the expression of propionicin plg-1 gene (plg-1) by lactic starters.
propionicin plg-1 is a bacteriocin produced by propionibacterium thoenii p127. such bacteriocin inhibits wide range of food-borne pathogens such as pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio parahaemolyticus, yersinia enterocolitica and a strain of corynebacterium sp. in the present study, plg-1 gene expressing propionicin plg-1 was isolated, sequenced for the first time and the resulting sequence was analysed using several web-based bioinformatics programs. the pcr product containing plg-1 gene was transferred to different lactic acid bacterial (lab) strains using pleb590 as a cloning vector to give the modified vector plebplg-1. lab transformants showed an antimicrobial activity against esch. coli dh5alpha (most affected strain), listeria monocytogenes 18116, and salmonella enterica 25566 as model pathogenic strains. such lab transformants can be used in dairy industry to control the food-borne pathogens that are largely distributed worldwide and to feed schoolchildren in the poor countries where dangerous epidemic diseases and diarrhoea prevail.
chemical assessment and antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of endophytic fungi extracts isolated from costus spiralis (jacq.) roscoe (costaceae).
costus spiralis (costaceae) is a species native to the amazon region and is used  in traditional medicine. the endophytic fungi used in this study were obtained from leaves of this plant. 13 strains were selected to obtain hydroethanolic extracts and were submitted to hydroalcoholic extraction and evaluated for antioxidant activity by dpph (2,2-difenil-1-picrilhidrazil) and frap (ferric reducing antioxidant power), and all of the fungi had positive results. the antimicrobial action of crude extracts had a good range of activities. all extracts had inhibitory activities against the yeasts of candida albicans and c. parapsilosis, with 125 to 500 mug/ml mic. eight extracts had antimicrobial activities against bacillus subtilis (mic from 62.4 to 125 mug/ml), 5 against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic from 125 to 500 mug/ml), 2 against salmonella enterica (mic from 125 to 62.5 mug/ml), and 2 against enterococcus faecalis (mic from 500 to 125 mug/ml). the presence of secondary metabolites, including coumarins, was observed during chemical evaluation by thin layer chromatography. total phenol content was estimated, and a strong positive correlation to antioxidant activity was observed, according to its pearson coefficient. this is the first report of the bioactive potential of endophytic fungi isolated from the costaceae family in brazilian ecosystems.
green conversion of agroindustrial wastes into chitin and chitosan by rhizopus arrhizus and cunninghamella elegans strains.
this article sets out a method for producing chitin and chitosan by cunninghamella elegans and rhizopus arrhizus strains using a green metabolic conversion of agroindustrial wastes (corn steep liquor and molasses). the physicochemical characteristics of the biopolymers and antimicrobial activity are described. chitin and chitosan were extracted by alkali-acid treatment, and characterized by infrared spectroscopy, viscosity and x-ray diffraction. the effectiveness of chitosan from c. elegans and r. arrhizus in inhibiting the growth of listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica were evaluated by determining the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc). the highest production of biomass (24.60 g/l), chitin (83.20 mg/g) and chitosan (49.31 mg/g) was obtained by r. arrhizus. chitin and chitosan from both fungi showed a similar degree of deacetylation, respectively of 25% and 82%, crystallinity indices of 33.80% and 32.80% for chitin, and 20.30% and 17.80% for chitosan. both chitin and chitosan presented similar viscosimetry of 3.79-3.40 cp and low molecular weight of 5.08x10(3) and 4.68x10(3) g/mol. they both showed identical mic and mbc for all bacteria assayed. these results suggest that: agricultural wastes can be produced in an environmentally friendly way; chitin and chitosan can be produced economically; and that chitosan has antimicrobial potential against pathogenic bacteria.
antimicrobial function of shbetaap, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
a 2.3 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the skipjack hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide (shbetaap). shbetaap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 6.5-57.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli d31, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, and two vibrio parahaemolyticus species (mecs, 2.0-19.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec; 12.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and ph resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. shbetaap did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. this is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.
cell-free supernatants obtained from fermentation of cheese whey hydrolyzates and phenylpyruvic acid by lactobacillus plantarum as a source of antimicrobial compounds, bacteriocins, and natural aromas.
cheese whey hydrolyzates supplemented with phenylpyruvic acid (ppa) and commercial nutrients can be efficiently metabolized by lactobacillus plantarum cect-221 to biosynthesize some compounds with attractive applications in the food market. the main metabolites of cell-free extracts were antimicrobial compounds such as phenyllactic acid (pla) and lactic acid (la). the production of pla by l. plantarum cect-221 was evaluated in the man-rogosa-sharpe broth supplemented with two biosynthetic precursors: phenylalanine or ppa. using 30.5 mm ppa, the microorganism increased sevenfold the concentration of pla producing 16.4 mm pla in 46 h. a concentration of 40 mm ppa was a threshold to avoid substrate inhibition. the biosynthesis of whey hydrolyzates as a carbon source was enhanced by fed-batch fermentation of ppa; the average productivity of pla increased up to 45.4 +/- 3.02 mm after 120 h with a product yield of 0.244 mm mm(-1); meanwhile, la reached 26.1 +/- 1.3 g l(-1) with a product yield of 0.72 g g(-1). cell-free fed-batch extracts charged in wells showed bacteriocin activity with halos of 7.49 +/- 1.44 mm in plates inoculated with carnobacterium piscicola and antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus (11.54 +/- 1.14 mm), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.17 +/- 2.46 mm), listeria monocytogenes (7.75 +/- 1.31 mm), and salmonella enterica (3.60 +/- 1.52 mm). additionally, the analysis of the volatile composition of the headspace of this cell-free extract revealed that l. plantarum is a potential producer for natural aromas, such as acetophenone, with high price in the market. this is the first report of pla production from cheese whey and ppa. the extracts showed bacteriocin activity and potential to be applied as an antimicrobial in the elaboration of safer foods.
species-dependent blood-brain barrier disruption of lipopolysaccharide: amelioration by colistin in vitro and in vivo.
the aim of this study was to use in vitro and in vivo models to assess the impact of lipopolysaccharide (lps) from two different bacterial species on blood-brain barrier (bbb) integrity and brain uptake of colistin. following repeated administration of lps from pseudomonas aeruginosa, the brain-to-plasma ratio of 14c-sucrose in swiss outbred mice was not significantly increased. furthermore, while the brain uptake of colistin in mice increased 3-fold following administration of lps from salmonella enterica, lps from p. aeruginosa had no significant effect on colistin brain uptake. this apparent species-dependent effect did not appear to correlate with differences in plasma cytokine levels as the concentrations of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-6 following administration of each lps was not different (p > 0.05). to clarify whether this species-specific effect of lps was due to direct effects on the bbb, human brain capillary endothelial cells (hcmec/d3) were treated with lps from p. aeruginosa or s. enterica and claudin-5 expression was measured by western blotting. s. enterica lps significantly (p < 0.05) reduced claudin-5 expression at a concentration of 7.5 mug/ml. in contrast, p. aeruginosa lps only decreased (p < 0.05) claudin-5 expression at the highest concentration tested (i.e. 30 mug/ml). co-administration of therapeutic concentrations of colistin ameliorated the s. enterica lps-induced reduction in claudin-5 expression in hcmec/d3 cells and the perturbation in bbb function in mice. this study demonstrates that bbb disruption induced by lps is species-dependent, at least between p. aeruginosa and s. enterica, and can be ameliorated by colistin.
extracellular dna-induced antimicrobial peptide resistance in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
background: the salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phopq two component system (tcs) is activated by low mg2+ levels, low ph and by antimicrobial peptides (ap). under mg2+ limitation, the phopq system induces pmrd expression, which post-translationally activates the pmrab tcs. phopq and pmrab control many genes required for intracellular survival and pathogenesis. these include the polymyxin resistance (pmr) operon, which is required for aminoarabinose modification of lps and protecting the outer membrane from antimicrobial peptide disruption and killing. extracellular dna is a ubiquitous polymer in the matrix of biofilms and accumulates in some infection sites. extracellular dna chelates cations and thus activates the pseudomonas aeruginosa phopq/pmrab systems, leading to expression of the orthologous arn (pmr) operon. results: here we show that extracellular dna induces expression of the s. typhimurium pmr antimicrobial peptide resistance operon in a phopq and pmrab-dependent manner. induction of the pmr genes by dna was blocked when present with excess mg2+. exogenous dna led to increased resistance of planktonic cultures to aminoglycosides, antimicrobial peptides (ap) and ciprofloxacin, but only ap resistance was phopq/pmrab-dependent. extracellular dna was shown to be a matrix component of s. typhimurium biofilms cultivated in flow chambers and on glass surfaces. a pmrh-gfp fusion was highly expressed in flow chamber biofilms cultivated in medium with repressing levels of 10 mm mg2+ and co-localized with edna. expression of pmrh-lux was monitored in plastic peg biofilms and shown to require phopq and pmrab. biofilms had higher levels of pmrh expression compared to planktonic cultures. we propose that dna accumulation in biofilms contributes to the increased pmrh-lux expression in biofilms. conclusions: the salmonella phopq/pmrab systems and antimicrobial peptide resistance are activated by the cation chelating properties of extracellular dna. dna-induced ap resistance may allow immune evasion and increased survival of s. typhimurium biofilms formed during extracellular growth stages of an infection or outside the host.
recombinant heat shock protein 60 (hsp60/groel) of salmonella enterica serovar typhi elicits cross-protection against multiple bacterial pathogens in mice.
heat shock proteins (hsps) or stress proteins are recognized as protective antigens against a wide range of bacterial diseases. conservation of hsps across different life forms also appears to contribute to the antigenicity of these proteins. due to their high sequence homology, there exists an immunological cross-recognition between different bacterial species. in the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of recombinant groel of salmonella enterica serovar typhi as a vaccine candidate against various bacterial pathogens viz.; shigella dysenteriae type i, shigella flexneri, shigella boydii, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in vitro serum bactericidal assay (sba) with groel antisera showed 50-55% inhibition of cells of shigella spp., 65-75% of e. coli, 60-65% of k. pneumoniae, 45-50% of p. aeruginosa. in in vivo experiments, mice immunized with groel protein of s. typhi showed 60-65% protection against s. flexneri, s. dysenteriae type i, s. boydii. similarly 75-80% protection was observed against enteropathogenic e. coli, 70-80% against k. pneumoniae. 50% of mice survived the lethal infection against p. aeruginosa. organ burden and histopathological studies also revealed significant reduction of bacterial infection. this study shows the cross-protective efficacy of recombinant groel of s. typhi which could lead to the development of a single vaccine candidate protective against multiple bacterial pathogens.
characterization of five novel endolysins from gram-negative infecting bacteriophages.
we here characterize five globular endolysins, encoded by a set of gram-negative  infecting bacteriophages: bcepc6gp22 (burkholderia cepacia phage bcepc6b), p2gp09 (escherichia coli phage p2), psp3gp10 (salmonella enterica phage psp3), k11gp3.5 and kp32gp15 (klebsiella pneumoniae phages k11 and kp32, respectively). in silico, bcepc6gp22, p2gp10 and psp3gp10 are predicted to possess lytic transglycosylase activity, whereas k11gp3.5 and kp32gp15 have putative amidase activity. all five endolysins show muralytic activity on the peptidoglycan of several gram-negative bacterial species. in vitro, pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 is clearly sensitive for the antibacterial action of the five endolysins in the presence of the outer membrane permeabilizer edta: reductions are ranging from 1.89 to 3.08 log units dependent on the endolysin. the predicted transglycosylases bcepc6gp22, p2gp10 and psp3gp10 have a substantially higher muralytic and in vitro antibacterial activity compared to the predicted amidases k11gp3.5 and kp32gp15, highlighting the impact of the catalytic specificity on endolysin activity. furthermore, initial data exclude the synergistic lethal effect of a combination of the predicted transglycosylase psp3gp10 and the predicted amidase k11gp3.5 on pao1. as these globular endolysins show a lower enzymatic and antibacterial activity, in comparison to modular endolysins, we suggest that the latter should be favored for antibacterial applications.
wfdc2 is differentially expressed in the mammary gland of the tammar wallaby and  provides immune protection to the mammary gland and the developing pouch young.
wap four disulfide core domain 2 (wfdc2) is a four disulfide core (4-dsc) protein secreted in the milk of the tammar wallaby. it is comprised of two 4-dsc domains assigned domain iii at the nh2-terminal end and domain ii at the cooh-terminal end. the wfdc2 gene was expressed only during pregnancy, early lactation, towards the end of lactation and involution. the wfdc2 protein showed antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica and pseudomonas aeruginosa and this activity resided with domain ii. there was no antibacterial activity detected against enterococcus faecalis. the observed expression pattern of tammar wfdc2 and its antibacterial activity suggests a role to either reduce mastitis in the mammary gland caused by s. aureus or to protect the gut of the young at a time when it is not immune-competent. the latter effect could be achieved without disturbing the balance of commensal gut flora such as e. faecalis.
inhibition of growth of highly resistant bacterial and fungal pathogens by a natural product.
the continuous escalation of resistant bacteria against a wide range of antibiotics necessitates discovering novel unconventional sources of antibiotics. b. oleracea l (red cabbage) is health-promoting food with proven anticancer and anti-inflammatory activities. however, it has not been researched adequately for its antimicrobial activity on potential resistant pathogens. the methanol crude extract of b. oleracea l. was investigated for a possible anti-microbial activity. the screening method was conducted using disc diffusion assay against 22 pathogenic bacteria and fungi. it was followed by evaluation of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). moreover, the antibacterial and the antifungal activities were confirmed using the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) and the minimum fungicidal concentration (mfc), respectively. remarkable, antibacterial activity was evident particularly against highly infectious microorganisms such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium as well as against human fungal pathogens, trichophyton rubrum and aspergillus terreus. red cabbage is a rich source of phenolic compounds, anthocyanins being the most abundant class, which might explain its potent antimicrobial action. this extract is potentially novel for future antimicrobials, inexpensive, and readily available at a large scale for pharmaceutical companies for further investigation and processing.
evaluation of abelmoschus moschatus extracts for antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities using in vitro assays.
background: abelmoschus moschatus medik. leaves and seeds are considered as valuable traditional medicine. the aromatic seeds of this plant are aphrodisiac, ophthalmic, cardio tonic, antispasmodic and used in the treatment of intestinal complaints and check queasiness. to give a scientific basis for traditional usage of this medicinal plant, the seed and leaf extracts were evaluated for their antioxidant, free radical scavenging, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities. methods: in this study, antioxidant, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activities of a. moschatus extracts were evaluated in a series of in vitro assay involving free radicals, reactive oxygen species and their ic50 values were also determined. the antioxidant activities of the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus were determined by total antioxidant, dpph, and ferrous reducing antioxidant property (frap) methods. in addition, the antiproliferative activity was also evaluated using colorectal adenocarcinoma and retinoblastoma human cancer cell lines. moreover, six bacterial reference strains, two gram-positive (bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus), four gram-negative (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and salmonella enterica paratyphi) and one fungal strain (candida albicans) were used to evaluate its antimicrobial activity. results: the results from this study showed that the antioxidant activities of a. moschatus as determined by the total phenol, flavonoids, total antioxidant and frap methods were higher in leaf than that of the seed extracts. on the other hand, the aqueous overnight seed extract (ams-i) has shown significant radical scavenging activity as in 1, 1- diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (dpph), hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radical, superoxide and lipid peroxidation as compared to other seed and leaf extracts. the ams-i and aml-iv have shown activity against six and seven microorganisms respectively. simulteneously, ams-iv and aml-iv have demonstrated potential antiproliferative activity against two human cell lines - colorectal adenocarcinoma (colo-205) and retinoblastoma (y79). conclusion: the seed and leaf extracts of a. moschatus possess significant antioxidant activity and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavenger, or substitute, probably as primary antioxidants. the plant possesses moderate antibacterial activity against bacterial strains used in this study. hydroalcoholic seed and leaf extracts also exhibited antiproliferative activity against two human cancer cell lines. a. moschatus may therefore, be a good candidate for functional foods as well as pharmaceutics.
synthesis, characterization and biological properties of thienyl derived triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes.
a new series of biologically active thienyl derived triazole schiff bases and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been synthesized and characterized on the basis of physical (m.p., magnetic susceptibility and conductivity), spectral (ir, (1)h and (1)(3)c nmr, electronic and mass spectrometry) and microanalytical data. all the schiff base ligands and their oxovanadium(iv) complexes have been subjected to in vitro antibacterial activity against four gram-negative (escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serover typhi) and two gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis) bacterial strains and, for in vitro antifungal activity against trichophyton longifucus, candida albican, aspergillus flavus, microscopum canis, fusarium solani and candida glabrata. brine shrimp bioassay was also carried out to check the cytotoxic nature of these compounds.
lactobacillus fermentum isolated from human colonic mucosal biopsy inhibits the growth and adhesion of enteric and foodborne pathogens.
a number of lactobacillus species are used as probiotic strains in order to benefit health. we have isolated l. fermentum from human colonic mucosal biopsy samples that possess antimicrobial activities against entroinvasive and foodborne pathogens such as escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio sp. in addition to lactic acid, l. fermentum secretes antimicrobial proteinacious compound(s) that was found to be active even at neutral ph (ph 7.0). the compound was sensitive to heat treatment and trypsin digestion. lactobacillus fermentum inhibited the adhesion of enteropathogens to intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. isolated cell surface associated proteins (saps) from l. fermentum were sufficient for the adhesion exclusions of enteropathogenic e. coli. our results indicate that l. fermentum produces antimicrobial compounds and saps to inhibit the growth and adhesion of enteropathogens, respectively.
antibacterial activity in spices and local medicinal plants against clinical isolates of karachi, pakistan.
context: development of resistance in human pathogens against conventional antibiotic necessitates searching indigenous medicinal plants having antibacterial property. twenty-seven medicinal plants used actively in folklore, ayurvedic and traditional system of medicine were selected for the evaluation of their antimicrobial activity for this study. eleven plants chosen from these 27 are used as spices in local cuisine. objective: evaluation of the effectiveness of some medicinal plant extracts against clinical isolates. material and methods: nonedible plant parts were extracted with methanol and evaporated in vacuo to obtain residue. powdered edible parts were boiled three times and cooled in sterile distilled water for 2 min each and filtrate collected. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of plant extracts and filtrates/antibiotics was evaluated against clinical isolates by microbroth dilution method. results: water extract of syzygium aromaticum l. (myrtaceae) buds, methanol extracts of ficus carica l. (moraceae) and olea europaea l. (oleaceae) leaves and peganum harmala l. (nitrariaceae) seeds had mic ranges of 31.25-250 microg/ml. s. aromaticum inhibited growth of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, salmonella enterica serovar typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. f. carica and o. europaea inhibited growth of s. aureus, s. epidermidis, and s. pyogenes whereas p. harmala was effective against s. aureus, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and candida albicans. ampicillin, velosef, sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline and ceftazidime, cefotaxime, cefepime, which are used as control, had mic >/= 50 and 1.5 microg/ml, respectively, for organisms sensitive to extracts. discussion and conclusion: mono/multiextract from identified plants will provide an array of safe antimicrobial agents to control infections by drug-resistant bacteria.
the activity of bacteriocins from carnobacterium maltaromaticum ual307 against gram-negative bacteria in combination with edta treatment.
bacteriocins from gram-positive bacteria are potent antimicrobial peptides that inhibit pathogenic and food-spoilage bacteria. they are usually ineffective against gram-negative bacteria because they cannot penetrate the outer membrane (om). disruption of the om of some gram-negative bacteria was reported to sensitize them to certain bacteriocins. this study evaluates the activity of three purified bacteriocins [carnocyclin a (ccla), carnobacteriocin bm1 (cbnbm1) and piscicolin 126 (pisa)] produced by carnobacterium maltaromaticum ual307, which has been approved for preservation of food in united states and canada, against three gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli dh5alpha, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 14207 and salmonella typhimurium atcc 23564). their efficacy is compared with bacteriocins of other classes: the lantibiotics nisin a (positive control) and gallidermin, and the cyclic peptide subtilosin a (suba). in combination with edta, ccla inhibited both e. coli and pseudomonas. pisa inhibited pseudomonas, but cbnbm1 showed weak activity toward pseudomonas. in comparison, nisin and gallidermin inhibited the growth of all three strains, whereas suba was active against e. coli and pseudomonas only at high concentrations. the results reveal that ual307 bacteriocins can inhibit gram-negative bacteria if the om is weakened, and that the different classes of bacteriocins in this study exert unique modes of action toward such bacteria.
sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.
susceptibility of complete bacteria and spheroplasts of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi to rolliniastatin-2.
rolliniastatin-2 is an acetogenin with elevated cytotoxic activity whose effect on bacteria has not yet been analysed and was isolated by cc from the hexanic extract of annona diversifolia saff (annonaceae) seeds. in this study, we evaluated the susceptibility of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi as well as spheroplasts of these bacteria to the compound, determining percent inhibition by turbidimetry. the complete bacteria were susceptible to rolliniastatin-2 (28-40% at 2 mg ml(-1)), while spheroplasts showed an increased susceptibility (55-58%, at 1 ng ml(-1)). the most susceptible bacterium was p. aeruginosa, while the spheroplasts of e. coli and s. typhi were most sensitive to the compound's effects.
the cyclotide cycloviolacin o2 from viola odorata has potent bactericidal activity against gram-negative bacteria.
objectives: to determine the antibacterial activity of small cyclic plant proteins, i.e. cyclotides, and the importance of the surface exposed charged residues for activity. methods: prototypic cyclotides, including the mobius kalata b1 and the bracelet cycloviolacin o2 (cyo2), were isolated using reversed-phase hplc. initial activity screenings were conducted using radial diffusion assays (rdas) and mic assays with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus as test strains. for the most active peptide, cyo2, time-kill kinetics was determined in sodium phosphate buffer (containing 0.03% trypticase soy broth) against several gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species. charged residues in cyo2 were chemically modified and activity was determined in time-kill assays. results: cyo2 was the most active cyclotide and efficiently inhibited the growth of s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 and e. coli in rdas and mic assays, while the other peptides were less active. in time-kill assays, cyo2 also had bactericidal activity against the gram-negative species klebsiella pneumoniae and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in contrast, none of the cyclotides had high activity against s. aureus. chemical masking of the charged glu and lys residues in cyo2 caused a near total loss of activity against salmonella, while masking arg caused a less pronounced activity reduction. conclusions: cyo2 is a cyclotide with potent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the charged residues in cyo2 are all required for optimum antibacterial activity. in combination with its previously demonstrated cytotoxic activity against cancer cells and the general stability of cyclotides, cyo2 provides a promising scaffold for future drug design.
antimicrobial properties of prunin, a citric flavanone glucoside, and its prunin  6''-o-lauroyl ester.
aims: to determine the antimicrobial potential of prunin (p), a flavanone glucoside resulting from the hydrolysis of naringin present in grapefruit, and of its prunin 6''-o-lauroyl ester (pl), synthesized by enzymatic catalysis. methods and results: p and its lauroyl ester were tested against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, yeasts and moulds. p showed no inhibitory effect against the micro-organisms assayed, but stimulated growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa and different bacilllus sp. however, 150 mug ml(-1) of pl inhibited escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, many bacillus sp., staphylococcus aureus atcc29213, enterococcus avium dsmz17511, and different listeria monocytogenes strains. in the last case, l. monocytogenes, sensitive or bacteriocin-resistant cells, lost nearly 4-log reductions after 30 min of contact. a bactericidal mode of action was determined using both scanning and transmission electronic microscopies. conclusions: pl could be used as a food additive, because at low concentration (150 mug ml(-1)) it exhibited antimicrobial activity against important food-borne pathogens. a bactericidal effect was also determined on l. monocytogenes sensitive and bacteriocin-resistant mutant strains. p did not show any antimicrobial property at all. significance and impact of the study: pl is a potential antimicrobial compound with a high anti-listeria property.
synthesis and antimicrobial activity of n,n'-bis(2-hydroxylbenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine derivatives.
a series of n,n'-bis(2-hydroxylbenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine derivatives and its schiff bases were synthesized, characterized and screened for in vitro antimicrobial activity against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica. result indicated that the ethylenediamine derivatives, n,n'-bis(2-hydroxy-5-bromobenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (21), and n,n'-bis(2-hydroxy-5-chlorobenzyl)-1,2-ethanediamine (22) showed the most favorable antimicrobial activity exhibiting lc(50) of 11.6 and 8.79 mum against s.enterica, 86 and 138 mum against p. aeruginosa, and 140 and 287 mum against s. aureus, respectively. these compounds displayed highest level of resistance with s. aureus. thus, the high level of activity seen with the compounds (21, 22) suggests that these compounds could serve as the leads for development of novel synthetic compounds with enhanced antimicrobial activity.
antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy using a highly pure chlorin e6.
the aim of the present study is to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of photodynamic therapy (pdt) using a highly pure chlorin e(6) (ce(6)), against various pathogenic bacteria. to examine the antimicrobial effect of ce(6)-mediated pdt against staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, inhibition zone formation, cfu quantification, and bacterial viability were evaluated. inhibition zone analysis showed that ce(6)-mediated pdt is very effective to inhibit the growth of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, but has only minor effect to e. coli and s. typhimurium, which was dependent on the energy density of laser and dose of ce(6). ce(6)-mediated pdt also nearly inhibited the colony formation of s. aureus and p. aeruginosa, and partially inhibited that of e. coli and s. typhimurium. in addition, the number of viable bacteria decreased greatly after pdt application with ls-chlorin e6 of 10 microm and laser and energy density of 20 j/cm(2). these results show that ce(6)-mediated pdt can be an effective alternative for antimicrobial treatment.
the role of potassium in inflammasome activation by bacteria.
many gram-negative bacteria possess a type iii secretion system (ttss( paragraph  sign)) that can activate the nlrc4 inflammasome, process caspase-1 and lead to secretion of mature il-1beta. this is dependent on the presence of intracellular flagellin. previous reports have suggested that this activation is independent of extracellular k(+) and not accompanied by leakage of k(+) from the cell, in contrast to activation of the nlrp3 inflammasome. however, non-flagellated strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to activate nlrc4, suggesting that formation of a pore in the cell membrane by the ttss apparatus may be sufficient for inflammasome activation. thus, we set out to determine if extracellular k(+) influenced p. aeruginosa inflammasome activation. we found that raising extracellular k(+) prevented ttss nlrc4 activation by the non-flagellated p. aeruginosa strain pa103deltaudeltat at concentrations above 90 mm, higher than those reported to inhibit nlrp3 activation. infection was accompanied by efflux of k(+) from a minority of cells as determined using the k(+)-sensitive fluorophore pbfi, but no formation of a leaky pore. we obtained exactly the same results following infection with salmonella typhimurium, previously described as independent of extracellular k(+). the inhibitory effect of raised extracellular k(+) on nlrc4 activation thus reflects a requirement for a decrease in intracellular k(+) for this inflammasome component as well as that described for nlrp3.
quinine is bactericidal.
objective: to determine the antibacterial properties of quinine dihydrochloride and its mic. material and methods: a quasi-experimental study was conducted at the jinnah postgraduate medical centre, karachi from july 2006 to november 2006. two hundred samples of pus, blood, sputum and ascitic fluid, from hospitalized adult patients from medicine ward (w-7) having different bacterial infections were studied. proforma was filled to document the demographic details. samples were collected from different sites, isolated, identified and checked for antimicrobial susceptibility of quinine dihydrochloride by standard methods. results: staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhi were inhibited at mic of 125 g/ml. streptococcus pyogenes was inhibited at mic of 31.25 g/ml of quinine dihydrochloride (dilution ranges from 31.25 g/ml to 1000 g/ml). conclusion: the concomitant antimalarial and antibacterial action of quinine dihydrochloride may be beneficial in developing countries adding to cost effectiveness of treatment provided to patients belonging to low socioeconomic group.
discovery of novel 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives as anti-gram-positive antibacterial agents.
a number of 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone derivatives were synthesized and examined for growth inhibition of several kinds of bacteria. 2',3',4'-trihydroxy-2-phenylacetophenone itself exhibited no antibacterial activity, but some of its derivatives showed various antibacterial activities depending on functional groups introduced on the 2-phenyl ring. eighteen out of 24 compounds synthesized in this study appeared to possess antibacterial activities against at least two gram-positive strains of bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, 2-(biphenyl-4-yl)-2',3',4'-trihydroxyacetophenone being the most active with lc(50) of 5.8 mum and 5.6 mum respectively. however, none of the synthesized compounds exhibited inhibitory effects on gram-negative strains, such as escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica, suggesting that anti-gram-positive specificity of the antibacterial compounds.
the phoq histidine kinases of salmonella and pseudomonas spp. are structurally and functionally different: evidence that ph and antimicrobial peptide sensing contribute to mammalian pathogenesis.
the phoq sensor kinase is essential for salmonella typhimurium virulence for animals, and a homologue exists in the environmental organism and opportunistic pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. s. typhimurium phoq (st-phoq) is repressed by millimolar concentrations of divalent cations and activated by antimicrobial peptides and at acidic ph. st-phoq has a periplasmic per-arnt-sim domain, a fold commonly employed for ligand binding. however, substrate binding is instead accomplished by an acidic patch in the periplasmic domain that interacts with the inner membrane through divalent cation bridges. the dna sequence encoding this acidic patch is absent from pseudomonas phoq (pa-phoq). here, we demonstrate that pa-phoq binds and is repressed by divalent cations, and can functionally complement a s. typhimurium phoq-null mutant. mutational analysis and nmr spectroscopy of the periplasmic domains of st-phoq and pa-phoq indicate distinct mechanisms of binding divalent cation. the data are consistent with pa-phoq binding metal in a specific ligand-binding pocket. pa-phoq was partially activated by acidic ph but not by antimicrobial peptides. s. typhimurium expressing pa-phoq protein were attenuated for virulence in a mouse model, suggesting that the ability of salmonella to sense host environments via antimicrobial peptides and acidic ph is an important contribution to pathogenesis.
copper and quaternary ammonium cations exert synergistic bactericidal and antibiofilm activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa.
biofilms are slimy aggregates of microbes that are likely responsible for many chronic infections as well as for contamination of clinical and industrial environments. pseudomonas aeruginosa is a prevalent hospital pathogen that is well known for its ability to form biofilms that are recalcitrant to many different antimicrobial treatments. we have devised a high-throughput method for testing combinations of antimicrobials for synergistic activity against biofilms, including those formed by p. aeruginosa. this approach was used to look for changes in biofilm susceptibility to various biocides when these agents were combined with metal ions. this process identified that cu(2+) works synergistically with quaternary ammonium compounds (qacs; specifically benzalkonium chloride, cetalkonium chloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, myristalkonium chloride, and polycide) to kill p. aeruginosa biofilms. in some cases, adding cu(2+) to qacs resulted in a 128-fold decrease in the biofilm minimum bactericidal concentration compared to that for single-agent treatments. in combination, these agents retained broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity that also eradicated biofilms of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica serovar cholerasuis, and pseudomonas fluorescens. to investigate the mechanism of action, isothermal titration calorimetry was used to show that cu(2+) and qacs do not interact in aqueous solutions, suggesting that each agent exerts microbiological toxicity through independent biochemical routes. additionally, cu(2+) and qacs, both alone and in combination, reduced the activity of nitrate reductases, which are enzymes that are important for normal biofilm growth. collectively, the results of this study indicate that cu(2+) and qacs are effective combinations of antimicrobials that may be used to kill bacterial biofilms.
isolation and purification of enterocin e-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
broad-spectrum in vitro antibacterial activities of clay minerals against antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens.
objectives: the capacity to properly address the worldwide incidence of infectious diseases lies in the ability to detect, prevent and effectively treat these infections. therefore, identifying and analysing inhibitory agents are worthwhile endeavours in an era when few new classes of effective antimicrobials have been developed. the use of geological nanomaterials to heal skin infections has been evident since the earliest recorded history, and specific clay minerals may prove valuable in the treatment of bacterial diseases, including infections for which there are no effective antibiotics, such as buruli ulcer and multidrug-resistant infections. methods: we have subjected two iron-rich clay minerals, which have previously been used to treat buruli ulcer patients, to broth culture testing of antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria to assess the feasibility of using clay minerals as therapeutic agents. results: one specific mineral, csag02, demonstrated bactericidal activity against pathogenic escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and mycobacterium marinum, and a combined bacteriostatic/bactericidal effect against staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant s. aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and mycobacterium smegmatis, whereas another mineral with similar structure and bulk crystal chemistry, csar02, had no effect on or enhanced bacterial growth. the <0.2 microm fraction of csag02 and csag02 heated to 200 or 550 degrees c retained bactericidal activity, whereas cation-exchanged csag02 and csag02 heated to 900 degrees c no longer killed e. coli. conclusions: our results indicate that specific mineral products have intrinsic, heat-stable antibacterial properties, which could provide an inexpensive treatment against numerous human bacterial infections.
polyamine effects on antibiotic susceptibility in bacteria.
biogenic polyamines (e.g., spermidine and spermine) are a group of essential polycationic compounds found in all living cells. the effects of spermine and spermidine on antibiotic susceptibility were examined with gram-negative escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium bacteria and clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and with gram-positive staphylococcus aureus bacteria, including methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). exogenous spermine exerted a dose-dependent inhibition effect on the growth of e. coli, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and s. aureus but not p. aeruginosa, as depicted by mic and growth curve measurements. while the mics of polymyxin and ciprofloxacin were in general increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine in p. aeruginosa, this adverse effect was not observed in enteric bacteria and s. aureus. it was found that spermine and spermidine can decrease the mics of beta-lactam antibiotics in all strains as well as other types of antibiotics in a strain-dependent manner. significantly, the mics of oxacillin for mrsa mu50 and n315 were decreased more than 200-fold in the presence of spermine, and this effect of spermine was retained when assessed in the presence of divalent ions (magnesium or calcium; 3 mm) or sodium chloride (150 mm). the effect of spermine on the sensitization of p. aeruginosa and mrsa to antibiotics was further demonstrated by population analysis and time-killing assays. the results of checkerboard assays with e. coli and s. aureus indicated a strong synergistic effect of spermine in combination with beta-lactams and chloramphenicol. the decreased mics of beta-lactams implied that the possible blockage of outer membrane porins by exogenous spermine or spermidine did not play a crucial role in most cases. in contrast, only the mic of imipenem against p. aeruginosa was increased by exogenous spermine and spermidine, and this resistance effect was abolished in a mutant strain devoid of the outer membrane porin oprd. in e. coli, the mics of carbenicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline were decreased in two acra mutants devoid of a major efflux pump, acrab. however, retention of the spermine effect on antibiotic susceptibility in two acra mutants of e. coli suggested that the acrab efflux pump was not the target for a synergistic effect by spermine and antibiotics and ruled out the hypothesis of spermine serving as an efflux pump inhibitor in this organism. in summary, this interesting finding of the effect of spermine on antibiotic susceptibility provides the basis for a new potential approach against drug-resistant pathogens by use of existing beta-lactam antibiotics.
antibacterial activities of emblica officinalis and coriandrum sativum against gram negative urinary pathogens.
present investigation is focused on antibacterial potential of aqueous infusions  and aqueous decoctions of emblica officinalis (amla) and coriandrum sativum (coriander) against 345 bacterial isolates belonging to 6 different genera of gram negative bacterial population isolated from urine specimens by employing well diffusion technique. aqueous infusion and decoction of emblica officinalis exhibited potent antibacterial activity against escherichia coli (270), klebsiella pneumoniae (51), k. ozaenae (3), proteus mirabilis (5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10), salmonella typhi (1), s. paratyphi a (2), s. paratyphi b (1) and serratia marcescens (2) but did not show any antibacterial activity against gram negative urinary pathogens.
bafoudiosbulbins a, and b, two anti-salmonellal clerodane diterpenoids from dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa.
two clerodane diterpenoids, bafoudiosbulbins a 1, and b 2, together with five known compounds: tetracosanoic acid, 1-(tetracosanoyl)-glycerol, trans-tetracosanylferulate, beta-sitosterol and 3-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl-beta-sitosterol were isolated from the tubers of dioscorea bulbifera l. var sativa. their structures were established by spectroscopic methods (1d and 2d-nmr, ms) and x-ray crystallographic diffraction analysis of compound 1. the ch2cl2-soluble portion of the crude extract and the two clerodanes were screened for anti-bacterial activity using both agar diffusion and broth dilution techniques against pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi, salmonella paratyphi a and salmonella paratyphi b. they both showed significant activities against p. aeruginosa, s. typhi, s. paratyphi a and s. paratyphi b.
pseudomonas aeruginosa protease iv degrades surfactant proteins and inhibits surfactant host defense and biophysical functions.
pulmonary surfactant has two distinct functions within the lung: reduction of surface tension at the air-liquid interface and participation in innate host defense. both functions are dependent on surfactant-associated proteins. pseudomonas aeruginosa is primarily responsible for respiratory dysfunction and death in cystic fibrosis patients and is also a leading pathogen in nosocomial pneumonia. p. aeruginosa secretes a number of proteases that contribute to its virulence. we hypothesized that p. aeruginosa protease iv degrades surfactant proteins and results in a reduction in pulmonary surfactant host defense and biophysical functions. protease iv was isolated from cultured supernatant of p. aeruginosa by gel chromatography. incubation of cell-free bronchoalveolar lavage fluid with protease iv resulted in degradation of surfactant proteins (sp)-a, -d, and -b. sps were degraded in a time- and dose-dependent fashion by protease iv, and degradation was inhibited by the trypsin-like serine protease inhibitor nalpha-p-tosyl-l-lysine-chloromethyl ketone (tlck). degradation by protease iv inhibited sp-a- and sp-d-mediated bacterial aggregation and uptake by macrophages. surfactant treated with protease iv was unable to reduce surface tension as effectively as untreated surfactant, and this effect was inhibited by tlck. we speculate that protease iv may be an important contributing factor to the development and propagation of acute lung injury associated with p. aeruginosa via loss of surfactant function within the lung.
antimicrobial activity of a low-molecular-weight chitosan obtained from cellulase digestion of chitosan.
a water-soluble chitosan hydrolysate with high activity against escherichia coli  was obtained during cellulase digestion of chitosan for 18 h. this 18-h hydrolysate is composed of low-molecular-weight chitosan (lmwc), with a molecular weight of 12.0 kda, and chitooligosaccharides, which are composed of sugars with a degree of polymerization of 1 to 8. lmwc has a strong activity at 100 ppm against many pathogens and yeast species, including bacillus cereus, e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, and saccharomyces cerevisiae, while the chitooligosaccharides have much weaker antimicrobial activity than does lmwc. accordingly, the antimicrobial activity against e. coli in the 18-h hydrolysate proved to come mainly from the presence of lmwc.
pmrab, a two-component regulatory system of pseudomonas aeruginosa that modulates resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides and addition of aminoarabinose to lipid a.
spontaneous polymyxin-resistant mutants of pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated.  the mutations responsible for this phenotype were mapped to a two-component signal transduction system similar to pmrab of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. lipid a of these mutants contained aminoarabinose, an inducible modification that is associated with polymyxin resistance. thus, p. aeruginosa possesses a mechanism that induces resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides in response to environmental conditions.
molecular and biochemical characterization of oxa-45, an extended-spectrum class  2d' beta-lactamase in pseudomonas aeruginosa.
as part of the cancer antimicrobial surveillance program in north america, a clinical strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain 07-406, isolated in texas was found to be resistant to all antimicrobials except polymyxin b. genetic analysis of this isolate identified two unique extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes. one, bla(vim-7), encoded a metallo-beta-lactamase (unpublished data), and the other, bla(oxa-45), described here, encoded a class d extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. bla(oxa-45) was isolated on a sau3a1 genomic fragment of 1.8 kb and encodes a protein of 264 amino acids with the highest identities to oxa-18 (65.9%), oxa-9 (42.8%), oxa-22 (40.2%), oxa-12 (38.6%), and oxa-29 (35.2%) but weak identities with other class d beta-lactamases. bla(oxa-45) was found to be harbored on a 24-kb plasmid in a region that displays high identities with a section of the 43-kb genomic island of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium dt104. biochemically oxa-45 is most similar to oxa-18 in its substrate profile and inhibition by clavulanic acid and is a member of the 2d' class of beta-lactamases.
sensitization of outer-membrane mutants of salmonella typhimurium and pseudomonas aeruginosa to antimicrobial peptides under high pressure.
high pressure can sensitize gram-negative bacteria to antimicrobial peptides or proteins through the permeabilization of their outer membranes; however, the range of compounds to which sensitivity is induced is species and strain dependent. we studied the role of outer-membrane properties in this sensitization by making use of a series of rough and deep rough mutants of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium that show an increased degree of lipopolysaccharide (lps) truncation, along with pseudomonas aeruginosa phop and phoq mutants with altered outer-membrane properties. the outer-membrane properties of p. aernginosa were also modulated through the use of different mg2- concentrations in the growth medium. each of these strains was challenged under high pressure (15 min at 270 mpa for salmonella typhimurium and 15 min at 100 mpa for p. aerttginosa) in phosphate buffer with lysozyme (100 microg/ml), nisin (100 iu/ml), lactoferricin (20 microg/ml), and hel96-116 (100 microg/ml), a synthetic lysozyme-derived peptide, and sensitization levels were compared. the results obtained indicated that outer-membrane properties affected high-pressure sensitization differently for different compounds. lps truncation in salmonella typhimurium was correlated with increased sensitization to lysozyme (up to 1.5 log10 units) and nisin (up to 1.2 log10 units) but with decreased sensitization to lactoferricin under pressure. for p. aeruginosa, the pattern of sensitization to lactoferricin and nisin resembled that of polymyxin b at atmospheric pressure, suggesting that pressure induces the self-promoted uptake of both peptides. sensitization to hel96-116 was not affected by outer-membrane properties for either organism. hence, outer-membrane permeabilization by high pressure cannot be explained by a single unifying mechanism and is dependent on the organism, the outer-membrane properties, and the nature of the antimicrobial compound. on the basis of these findings, the use of antimicrobial cocktails targeting different bacteria and fractions of bacterial populations may enhance the efficacy of high pressure as a preservation treatment.
antibacterial, antiprotozoal and antioxidant activity of five plants used in izabal for infectious diseases.
methanol and aqueous extracts from fi ve plant species, used in traditional medicine in guatemala for the treatment of microbial infections, were tested in vitro for their ability to scavenge dpph, oh(.) and o(2) (-) radicals and to inhibit lipoperoxidation (lpo) in order to establish a relationship between their antioxidant activities and their effects against infectious agents. acalypha guatemalensis, ocimum micranthum and smilax spinosa possessed a significant activity against both the three free radicals assayed and lpo; guazuma ulmifolia showed effects against dpph and oh(.). piper auritum showed no activity. these extracts were also evaluated for antibacterial and antiprotozoal activities. a. guatemalensis showed activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa; s. spinosa was active against salmonella typhi, and a. guatemalensis, and s. spinosa against trypanosoma cruzi or leishmania spp.
screening of some siberian medicinal plants for antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of crude ethanolic extracts of 16 siberian medicinal plants was tested against five species of microorganisms: bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and candida albicans. of the 16 plants tested, 12 showed antimicrobial activity against one or more species of microorganisms. the most active antimicrobial plants were bergenia crassifolia, chelidonium majus, rhaponticum carthamoides, sanguisorba officinalis, and tussilago farfara.
inorganic polyphosphate is essential for long-term survival and virulence factors in shigella and salmonella spp.
the importance of inorganic polyphosphate (poly p) and poly p kinase (ppk), the enzyme principally responsible for its synthesis, has been established previously for stationary-phase survival of escherichia coli and virulence in pseudomonas aeruginosa. the gene (ppk) that encodes ppk is highly conserved among many bacterial pathogens, including shigella and salmonella spp. in view of the phylogenetic similarity of the enteropathogens and the frequency with which virulence factors are expressed in stationary phase, the ppk gene of pathogenic shigella flexneri, salmonella enterica serovar dublin, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium have been cloned and deleted. in some of these mutants lacking ppk, the phenotypes included features indicative of decreased virulence such as: (i) growth defects, (ii) defective responses to stress and starvation, (iii) loss of viability, (iv) polymyxin sensitivity, (v) intolerance to acid and heat, and (vi) diminished invasiveness in epithelial cells. thus ppk may prove, as it has with p. aeruginosa, to be an attractive target for antibiotics, with low toxicity because ppk is not found in higher eukaryotes.
epithelial cell contact-induced alterations in salmonella enterica serovar typhi  lipopolysaccharide are critical for bacterial internalization.
the invasion of pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhi into epithelial cells depends on the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) protein as an epithelial receptor. in the case of p. aeruginosa, the bacterial ligand for cftr is the outer core oligosaccharide portion of the lipopolysaccharide (lps). to determine whether serovar typhi lps is also a bacterial ligand mediating internalization, we used both p. aeruginosa and serovar typhi lps as a competitive inhibitor of serovar typhi invasion into the epithelial cell line t84. p. aeruginosa lps containing a complete core efficiently inhibited serovar typhi invasion. however, neither killed wild-type typhi cells nor purified lps were effective inhibitors. lps from mutant typhi strains defective in o side-chain synthesis, but with an apparently normal core, was capable of inhibiting invasion, but lps obtained from a deeper rough mutant strain with alterations in fast-migrating core oligosaccharide failed to inhibit invasion. lastly, exposure of wild-type serovar typhi to t84 cultures before heat killing resulted in a structural alteration in its lps that allowed the heat-killed cells to inhibit invasion of wild-type serovar typhi. these data indicate that the serovar typhi lps core, like the p. aeruginosa lps core, is a ligand mediating internalization of bacteria by epithelial cells, and that exposure of this ligand on wild-type typhi is induced by the bacteria's interaction with host cells.
role of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator in innate immunity to pseudomonas aeruginosa infections.
chronic pseudomonas aeruginosa infection occurs in 75-90% of patients with cystic fibrosis (cf). it is the foremost factor in pulmonary function decline and early mortality. a connection has been made between mutant or missing cf transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) in lung epithelial cell membranes and a failure in innate immunity leading to initiation of p. aeruginosa infection. epithelial cells use cftr as a receptor for internalization of p. aeruginosa via endocytosis and subsequent removal of bacteria from the airway. in the absence of functional cftr, this interaction does not occur, allowing for increased bacterial loads in the lungs. binding occurs between the outer core of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide and amino acids 108-117 in the first predicted extracellular domain of cftr. in experimentally infected mice, inhibiting cftr-mediated endocytosis of p. aeruginosa by inclusion in the bacterial inoculum of either free bacterial lipopolysaccharide or cftr peptide 108-117 resulted in increased bacterial counts in the lungs. cftr is also a receptor on gastrointestinal epithelial cells for salmonella enterica serovar typhi, the etiologic agent of typhoid fever. there was a significant decrease in translocation of this organism to the gastrointestinal submucosa in transgenic mice that are heterozygous carriers of a mutant deltaf508 cftr allele, suggesting heterozygous cftr carriers may have increased resistance to typhoid fever. the identification of cftr as a receptor for bacterial pathogens could underlie the biology of cf lung disease and be the basis for the heterozygote advantage for carriers of mutant alleles of cftr.
impact of heterogeneity within cultured cells on bacterial invasion: analysis of  pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhi entry into mdck cells by using a green fluorescent protein-labelled cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator receptor.
the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (cftr) is a chloride ion  channel that also serves as a receptor for entry of pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhi into epithelial cells. to evaluate heterogeneity in cftr protein expression in cultured cells and the effect of heterogeneity on internalization of different p. aeruginosa and serovar typhi strains, we used two-color flow cytometry and confocal laser microscopy to study bacterial uptake by madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) type i epithelial cells stably expressing a green fluorescent protein (gfp)-cftr fusion construct (mdck-gfp-cftr cells). we found a strong correlation between cell size and gfp-cftr protein expression, with 60 to 70% of cells expressing low levels of gfp-cftr protein, 20 to 30% expressing intermediate levels, and <10% expressing high levels. the cells were sorted into low-, intermediate-, or high-level producers of cftr protein; in vitro growth of each sorted population yielded the same distribution of cftr protein expression as that in the original population. cells expressing either low or high levels of cftr protein internalized bacteria poorly; maximal bacterial uptake occurred in the cells expressing intermediate levels of cftr protein. treatment of mdck cells with sodium butyrate markedly enhanced the production of cftr protein without increasing cell size; butyrate treatment also increased the proportion of cells with internalized bacteria. however, there were fewer bacteria per butyrate-treated cell and, for p. aeruginosa, there was an overall decrease in the total level of bacterial uptake. the most highly ingested bacterial strains were internalized by fewer total mdck-gfp-cftr cells, indicating preferential bacterial uptake by a minority of epithelial cells within a given culture. confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that p. aeruginosa and serovar typhi induced cytoplasmic accumulation of cftr protein close to the plasma membrane where the bacteria were adherent. these results show that within a population of mdck-gfp-cftr cells, there are cells with markedly different abilities to ingest bacteria via cftr, the majority of the p. aeruginosa and serovar typhi cells are ingested by the one-fourth to one-third of the cells that exhibit an intermediate size and level of cftr protein expression, and overexpression of the cftr receptor does not increase total bacterial uptake but rather allows more epithelial cells to ingest fewer total bacteria.
the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 secretes a nonbacteriocin antibacterial substance(s) active in vitro and in vivo.
the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain la1 inhibits the cell association and cell invasion of enteropathogens in cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells (m. f. bernet, d. brassard, j. r. neeser, and a. l. servin, gut 35:483-489, 1994). here, we demonstrate that strain la1 developed its antibacterial activity in conventional or germ-free mouse models orally infected by salmonella typhimurium. we present evidence that the spent culture supernatant of strain la1 (la1-scs) contained antibacterial components active against s. typhimurium infecting the cultured human intestinal caco-2 cells. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was observed in vitro against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, such as staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, s. typhimurium, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter cloacae. by contrast, no activity was observed against species of the normal gut flora, such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the la1-scs antibacterial activity was insensitive to proteases and independent of lactic acid production.
antibacterial effect of the adhering human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb.
the spent culture supernatant of the human lactobacillus acidophilus strain lb produces an antibacterial activity against a wide range of gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. it decreased the in vitro viability of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter spp. in contrast, it did not inhibit lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. the activity was heat stable and relatively sensitive to enzymatic treatments and developed under acidic conditions. the antimicrobial activity was independent of lactic acid production. activity against s. typhimurium sl1344 infecting human cultured intestinal caco-2 cells was observed as it was in the conventional c3h/he/oujco mouse model with s. typhimurium c5 infection and oral treatment with the lb spent culture supernatant.
cloning, complementation, and characterization of an rfae homolog from neisseria  gonorrhoeae.
neisseria gonorrhoeae ws1 is a spontaneous pyocin (a bacteriocin produced by pseudomonas aeruginosa)-resistant mutant of n. gonorrhoeae fa19 that produces a truncated lipooligosaccharide (los) and is non-transformable. the los-specific mutation in ws1 was moved into a transformable background by transforming fa19 with chromosomal dna from ws1 (generating strain jws-1). a clone (pjcl2) capable of restoring jws-1 to wild-type los expression, as detected by its acquisition of reactivity with monoclonal antibodies and by its complemented sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profile, was isolated. sequential unidirectional deletion and dna sequence analysis of pjcl2 identified an open reading frame, designated lsi-7, that could complement the defect in jws-1. homology searches against various databases indicated that lsi-7 bad homology with several escherichia coli genes involved in the phosphorylation of sugars. lsi-7 is adjacent to the lsi-6 gene, another gene involved in los biosynthesis. complementation studies using salmonella typhimurium lipopolysaccharide mutants showed lsi-6 and lsi-7 to be gonococcal homologs of s. typhimurium rfad and rfae, respectively. reverse transcriptase pcr analysis demonstrated that lsi-6 and lsi-7 are part of the same transcriptional unit.
bactericidal activities of rat defensins and synthetic rabbit defensins on staphylococci, klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3), pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and nonmucoid strains), salmonella typhimurium (ra, rc, rd, and re of lps mutants) and escherichia coli.
rat defensins were purified and tested for in vitro bactericidal assay against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. staphylococcus aureus (209p, cowan i, smith diffuse and smith compact) were resistant to defensins, whereas staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, micrococcus lysodeikticus and bacillus subtilis were less sensitive. gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mucoid and k) and klebsiella pneumoniae (chedid, 277, and 8n3 which were heavily capsulated, moderately capsulated and noncapsulated, respectively) were all very sensitive to defensins and killed within 20 min. escherichia coli was moderately sensitive and the rough mutants of lipopolysaccharide (lps) of salmonella typhimurium lt2, such as ra, rc, rd, and re were equally sensitive to defensins, being killed within 40 min. lysozyme did not show any bactericidal activity except against m. lysodeikticus and b. subtilis, whereas it enhanced the bactericidal activity of defensins against p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and k. pneumoniae and suppressed the killing activity of defensins against s. typhimurium and s. aureus. with regard to the three synthetic rabbit defensins, np1, np4, and np5, np1 showed strong bactericidal activity against k. pneumoniae 277, comparable to that of rat defensins. neither np4 nor np5 showed any bactericidal activity, while np5 rather enhanced the bactericidal activity of np1 against k. pneumoniae 277.
inhibition of chemotaxis of neutrophil leukocytes to interleukin-8 by endotoxins  of various bacteria.
the effects of endotoxins from various bacteria (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio cholerae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhosa, and pseudomonas aeruginosa) on chemotaxis of neutrophil leukocytes to formyl peptide and interleukin-8 were tested in an improved chemotaxis assay involving a "sparse-pore" polycarbonate (nuclepore) membrane in a boyden-type chamber. the possible chemotactic activity of the endotoxins themselves were tested by the same technique. in addition, the effects of these substances on random motility of neutrophils were tested with a corresponding assay involving similar chambers fitted with membranes of standard pore density. possible activation of the complement system of serum by each endotoxin was tested with sheep erythrocyte assays and the maximum endotoxin concentration (100 micrograms/ml) used in the chemotaxis and motility assays. all endotoxins inhibited chemotaxis of neutrophils to interleukin-8. no endotoxin affected chemotaxis to formyl peptide or was itself chemotactic for neutrophils. endotoxin of s. flexneri inhibited random motility of neutrophils, while the others had no such effect. endotoxins of k. pneumoniae and of p. aeruginosa produced moderate and marked inhibition, respectively, of total complement, as measured by hemolysis of sheep erythrocytes, without affecting the levels of c3c and c4 in these assays. endotoxins of the other bacteria had no demonstrable effect in any of these assays of complement activation. these results suggest that chemotaxis to interleukin-8 may be mediated by cellular mechanisms different from those involved in chemotaxis to formyl peptide. furthermore, the presence of these endotoxins could be significant for the suppression of neutrophil accumulation in inflammatory lesions mediated by interleukin-8.
sensitivity of bacteria to nano2 and to l-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages.
sensitivity of bacteria to no2-/no and to l-arginine-dependent system in murine macrophages was tested. the growth of all bacteria tested, salmonella typhimurium, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus epidermidis, was significantly inhibited by nano2 at the concentration of 5 to 10 mm. however, l-arginine-dependent effector mechanism of lps-activated murine macrophages was ineffective in killing these bacteria. it seems that the concentration of no2-/no in phagolysosome in the activated macrophages is insufficient to kill the bacteria in situ. we concluded that l-arginine-dependent effector mechanism can hardly work on bacteria killing in activated macrophages.
augmentation of resistance of mice to bacterial infection by a polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (pspg) extracted from lactobacillus casei.
a water-soluble polysaccharide-peptidoglycan complex (pspg) was prepared from heat-killed lactobacillus casei by digesting the bacteria with n-acetylmuramidase. the molecular weight of pspg was over 30,000, and the polysaccharide portion of pspg, its main component was composed of rhamnose, glucose, galactose, glucosamine and galactosamine. mice pretreated intraperitoneally with pspg survived after a lethal infection with listeria monocytogenes or pseudomonas aeruginosa. the growth of infecting bacteria (l. monocytogenes, p. aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli) in both the peritoneal cavity and the liver was inhibited markedly in the mice that had been treated with pspg. it was suggested that macrophages may be the main effector for the anti-infectious effect of pspg since treatment of mice with carrageenan, a selective macrophage blocker, markedly reduced the anti-infectious effect of pspg.
effect of date extract on growth and spore germination of bacillus subtilis.
berhi date extract was studied for its effect on the growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhi and pseudomonas aeruginosa. from 80 to 99% inhibition was observed in nutrient broth cultures containing 20% (w/v) date extract. spore germination of b. subtilis was inhibited completely using various concentrations of date extract. cell elongation and depression in the cell wall of b. subtilis were seen by scanning electron microscopy as a result of incubation in a growth medium containing dates.
survival of pathogenic bacteria in environmental microcosms.
the survival times of salmonella enteritidis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and vibrio cholerae in natural soil and river water samples were monitored by using various differential media. s. aureus and v. cholerae failed to survive in samples of soil, groundwater, and river water with various degrees of eutrophication. the population of the introduced s. enteritidis remained fairly constant in all three samples of soils tested. in water samples, numbers of s. enteritidis and p. aeruginosa showed an initial rapid decline followed by a much lower rate of decrease. the results indicated that some allochthonous microorganisms, because of their insensitivity to various biotic and abiotic stresses, might persist for a long time in the environment and become a serious threat to public health.
factors responsible for increased susceptibility of mice to intestinal colonization after treatment with streptomycin.
streptomycin sulfate (5 mg/ml) was added to the drinking water of swiss white mice. after treatment for 1 week, the mice were challenged orogastrically with 10(8) pseudomonas aeruginosa cells. the organism failed to multiply in the intestinal tract of either treated or untreated animals, but could be recovered from contents and tissues after 48 h. in a previous study, salmonella typhimurium was shown to multiply in the intestines of streptomycin-treated but not untreated mice when 10(3) organisms were used as inoculum. streptomycin administration had little effect on eh, protein or carbohydrate concentrations of cecal contents, or intestinal motility. however, it caused a statistically significant increase in water content and ph of contents and a decrease in the concentrations of acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids. s. typhimurium multiplied in pooled cecal contents obtained from both streptomycin-treated and untreated animals, but its multiplication rate and total populations were significantly greater in contents from treated animals. p. aeruginosa did not multiply in contents from either treated or untreated mice. similar results were obtained when the organisms were inoculated into nutrient broth adjusted to simulate the ph levels and volatile fatty acid (vfa) concentrations in cecal contents of treated and untreated mice. the addition of brain heart infusion broth to cecal contents from untreated animals, in concentrations that support multiplication of s. typhimurium and p. aeruginosa, did not reverse inhibition. the addition of vfa to cecal contents from treated animals to equal the concentration in cecal contents from untreated animals caused inhibition of a magnitude observed in cecal contents from untreated animals. the results indicate that vfa operating at the ph level of cecal contents of conventional mice inhibit the multiplication of both s. typhimurium and p. aeruginosa and restrict colonization of the intestine by these organisms. the decrease in vfa concentrations that occurs as a result of streptomycin administration adequately explains the increased susceptibility of treated mice to colonization with s. typhimurium. it does not explain the increased susceptibility of treated mice to p. aeruginosa colonization, however.
effect of rat polymorphonuclear leukocyte granule components on the growth and survival of pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium.
granule contents from rat polymorphonuclear neutrophils were prepared by extraction with 0.2 m acetate buffer (ph 4.0), dialyzed against phosphate-buffered saline (ph 7.0), and tested for bactericidal activity against selected target bacteria. salmonella typhimurium lt-2 and a series of progressively rough lipopolysaccharide outer membrane mutants derived from it were used to monitor antimicrobial activity. although an antimicrobial potential was present in rat granule contents for s. typhimurium, the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa pao-1 in antimicrobial assay mixtures containing rat granule contents was substantially enhanced over control values. the growth enhancement property of the granule protein was heat resistant and promoted increased oxygen consumption by whole cells.
comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.
minimal inhibitory concentrations of twenty antimicrobial agents to animal pathogens.
minimal inhibitory concentration (m.i.c.) values as determined by an agar-plate-dilution method for 60 bacterial isolates, consisting of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus of animal origin against 20 antimicrobial drugs are presented. of all the drugs, gentamicin had the best in vitro antibacterial activity in terms of m.i.c. when considering all the species of organisms together, while spectinomycin had the least activity.an inoculum replicator was a convenient tool in carrying out the agar-plate-dilution method.a comparison of the m.i.c. values of 42 isolates of s. typhimurium with the results obtained by low level method and the bauer-kir-by method showed that with few exceptions, there is a general agreement.
