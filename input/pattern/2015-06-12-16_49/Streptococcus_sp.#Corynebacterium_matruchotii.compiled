TI  - Subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in Korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  - Smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. However, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. Here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in Korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16S rRNA gene-based pyrosequencing. A total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. Differences in bacterial communities between smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. The genera Fusobacterium, Fretibacterium, Streptococcus, Veillonella, Corynebacterium, TM7, and Filifactor were abundant in smokers. On the other hand, Prevotella, Campylobacter, Aggregatibacter, Veillonellaceae GQ422718, Haemophilus, and Prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. Among species-level taxa occupying > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (OTUs) was found: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria sicca, Neisseria oralis, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Veillonella dispar, Filifactor alocis, and Fretibacterium AY349371. On the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or OTUs was found in smokers: Neisseria elongata, six Prevotella species or OTUs, Fusobacterium canifelinum, Aggregatibacter AM420165, Selenomonas OTU, and Veillonellaceae GU470897. Species richness and evenness were similar between the groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. Collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in Korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.
TI  - Bacterial 16S sequence analysis of severe caries in young permanent teeth.
AB  - Previous studies have confirmed the association of the acid producers Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus spp. with childhood caries, but they also suggested these microorganisms are not sufficient to explain all cases of caries. In addition, health-associated bacterial community profiles are not well understood, including the importance of base production and acid catabolism in pH homeostasis. The bacterial community composition in health and in severe caries of the young permanent dentition was compared using Sanger sequencing of the ribosomal 16S rRNA genes. Lactobacillus species were dominant in severe caries, and levels rose significantly as caries progressed from initial to deep lesions. S. mutans was often observed at high levels in the early stages of caries but also in some healthy subjects and was not statistically significantly associated with caries progression in the overall model. Lactobacillus or S. mutans was found either at low levels or not present in several samples. Other potential acid producers observed at high levels in these subjects included strains of Selenomonas, Neisseria, and Streptococcus mitis. Propionibacterium FMA5 was significantly associated with caries progression but was not found at high levels. An overall loss of community diversity occurred as caries progressed, and species that significantly decreased included the Streptococcus mitis-S. pneumoniae-S. infantis group, Corynebacterium matruchotii, Streptococcus gordonii, Streptococcus cristatus, Capnocytophaga gingivalis, Eubacterium IR009, Campylobacter rectus, and Lachnospiraceae sp. C1. The relationship of acid-base metabolism to 16S rRNA gene-based species assignments appears to be complex, and metagenomic approaches that would allow functional profiling of entire genomes will be helpful in elucidating the microbial pathogenesis of caries.
TI  - Association of a novel high molecular weight, serine-rich protein (SrpA) with fibril-mediated adhesion of the oral biofilm bacterium Streptococcus cristatus.
AB  - The surface of the oral plaque bacterium Streptococcus cristatus is decorated with a lateral tuft of fibrils. The fibrillar tuft functions in the adhesion of S. cristatus to heterologous bacterial species in the plaque biofilm. The tuft typically consists of a densely packed fringe of shorter fibrils 238 +/- 19 nm long with longer, less abundant fibrils 403 +/- 66 nm long projecting through the fringe of short fibrils. The two types of fibrils in the tufts of S. cristatus have been refractory to biochemical separation, complicating their characterization. A hexadecane partition assay was used to enrich for subpopulations of S. cristatus CR311 (type strain NCTC 12479) having distinct fibrillar morphotypes. Negative staining in the TEM revealed that cells of a hydrophobic subpopulation of S. cristatus (CR311var1) carried only the long fibrils (395 +/- 32 nm). A hydrophilic subpopulation of S. cristatus (CR311var3) consisted of mixed morphotypes having no fibrils or remnant short fibrils (223 +/- 49 nm). No long fibrils were observed on any cells in the CR311var3 subpopulation. The CR311var3 morphotype, unlike the wild-type strain and CR311var1, was not able to form corncobs with either Corynebacterium matruchotii or Fusobacterium nucleatum. Variant CR311var3 did not express the novel gene srpA, which encodes a high molecular weight (321,882 Da) serine-rich protein, SrpA. The SrpA protein contains two extensive repeat motifs of 17 and 71 amino acids and a gram-positive cell wall anchor consensus sequence (LPNTG). The unusual properties of SrpA most closely resemble those of Fap1, the fimbrial-associated adhesin protein of Streptococcus parasanguis. The association of long fibrils, high surface hydrophobicity, ability to form corncob formations, and expression of the srpA gene suggest that SrpA is a long fibril protein in S. cristatus.
TI  - Calcium and water diffusion in single-species model bacterial plaques.
AB  - The diffusion of tritiated water and 45Ca through single-species model plaques was measured in a diaphragm cell. Using plaques of Streptococcus downei, the apparent diffusion coefficient for tritiated water showed a small but significant decrease between pH 7.0 and 5.0 with a smaller, non-significant decrease for calcium. These effects are attributed to possible plaque shrinkage at reduced pH, which overcomes effects due to charge-dependent changes in permeability. Effective diffusion coefficients for 45Ca obtained from lag-time measurements were much reduced at low carrier concentrations, demonstrating a binding which correlated with previous results from equilibrium dialysis. Strep. sanguis and Corynebacterium matruchotii showed few differences from Strep. downei, although the corynebacterium previously demonstrated stronger calcium binding. Permeability to water and calcium were slightly affected by pH, while effective diffusion of calcium depended on concentration. This may have important implications for the process of mineral loss in dental caries.
TI  - Calcification of a cariogenic Streptococcus and of Corynebacterium (Bacterionema) matruchotii.
AB  - The main aim of this investigation was to challenge the idea that cariogenic streptococci do not calcify. Calcium uptake of calcification of Streptococcus mutans C180-2, proven to be an acidogenic and cariogenic strain, was compared with calcium uptake and calcification of Corynebacterium (Bacterionema) matruchotii, known as a ready calcifier. Bacteria were grown on Brain Heart Infusion Agar (BHIA) and on well-buffered semi-synthetic E-agar, both containing 1.4 mmol/L calcium, 2 g/L glucose, initial pH 7.4. Calcium uptake from BHIA by C. matruchotii (25 mmol Ca/kg wet bacterial cell mass), but not by S. mutans, was found. Grown as a plaque-like lawn on E-agar, the S. mutans cell mass concentrated calcium to 63 +/- 11 mmol/kg compared with 145 +/- 61 mmol/kg in C. matruchotii. X-ray diffraction confirmed the presence of crystalline apatite in the bacterial cell masses. Electron microscopy revealed crystals and mineralized deposits in both organisms. Heavy calcifications in some cells of S. mutans were seen. Calcification was partly inhibited by magnesium ion and by methanehydroxybisphosphonate. S. sobrinus 6715, as well as freshly isolated S. mutans and S. sobrinus from patients, concentrated very large quantities of calcium, up to 500-fold from the medium, when maintained for several weeks on E-agar of initial pH 7.6. Our observations widen the view on acidogenic bacteria as mineralization agents and support the notion that members of the mutans group of streptococci may be involved in events that trigger heavy intracellular calcifications and, possibly, dental calculus formation.
TI  - A quantitative study of calcium binding and aggregation in selected oral bacteria.
AB  - By means of micro-equilibrium dialysis, calcium binding capacities and affinities were measured in three different oral bacteria, and the effects of extracellular polysaccharide, pH, and aggregation were investigated. Binding capacities of 31.0 +/- 2.1 (C. matruchotii), 34.7 +/- 3.7 (S. sanguis), and 41.5 +/- 5.4 (S. downei) mumol calcium/g wet weight of cells were found at pH 7.0, falling to 21.4 +/- 0.8 mumol calcium/g wet wt. cells at pH 5.0 for S. downei. Dissociation constants were found to vary between 0.78 +/- 0.24 and 1.77 +/- 0.30 mmol/L (at pH 7.0, depending on species), and between 0.62 +/- 0.04 and 1.77 +/- 0.30 (in the pH range 5.0 to 7.0, for S. downei only). Examination suggested that at pH 7.0 calcium-facilitated bacterial association occurs in the streptococci with calcium uptake curves analogous with those of positively cooperative systems. Desorption of calcium from aggregated S. downei suggested that the mechanism of desorption differed from that of uptake. This may be an important factor in plaque formation and in the binding of cells to the surface of formed plaque. Plaque calcium forms a reservoir, readily released by a pH drop, which may increase plaque fluid saturation and reduce demineralization.
TI  - Silica-induced precipitation of calcium phosphate in the presence of inhibitors of hydroxyapatite formation.
AB  - The promotion and the inhibition of hydroxyapatite formation by various substances were determined by measurement of the induction time of spontaneous precipitation (ti) from supersaturated solutions. Silica was found to decrease ti in Hepes-buffered (pH 7.2) supersaturated solutions with a wide range of calcium-to-phosphate ratios and concentrations. Also, in suspensions of the oral bacteria S. mutans or C. matruchotii in 1 mmol/L calcium, 7.5 mmol/L phosphate, and 50 mmol/L Hepes (pH 7.2), silica was capable of stimulating precipitation. Macromolecules derived from these bacteria by freezing and thawing appeared to be strong inhibitors of calcium phosphate precipitation. In the presence of silica, the effects of these bacterial inhibitors could be partially overcome, which supports the idea that silica in dental plaque is a promoter of calculus formation. In contrast, inhibition of calcium phosphate precipitation by a low-molecular-weight inhibitor, pyrophosphate, could not be counteracted by silica.
TI  - Production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from Staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  - Staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. These strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of Staphylococcus aureus FDA209P. The frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. Strain IYS2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. IYS2 was identified to be S. aureus, based on its biological properties. The bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. Its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. The isoelectric point was 10.0. In amino acid composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. The bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. The bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. An analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that Streptococcus salivarius, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium parvulum, and Actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus mitis, Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacterionema matruchotii, and Bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. The majority of S. aureus tested were susceptible, and all Staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
