TI  - Mutual influences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on their adhesion to stainless steel.
AB  - The mutual influences of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Desulfovibrio desulfuricans subsp. desulfuricans (ATCC 29577) on their adhesion to stainless steel were investigated in batch and column experiments. It was found that P. aeruginosa promoted the adhesion of D. desulfuricans under conditions of turbulence, but not under quiescent conditions. The enhancement involved the alignment of most D. desulfuricans along P. aeruginosa cells and was attributed to the additional interaction surface area provided by adhered P. aeruginosa to aligning D. desulfuricans cells. A slightly positive effect of preadhered D. desulfuricans on the adhesion of P. aeruginosa was found. Under condition of laminar flow, substantially better adhesion of D. desulfuricans to confluent P. aeruginosa biofilms than to steel was observed. The mutual influences are discussed in terms of more favorable adhesion energies and the influence of changed hydraulic conditions due to the roughness of P. aeruginosa biofilms.
TI  - Comparative studies of monohemic bacterial C-type cytochromes. Redox and optical  properties of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway cytochrome C553(550) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa cytochrome C551.
AB  - Redox properties of cytochrome c553(550) from Desulfovibrio desulfuricans Norway  (Eo' = 0.04 + 0.02 V/NHE) and cytochrome c551 from P. aeruginosa (Eo = 0.25 +/- 0.02 V/NHE) are compared with those of some monohemic c-type cytochromes. The pK value for the equilibrium between the pH-dependent forms of cytochrome c553(550) (pK = 10.3 +/- 0.1) has been also determined. It is to be noted that the difference between redox potentials can extend to nearly 250 mV, though the axial heme ligands are identical. Structural reasons have to be invoked to explain these variations.
TI  - [Mutual relations between plastic materials and bacteria (author's transl)].
AB  - The complex problems of microbiological degradation of synthetic plastics and a fairly wide variety of 62 testing materials, belonging to 14 major groups of plastics, are described. Adaequate and reliable testing techniques had to be devised. Drawing on the experiences of H. Braun, 1930, and of Bushnell and Haas, 1941, as to the metabolism of bacteria and the utilization of certain hydrocarbons by microorganisms, and previous research work by A. Schwartz in Berlin, 1959-60, on microbial corrosion of plastics, methods of laboratory testing were developed. The bacteriological technique was based on selection of aerobic microorganisms, which were, by starvation, adapted to use the plastic materials as their only carbon source; foreign carbon sources had to be strictly eliminated; emphasis was laid on proper, double control cultures. The test organisms involved included P. aeruginosa and fluorescens strains, also a certain species of Candida, and mixtures of soil, sewage and garbage organisms grown on exposed plastic surfaces. By means of series of passages the selective adaptation and conservation of these organisms was continued up to 4 1/2 years. An anaerobic adaptation method for Desulfovibrio desulfuricans was developed and used successfully. After preliminary experimentation (Soil burial, sewage and garbage exposure tests) in the laboratory as well as in the open, a large scale Field testing programme under realistic and to some extent extreme conditions was implemented: Nine different plastic materials comprising eight plain high polymer plastics and for comparison one synthetic Cellulose derivate, together with glass control samples, were exposed in twelve different sewage, garbage, and soil media over a period of 3 months to 2 years, and subsequently examined. On the basis of the bacteriological results obtained from the adaptation series the test materials were classified into three categories, corresponding to the stimulation of bacterial growth: Group one, which allowed strong proliferation, included certain types of plasticized P.V.C. and Cellulose esters, as expected, and, as a new result, Polyurethane rubber; the latter showed clear signs of surface corrosion. Group two, which induced a clear but moderate growth, comprised a nylon trade type of Polyamide. Gruop three, allowing weak but still recognisable growth, included Formaldehyde pressure resing (Bakelite). This was surprising as it was thought that the formaldehyde and phenol components would exert a bacteriocidic or at least bacteriostatic effect. The results of the long and time consuming adaptation series with Pseudomonas aeruginosa were confirmed by the manometric dissimilation method of O. Warburg by means of the Braun/Melsungen apparatus. With this subtle but elegant procedure results and graphical recordings were obtained within hours and days...
