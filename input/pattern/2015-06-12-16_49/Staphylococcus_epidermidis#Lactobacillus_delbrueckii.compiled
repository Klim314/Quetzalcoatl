TI  - A rapid procedure for isolating chromosomal DNA from Lactobacillus species and other Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - This study describes a rapid procedure for the isolation of genomic DNA from various Gram-positive bacteria. Species tested included Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis ATCC 4797, Lact. acidophilus N2, Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Propionibacterium jensenii P126, Bacillus pumilus and Enterococcus faecalis. Our technique for chromosomal DNA isolation circumvents the need for phenol-chloroform extractions and caesium chloride gradients. Isolated DNA is consistently greater than 25 kb in size and can be used directly for subcloning, polymerase chain reaction amplification, restriction digestions and library construction.
