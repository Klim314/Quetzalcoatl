TI  == establishment of a sensitive system for analysis of human vaginal microbiota on the basis of rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr.
AB  == ten specific primer sets, for lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus crispatus, atopobium vaginae, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii, chlamydia trachomatis/muridarum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum, bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis, bifidobacterium adolescentis, and bifidobacterium angulatum, were developed for quantitative analysis of vaginal microbiota. rrna-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) analysis of the vaginal samples from 12 healthy japanese volunteers using the new primer sets together with 25 existing primer sets revealed the diversity of their vaginal microbiota: lactobacilli such as l. crispatus, l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii, lactobacillus iners, and lactobacillus vaginalis, as the major populations at 10(7) cells/ml vaginal fluid, were followed by facultative anaerobes such as streptococcus and strict anaerobes at lower population levels of 10(4) cells/ml or less. certain bacterial vaginosis (bv)-related bacteria, such as g. vaginalis, a. vaginae, m. curtisii, and prevotella, were also detected in some subjects. especially in one subject, both g. vaginalis and a. vaginae were detected at high population levels of 10(8.8) and 10(8.9) cells/ml vaginal fluid, suggesting that she is an asymptomatic bv patient. these results suggest that the rt-qpcr system is effective for accurate analysis of major vaginal commensals and diagnosis of several vaginal infections.

TI  == dissimilarity in the occurrence of bifidobacteriaceae in vaginal and perianal microbiota in women with bacterial vaginosis.
AB  == recent data point at the similarity between the perianal and vaginal microflora in terms of lactobacillus species involved. bacterial vaginosis, the most common  perturbation of the vaginal microflora involving primarily overgrowth of gardnerella vaginalis, has also been suggested to involve a recto-vaginal pathway. we addressed this issue with regard to bacteria of the bifidobacteriaceae family. in particular, we investigated the putative concordance of the presence of g. vaginalis and a series of bifidobacteria between the perianal and vaginal microflora in 10 patients with bacterial vaginosis through multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of desquamated epithelial cells. g. vaginalis was found in a biofilm mode of growth  at the perianal and vaginal sites. in most women at least one of the following species was detected perianally: bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium breves, bifidobacterium bifidum and bifidobacterium catenulatum. at the vaginal site, none of these bifidobacteria was found. we conclude that bacterial vaginosis does not occur as a result of simple growth per continuum of perianal bacteria. only some species originating from the intestinal tract do display pronounced vaginotropism, like g. vaginalis, whereas many other  species do not.

TI  == [amplification of bacterial heat shock protein 60 gene using inverse pcr method].
AB  == a method is presented for rapid in vitro amplification of dna sequences of bacterial hsp60 gene. in our previous work, using degenerate oligonucleotide primers for conserved regions of hsp60 gene, a 600 bp fragment was amplified by pcr, cloned and sequenced. an inverse pcr method, with the primers oriented in the reversed direction of the usual orientation, is used to amplify the dna sequences that flank the 600 bp known region. the feasibility of this method is shown by amplifying the complete hsp60 gene sequences of 4 bacterial strains, namely bifidobacterium denticolens, bifidobacterium inopinatum, bifidobacterium adolescentis and gardnerella vaginalis.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.
