TI  == research into acetone removal from air by biofiltration using a biofilter with straight structure plates.
AB  == the biological air treatment method is based on the biological destruction of organic compounds using certain cultures of microorganisms. this method is simple and may be applied in many branches of industry. the main element of biological air treatment devices is a filter charge. tests were carried out using a new-generation laboratory air purifier with a plate structure. this purifier is called biofilter. the biofilter has a special system for packing material humidification which does not require additional energy inputs. in order to extend the packing material's durability, it was composed of thermally treated birch fibre. pollutant (acetone) biodegradation occurred on thermally treated wood fibre in this research. according to the performed tests and the received results, the process of biodestruction was highly efficient. when acetone was passed through biofilter's packing material at 0.08 m s-1 rate, the efficiency of the biofiltration process was from 70% up to 90%. the species of bacteria capable of removing acetone vapour from the air, i.e. bacillus (b. cereus, b. subtilis),  pseudomonas (p. aeruginosa, p. putida), stapylococcus (s. aureus) and rhodococcus sp., was identified in this study during the process of biofiltration. their amount in the biological packing material changed from 1.6 x 107 to 3.7 x 1011 cfu g-1.

TI  == [specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra oaxaca, mexico].
AB  == specific bacterial diversity in bats of different food guilds in southern sierra  oaxaca, mexico. bats have different ecologic roles in variable ecosystems that have been already described. they have been linked to several zoonoses, however little is known about the relationship between bat microbiota and their diet, and studies on the bacterial ecology of the microbiota in bats are limited. to contribute with the description of this important interaction between microbiota  and host, the aim of this work was to characterize the composition and bacterial  diversity in the oral and anal regions of 10 species of bats, in relation to food guild. for this monthly samplings were conducted using four mist nets (19:00-24:00h) from february to october 2012; nets were reviewed every 45 minutes. each captured organism was sampled in the oral and anal cavities with sterile swabs; these were placed in pre-enrichment media and stored at 4 degrees  c. bacterial samples were studied which through selective media, chromogenic and  biochemical tests. we obtained samples from 502 frugivorous, 29 hematophagous and 11 nectivorous bats. we found a total of 26 bacterial species, with the predominant phylum proteobacteria and the family enterobacteriaceae. statistically significant differences were observed between oral and anal microhabitats: frugivorous (t = -3.516, g.1 = 14.761, p = 0.003), hematophagous (t = -3.320, g.l = 19.262, p = 0.003), and nectivorous (t = -2.497, g.l = 11.933, p = 0.026), and in some guilds [frugivorous and nectivorous in the anal region (t = 2.274, g.l = 29.660, p = 0.030), hematophagous and nectivorous anal region (t = 2.077, g.l = 29.904, p = 0.049)]. it was also shown that there is bacteria specificity in some guilds such as nectivorous and frugivorous with bacillus cereus, b. sp. x. sp., as well as, pseudomonas aeruginosa, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermis, aeromonas hydrophyla in hematophagous. bacterial presence can be explained by the type of diet and/or by transfer of bacteria from their preys. these bacteria may be indigenous to these bats and play the role of mutual benefit, providing the host with stable growth conditions and supplemental nutrients, while the microbiota contributes to host nutrition, development of the immune system, stabilization of the microbial population and to avoid pathogens colonization. by understanding the importance of the relation- ship between host and its bacterial populations, the conservation efforts being made to protect species such as bats may be improved.

TI  == antibacterial and cytotoxic potential of silver nanoparticles synthesized using latex of calotropis gigantea l.
AB  == the present study aimed to synthesis silver nanoparticles (agnps) in a greener route using aqueous latex extract of calotropis gigantea l. toward biomedical applications. initially, synthesis of agnps was confirmed through uv-vis spectroscopy which shows the surface plasmonic resonance peak (spr) at 420 nm. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) analysis provides clear evidence that protein fractions present in the latex extract act as reducing and stabilizing bio agents. energy dispersive x-ray (edax) spectroscopy confirms the  presence of silver as a major constituent element. x-ray diffractograms displays  that the synthesized agnps were biphasic crystalline nature. electron microscopic studies such as field emission scanning electron microscopic (fe-sem) and transmission electron microscope (tem) reveals that synthesized agnps are spherical in shape with the size range between 5 and 30 nm. further, crude latex  aqueous extract and synthesized agnps were evaluated against different bacterial  pathogens such as bacillus cereus, enterococci sp, shigella sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. compared to the crude latex aqueous extract, biosynthesized agnps exhibits a remarkable antimicrobial activity. likewise in vitro anticancer study manifests the cytotoxicity value of synthesized agnps against tested hela cells. the output of this study clearly suggesting that biosynthesized agnps using latex of c. gigantea can be used as promising nanomaterial for therapeutic application in context with nanodrug formulation.

TI  == antibiotic oxylipins from alternanthera brasiliana and its endophytic bacteria.
AB  == bioassay-guided fractionation of alternanthera brasiliana stem extracts resulted  in the isolation of an antibiotically active fraction. five human pathogenic bacteria were used to guide the fractionation process for the isolation of antimicrobial compounds. finally, 17 linoleate oxylipins were identified by lc-ms/ms and nmr spectroscopy. five of the isolated compounds present in a. brasiliana tissues were also detected to be synthesized by endophytic bacteria of the genus bacillus that were isolated from a. brasiliana. it is speculated that the antibiotic oxylipins from a. brasiliana might derive from bacteria and be involved in an ecological relationship between this plant and its endophytes.

TI  == chemotaxis-based endosulfan biotransformation: enrichment and isolation of endosulfan-degrading bacteria.
AB  == the study was conducted to isolate endosulfan biotransforming or biodegrading microbes based on chemotaxis. pseudomonas aeruginosa strain kkc3, ochrobactrum sp. strain kkc4, achromobacter xylosoxidans strain kkc6 and bacillus megaterium kkc7 were isolated based on their migration towards endosulfan in a soil column.  out of the four bacteria, b. megaterium converted endosulfan into toxic metabolite endosulfan sulphate, while the other three bacteria followed the non-toxic endosulfan diol pathway. the mixed culture system consisting of p. aeruginosa, ochrobactrum sp and a. xylosoxidans could remove 94% of total endosulfan by using endosulfan as the sole source of sulphur.

TI  == two rhizobacterial strains, individually and in interactions with rhizobium sp.,  enhance fusarial wilt control, growth, and yield in pigeon pea.
AB  == a pseudomonas aeruginosa strain, rrlj 04, and a bacillus cereus strain, bs 03, were tested both individually and in combination with a rhizobium strain, rh 2, for their ability to enhance plant growth and nodulation in pigeon pea (cajanus cajan l.) under gnotobiotic, greenhouse and field conditions. both of the rhizobacterial strains exhibited a positive effect on growth in terms of shoot height, root length, fresh and dry weight, nodulation and yield over the non-treated control. co-inoculation of seeds with these strains and rhizobium rh  2 also reduced the number of wilted plants, when grown in soil infested with fusarium udum. gnotobiotic studies confirmed that the suppression of wilt disease was due to the presence of the respective pgpr strains. seed bacterization with drug-marked mutants of rrlj 04 and bs 03 confirmed their ability to colonize and  multiply along the roots. the results suggest that co-inoculation of these strains with rhizobium strain rh 2 can be further exploited for enhanced growth,  nodulation and yield in addition to control of fusarial wilt in pigeon pea.

TI  == purification and molecular and biological characterisation of the 1-hydroxyphenazine, produced by an environmental strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa--an opportunistic pathogen, perhaps best known for chronic lung infections, produces wide range of pigments that possess specific activities which either assist the organism's survival or bring about changes within host. a similar blue-green diffusible pigment producing p. aeruginosa was isolated from dug-well water, so as to extract 1-hydroxyphenazine from its crude pigment. the compound was purified from the crude pigment using column chromatography followed by a preparative thin layer chromatography that showed a single yellow spot. further molecular characterisation of the purified component was carried out using uv-vis spectrophotometer, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, nuclear  magnetic resonance spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy which showed respective peaks corresponding to 1-hydroxyphenazine. biological characterisation using in vitro assays revealed that 1-hydroxyphenazine showed anti-bacterial activity only against bacillus sp. and a concentration of 30 microg/ml induced noticeable morphological alteration in a549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells followed by cell death after 48 h. thus, such active components within bacterial pigments can be characterized and used as possible anti-bacterial or anti-cancer agents.

TI  == the blow fly, chrysomya megacephala, and the house fly, musca domestica, as mechanical vectors of pathogenic bacteria in northeast thailand.
AB  == the oriental latrine fly, chrysomya megacephala (fabricius) (diptera: calliphoridae) and the house fly, musca domestica l., (diptera: muscidae) are synanthropic flies which are adapted to live in close association with human habitations, thereby making them likely mechanical vectors of several pathogens to humans. there were two main aims of this study. the first aim was to determine the prevalence of these two fly species from five types of human habitations including: fresh-food markets, garbage piles, restaurants, school cafeterias and  paddy fields, in the muang ubon ratchathani and warinchamrap districts of ubon ratchathani province of northeast thailand. flies collection were conducted monthly from september 2010-october 2011 using a reconstructable funnel trap, containing 1 day-tainted beef offal as bait. a total of 7 750 flies (6 401 c. megacephala and 1 349 m.domestica) were collected. the second aim was to examine  the potential of these flies to carry pathogenic bacteria. bacteria were isolated from 994 individual flies collected using a sweep net (555 c. megacephala and 439 m. domestica). a total of 15 bacterial genera were isolated from the external surfaces, comprising ten genera of gram-negative bacteria and five gram-positive  bacteria. the most common bacteria isolated from both species were coagulase-negative staphylococci, followed by streptococcus group d non-enterococci. human pathogenic enteric bacteria isolated were salmonella sp.,  shigella sp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhi, bacillus sp., and enterococcus sp., of which s. typhi is the first report of isolation from these fly species. other human pathogens included staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. not only were the number of c. megacephala positive for bacteria significantly higher than for m. domestica, but they were also carrying ~11-12 times greater bacterial load than m. domestica. these data suggest that both fly  species should be considered potential mechanical vectors of bacterial pathogens  associated with human habitations year-round in this region of northeast thailand.

TI  == in-vitro assessment of antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of methanol extracts and essential oil of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis.
AB  == background: owing to the complexity of the antioxidant materials and their mechanism of actions, it is obvious that no single testing method is capable of providing a comprehensive picture of the antioxidant profile. the essential oil of the thymus specie may still possess other important activities in traditional  medicine, it can be used in the treatment of fever and cough. this essential oil  may also have an anticancer activity. methods: the essential oils aerial parts hydrodistilled from thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were characterised by gc/ms analysis and the methanolic extracts were chemically characterized by hplc method. the essence of thyme was evaluated for its antioxidant and antibacterial  activity. result: the terpinen-4-ol are the principal class of metabolites (33.34%) among which 1.8-cineole (19.96%) and camphor (19.20%) predominate. in this study, quantitative values of antioxidant activity of crude methanolic extracts of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis were investigated. the essential oils was screened for their antibacterial activity against six common pathogenic microorganisms (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enteridis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis and listeria monocytogenes) by well diffusion method and agar dilution method (mic). all the essences were found to inhibit the growth of both gram (+) and gram (-) bacteria organisms tested. these activities were correlated with the presence of phenolic compounds in active fractions. hplc confirmed presence of phenolic compounds in methanol extracts. conclusion: methanol extracts and essential oils from aerial parts of thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis, were examined for their potential as antioxidants. the technique for measuring antioxidant activity, which was developed using dpph, abts and beta-carotene bleaching, produced results as found in established literatures. the present results indicate clearly that methanol extracts and essential oils from thymus hirtus sp. algeriensis possess antioxidant properties  and could serve as free radical inhibitors or scavengers, acting possibly as primary antioxidants, also their essential oil have an antibacterial effect.

AB  == surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. the aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. the identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16s rrna gene sequencing. bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. the antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (tpc), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (dpph) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (orac). antimicrobial activities were evaluated against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, salmonella enteritidis, staphylococcus aureus, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida albicans. a total of 39 bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as vibrio sp.  (48.72%), alteromonas sp. (12.82%), shewanella sp. (12.26%), serratia sp. (2.56%), citricoccus sp. (2.56%), cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), ruegeria sp. (2.56%)  and staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% basic local alignment search tool (blast) match, and some of those could be new. the highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against b. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (shewanella sp.). several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against s. aureus, mainly belonging to alteromonas sp. and vibrio sp. there were no positive results against fungi and gram-negative bacteria. bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == tuning the biological activity profile of antibacterial polymers via subunit substitution pattern.
AB  == binary nylon-3 copolymers containing cationic and hydrophobic subunits can mimic  the biological properties of host-defense peptides, but relationships between composition and activity are not yet well understood for these materials. hydrophobic subunits in previously studied examples have been limited mostly to cycloalkane-derived structures, with cyclohexyl proving to be particularly promising. the present study evaluates alternative hydrophobic subunits that are  isomeric or nearly isomeric with the cyclohexyl example; each has four sp(3) carbons in the side chains. the results show that varying the substitution pattern of the hydrophobic subunit leads to relatively small changes in antibacterial activity but causes significant changes in hemolytic activity. we hypothesize that these differences in biological activity profile arise, at least in part, from variations among the conformational propensities of the hydrophobic subunits. the alpha,alpha,beta,beta-tetramethyl unit is optimal among the subunits we have examined, providing copolymers with potent antibacterial activity and excellent prokaryote vs eukaryote selectivity. bacteria do not readily develop resistance to the new antibacterial nylon-3 copolymers. these findings suggest that variation in subunit conformational properties could be generally valuable in the development of synthetic polymers for biological applications.

TI  == comparative pyrosequencing analysis of bacterial community change in biofilm formed on seawater reverse osmosis membrane.
AB  == the change in bacterial community structure induced by bacterial competition and  succession was investigated during seawater reverse osmosis (swro) in order to elucidate a possible link between the bacterial consortium on swro membranes and  biofouling. to date, there has been no definitive characterization of the microbial diversity in swro in terms of distinguishing time-dependent changes in  the richness or abundance of bacterial species. for bacterial succession within biofilms on the membrane surface, swro using a cross-flow filtration membrane test unit was operated for 5 and 100h, respectively. as results of the pyrosequencing analysis, bacterial communities differed considerably among seawater and the 5 and 100 h samples. from a total of 33,876 pyrosequences (using a 95% sequence similarity), there were less than 1% of shared species, confirming the influence of the operational time factor and lack of similarity of these communities. during swro operation, the abundance of pseudomonas stutzeri bbspn3  (gu594474) belonging to gamma-proteobacteria suggest that biofouling of swro membrane might be driven by the dominant influence of a specific species. in addition, among the bacterial competition of five bacterial species (pseudomonas  aeruginosa, bacillus sp., rhodobacter sp., flavobacterium sp., and mycobacterium  sp.) competing for bacterial colonization on the swro membrane surfaces, it was exhibited that bacillus sp. was the most dominant. the dominant influences ofpseudomonas sp. and bacillus sp. on biofouling during actual swro is decisive depending on higher removal efficiency of the seawater pretreatment.

TI  == paraben resistance in bacteria from sewage treatment plant effluents in india.
AB  == parabens, the antimicrobial preservatives used in cosmetics, food and pharmaceuticals, are often detected in the aquatic environment. generally, sewage treatment plants (stps) receive community sewage containing parabens, which are ultimately released into streams/rivers. in this study, bacteria in stp effluents were evaluated for their resistance to parabens. the susceptibility was in the order of staphylococcus aureus > bacillus sp. >escherichia coli > pseudomonas aeruginosa. gram-negative bacteria showed less susceptibility than their control  and gram-positive bacteria. further, the bacteria were more sensitive towards butyl and ethyl parabens. interestingly, the strains showed resistance to >/=5 mg of parabens, which is equivalent to or higher than reported environmental concentrations. the increase in paraben chain length did not enhance the susceptibility in all cases and it was understood that the activity may differ for each bacterium in the environment. this is the first profile on paraben resistance in common pathogens of indian stps. paraben resistance may be developed due to continuous exposure even at sub-inhibitory and/or chronic levels in the environment and this resistance may be transferred to other pathogenic bacteria in receiving waters. thus the study demonstrates the effectiveness of the disc diffusion method in environmental bacterial resistance assessment and addresses the risk involved in the use of parabens.

TI  == phylogenetic diversity and antimicrobial activity of marine bacteria associated with the soft coral sarcophyton glaucum.
AB  == coral reefs are the most biodiverse and biologically productive of all marine ecosystems. corals harbor diverse and abundant prokaryotic groups. however, little is known about the diversity of coral-associated microorganisms. we used molecular techniques to identify and compare the culturable bacterial assemblages associated with the soft coral sarcophyton glaucum from the red sea. different media were utilized for microbial isolation, and the phylogeny of the culturable  bacteria associated with the coral was analyzed based on 16s rdna sequencing. the coral associated bacteria were found to be representatives within the gammaproteobacteria, actinobacteria, and firmicutes. antimicrobial activities of  twenty bacterial isolates were tested against four pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumonia, pseudomonas aeruginosa, vibrio fluvialis) and three fungi (penicillium sp., aspergillus niger, candida albicans). a relatively high proportion of bacterial strains displayed distinct antibacterial and antifungal activities, suggesting that soft coral-associated microorganisms may aid their host in protection against marine pathogens. members of genera bacillus and pseudomonas had the highest proportion of antimicrobial activity which supported the hypothesis that they might play a protective role in the coral hosts.

AB  == the cell free culture filtrate of bacillus cereus associated with an entomopathogenic nematode, rhabditis (oscheius) sp. exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain four bioactive compounds. the structure and absolute stereochemistry of these compounds were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1)h  nmr, (13)c nmr, (1)h-(1)h cosy, (1)h-(13)c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclic dipeptides (cdps): cyclo(l-pro-l-trp), cyclo(l-leu-l-val), cyclo(d-pro-d-met), and cyclo(d-pro-d-phe), respectively. compounds recorded significant antibacterial activity against all the test bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin-resistant s. aureus) except cyclo(l-leu-l-val). cyclo(l-leu-l-val) recorded activity only against gram positive bacteria. best antibacterial activity was recorded by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against s. aureus (4 mug/ml). the four compounds were active against all the five fungi tested (trichophyton rubrum, aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, candida tropicalis and cryptococcus neoformans) and the activity was compared with amphotericin b, the standard fungicide. the highest activity of 1 mug/ml by cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) was recorded against t. rubrum, a human pathogen responsible for causing athlete's foot, jock itch, and ringworm. the activity of cyclo(l-pro-l-trp) against t. rubrum, c. neoformans and c. albicans were better than amphotericin b, the standard antifungal agent. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal activity of cdps against the human pathogenic fungi t. rubrum and c. neoformans. the four cdps are nontoxic to healthy human cell line up to 200 mug/ml. we conclude that the bacterium associated with entomopathogenic nematode is promising sources of natural antimicrobial secondary metabolites, which may receive greater benefit as potential sources of new drugs in the pharmaceutical industry.

TI  == changing profile of organisms causing scleral buckle infections: a clinico-microbiological case series.
AB  == purpose: to study the microbiological spectrum and in vitro susceptibility of bacterial isolates from explanted scleral buckles and to correlate clinical presentation to the causative agent. method: medical records of patients who underwent buckle explantation from july 2007 to may 2012 were reviewed retrospectively. clinical features and microbiological profile were noted and correlated. results: twenty of 24 buckles (83.33%) from 24 patients grew 21 isolates. isolates included 6 acid-fast bacilli (28.57%; atypical mycobacteria =  5, nocardia asteroides = 1), 5 gram-positive bacilli (23.8%; corynebacterium spp. = 4, bacillus sp. = 1), 4 gram-positive cocci (19.0%; staphylococcus spp. = 4), 2 gram-negative bacilli (9.5%; pseudomonas aeruginosa = 2), and 4 fungi (19.0%; aspergillus spp. = 3, paecilomyces sp. = 1). acid-fast bacilli and gram-negative  bacilli were sensitive to amikacin and gram-positive bacilli and gram-positive cocci to vancomycin. buckle exposure within 2 years of primary surgery tended to  be noninfective (p = 0.06). fungal or mycobacterial infections were more symptomatic than those with corynebacterium species. results of microscopic examination of conjunctival swab in 5 of 7 eyes (71.4%) were consistent with culture of conjunctival swab and explanted buckles. conclusion: clinical features and microscopic examination of conjunctival swab may give a lead toward the causative organism in suspected buckle infections. based on these leads, vancomycin and amikacin may be used as the initial empirical therapy.

TI  == antibacterial and antifungal activities of crude plant extracts from colombian biodiversity.
AB  == on a global scale, people have used plants to treat diseases and infections, and  this has raised interest on the plant biodiversity potencial in the search of antimicrobial principles. in this work, 75 crude n-hexanes, dichloromethane and methanol extracts from the aerial parts of 25 plants belonging to four botanical  families (asteraceae, euphorbiaceae, rubiaceae and solanaceae), collected at the  natural regional park ucumari (risaralda, colombia), were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities by the agar well diffusion method. the antibacterial activities were assayed against two gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and bacillus subtilis, and three gram-negative ones named,  klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. in addition,  the same plant extracts were tested against the yeast candida albicans and the fungi aspergillus fumigatus and fusarium solani. overall, the plant extracts examined displayed better bactericide rather than fungicide activities. in general, the best antibacterial activity was showed by the plant extracts from the rubiaceae family, followed in order by the extracts from the euphorbiaceae and solanaceae ones. it is important to emphasize the great activity displayed by the methanol extract of alchornea coelophylla (euphorbiaceae) that inhibited four out of five bacteria tested (b. subtilis, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus and e. coli).  furthermore, the best minimal inhibitory concentration for the extracts with antifungal activities were displayed by the dichloromethane extracts from acalypha diversifolia and euphorbia sp (euphorbiaceae). the most susceptible fungus evaluated was f. solani since 60% and 20% of the dichloromethane and methanol extracts evaluated inhibited the growth of this phytopathogenic fungus.  the antimicrobial activity of the different plant extracts examined in this work  could be related to the secondary metabolites contents and their interaction and  susceptibility of pathogenic microorganism evaluated.

TI  == association with soil bacteria enhances p38-dependent infection resistance in caenorhabditis elegans.
AB  == the importance of our inner microbial communities for proper immune responses against invading pathogens is now well accepted, but the mechanisms underlying this protection are largely unknown. in this study, we used caenorhabditis elegans to investigate such mechanisms. since very little is known about the microbes interacting with c. elegans in its natural environment, we began by taking the first steps to characterize the c. elegans microbiota. we established  a natural-like environment in which initially germfree, wild-type larvae were grown on enriched soil. bacterial members of the adult c. elegans microbiota were isolated by culture and identified using 16s rrna gene sequencing. using pure cultures of bacterial isolates as food, we identified two, bacillus megaterium and pseudomonas mendocina, that enhanced resistance to a subsequent infection with the gram-negative pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. whereas protection by b.  megaterium was linked to impaired egg laying, corresponding to a known trade-off  between fecundity and resistance, the mechanism underlying protection conferred by p. mendocina depended on weak induction of immune genes regulated by the p38 mapk pathway. disruption of the p38 ortholog, pmk-1, abolished protection. p. mendocina enhanced resistance to p. aeruginosa but not to the gram-positive pathogen enterococcus faecalis. furthermore, protection from p. aeruginosa was similarly induced by a p. aeruginosa gaca mutant with attenuated virulence but not by a different c. elegans-associated pseudomonas sp. isolate. our results support a pivotal role for the conserved p38 pathway in microbiota-initiated immune protection and suggest that similarity between microbiota members and pathogens may play a role in such protection.

TI  == [role of polymer complexes in the formation of biofilms by corrosive bacteria on  steel surfaces].
AB  == the composition of exopolymer complexes (epcs), synthesized by the monocultures desulfovibrio sp. 10, bacillus subtilis 36, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 27 and by  microbial associations involved in the corrosion of metal surfaces has been studied. an analysis of the monosaccharide composition of carbohydrate components, as well as the fatty acid composition of the lipid part of epcs, was  carried out by gas-liquid chromatography (glc). it was found that bacteria in biofilms synthesized polymers; this process was dominated by glucose, while the growth of bacteria in a suspension was marked by a high rhamnose content. hexouronic acids and hexosamine have been revealed as a part of b. subtilis 36 and p. aeruginosa 27 epcs. qualitative differences were revealed in the fatty acid composition ofexopolymers in biofilms and in a bacterial suspension. it was  shown that the transition to a biofilm form of growth led to an increase in the unsaturation degree of fatty acids in the exopolymers of associative cultures. the results can be used to develop methods to control microbial corrosion of metal surfaces.

TI  == evaluation of guar gum derivatives as gelling agents for microbial culture media.
AB  == guar gum, a galactomannan, has been reported to be an inexpensive substitute of agar for microbial culture media. however, its use is restricted probably because of (1) its highly viscous nature even at high temperatures, making dispensing of  the media to petri plates difficult and (2) lesser clarity of the guar gum gelled media than agar media due to impurities present in guar gum. to overcome these problems, three guar gum derivatives, carboxymethyl guar, carboxymethyl hydroxypropyl guar and hydroxypropyl guar, were tested as gelling agents for microbial growth and differentiation. these were also evaluated for their suitability for other routine microbiological methods, such as, enumeration, use  of selective and differential media, and antibiotic sensitivity test. for evaluation purpose, growth and differentiation of eight fungi and eight bacteria  grown on the media gelled with agar (1.5%), guar gum (4%) or one of the guar gum  derivatives (4%), were compared. all fungi and bacteria exhibited normal growth and differentiation on all these media. generally, growth of most of the fungi was better on guar gum derivatives gelled medium than on agar medium. the enumeration carried out for serratia sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa by serial dilution and pour plate method yielded similar counts in all the treatments. likewise, the selective succinate medium, specific for p. aeruginosa, did not allow growth of co-inoculated bacillus sp. even if gelled with guar gum derivatives. the differential medium, congo red mannitol agar could not differentiate between agrobacterium tumefaciens and rhizobium meliloti on color basis, if gelled with guar gum or any of its derivatives however, for antibiotic  sensitivity tests for both gram-positive and -negative bacteria, guar gum and its derivatives were as effective as agar.

TI  == identification of antimicrobial compound, diketopiperazines, from a bacillus sp.  n strain associated with a rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode against major plant pathogenic fungi.
AB  == aims: to purify and characterize antimicrobial compounds from bacillus sp. strain n associated with rhabditid entomopathogenic nematode (epn). methods and results: the cell-free culture filtrate of a bacterium associated with an epn, rhabditis (oscheius) sp., exhibited strong antimicrobial activity. the ethyl acetate extract of the bacterial culture filtrate was purified by silica gel column chromatography to obtain three diketopiperazines (dkps). the structure and absolute stereochemistry of this compound were determined based on extensive spectroscopic analyses (fabms, (1) h nmr, (13) c nmr, (1) h-(1) h cosy, (1) h-(13) c hmbc) and marfey's method. the compounds were identified as cyclo(l-pro-l-leu), cyclo(d-pro-l-leu) and cyclo(d-pro-l-tyr), respectively. three dkps were active against all the five fungi tested (aspergillus flavus, candida albicans, fusarium oxysporum, rhizoctonia solani and penicillium expansum) and are more effective than the standard fungicide bavistin. the highest activity of 4 mug ml(-1) by cyclo(l-pro-l-leu) and cyclo(d-pro-l-tyr) was recorded against p. expansum, a plant pathogen responsible for causing postharvest decay of stored apples and oranges. cyclo(d-pro-l-leu) recorded good  antibacterial activity against all the four bacteria tested (bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and cyclo(l-pro-l-leu) and cyclo(d-pro-l-tyr) recorded good activity only against gram-positive bacteria. to our knowledge, this is the first report of antifungal  activity of the dkps against the plant pathogenic fungi f. oxysporum, r. solani and p. expansum. the production of cyclo(l-pro-l-leu), cyclo(d-pro-l-leu) and cyclo-(d-pro-l-tyr) by a bacterium associated with epn is also reported here for  the first time. conclusions: isolated dkps demonstrated high antimicrobial activity against bacteria and fungi, especially against plant pathogenic fungi. we conclude that the bacterium associated with epn is a promising source of natural bioactive secondary metabolites which may receive great benefit in the field of agriculture. significance and impact of the study: this study is a significant contribution to the knowledge of compounds unique from epn bacteria as potential sources of new drugs in the agricultural and pharmacological industry.

TI  == siderophore-producing bacteria from a sand dune ecosystem and the effect of sodium benzoate on siderophore production by a potential isolate.
AB  == bioremediation in natural ecosystems is dependent upon the availability of micronutrients and cofactors, of which iron is one of the essential elements. under aerobic and alkaline conditions, iron oxidizes to fe(+3) creating iron deficiency. to acquire this essential growth-limiting nutrient, bacteria produce  low-molecular-weight, high-affinity iron chelators termed siderophores. in this study, siderophore-producing bacteria from rhizosphere and nonrhizosphere areas of coastal sand dunes were isolated using a culture-dependent approach and were assigned to 8 different genera with the predominance of bacillus sp. studies on the ability of these isolates to grow on sodium benzoate revealed that a pigmented bacterial culture tmr2.13 identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa showed growth on mineral salts medium (msm) with 2% of sodium benzoate and produced a yellowish fluorescent siderophore identified as pyoverdine. this was inhibited above 54 mum of added iron in msm with glucose without affecting growth, while, in presence of sodium benzoate, siderophore was produced even up to the presence  of 108 mum of added iron. increase in the requirement of iron for metabolism of aromatic compounds in ecosystems where the nutrient deficiencies occur naturally  would be one of the regulating factors for the bioremediation process.

TI  == mass spectral molecular networking of living microbial colonies.
AB  == integrating the governing chemistry with the genomics and phenotypes of microbial colonies has been a "holy grail" in microbiology. this work describes a highly sensitive, broadly applicable, and cost-effective approach that allows metabolic  profiling of live microbial colonies directly from a petri dish without any sample preparation. nanospray desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ms), combined with alignment of ms data and molecular networking, enabled monitoring of metabolite production from live microbial colonies from diverse bacterial genera, including bacillus subtilis, streptomyces coelicolor, mycobacterium smegmatis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. this work demonstrates that, by using these tools to visualize small molecular changes within bacterial interactions, insights can be gained into bacterial developmental processes as a  result of the improved organization of ms/ms data. to validate this experimental  platform, metabolic profiling was performed on pseudomonas sp. sh-c52, which protects sugar beet plants from infections by specific soil-borne fungi [r. mendes et al. (2011) science 332:1097-1100]. the antifungal effect of strain sh-c52 was attributed to thanamycin, a predicted lipopeptide encoded by a nonribosomal peptide synthetase gene cluster. our technology, in combination with our recently developed peptidogenomics strategy, enabled the detection and partial characterization of thanamycin and showed that it is a monochlorinated lipopeptide that belongs to the syringomycin family of antifungal agents. in conclusion, the platform presented here provides a significant advancement in our ability to understand the spatiotemporal dynamics of metabolite production in live microbial colonies and communities.

TI  == isolation of a bacteriocin-producing lactococcus lactis and application of its bacteriocin to manage spoilage bacteria in high-value marine fish under different storage temperatures.
AB  == the bacteriocins of lactic acid bacteria have considerable potential for biopreservation. the lactococcus lactis strain psy2 (genbank account no. jf703669) isolated from the surface of marine perch perca flavescens produced antibacterial activity against pathogenic and spoilage-causing gram-positive and  gram-negative bacteria viz. arthrobacter sp., acinetobacter sp., bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus and possessed broad inhibitory spectrum. the biopreservative efficacy of the bacteriocin psy2 was evaluated using fillets of reef cod, epinephelus diacanthus. the fillets (10 g) were sprayed with 2.0 ml of  1,600 au/ml bacteriocin, wrapped and kept under different storage temperatures viz., 4, 0 and -18 degrees c. the biopreservative extended the shelf-life of fillets stored at 4 degrees c to >21 days as against <14 days observed in the untreated samples. the total count of spoilage bacteria was reduced by 2.5 logarithmic units in the treated sample during the 14th day of storage as against the control. chemical analysis revealed a significant change (p < 0.05) in the ph value, free fatty acid (as % oleic acid), total volatile base nitrogen and total  methyl amine content in the treated samples. the overall acceptability in terms of sensory attributes was significantly higher in the bacteriocin-treated samples stored for 21 days at 4 degrees c while the untreated samples became unacceptable by the 14th day. the biopreservative gave no significant effect at -18 degrees c. thus, the bacteriocin derived from l. lactis psy2 gave increased protection against spoilage bacteria and offers an alternative for the preservation of high-value sea foods.

TI  == iodine from bacterial iodide oxidization by roseovarius spp. inhibits the growth  of other bacteria.
AB  == microbial activities in brine, seawater, or estuarine mud are involved in iodine  cycle. to investigate the effects of the microbiologically induced iodine on other bacteria in the environment, a total of 13 bacteria that potentially participated in the iodide-oxidizing process were isolated from water or biofilm  at a location containing 131 mug ml(-1) iodide. three distinct strains were further identified as roseovarius spp. based on 16 s rrna gene sequences after being distinguished by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. morphological characteristics of these three roseovarius spp. varied considerably across and within strains. iodine production increased with roseovarius spp. growth when cultured in marine broth with 200 mug ml(-1) iodide (i(-)). when 10(6) cfu/ml escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus pumilus were  exposed to various concentrations of molecular iodine (i(2)), the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were 0.5, 1.0, and 1.0 mug ml(-1), respectively. however, fivefold increases in the mics for roseovarius spp. were obtained. in co-cultured roseovarius sp. iob-7 and e. coli in marine broth containing iodide (i(-)), the molecular iodine concentration was estimated to be 0.76 mug ml(-1) after 24 h and less than 50 % of e. coli was viable compared to that co-cultured  without iodide. the growth inhibition of e. coli was also observed in co-cultures with the two other roseovarius spp. strains when the molecular iodine concentration was assumed to be 0.52 mug ml(-1).

TI  == removal of high concentrations of nh(3) by a combined photoreactor and biotrickling filter system.
AB  == average emission levels as high as 800 ppm(v) nh(3) have often been found during  the anaerobic fermentation process. at these levels, nh(3) is regarded as an environmental toxic compound. high concentrations of nh(3) gas are difficult to treat in a single treatment process, suggesting that, in terms of economic cost and treatment performance, a coupled system may be a feasible technological alternative. in the coupled tio(2) photocatalytic-biological treatment system evaluated here, the optimal gas retention time for nh(3) removal--in terms of removal efficiency and capital cost--was 26 s. high gas temperatures, high nh(3)  concentrations, and low oxygen contents were unfavorable conditions for nh(3) removal by the photoreactor. the coupled system successfully removed concentrated nh(3) gas (r % > 97 %) under disrupted and shutdown conditions. the photoreactor  component of the system successfully fulfilled its role as a pretreatment process and enhanced the performance of the biotrickling filter at a high inlet nh(3) load (2,277 g-n m(-3) day(-1)). potential ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, including bacillus cereus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas sp., were isolated  under the high inlet nh(3) load condition. these microbial strains have a potential as biological agents in the removal of high concentrations of nh(3) in  waste gas or wastewater.

AB  == the effect of crude oil on the growth of legumes (calopogonium muconoides and centrosema pubescens) and fate of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in wetland ultisol was investigated using standard cultural techniques. the results revealed observable  effects of oil on soil physico-chemistry, plant growth and nodulation as well as  on densities of heterotrophic, hydrocarbonoclastic and nitrogen fixing bacteria.  the effects however varied with different levels (0.5%, 1%, 5%, 10%, 15% and 20%) of pollution. ammonium and nitrate levels were high in the unpolluted soil but decreased with increase in pollution levels. nitrite was not detected in contaminated soil probably due to the reduction in numbers of nitrogen fixers, from 5.26 +/- 0.23 x l0(6)cfu/g in unpolluted soil to 9.0 +/- 0.12 x 10(5) and 2.2 +/- 0.08 x l0(5) cfu/g in soils with 5% and 20% levels of pollution respectively. the contaminated soil also exhibited gross reduction in the nodulation of legumes. a range of 13-57 nodules was observed in legumes from polluted soil against 476 nodules recorded for plants cultured on unpolluted soil. the heterogeneity of the microbial loads between oil-polluted and unpolluted soil were statistically significant (p < 0.05, anova). positive significant relationships were observed between the levels of hydrocarbons and the densities of heterotrophic bacteria (r = 0.91) and that of hydrocarbon utilizing bacteria (r = 0.86). on the other hand, relationships between the densities of nitrogen fixing bacteria and total hydrocarbons content was negative (r = -0.30) while positive relationships were recorded between the densities of different microbial groups and treatment periods except at 15% and 20% pollution  levels. the lsd tests revealed highly significant differences (p < 0.001) in the  physiological groups of soil microorganisms at all levels of pollution. the results imply that crude oil seriously affects rhizosphere microbial growth in legumes. among the bacterial species isolated, clostridium pasteurianum, bacillus polymyxa and pseudomonas aeruginosa exhibited greater ability to degrade hydrocarbons than azotobacter sp, klebsiella pneumoniae and derxia gummusa while  nitrosomonas and nitrobacter had the least degradability. a continuous monitoring of the environment is advocated to prevent extinction of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and total loss of soil fertility attributable to petroleum hydrocarbon contamination in the niger delta ultisol.

TI  == antipathogenic potential of marine bacillus sp. ss4 on n-acyl-homoserine-lactone-mediated virulence factors production in pseudomonas aeruginosa (pao1).
AB  == antipathogenic therapy is an outcome of the quorum-sensing inhibition (qsi) mechanism, which targets autoinducer-dependent virulent gene expression in bacterial pathogens. n-acyl homoserine lactone (ahl) acts as a key regulator in the production of virulence factors and biofilm formation in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 and violacein pigment production in chromobacterium violaceum. in the present study, the marine bacterial strain ss4 showed potential qsi activity  in a concentration-dependent manner (0.5-2 mg/ml) against the ahl-mediated violacein production in c. violaceum (33-86%) and biofilm formation (33-88%), total protease (20-65%), lasa protease (59-68%), lasb elastase (36-68%), pyocyanin (17-86%) and pyoverdin productions in pao1. the light and confocal laser scanning microscopic analyses confirmed the reduction of the biofilm-forming ability of pao1 when treated with ss4 extract. furthermore, the antibiofilm potential was confirmed through static biofilm ring assay, in which ethyl acetate extract of ss4 showed concentration-dependent reduction in the biofilm-forming ability of pao1. thus, the result of this study clearly reveals the antipathogenic and antibiofilm properties of the bacterial isolate ss4. through 16s rdna analysis, the strain ss4 was identified as bacillus sp. (genbank accession number: gu471751).

TI  == isolation, characterization and phylogeny of sponge-associated bacteria with antimicrobial activities from brazil.
AB  == bacteria associated with marine sponges represent a rich source of bioactive metabolites. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize bacteria with  antimicrobial activities from brazilian sponges. a total of 158 colony-forming units were isolated from nine sponge species. among these, 12 isolates presented  antimicrobial activities against pathogenic bacteria. based on comparative sequence analysis of their 16s rrna genes, the sponge-associated bacterial strains could be subdivided into three phylogenetically different clusters. five  strains were affiliated with firmicutes (genera bacillus and virgibacillus), three with alpha-proteobacteria (pseudovibrio sp.) and four with gamma-proteobacteria (genera pseudomonas and stenotrophomonas). the sponge-associated bacterial strains pseudomonas fluorescens h40 and h41 and pseudomonas aeruginosa h51 exhibited antimicrobial activity against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including strains such as vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium and multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae. bacillus pumilus pc31 and pc32, pseudovibrio ascidiaceicola pm31 and  ca31 and pseudovibrio denitrificans mm37 strains were more effective against gram-positive bacteria. these findings suggest that the identified strains may contribute to the search for new sources of antimicrobial substances, an important strategy for developing alternative therapies to treat infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == antibiofilm activity of the marine bacterium pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3j6.
AB  == biofilm formation results in medical threats or economic losses and is therefore  a major concern in a variety of domains. in two-species biofilms of marine bacteria grown under dynamic conditions, pseudoalteromonas sp. strain 3j6 formed  mixed biofilms with bacillus sp. strain 4j6 but was largely predominant over paracoccus sp. strain 4m6 and vibrio sp. strain d01. the supernatant of pseudoalteromonas sp. 3j6 liquid culture (sn(3j6)) was devoid of antibacterial activity against free-living paracoccus sp. 4m6 and vibrio sp. d01 cells, but it  impaired their ability to grow as single-species biofilms and led to higher percentages of nonviable cells in 48-h biofilms. antibiofilm molecules of sn(3j6) were able to coat the glass surfaces used to grow biofilms and reduced bacterial  attachment about 2-fold, which might partly explain the biofilm formation defect  but not the loss of cell viability. sn(3j6) had a wide spectrum of activity since it affected all gram-negative marine strains tested except other pseudoalteromonas strains. biofilm biovolumes of the sensitive strains were reduced 3- to 530-fold, and the percentages of nonviable cells were increased 3-  to 225-fold. interestingly, sn(3j6) also impaired biofilm formation by three strains belonging to the human-pathogenic species pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli. such an antibiofilm activity is original and opens up a variety of applications for pseudoalteromonas sp. 3j6 and/or its active exoproducts in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == lyngbyazothrins a-d, antimicrobial cyclic undecapeptides from the cultured cyanobacterium lyngbya sp.
AB  == four novel cyclic undecapeptides, lyngbyazothrins a (1), b (2), c (3), and d (4), were isolated from the cultured lyngbya sp. 36.91 as binary mixtures (1/2 and 3/4). their structures were elucidated by analysis of 1d (1h and 13c) and 2d (cosy, tocsy, roesy, noesy, hmqc, and hmbc) nmr spectra, esimsms, esitofms, and amino acid analyses. three unusual amino acids were present and identified as 4-methoxyhomophenylalanine in 1 and 3, homophenylalanine in 2 and 4, and 3-amino-2,5,7,8-tetrahydroxy-10-methylundecanoic acid (aound) in all compounds, while 3 and 4 have an additional n-acetyl-n-methyltyrosine unit. the mixture of lyngbyazothrins a (1) and b (2) shows only low antimicrobial activity against micrococcus flavus, whereas the mixture of lyngbyazothrins c (3) and d (4) was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. it seems that the acyl residue at c-5 of the aound unit plays an important role in antimicrobial activity.

TI  == new thioureides of 2-(4-methylphenoxymethyl) benzoic acid with antimicrobial activity.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate in vitro, by means of qualitative and quantative methods, the antimicrobial activity of some new synthesized chemical compounds previously solubilized in dmf (dimethyl formamide). the qualitative screening of the susceptibility spectra of different microbial strains versus these compounds was performed by three adaptated diffusion methods: paper filter  disk impregnation with the tested substances solutions, the disposal of tested solutions in agar wells and the spotting of tested solutions on solid medium previously inoculated with microbial suspension. the quantitative assay of the antimicrobial activity was performed by broth microdilution method in 96-well microplates in order to establish the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic).the  antimicrobial activity was tested against gram-positive strains (staphylococcus)  aureus sp., bacillus subtilis sp.), gram-negative (escherichia coli sp, pseudomonas aeruginosa sp., klebsiella pneumonia sp.) and fungal strains (candida albicans sp, aspergillus nige rsp.). all tests were performed by comparison with  the reference strains: k. pneumoniae ic 13420, e. coli ic 13529, s. aureus ic 13204, p. aeruginosa ic 13202, b. subtilis ic 12488, c. albicans ic 249, a. niger ic 13534. our results indicated that the tested compounds exhibited specific antimicrobial activity, the highest activity being noticed against planktonic fungal cells (mic ranging from 62.5 microg to 15.6 microg), followed by p. aeruginosa (mics from 250 microg to 31.5 microg). only few compounds exhibited antimicrobial activity against e. coli and k. pneumoniae. antimicrobial activity  against gram positive bacteria was noticed for the most of the tested compounds,  five of them exhibiting very low mic values (mics from 1000 microg to 62.5 microg).

TI  == tetracycline and chloramphenicol efficiency against selected biofilm forming bacteria.
AB  == despite the constantly increasing need for new antimicrobial agents, antibiotic drug discovery and development seem to have greatly decelerated in recent years.  presented with the significant problem of advancing antimicrobial resistance, the global scientific community has attempted to find alternative solutions; one of the most promising ones is the evaluation and use of old antibiotic compounds. a  number of old antibiotic compounds, such as aminoglycosides, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline, are re-emerging as valuable alternatives for the treatment of difficult-to-treat infections. this study examined the in vitro potency for biofilm formation of five isolates (klebsiella sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, achromobacter sp., klebsiella pneumoniae, and bacillus pumilis) and the effects of antibiotics on these biofilms. furthermore the quantitative analysis of planktonic, loosely attached cells, and their susceptibility to antibiotics was also determined. twitching motility was observed to determine any effect in the biofilm forming capability of the isolates. all the isolates tested were efficient biofilm-forming strains in the polypropylene and borosilicate test tubes. standard bacterial enumeration technique and cv staining produced equivalent results both in biofilm and planktonic assays. the biofilm formation of all the strains was affected in the presence of tetracycline or chloramphenicol. highly significant decrease (p < 0.01) in biofilm formation was  observed by treatment with chloramphenicol compared to tetracycline. in addition, the two antibiotics also affected adversely the planktonic and loosely attached cells of all isolates. thus, testing the effects of older antibiotics on biofilms may supply useful information in addition to standard in vitro testing, particularly in diseases where biofilm formation is involved in the pathogenesis.

TI  == earthquakes promote bacterial genetic exchange in serpentinite crevices.
AB  == we report the results of our efforts to study the effects of seismic shaking on simulated biofilms within serpentinite fissures. a colloidal solution consisting  of recipient bacterial cells (pseudomonas sp. or bacillus subtilis), donor plasmid dna encoded for antibiotic resistance, and chrysotile (an acicular clay mineral that forms in crevices of serpentinite layers) were placed onto an elastic body made from gellan gum, which acted as the biofilm matrix. silica beads, as rock analogues (i.e., chemically inert mechanical serpentinite), were placed on the gellan surface, which was coated with the colloidal solution. a rolling vibration similar to vibrations generated by earthquakes was applied, and the silica beads moved randomly across the surface of the gellan. this resulted in the recipient cells' acquiring plasmid dna and thus becoming genetically transformed to demonstrate marked antibiotic resistance. neither pseudomonas sp.  nor b. subtilis were transformed by plasmid dna when chrysotile was substituted for by kaolinite or bentonite in the colloidal solution. tough gellan (1.0%) promoted the introduction of plasmid dna into pseudomonas sp., but soft gellan (0.3%) had no such effect. genetic transformation of bacteria on the surface of gellan by exposure to exogenous plasmid dna required seismic shaking and exposure to the acicular clay mineral chrysotile. these experimental results suggest that  bacterial genetic exchange readily occurs when biofilms that form in crevices of  serpentinite are exposed to seismic shaking. seismic activity may be a key factor in bacterial evolution along with the formation of biofilms within crevices of serpentinite.

TI  == biodegradation of mixed pesticides by mixed pesticide enriched cultures.
AB  == this paper discusses the degradation kinetics of mixed (lindane, methyl parathion and carbofuran) pesticides by mixed pesticide enriched cultures (mec) under various environmental conditions. the bacterial strains isolated from the mixed microbial consortium were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (mtcc 9236), bacillus sp. (mtcc 9235) and chryseobacterium joostei (mtcc 9237). batch studies  were conducted to estimate the biokinetic parameters like the maximum specific growth rate (mu(max)), yield coefficient (y(t)), half saturation concentration (k(s)) and inhibition concentration (ki) for individual and mixed pesticide enriched cultures. the cultures enriched in a particular pollutant always showed  high growth rate and low inhibition in that particular pollutant compared to mec. after seven weeks of incubation, mixed pesticide enriched cultures were able to degrade 72% lindane, 95% carbofuran and 100% of methyl parathion in facultative co-metabolic conditions. in aerobic systems, degradation efficiencies of lindane  methyl parathion and carbofuran were increased by the addition of 2g l(- 1) of dextrose. though many metabolic compounds of mixed pesticides were observed at different time intervals, none of the metabolites were persistent. based on the observed metabolites, a degradation pathway was postulated for different pesticides under various environmental conditions.

TI  == growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii grazing on different  bacteria.
AB  == free-living amoebae of the genus acanthamoeba are widely distributed in soil and  water collections, where trophozoites (vegetative, multiplicative stages) feed mainly by phagocytosis and thus control bacterial populations in the environment. here, we examined the growth, encystment and survival of acanthamoeba castellanii receiving different bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, bacillus subtilis, bacillus megaterium, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus) in nonnutrient saline. all bacteria assayed induced a  dose-dependent proliferative response, in most cases maximized with a bacterial dose of 1 x 10(9) ml(-1); except for m. luteus, trophozoites grew better with viable than with heat-killed bacteria. in addition, acanthamoeba growth was improved by adding bacteria on alternate days. single-dose experiments indicated  a temporal association between the growth of trophozoite and bacterial consumption, and higher consumption of m. luteus, e. coli and p. aeruginosa, bacterial species that allowed the highest trophozoite yields. long-term acanthamoeba-bacteria incubation revealed that encystment was significantly delayed by almost all the bacteria assayed (including s. aureus, which elicited a poor growth response) and that the presence of bacteria markedly increased cyst yield; final cyst recovery clearly depended on both the dose and the type of the  bacterium given, being much higher with e. coli, m. luteus and p. aeruginosa.

TI  == proteolytic activity in stored aerobic granular sludge and structural integrity.
AB  == aerobic granules lose stability during storage. the goal of this work was to highlight the main cause of stability loss for stored granules as intracellular protein hydrolysis. the quantity of extracellular proteins was noted to be significantly lower during granule storage, and protease enzyme activities were correspondingly higher in the cores of stored granules. the proteolytic bacteria, which secrete highly active protease enzymes, were for the first time isolated and characterized by analyzing 16s rdna sequences. the proteolytic bacteria belonged to the genera pseudomonas, raoultella, acinetobacter, pandoraea, klebsiella, bacillus and uncultured bacterium, and were grouped into proteobacteria, enterobacteria and firmicutes. the pb1 (pseudomonas aeruginosa) strain, which exhibited very high proteolytic activity during the skim milk agar  test, was located at the core regime with active protease enzymes, and was close  to the obligate anaerobic strain bacteroides sp. hence, the extracellular proteins in stored granules were proposed to be hydrolyzed by enzymes secreted by proteolytic bacteria with the hydrolyzed products ultimately being used by nearby anaerobic strains. this process gradually digests the protein core, and eventually consumes the entire granule.

TI  == detoxification of toxic heavy metals by marine bacteria highly resistant to mercury.
AB  == pollution in industrial areas is a serious environmental concern, and interest in bacterial resistance to heavy metals is of practical significance. mercury (hg),  cadmium (cd), and lead (pb) are known to cause damage to living organisms, including human beings. several marine bacteria highly resistant to mercury (bhrm) capable of growing at 25 ppm (mg l(-1)) or higher concentrations of mercury were tested during this study to evaluate their potential to detoxify cd  and pb. results indicate their potential of detoxification not only of hg, but also cd and pb. through biochemical and 16s rrna gene sequence analyses, these bacteria were identified to belong to alcaligenes faecalis (seven isolates), bacillus pumilus (three isolates), bacillus sp. (one isolate), pseudomonas aeruginosa (one isolate), and brevibacterium iodinium (one isolate). the mechanisms of heavy metal detoxification were through volatilization (for hg), putative entrapment in the extracellular polymeric substance (for hg, cd and pb)  as revealed by the scanning electron microscopy and energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and/or precipitation as sulfide (for pb). these bacteria removed more than 70% of cd and 98% of pb within 72 and 96 h, respectively, from growth medium that had initial metal concentrations of 100 ppm. their detoxification efficiency for hg, cd and pb indicates good potential for application in bioremediation of toxic heavy metals.

TI  == biodegradability of commercial and weathered diesel oils.
AB  == this work aimed to evaluate the capability of different microorganisms to degrade commercial diesel oil in comparison to a weathered diesel oil collected from the  groundwater at a petrol station. two microbiological methods were used for the biodegradability assessment: the technique based on the redox indicator 2,6 -dichlorophenol indophenol (dcpip) and soil respirometric experiments using biometer flasks. in the former we tested the bacterial cultures staphylococcus hominis, kocuria palustris, pseudomonas aeruginosa lbi, ochrobactrum anthropi and bacillus cereus, a commercial inoculum, consortia obtained from soil and groundwater contaminated with hydrocarbons and a consortium from an uncontaminated area. in the respirometric experiments it was evaluated the capability of the native microorganisms present in the soil from a petrol station to biodegrade the diesel oils. the redox indicator experiments showed that only the consortia, even that from an uncontaminated area, were able to biodegrade the weathered diesel. in 48 days, the removal of the total petroleum hydrocarbons (tph) in the respirometric experiments was approximately 2.5 times greater when the commercial diesel oil was used. this difference was caused by the consumption of labile hydrocarbons, present in greater quantities in the commercial diesel oil, as demonstrated by gas chromatographic analyses. thus, results indicate that biodegradability studies that do not consider the weathering effect of the pollutants may over estimate biodegradation rates and when the bioaugmentation is necessary, the best strategy would be that one based on injection of consortia, because even cultures with recognised capability of biodegrading hydrocarbons may fail when applied isolated.

AB  == some copper chelates have potent antitumour activity, and in some cases also the  free ligands have activity in vivo. yet, little is known about their antimicrobial properties. copper(ii) chelates of the thiosemicarbazones of a-n-heterocyclic carboxaldehydes constitute one important group of such agents, also their ligands having marked antitumour activity. both the ligands and chelates inhibit ribonucleotide reductase. some ligands have been or are under clinical trials as antineoplastic agents. i report here a study on the antimicrobial properties of the prototype compounds of this group, pyridine-2-carboxaldehyde thiosemicarbazone and its copper(ii) chelate. they were tested against nine microbes, including bacteria (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus lactis), yeasts (candida albicans and saccharomyces cerevisiae) and one mold (aspergillus niger). two clinical isolates of bacillus sp. and one reference strain were also studied. both the ligand and the chelate had marked activity. the ligand displayed considerable activity against all bacteria except  for s. lactis, and its activity against e. coli and p. aeruginosa was that high that practical applications might be considued. it was highly active against a. niger and moderately active against c. albicans. the chelate was highly active against s. epidermidis and s. cerevisiae. both compounds inhibited the clinical isolates markedly. since some related ligands have been or are in clinical trials on humans or are entering them, their route to clinical use, also as antimicrobials, might be much more straightforward than that of substances, whose toxicity in humans is wholly unexplored.

TI  == diversity of microflora in the gut and casts of tropical composting earthworms reared on different substrates.
AB  == the diversity of fungi, bacteria, yeast, actinomycetes and protozoa were analysed in the gut and casts of eudrilus eugeniae, lampito mauritii, eisenia fetida and perionyx excavatus, both qualitatively and quantitatively as influenced by different feed substrates like clay loam soil, cowdung and pressmud. while actinomycetes (streptomyces albus, s. somaliensis, nocardia asteroides, n. caviae and saccharomonosporia) were not digested by any of these species of worms, protozoa (amoeba proteus, a. terricola, paramecium trichium, euglena viridis, e.  orientalis, vorticella picta and trichomonas hominis) and yeast (candida tropicalis, c. krusei c. albicans and cryptococcus neoformans) were totally digested. certain species of fungi (saksenae vasiformis, mucor plumbeus, cladosporium carrionii, c. herbacium, alternaria sp., cunninghamella echinulata,  mycetia sterila, syncephalostrum racemosum, curvalaria lunata, c. geniculata and  geotrichum candidum) and bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacterium antitratum,  mima polymorpha, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, proteus vulgaris, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri, escherichia coli, staphylococus citreus, bacillus subtilis, b. cereus, enterococci and micrococci) were completely digested. certain other species were not digested fungi like aspergillus fumigatus, a. flavus, a. ochraceous, trichoderma koningii (except by eeugeniae), fusarium moniliforme (except by e. eugeniae) and rhizopus sp., and bacteria like klebsiella pneumoniae and morganella morganii) and these were multiplied during the transit of the organic residues through the gut of worms. the microbial proliferation was more in the casts, due to the environment prevailing--rich in nutrient supply and large surface area available for growth and reproduction of the microbes that lead to enhanced microbial activity and humic acid contents in  the casts.

TI  == streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov., a streptomycete with violet blue diffusible pigment isolated from soil in vietnam.
AB  == an actinomycete, designated strain gimv4.0001(t), was isolated from a forest soil sample in vietnam. it produced white aerial mycelium and violet-blue diffusible pigment on gause's synthetic agar. the substrate mycelium colour was not sensitive to ph. micoscopic observations revealed that strain gimv4.0001(t) produced long, straight chains of cylindrical spores, and chemotaxonomic data confirmed that it belongs to the genus streptomyces. melanin was produced, but no antibacterial activity was evident against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, candida albicans or penicillium citrinum. analysis of the 16s rrna gene sequence of strain gimv4.0001(t) revealed that the highest similarity (99.4 %) was to streptomyces bikiniensis atcc 11062(t). however, the dna-dna relatedness between strain gimv4.0001(t) and s. bikiniensis atcc 11062(t) was found to be 50.3 %. strain gimv4.0001(t) could also be differentiated from s. bikiniensis atcc 11062(t) and other streptomyces species showing high 16s rrna gene sequence similarity (98-99 %) based on morphological, physiological and biochemical characteristics. on the basis of its physiological and molecular properties, it is evident that strain gimv4.0001(t) represents a novel species of the genus streptomyces, for which the name streptomyces vietnamensis sp. nov. is  proposed. the type strain is gimv4.0001(t) (=cctcc m 205143(t)=iam 15340(t)).

TI  == a marine mesorhizobium sp. produces structurally novel long-chain n-acyl-l-homoserine lactones.
AB  == our study focused on a mesorhizobium sp. that is phylogenetically affiliated by 16s rrna gene sequence to other marine and saline bacteria of this genus. liquid  chromatography-mass spectrometry investigations of the extract obtained from solid-phase extraction of cultures of this bacterium indicated the presence of several n-acyl homoserine lactones (ahls), with chain lengths of c(10) to c(16).  chromatographic separation of the active bacterial extract yielded extraordinarily large amounts of two unprecedented acylated homoserine lactones,  5-cis-3-oxo-c(12)-homoserine lactone (5-cis-3-oxo-c(12)-hsl) (compound 1) and 5-cis-c(12)-hsl (compound 2). quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 was shown in two different biosensor systems [escherichia coli mt102(psb403) and pseudomonas putida f117(pkr-c12)]. furthermore, it was shown that both compounds  can restore protease and pyoverdin production of an ahl-deficient pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1 lasi rhli double mutant, suggesting that these signal molecules maybe used for intergenus signaling. in conclusion, these data indicate that the  quorum-sensing activity of compounds 1 and 2 is modulated by the chain length and functional groups of the acyl moiety. additionally, compound 1 showed antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.

AB  == vimelysin is a unique metalloproteinase from vibrio sp. t1800 exhibiting high activity at low temperature and high stability in organic solvents such as ethanol. a 1,821 bp open reading frame of the vimelysin gene encoded 607 amino acid residues consisting of an n-terminal pro-region, a mature enzyme, and a c-terminal pro-region. the mature enzyme region showed 80%, 57% and 35% sequence  identity with the mature forms of vibriolysin from v. vulnificus, pseudolysin from pseudomonas aeruginosa, and thermolysin from bacillus thermoproteolyticus, respectively. the catalytic residues and zinc-binding motifs of metalloproteinases are well conserved in vimelysin. the vimelysin gene was expressed in e. coli jm109 cells and the recombinant enzyme was purified as a 38-kda mature form from cell-free extracts. the purified recombinant enzyme is indistinguishable from the enzyme purified directly from vibrio. to obtain mutants exhibiting higher stability in organic solvents, random mutations were introduced by error-prone pcr and 600 transformants were screened. the n123d mutant exhibits two times higher stability in organic solvents than the wild-type enzyme. a plausible mechanism for the stability of the n123d mutant in organic solvents was discussed based on homology models of vimelysin and the n123d mutant.

AB  == a lectin isolated from the red alga solieria filiformis was evaluated for its effect on the growth of 8 gram-negative and 3 gram-positive bacteria cultivated in liquid medium (three independent experiments/bacterium). the lectin (500 microg/ml) stimulated the growth of the gram-positive species bacillus cereus and inhibited the growth of the gram-negative species serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus sp, and pseudomonas aeruginosa at 1000 microg/ml but the lectin (10-1000 microg/ml) had no effect on  the growth of the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus and b. subtilis, or on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. the purified lectin significantly reduced the cell density of gram-negative bacteria, although no changes in growth phases (log, exponential and of decline) were observed. it is possible that the interaction of s. filiformis lectin with the cell surface receptors of gram-negative bacteria promotes alterations in the flow of nutrients, which would explain the bacteriostatic effect. growth stimulation of the gram-positive bacterium b. cereus was more marked in the presence of the lectin at a concentration of 1000 microg/ml. the stimulation of the growth of b.  cereus was not observed when the lectin was previously incubated with mannan (125 microg/ml), its hapten. thus, we suggest the involvement of the binding site of the lectin in this effect. the present study reports the first data on the inhibition and stimulation of pathogenic bacterial cells by marine alga lectins.

(2004) j. biol. chem. 279, 13645]. here, the gene for an ahl lactonase from bacillus thuringiensis is cloned, and the protein is expressed, purified, and found to bind 2 equiv of zinc. the metal-bound form of ahl lactonase catalyzes the hydrolysis of n-hexanoyl-(s)-homoserine lactone but not the (r) enantiomer. removal of both zinc ions results in loss of activity, and reconstitution with zinc restores activity, indicating the importance of metal ions for catalytic activity. metal content, sequence alignments, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy of the zinc-containing lactonase all support a proposed dinuclear zinc binding site similar to that found in glyoxalase ii.

TI  == identification, cloning and expression of pseudomonas aeruginosa ps-x putative urate oxidase gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == in a previous study we reported for the first time the isolation and characterization ofurate oxidase enzyme from pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this work we isolated and cloned a 1.350 kilobase dna fragment that encode a putative urate oxidase gene from the genomic library of p. aeruginosa ps-x. the nucleotide sequence of the cloned dna insert revealed an open reading frame that encodes a protein of a molecular weight of 54.0 kda. the cloned dna fragment showed an uricolytic activity when expressed in e. coli dh5alpha. surprisingly, the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene showed more than 99% identity to the gene  encoding hypothetical protein of p. aeruginosa pao1. moreover, the sequence of the cloned gene was closely similar to the corresponding uricase gene of cellulomonas flavigena (44% similarity), but showed lower similarity values to that of bacillus sp. bt-90 (24% similarity), candida utilis (24% similarity). interestingly, the isolated uricase gene showed closer similarity to uricase from yeast-like symbiotic fungi beauveria bassiana (35%), tolypocladium inflatum (29%), paecilomyces tenuipes (27%) and cerataphis fransseni (24%).

AB  == the strain lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei bgbuk2-16. which was isolated from traditionally homemade white-pickled cheese, produces bacteriocin 217 (bac217; approximately 7 kda). the onset of bac217 biosynthesis was observed in the logarithmic phase of growth, and the production plateau was reached after 9 or 12 h of incubation at 37 and 30 degrees c, respectively, when culture entered  the early stationary phase. biochemical characterization showed that bac217 retained antimicrobial activity within the range of ph 3 to 12 or after treatment at 100 degrees c for 15 min. bac217 antimicrobial activity also remained unchanged after storage at 4 degrees c for 6 months or -20 degrees c for up to 12 months. however, bac217 activity was completely lost after treatment with different proteolytic enzymes. bgbuk2-16 contains only one plasmid about 80 kb in size. plasmid curing indicated that genes coding for bac217 synthesis and immunity seem to be located on this plasmid. bac217 exhibited antimicrobial activity against some pathogenic bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus and bacillus cereus. interestingly, bac217 showed activity against salmonella sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc27853. the inhibitory effect of bgbuk2-16 on the growth of s. aureus in mixed culture was observed. s. aureus treatment with bac217 led to a considerable decrease (cfu/ml) within a short period of time. the mode of bac217 action on s. aureus was identified as bactericidal. it should be noted that the strain bgbuk2-16 was shown to be resistant to bacteriocin nisin, which is otherwise widely used as a food additive for fermented dairy products.

TI  == effect of surfactants on solubilization and degradation of phenanthrene under thermophilic conditions.
AB  == the bioavailability and biodegradation of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (pahs) can be increased through the addition of surfactants. previous studies of this nature have been conducted under mesophilic conditions. hence, the aim of the present study was to investigate the effects of synthetic surfactants and biosurfactants on solubilization and degradation of phenanthrene (phe) in a series of batch solution experiments under thermophilic conditions. tween 80, triton x-100, and biosurfactants produced from pseudomonas aeruginosa strain p-cg3 (p-cg3) and pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 9027 (p. 9027) were used in this study. surfactants effectively enhanced the solubility of phe at 50 degrees c and the biosurfactant from p-cg3 was most effective with a 28-fold increase in apparent solubility of phe at a concentration of 10 x critical micelle concentration (cmc) compared with the controls. however, addition of synthetic surfactants or biosurfactants inhibited the biodegradation of phe in mineral salts medium by an isolate bacillus sp. b-um. degradation of phe diminished with  increasing surfactant concentrations, and phe degradation was completely inhibited for all the surfactants tested when the concentrations were greater than their respective cmc. the growth test suggested that tween 80 and biosurfactants were degradable, but preferential utilization of these surfactants as substrates was not the mechanism for explaining the inhibition of phe biodegradation. because of the hydrophobic property of b-um, degradation inhibition of phe by surfactants was probably due to the reduction of direct contact between bacterial cells and phe.

TI  == use of heterotrophic co2 assimilation as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile bacteria.
AB  == we have examined whether assimilation of co2 can be used as a measure of metabolic activity in planktonic and sessile heterotrophic bacteria. co2 assimilation by environmental samples and pure cultures of heterotrophic bacteria was studied using 14co2 and 13co2 as tracers. heterotrophic growth on complex organic substrates resulted in assimilation of co2 into cell biomass by activated sludge, drinking water biofilm, and pure cultures of escherichia coli atcc 25922, es. coli atcc 13706, rhodococcus ruber, burkholderia sp., bacillus circulans, pseudomonas putida, pseudomonas stutzeri, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. analysis of 13c-labelled phospholipid fatty acids (plfas) confirmed that heterotrophic bacteria may assimilate 13co2 into cell macromolecules such as membrane lipids. all major plfas extracted from activated sludge and drinking water biofilm samples were enriched in 13c after incubation with co2. between 1.4% and 6.5% of  the biomass produced by cultures of p. putida and a drinking water biofilm during growth in complex media was apparently derived from assimilation of co2. resting  cells assimilated less co2 compared to actively growing cells, and co2 assimilation activity correlated with the amount of biomass produced during heterotrophic growth. the 14co2 assimilation assay was evaluated as a tool to examine inhibitory effects of biocides on planktonic and sessile heterotrophs (biofilms). on the basis of 14co2 assimilation activity, the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of benzalkonium chloride was estimated to 21.1 and 127.2 mg l(-1) for planktonic and biofilm samples, respectively. the results indicate that assimilation of isotopically labelled co2 can be used as a relatively simple measure of metabolic activity in heterotrophic bacteria. co2 assimilation assays  may be used to study the effects of antimicrobial agents on growth and survival of planktonic and sessile heterotrophic organisms.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.

TI  == mesophilic aerobic degradation of a metal lubricant by a biological consortium.
AB  == the metal-forming industries require the use of greases to lubricate metal surfaces during manufacturing operations, and the residues of these lubricants must be removed prior to finishing processes to protect and improve the appearance of the final product. an aqueous, biological metal-cleaning process operating under mild conditions (ph 9, 42 degrees c) eliminates the use of environmentally unfriendly cleaning materials such as chlorinated solvents by employing microorganisms to degrade greases and oils naturally. this process was  characterized in terms of initial degradation rates of a representative metal lubricant and by phylogenetic identification of the active bacteria. the metal lubricant in a surfactant solution was degraded by a bacterial consortium, and its concentration was determined by a novel gas chromatography assay. the maximum degradation rate vmax and the apparent km were obtained as 45 mg/(day mg protein) and 24 g/l on cellular basis, and 4.6 g/(day l) and 33 g/l on a volumetric basis, respectively. mineralization of the metal lubricant was shown by analyzing the evolved co2 and cl-, and the bacterial consortium utilized the metal lubricant as a sole carbon and energy source (micro=0.05+/-0.01 h(-1) at 0.5 vol% lubricant concentration). the active bacteria in the biological metal-cleaning process were identified as bacillus licheniformis for the higher lubricant concentrations (3,  5, and 7.5 vol%), bacillus cereus at 1 vol%, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, rhizobiaceae strain m100, and achromobacter sp. lmg 5431 at 0.3 vol%.

TI  == relationships among ecology, demography and diseases of european bison (bison bonasus).
AB  == the bison population in the bialowieza forest in poland has now grown to approximately 300, while the herds in the belarusian part of the forest total about 240 bison. the first signs of a health problem in these herds appeared in 1980, when two cases of balanoposthitis were detected in two bulls (2 and 5 years of age). since 1980 research has been conducted to explain the cause of diseases, particularly balanoposthitis, and to monitor the health of bison in bialowieza forest. a total number of 614 bison (294 male and 320 female) of different ages was eliminated between 1980 and 2000. not all the culled bison were examined (postmortem analysis, histopathological, bacteriological, virological and toxicological examinations, serological tests, molecular research). based on the  increase in numbers, reproduction in this population for the past 21 years is generally considered successful. among 182 male bison eliminated during 1990-2000, only 85, or 47%, of the animals had balanoposthitis. thus, the percentage of balanoposthitis cases went from 100% during the 1980s down to 47% in the past decade. it appears that the culling process has been a major factor leading to this decrease. it can be assumed that a set of factors is involved in  the appearance of the disease (corynebacterium spp., bacillus sp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, ureoplasma spp, fusobacterium necrophorum, streptoccocus spp., staphyloccocus spp.) while opportunistic infections including nematodes (onchocerca spp.) are responsible for the occurrence of secondary lesions.

TI  == microbial diversity and prevalence of virulent pathogens in biofilms developed in a water reclamation system.
AB  == bacterial biofilm is a common phenomenon in both natural and engineered systems which often becomes a source of contamination and microbially influenced corrosion. it is thought that formation of biofilm in the monoculture of several  bacterial species is regulated by acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) quorum-sensing signals. in this study, we investigated the microbial diversity and existence of  ahl-producing and ahl-degrading bacterial species in the biofilm samples from a water reclamation system located in a tropical environment. 16s ribosomal dna sequencing analysis indicated the presence of at least 11 bacterial species, including the frequently encountered bacterial pathogens pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae, and several rare pathogens. we showed that only two groups of isolates, belonging to p. aeruginosa and enterobacter agglomerans, produced ahl signals. we also found that three bacterial isolates, i.e., agrobacterium tumefaciens xj01, bacillus cereus xj08, and ralstonia sp. xj12, expressed ahl degradation enzymes. furthermore, we showed that p. aeruginosa isolate hl43 was virulent against animal model caenorhabditis elegans and released 2-6-fold more pyocyanin cytotoxin than p. aeruginosa strains pa01 and pa14, the two commonly used laboratory strains. these data indicate the complexity and importance of biofilm research in water reclamation.

TI  == genetically programmed autoinducer destruction reduces virulence gene expression  and swarming motility in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1.
AB  == virulence in the opportunistic human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa is controlled by cell density via diffusible signalling molecules ('autoinducers') of the n-acylhomoserine lactone (ahl) type. two bacillus sp. isolates (a23 and a24) with ahl-degrading activity were identified among a large collection of rhizosphere bacteria. from isolate a24 a gene was cloned which was similar to the aiia gene, encoding an ahl lactonase in another bacillus strain. expression of the aiia homologue from isolate a24 in p. aeruginosa pao1 reduced the amount of the quorum sensing signal n-oxododecanoyl-l-homoserine lactone and completely prevented the accumulation of the second ahl signal, n-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone. this strongly reduced ahl content correlated with a markedly decreased expression and production of several virulence factors and cytotoxic compounds such as elastase, rhamnolipids, hydrogen cyanide and pyocyanin, and strongly reduced swarming. however, no effect was observed on flagellar swimming or on twitching motility, and aiia expression did not affect bacterial adhesion to a polyvinylchloride surface. in conclusion, introduction of an ahl degradation gene into p. aeruginosa could block cell-cell communication and exoproduct formation,  but failed to interfere with surface colonization.

AB  == mhyt, a new conserved protein domain with a likely signaling function, is described. this domain consists of six transmembrane segments, three of which contain conserved methionine, histidine, and tyrosine residues that are projected to lie near the outer face of the cytoplasmic membrane. in synechocystis sp. pcc6803, this domain forms the n-terminus of the sensor histidine kinase slr2098. in pseudomonas aeruginosa and several other organisms, the mhyt domain forms the  n-terminal part of a three-domain protein together with previously described ggdef and eal domains, both of which have been associated with signal transduction due to their presence in likely signaling proteins. in bacillus subtilis ykow protein, an additional pas domain is found between the mhyt and ggdef domains. a ykow null mutant of b. subtilis did not exhibit any growth alterations, consistent with a non-essential, signaling role of this protein. a model of the membrane topology of the mhyt domain indicates that its conserved residues could coordinate one or two copper ions, suggesting a role in sensing oxygen, co, or no.

AB  == this section is designed to provide a brief summary of some of the findings. a good deal of work has been conducted by mr n. l. pavey and the team at bsria, bracknell. the bsria publications are an excellent source of further information. ultraviolet radiation: uv radiation of wavelength 254 nm destroys bacteria by a mechanism of damaging nucleic acids by producing thymine dimers which disrupt dna replication [gavdy and gavdy, 1980]. l. pneumophila has been reported as sensitive to uv dosages of 2,500-7,000 uw.s/cm2 [antopol & ellner, 1979; knudson, 1985]. antopol and ellner [1979] examined the susceptibility of l. pneumophila to uv dosage. their results indicated that 50% of the organisms were killed by 380 uws/cm2 and 90% were killed by 920 uws/cm2. kills of 99 and 99.9% were obtained using 1,840 and 2,760 uws/cm2 respectively. muraca et al [1987] showed that continuous uv irradiation resulted in a 5 logarithm decrease in waterborne l. pneumophila in a circulating system. gilpin [1984] reported that in laboratory buffer solutions, exposure to 1 uw of uv radiation per cm2 achieved a 50% kill of l longbeachae in 5 minutes, l. gormanii in 2-30 minutes and l pneumophila in 17 minutes. exposure times for 99% kills for l. longbeachae, l pneumophila and l. gormanii were 33, 48 and 63 minutes respectively. the same research worker conducted experiments using a 3 litre circulating water system, connected to a stainless steel housing containing a uv source. the uv lamp output was 7 ergs/mm2 per second per 100 cm at 254 nm. l. pneumophila was killed within 15 seconds, that is within their first pass through the system. continuous disinfection with  uv has the advantages of imparting no taste, odour or harmful chemical by-products and requires minimal operation and maintenance [muraca et al 1988]. keevil et al [1989] state that uv irradiation fails to clear systems of biofilm because of poor penetration into microflocs of the micro-organisms. copper/silver ionisation: a recent study of full scale hot water test rigs incorporating copper-silver ionisation systems has been reported by pavey, 1996. copper and silver ions were introduced into the water by electrolysis. one of the principal  mechanisms of biocidal action of these ions is thought to be cell penetration. the positively charged copper ions form electrostatic bonds with negatively charged sites on the cell wall. the cell membrane is thus distorted, allowing ingress of silver ions which attack the cell by binding at specific sites to dna, rna, respiratory enzymes and cellular protein, causing catastrophic failure of the life support systems of the cell. silver and copper ion concentrations of 40  and 400 ug/l respectively were effective against planktonic legionellae in cold water systems and hot water systems containing soft water. in hard water, the ionisation was ineffective due to the inability to control silver ion concentrations. this was caused by scaling of the electrodes and silver ion complexation by the high concentration of dissolved solids. bosch et al [1993] had earlier extended the application of copper-silver disinfection to human enteric viruses in water, such as adenovirus, rotavirus, hepatitis a virus, and poliovirus. their work showed that copper and silver ions in the presence of reduced levels of free chlorine did not ensure the total elimination of viral pathogens from water. in the case of an amoeba, naegleria fowleria [responsible for primary amoebic meningoencephalitis], cassells et al [1995] have demonstrated that a combination of silver and copper ions were ineffective at inactivating the amoebae at 80 and 800 ug/l respectively. however addition of 1.0 mg/l free chlorine produced a synergistic effect, with superior inactivation relative to either chlorine or silver-copper in isolation. a similar synergy was reported by  yahya et al [1989] in their study of staphylococcus sp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa. yahya et al [1992] also suggested an additive or synergistic effect in the inactivation of coliphage ms-2 and poliovirus. other techniques: there are a number of other techniques. we have conducted trials of most of these in the control of legionella sp., but these fall out of the scope of this article, and as such less emphasis has been placed on them here. ozonation: ozone [o3] is an oxidising gas, generated electrically from oxygen [o2]. l. pneumophila can be killed at < 1 mg/l of ozone [edelstien et al 1982]. muraca et al [1987] found that 1-2 mg/l of continuous ozone over a six hour contact time, produced a 5 logarithm decrease of l. pneumophila. the effectiveness of ozone treatment against a range of bacteria and coliphages has been studied botzenhart et al [1993]. e. coli was least resistant to ozone, followed by ms 2-coliphage and phix 174-coliphage, with l. pneumophila and bacillus subtilis spores being the most resistant.

TI  == 16s rdna-based identification of bacteria from conjunctival swabs by pcr and dgge fingerprinting.
AB  == purpose: establishment of a new molecular biology technique for the identification of multiple bacteria from the ocular environment, which can be applied supplementarily to cultivation in cases of severe bacterial infections. methods: from 60 human conjunctivae (29 with purulent and 31 with nonpurulent conjunctivitis), swabs were taken and dna was extracted. fragments of 200 bp, spanning the v3 region of the eubacterial 16s rdna, were amplified by polymerase  chain reaction (pcr) and separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). for phylogenetic identification, dgge bands were excised and directly sequenced, or 16s rdna clone libraries were constructed and clones were screened  by dgge. sequences were compared with sequences of known bacteria listed in the embl database. furthermore, the results were compared with results obtained from  conventional cultivation. results: 16s rdna could be amplified from 25 of 29 investigated swabs taken from purulent conjunctivitis eyes and from 2 of 31 investigated swabs taken from nonpurulent conjunctivitis eyes. sixteen samples showed monomicrobial and 11 samples showed polymicrobial infections. the following genera (n is number of samples) were detected: staphylococcus (n = 8),  corynebacterium (n = 7), propionibacterium (n = 7), streptococcus (n = 6), bacillus (n = 2), acinetobacter (n = 3), pseudomonas (n = 3), proteus (n = 1), and brevundimonas (n = 1). four sequences could not be identified to the genus level. they had highest sequence similarities both to sequences of pantoea and enterobacter (n = 1), kingella and neisseria (n = 1), serratia and aranicola (n = 1), and leuconostoc and weissella (n = 2), respectively. culture was only positive for coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 9), corynebacteria (n = 3), staphylococcus aureus (n = 1), streptococcus sp. (n = 1), proteus sp. (n = 1), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 1), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1). in total, 45% of  the 60 analyzed conjunctival swabs were pcr positive, whereas only 22% were culture positive. no sample positive by culture gave negative results by pcr. conclusions: 16s rdna sequence analyses and dgge fingerprinting are appropriate methods for the detection and identification of monomicrobial as well as polymicrobial ocular infections of bacteria that might not be detected by conventional cultivation.

TI  == cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  == the algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on chromagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (ind), lysine decarboxylase (ldc), and ornithine decarboxylase (odc) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, ind positive (ind(+)), escherichia coli; metallic blue, ind(+), ldc(+), and odc negative (odc(-)), klebsiella oxytoca; ind(+), ldc(-), and odc(+), citrobacter diversus; ind(+) or ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(-), citrobacter freundii; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(+), enterobacter aerogenes; ind(-), ldc(-), and odc(+), enterobacter cloacae; ind(-), ldc(+), and odc(-), klebsiella pneumoniae;  diffuse brown and ind(+), morganella morganii; ind(-), proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, serratia marcescens; bluish green and ind(+), proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. during an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. a total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on chromagar orientation medium. for 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. the cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. the results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. in addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.

TI  == enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  == enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no  antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl.  tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.

TI  == aiia, an enzyme that inactivates the acylhomoserine lactone quorum-sensing signal and attenuates the virulence of erwinia carotovora.
AB  == n-acylhomoserine lactones, known as autoinducers (ais), are widely conserved signal molecules present in quorum-sensing systems of many gram-negative bacteria. ais are involved in the regulation of diverse biological functions, including expression of pathogenic genes in the plant pathogens pseudomonas solanacearum, several erwinia species, and the human pathogen pseudomonas aeruginosa. a bacterial isolate, bacillus sp. 240b1, is capable of enzymatic inactivation of ais. the gene (aiia) for ai inactivation from bacillus sp. 240b1  has been cloned and shown to encode a protein of 250 amino acids. sequence alignment indicates that aiia contains a "hxhxdh" zinc-binding motif that is conserved in several groups of metallohydrolases. site-directed mutagenesis showed that conserved aspartate and most histidine residues are required for aiia activity. expression of aiia in transformed erwinia carotovora strain scg1 significantly reduces the release of ai, decreases extracellular pectolytic enzyme activities, and attenuates pathogenicity on potato, eggplant, chinese cabbage, carrot, celery, cauliflower, and tobacco. our results indicate that the  ai-inactivation approach represents a promising strategy for prevention of diseases in which virulence is regulated by ais.

TI  == chemical composition and biological activity of extracts from arrabidaea bilabiata.
AB  == consumption of arrabidaea bilabiata fresh leaves produces a paraplegic syndrome in cattle. for isolation of the active principle, isopropanol and methanol extracts were prepared from the aerial parts of the plant; these were administered to sprague-dawley rats at doses of 0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg, orally, to determine the presence of substances affecting spontaneous motor activity. the isopropanol extract produced significant increases of long-pause and short-pause  movements (112 and 54%, respectively). the methanol extract tended to increase motor activity, but the effect did not reach statistical significance. chemical and spectroscopic analysis of the isopropanol extract showed allantoin was the major constituent. it was administered to rats, at doses of 1.2, 12, and 120 mg/kg. a complex dose-response curve was observed, but at the highest dose, there was a 52% increase in the number of long-pause movements. it was inferred that allantoin and the constituents of the alcholic extracts might not be responsible  for the paraplegic synndrome in cattle. the alteration of cattle motor activity could be caused by other non-alcoholic constituents. additionally, extracts were  assayed for in vitro activity against escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumonae , pseudomonas aeruginosa , staphylococcus aureus , bacillus sp. and candida albicans . all microbial strains were found to be resistant to the extracts with  the exception of c. albicans , suggesting a possible antifungal activity.

TI  == the biological activity of selected cyclic dipeptides.
AB  == cyclic dipeptides are widely used as models for larger peptides because of their  simplicity and limited conformational freedom. some cyclic dipeptides have been shown to be antiviral, antibiotic and anti-tumour. the aim of this study was to determine the biological activity of four cyclic dipeptides synthesized in this laboratory: cyclo(l-phenylalanyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tyrosyl-l-prolyl), cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-prolyl) and cyclo(l-tryptophanyl-l-tryptophanyl). the enhancement or inhibition of calcium channels in ventricular myocytes from rats and delayed-rectifier potassium channels in ventricular myocytes from guinea-pigs were determined by use of the whole-cell patch-clamp technique. the induction of  differentiation in ht-29 cells was assessed by assaying for an increase in the expression of alkaline phosphatase. antibiotic properties against escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilus and streptococcus sp. were determined by use of the kirby-bauer disc-diffusion assay. results from these assays indicate that the cyclic dipeptides have biological activity in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. three of  the dipeptides block cation channels in ventricular myocytes and all increase the expression of alkaline phosphatase. all the dipeptides have concentration-dependent antibacterial properties. these results suggest that with increased solubility the cyclic dipeptides might have potential as muscle relaxants, anti-tumour compounds and antibiotics.

TI  == bacterial infection and endotoxin in female reproductive tract in rats: correlation with the developmental status of preimplantation embryos.
AB  == during mammalian preimplantation development, a substantial numbers of embryos are believed to be lost for reasons that are unclear. using female rats, we investigated whether the developmental status of embryos is influenced by bacterial infection and endotoxin in the reproductive tract. from the vagina of cycling rats (n = 11), 21 bacterial isolates were identified; they were streptococcus faecalis (s. faecalis; 38%), escherichia coli (e. coli; 19%), acinetobactor calcoaceticus (a. calcoaceticus; 14%), and coagulase negative staphylococcus (14%), micrococcus sp. (5%), bacillus subtilis (b. subtilis; 5%) and proteus vulgaris (p. vulgaris; 5%). from the vagina of day 4 pregnant rats (n = 12), 26 isolates were identified; they were s. faecalis (23%), a. calcoaceticus (23%), e. coli (15%), micrococcus sp. (15%), b. subtilis (8%), p. vulgaris (4%),  staphylococcus aureus (4%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus (4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (4%). gram negative bacteria found in the vagina of cycling and day 4  pregnant rats were 38% and 46%, respectively. in both, bacterial load was 10(3)-10(5) colony forming units and there was no association with the abnormality of the recovered embryos. however, in two day 4 pregnant animals, pathogenic bacteria (staphylococcus aureus and beta-hemolytic streptococcus) were isolated and embryos recovered from them were degenerated and deformed. the vagina of day 9 pregnant animals (n = 7) were, however, sterile. consistently, in all animals, the upper reproductive tract (uterus and oviduct) was devoid of any  bacteria and no anaerobic bacteria were isolated from any part of the tract. the  levels of endotoxin in the vagina of cycling and day 4 pregnant rats were 1.35 +/- 0.1 and 1.17 +/- 0.1 endotoxin units (eu), respectively. it was undetectable  in the oviduct and uterus of all animals (n = 5) except one which showed high levels of endotoxin in uterus (4.5 eu) and oviduct (2.2 eu) and the animal also produced degenerated and deformed embryos. these results indicate that common bacterial flora of vagina may not affect embryo development and the presence of pathogenic bacteria in the vagina and/or endotoxin in reproductive tract could be detrimental to viability of gametes and preimplantation embryos in rats.

TI  == an effective method for isolating alginate lyase-producing bacillus sp. atb-1015  strain and purification and characterization of the lyase.
AB  == a new alginate lyase-producing micro-organism, designated as bacillus sp. strain  atb-1015, was effectively isolated from soil samples pretreated for 3 months with a substrate of the enzyme, sodium alginate. alginate lyase activity was assayed by the degrading activity of biofilm of teflon sheet discs, which was formed by a mucoid strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa pam3 selected from clinical isolates. the extracellular alginate lyase was precipitated with ammonium sulphate from the culture broth, and purified by gel filtration and anion exchange chromatography.  the molecular weight of the lyase was estimated to be 41 kda by sds polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and sephacryl s-200 hr column chromatography.  the optimum ph and temperature for the enzyme activity were around 7.5 and 37 degrees c, respectively, and the km value was 0.17% with the substrate, sodium alginate. the lyase activity was completely inhibited by treatment with 1 mmol l-1 of edta and the decreased activity was almost completely recovered by the addition of 2 mmol l-1 of cacl2. the activity was not affected by treatment with  the protein denaturants, 0.01 mol l-1 of sds or 1 mmol l-1 of urea. the lyase had substrate specificity for both the poly-guluronate and poly-mannuronate units in  the alginate molecule.

TI  == the extracytoplasmic function sigma factors: role and regulation.
AB  == alternative sigma factors provide a means of regulating gene expression in response to various extracellular changes. one such class of sigma factors appears to control a variety of functions, including expression of heat-shock genes in escherichia coli, biosynthesis of alginates and carotenoids in pseudomonas aeruginosa and myxococcus xanthus, respectively, iron uptake in e. coli and pseudomonas spp., nickel and cobalt efflux in alcaligenes europhus, plant pathogenicity in pseudomonas syringae and synthesis of outer membrane proteins in photobacterium sp. strain ss9. most of these activities deal with extracytoplasmic functions, and such sigmas have been designated as ecf sigma factors. they have also been characterized in mycobacteria as well as gram-positive bacteria such as streptomyces coelicolor and bacillus subtilus and  the archaea sulpholobus acidocaldarius. ecf factors belong to a subfamily of the  sigma 70 class, based on their sequence conservation and function across bacterial species. the promoter consensus sequences recognized by the ecf factors are also highly conserved. in most of the cases, the activity of these factors is modulated by a cognate inner membrane protein that has been shown, both in e. coli and in p. aeruginosa, to act as an anti-sigma activity. this inner membrane  protein is presumed to serve as a sensor and signalling molecule, allowing an adaptive response to specific environmental change. presumably, an on-and-off switch of the anti-sigma activity leads to the release of the sigma factor and thereby to the co-ordinate transcription of the specific regulon it governs.

TI  == biotransformation patterns of 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene by aerobic bacteria.
AB  == 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (tnt), a toxic nitroaromatic explosive, accumulates in the  environment, making necessary the remediation of contaminated areas and unused materials. although bioremediation has been utilized to detoxify tnt, the metabolic processes involved in the metabolism of tnt have proven to be complex.  the three aerobic bacterial strains reported here (pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus sp. , and staphylococcus sp.) differ in their ability to biotransform tnt and in their growth characteristics in the presence of tnt. in addition, enzymatic activities have been identified that differ in the reduction of nitro groups, cofactor preferences, and the ability to eliminate-no2 from the ring. the bacillus sp. has the most diverse bioremediation potential owing to its growth in the presence of tnt, high level of reductive ability, and capability of removing-no2 from the nitroaromatic ring.

TI  == cloning and nucleotide sequence of the gene coding for citrate synthase from a thermotolerant bacillus sp.
AB  == the structural gene coding for citrate synthase from the gram-positive soil isolate bacillus sp. strain c4 (atcc 55182) capable of secreting acetic acid at ph 5.0 to 7.0 in the presence of dolime has been cloned from a genomic library by complementation of an escherichia coli auxotrophic mutant lacking citrate synthase. the nucleotide sequence of the entire 3.1-kb hindiii fragment has been  determined, and one major open reading frame was found coding for citrate synthase (ctsa). citrate synthase from bacillus sp. strain c4 was found to be a dimer (mr, 84,500) with a subunit with an mr of 42,000. the n-terminal sequence was found to be identical with that predicted from the gene sequence. the kinetics were best fit to a bisubstrate enzyme with an ordered mechanism. bacillus sp. strain c4 citrate synthase was not activated by potassium chloride and was not inhibited by nadh, atp, adp, or amp at levels up to 1 mm. the predicted amino acid sequence was compared with that of the e. coli, acinetobacter anitratum, pseudomonas aeruginosa, rickettsia prowazekii, porcine heart, and saccharomyces cerevisiae cytoplasmic and mitochondrial enzymes.

TI  == distribution of epiphytic bacteria on olive leaves and the influence of leaf age  and sampling time.
AB  == mesophilic heterotrophic, aerobic or facultatively anaerobic bacteria that grow on yeast tryptone glucose extract agar were isolated from the surface of olive leaves of 3 or 4 different ages in january, april, july, and october from 1984 to 1989. unweighted average linkage cluster analysis on either the jaccard coefficient or the simple matching coefficient recovered 1,701 representative strains in 32 phena defined at the 70% and 80% similarity level, respectively. of these, 25 were identified to genus or lower level. from the identity of the representative strains, the frequency of occurrence among the phylloplane bacteria over the 6-year period was estimated at 51% forpseudomonas syringae, followed byxanthomonas campestris (6.7%),erwinia herbicola (6%),acetobacter aceti (4.7%),gluconobacter oxydans (4.3%),pseudomonas fluorescens (3.9%),bacillus megaterium (3.8%),leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp.dextranicum (3.1%),lactobacillus plantarum (2.8%),curtobacterium plantarum (2.2%),micrococcus luteus (2.2%),arthrobacter globiformis (1.4%),klebsiella planticola (1.2%),streptococcus faecium (1.2%),clavibacter sp.

(0.29%),alcaligenes faecalis (0.27%),erwinia carotovora (0.08%), andpseudomonas aeruginosa (0.04%). bacterial communities on leaves of a given age at a given time during any one year displayed a very similar structure but differed significantly from those on the leaves of the same age at a different time or on  the leaves of a different age at any time during any one year. communities on the leaves of a given age at a given time of the year were invariably dominated by one or another of only 9 taxa, which accounted for 22 to 98.5% of the isolates from those leaves. the communities on 10- and 13-month-old leaves were invariably made up of fewer taxa than those on younger leaves at the same time of the year.

TI  == structure of the detoxification catalyst mercuric ion reductase from bacillus sp. strain rc607.
AB  == several hundred million tons of toxic mercurials are dispersed in the biosphere.  microbes can detoxify organo-mercurials and mercury salts through sequential action of two enzymes, organomercury lyase and mercuric ion reductase (mera). the latter, a homodimer with homology to the fad-dependent disulphide oxidoreductases, catalyses the reaction nadph + hg(ii)----nadp+ + h+ + hg(0), one of the very rare enzymic reactions with metal substrates. human glutathione reductase serves as a reference molecule for fad-dependent disulphide reductases  and between its primary structure and that of mera from tn501 (pseudomonas), tn21 (shigella), p1258 (staphylococcus) and bacillus, 25-30% of the residues have been conserved. all meras have a c-terminal extension about 15 residues long but have  very varied n termini. although the enzyme from streptomyces lividans has no addition, from pseudomonas aeruginosa tn501 and bacillus sp. strain rc607 it has  one and two copies respectively of a domain of 80-85 residues, highly homologous  to merp, the periplasmic component of proteins encoded by the mer operon. these domains can be proteolytically cleaved off without changing the catalytic efficiency. we report here the crystal structure of mera from the gram-positive bacterium bacillus sp. strain rc607. analysis of its complexes with nicotinamide  dinucleotide substrates and the inhibitor cd(ii) reveals how limited structural changes enable an enzyme to accept as substrate what used to be a dangerous inhibitor. knowledge of the mode of mercury ligation is a prerequisite for understanding this unique detoxification mechanism.

TI  == identification of a new operon involved in listeria monocytogenes virulence: its  first gene encodes a protein homologous to bacterial metalloproteases.
AB  == the region flanking the transposon in a tn1545-induced lecithinase-negative mutant of listeria monocytogenes egd was cloned and sequenced. the transposon had inserted in orf d, the open reading frame previously identified downstream from hlya, the gene encoding listeriolysin o. the complete sequence of orf d from strain egd has been determined as well as that of two other strains: lo28, a clinical isolate; and lm8, an epidemic strain. orf d is 1,533 bp long and encodes a protein highly homologous to metalloproteases of bacilli, serratia sp., legionella pneumophila, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. it was renamed prta. northern rna blot analysis indicated that prta is the first gene of a 6-kb operon, suggesting that the lecithinase-negative phenotype of the mutant might be due to  a polar effect of the transposon insertion.

TI  == iodine sensitivity of bacteria isolated from iodinated water systems.
AB  == fourteen bacterial isolates, predominantly pseudomonas sp., from two water systems disinfected by iodinated anion-exchange resins were studied and compared  with an isolate of pseudomonas aeruginosa from a povidone-iodine solution and four other isolates. pseudomonas cepacia and p. aeruginosa grown in brain heart infusion were 3 to 5 logs less sensitive to 1 mg/l i2 (ph 7.2, 1 min) when compared with cultures grown in phosphate buffer. another p. cepacia isolate was  the least sensitive culture when grown in brain heart infusion (1 log decrease) but was more sensitive after cultivation in phosphate buffer (5 logs). isolates from an iodinated potable water system, including p. cepacia, staphyloccus warneri, and a bacillus sp., were all less sensitive to iodine than a "resistant" p. aeruginosa and three other isolates when grown in brain heart infusion. a clinical isolate of p. aeruginosa exhibited intermediate sensitivity. the sensitivity of bacteria to iodine is thus highly variable, depending on the organism as well as the growth conditions.

TI  == thiosulfate oxidation by obligately heterotrophic bacteria.
AB  == thiosulfate was oxidized stoichiometrically to tetrathionate during growth on glucose byklebsiella aerogenes, bacillus globigii, b. megaterium, pseudomonas putida, two strains each ofp. fluorescens andp. aeruginosa, and anaeromonas sp. a gram-negative, rod-shaped soil isolate, pseudomonad hw, converted thiosulfate to  tetrathionate during growth on acetate. none of the organisms could use thiosulfate as sole energy source. the quantitative recovery of all the thiosulfate supplied to heterotrophic cultures either as tetrathionate alone or as tetrathionate and unused thiosulfate demonstrated that no oxidation to sulfate occurred with any of the strains tested. two strains ofescherichia coli did not oxidize thiosulfate. thiosulfate oxidation in batch culture occurred at different stages of the growth cycle for different organisms:p. putida oxidized thiosulfate during lag and early exponential phase,k. aerogenes oxidized thiosulfate at all stages of growth, andb. megaterium andaeromonas oxidized thiosulfate during late  exponential phase. the relative rates of oxidation byp. putida andk. aerogenes were apparently determined by different concentrations of thiosulfate oxidizing enzyme. thiosulfate oxidation byp. aeruginosa grown in chemostat culture was inducible, since organisms pregrown on thiosulfate-containing media oxidized thiosulfate, but those pregrown on glucose only could not oxidize thiosulfate. steady state growth yield ofp. aeruginosa in glucose-limited chemostat culture increased about 23% in the presence of 5-22 mm thiosulfate, with complete or partial concomitant oxidation to tetrathionate. the reasons for this stimulation  are unclear. the results suggest that heterotrophic oxidation of thiosulfate to tetrathionate is widespread across several genera and may even stimulate bacterial growth in some organisms.

TI  == antibiotic activity of the pyrenocines.
AB  == pyrenocine a, a phytotoxin produced by pyrenochaeta terrestris (hansen) gorenz, walker and larson, possesses general antibiotic activity against plants, fungi, and bacteria. effective doses for 50% inhibition (ed50s) are 4 micrograms/ml for  onion seedling elongation; 14, 20, 20, and 25 micrograms/ml for the germination of asexual spores of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cepae, fusarium solani f. sp. pisi, mucor hiemalis, and rhizopus stolonifer, respectively. pyrenocine a also inhibits the linear mycelial growth of both p. terrestris and f. oxysporum with ed50s calculated as 77 and 54 micrograms/ml, respectively. gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to pyrenocine a than gram-negative bacteria. ed50s are estimated as 30, 45, and 200 micrograms/ml for the inhibition of growth of bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli, respectively, with pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to those concentrations tested. pyrenocine  a acts primarily as a biostatic rather than a biocidal agent with all organisms tested showing some degree of recovery when released from pyrenocine a. pyrenocines b and c show little antibiotic activity in the bioassays performed.

TI  == the nosocomial colonization of t. bear.
AB  == a national effort to reduce nosocomial infections includes a program developed at the national institutes of health to encourage handwashing in hospitals and day care centers. the program promotes a symbolic teddy bear (t. bear) with slogans to remind hospital personnel and patients to practice handwashing. one of the items used is a stuffed toy t. bear to be dispensed to the hospitalized child. considering the manner in which children handle stuffed toys, we suspected the t. bear might serve as a "fomite" for transmission of nosocomial microbes. a prospective study of 39 sterilized t. bears revealed that all became colonized with bacteria, fungi, or both within 1 week of hospitalization. hospital acquired organisms cultured from the t. bear included staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, alpha streptococci, corynebacterium acnes, micrococcus sp, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, bacillus sp, and species of candida, cryptococcus, trichosporon, aspergillus and others. concomitant cultures of the patients revealed similar isolates. although the t. bear handwashing campaign should not be discredited, the promotional toy may pose an unnecessary expense and hazard and should not be used in hospitals or day care centers.

TI  == a note on antibiotic resistance in the bacterial flora of raw sewage and sewage-polluted river tigris in mosul, iraq.
AB  == polluted water samples collected from the river tigris in the vicinity of a raw sewage outfall were examined for the incidence of antibiotic resistance among coliform bacteria on three occasions during 1983. eighty percent or more of the coliform bacteria were resistant to one or more antibiotics. at the same time, raw sewage samples were examined for the incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and escherichia coli, pseudomonas spp. and staphylococcus spp. were selected for sensitivity testing. collectively, more than 90% of the 480 strains  of the three organisms were resistant to one or more antibiotics. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of ampicillin for twenty-nine strains including coliforms, e. coli, klebsiella sp., serratia sp., ps. aeruginosa, pseudomonas sp., micrococcus sp., staph. aureus, streptococcus faecalis and bacillus sp. from raw sewage and polluted river tigris water was determined and that for ps. aeruginosa was 250 micrograms/ml. the high incidence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in natural waters could be related to the widespread use of antibiotics  in this locality.

TI  == bacterial interference with coliform colony sheen production on membrane filters.
AB  == the membrane filter (mf) method for detection and enumeration of coliform bacteria in drinking water requires that the coliforms both grow and produce a green metallic sheen when the filter is incubated on modified endo medium at 35 degrees c for 22 h. large numbers of noncoliform bacteria, which are enumerated by the standard plate count (spc) technique, can interfere with the detection of  coliforms on mf. this paper presents quantitative evidence from laboratory experiments on the interference of specific spc bacteria on coliform colony sheen production on mf. pseudomonas aeruginosa and aeromonas hydrophila caused significant reductions in escherichia coli sheen colony counts when present at 3,000 and 220 per filter, respectively. the flavobacterium sp. and bacillus sp. selected for this study from spc did not interfere with coliform colony sheen production. excessive crowding of e. coli and enterobacter cloacae colonies on mf also caused a reduction in the number of colonies that produced sheen. even when  there was no crowding (14 colonies per filter), only a fraction of the e. cloacae colonies produced sheen colonies on modified endo medium.

TI  == degradation of uric acid by certain aerobic bacteria.
AB  == we have isolated and identified nine cultures of aerobic bacteria capable of growing on an elective medium containing uric acid as the only source of carbon,  nitrogen, and energy. four of these cultures were identified as aerobacter aerogenes, two as klebsiella pneumoniae, and the remainder as serratia killiensis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and bacillus species. another culture identified as p. fluorescens required both glucose and uric acid for growth. when 23 laboratory stock cultures were inoculated into the uric acid medium, a. aerogenes, b. subtilis, mycobacterium phlei, p. aeruginosa, and s. marcescens were able to grow. these five cultures also grew when the uric acid was replaced  with adenine, guanine, hypoxanthine, xanthine, or allantoin, but growth was poor. in all of these media, including the uric acid medium, addition of glucose along  with the nitrogenous compounds yielded good growth. induction experiments demonstrated that the ability of a. aerogenes, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, p. fluorescens, s. kiliensis, s. marcescens, b. subtilis, and bacillus sp. to degrade uric acid is an induced property. of these organisms, only bacillus sp. accumulated a small amount of intracellular uric acid.
