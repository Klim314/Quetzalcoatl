TI  == vertical mother-neonate transfer of maternal gut bacteria via breastfeeding.
AB  == breast milk has recently been recognized as source of commensal and potential probiotic bacteria. the present study investigated whether viable strains of gut-associated obligate anaerobes are shared between the maternal and neonatal gut ecosystem via breastfeeding. maternal faeces, breast milk and corresponding neonatal faeces collected from seven mothers-neonate pairs at three neonatal sampling points were analyzed by culture-independent (pyrosequencing) and culture-dependent methods (16s rrna gene sequencing, pulsed field gel electrophoresis, random amplified polymorphic dna and repetitive extragenic palindromic polymerase chain reaction. pyrosequencing allowed identifying gut-associated obligate anaerobic genera, like bifidobacterium, bacteroides, parabacteroides and members of the clostridia (blautia, clostridium, collinsella  and veillonella) shared between maternal faeces, breast milk and neonatal faeces. using culture, a viable strain of bifidobacterium breve was shown to be shared between all three ecosystems within one mother-neonate pair. furthermore, pyrosequencing revealed that several butyrate-producing members of the clostridia (coprococcus, faecalibacterium, roseburia and subdoligranulum) were shared between maternal faeces and breast milk. this study shows that (viable) obligate  gut-associated anaerobes may be vertically transferred from mother to neonate via breastfeeding. thus, our data support the recently suggested hypothesis of a novel way of mother-neonate communication, in which maternal gut bacteria reach breast milk via an entero-mammary pathway to influence neonatal gut colonization  and maturation of the immune system.
