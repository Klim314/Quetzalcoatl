TI  - Evaluation of antibiotic susceptibility of Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium species isolated from patients of the N. N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russia.
AB  - In total 122 non-duplicate Bacteroides, Prevotella and Fusobacterium spp isolated from cancer patients between 2004 and 2014 were involved in this study. Most of the strains belonged to the B. fragilis group (55%), followed by Prevotella strains (34.4%) and Fusobacterium spp (10.6%). The species identification was carried out by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), and they were identified on species level with a log (score) >2.0. The most common isolates were B. fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. ovatus and B. vulgatus. Among Prevotella species, the most frequently isolated species were P. buccae, P. buccalis, P. oris, P. denticola and P. nigrescens, and most of the Fusobacterium spp. were F. nucleatum. Susceptibilities of the strains were determined by the E-test methodology. The percentage of the susceptibility of B. fragilis group isolates were: metronidazole (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 97%; imipenem (MIC </=2 mug/ml), 95.5%; amoxicillin/clavulanate (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 95.5% and clindamycin (MIC </=4 mug/ml), 77.6%. Three B. fragilis isolates proved to be multidrug-resistant (parallel resistance to imipenem, amoxicillin/clavulanate and metronidazole or clindamycin was observed). All Prevotella strains tested were susceptible to imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanate, whereas 78.6% of the pigmented Prevotella species and 46.4% of the non-pigmented species were resistant to penicillin (MIC >0.5 mug/ml). The susceptibility to metronidazole and clindamycin were 93% and 88%, respectively. All Fusobacterium strains were sensitive to all tested antibiotics, including penicillin.
TI  - Evaluation of the Rapid ID 32A system for identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the Rapid ID 32A system (bioMerieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France) for the identification of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli, excluding the Bacteroides fragilis group. METHODS: Five hundred and twenty-eight identified clinical isolates of non-B. fragilis group anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli were tested in the Rapid ID 32A system, and identifications were compared with those obtained with conventional biochemical tests and gas-liquid chromatography. RESULTS: The Rapid ID 32A system correctly identified 280 (60.9%) of the 460 isolates tested for which taxa were included in the database, without the need for additional testing. A further 97 (21.1%) isolates were correctly identified to species level following the performance of complementary tests recommended by the manufacturer. Fifty-nine (12.8%) isolates were identified at the genus level only, and 21 (4.6%) were misidentified at the species level. Three isolates of Prevotella were not identified by the system. Of the 68 isolates belonging to taxa not included in the database, no identification was obtained for 33 (48.5%), while 35 (51.5%) were misidentified. CONCLUSIONS: The Rapid ID 32A system provided a rapid and reliable method for the identification of non-B. fragilis group, anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli to the genus level, while the success of species-level identification varied with different taxa. There was poor discrimination between Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum, between Porphyromonas asaccharolytica and Porphyromonas endodontalis, and between Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella denticola, Prevotella loescheii, Prevotella melaninogenica and Prevotella oralis. The need to perform conventional complementary tests on 149 (32.4%) of the 460 isolates compromised the usefulness of the system for rapid species identification.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Numerical taxonomy of some non-saccharolytic and saccharolytic Bacteroides species.
AB  - Various Bacteroides spp. were examined by physiological tests, presence of specific enzymes, antibiotic sensitivity, menaquinone composition and a few miscellaneous tests. The data matrix containing 58 strains and 55 unit characters was examined using Gower's similarity coefficients (SG) and included matching negative character states and multistate characters. The highly saccharolytic strains were separated from the less saccharolytic and non-fermentative strains at the 55% similarity level; while at the slightly higher level of 63% strains of Capnocytophaga (formerly Bact. ochraceus) were recovered as a compact phenon distinct from other saccharolytic species. The phenogram was divided into 6 clusters at 72% similarity level. Most of the 'Bact. fragilis group' of species clustered in one phenon while Bact. melaninogenicus ssp. melaninogenicus, Bact. bivius and a new species, Bact. denticola, formed another group. Another phenon comprised the saccharolytic non-pigmented species closely related to Bact. oralis such as Bact. buccalis and Bact. pentosaceus. The less saccharolytic strains of Bact. melaninogenicus ssp. intemedius and Bact. disiens were recovered in a distinct phenon. The low affinity (less than 55% similarity) between the two subspecies of Bact. melaninogenicus emphasised the need for reclassifying these taxa into separate species. The non-fermentative and very weakly saccharolytic strains formed good taxospecies. The separation of this cluster into three subclusters is in excellent agreement with chemotaxonomic data now available.
TI  - The isolation and identification of Bacteroides spp. from the normal human gingival flora.
AB  - Gram-negative anaerobic bacilli were isolated on an enriched selective medium from specimens of subgingival plaque from 20 normal, healthy adults without periodontal disease. a heavy growth of Bacteroides and Fusobacterium spp. was obtained from all specimens and 10 representative colonies from each subject were selected for identification by conventional bacteriological methods. Results were obtained in these tests with 188 isolates; some strains of the B. melaninogenicus/oralis group would not grow in pure culture on solid media and showed satellitism in mixed culture, and some strains of fusobacteria did not survive repeated subculture. Most isolates (68%) belonged to the B. melaninogenicus/oralis group. The commonest species identified in this group were B. oralis (41%), B. melaninogenicus ss. melaninogenicus (26%) and ss. intermedius (17%). B. oralis was isolated from all subjects and at least one strain of B. melaninogenicus was isolated from 18 out of 20 subjects. Only eight strains of the B. fragilis group were detected and they probably represented transient carriage. Fusobacterium spp. and L. buccalis were isolated from 15 out of 20 subjects and accounted for 21% of the isolates studied, but most could not be identified specifically by the set of tests used. Asaccharolytic species of Bacteroides were isolated in small numbers from seven subjects.
