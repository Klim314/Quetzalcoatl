TI  == probiotic potential of lactobacillus strains isolated from sorghum-based traditional fermented food.
AB  == sorghum-based traditional fermented food was screened for potential probiotic lactic acid bacteria. the isolates were identified by biochemical, physiological  and genetic methods. species identification was done by 16s rrna sequence analysis. the functional probiotic potential of the two lactobacillus species viz., lactobacillus plantarum (lact. plantarum) and lactobacillus pentosus (lact. pentosus) was assessed by different standard parameters. the strains were tolerant to ph 2 for 1 h and resistant to methicillin, kanamycin, vancomycin and  norfloxacin. two (lact. plantarum coorg-3 and lact. pentosus coorg-8) out of eight isolates recorded the cell surface hydrophobicity to be 59.12 and 64.06 %,  respectively. all the strains showed tolerance to artificial duodenum juice (ph 2) for 3 h, positive for bile salt hydrolase test and negative for haemolytic test. the neutralized cell-free supernatant of the strains lact. pentosus coorg-4, lact. plantarum coorg-1, lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-8 and lact. plantarum coorg-3 showed good antibiofilm activity. lact. pentosus coorg-8 exhibited 74 % activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa-mtcc 7903 and lact. plantarum coorg-7 showed 68 % inhibition of biofilm against klebsiella pneumonia mtcc 7407. three (lact. plantarum coorg-7, lact. pentosus coorg-5 and lact. pentosus coorg 8) out of eight isolates exhibited a good antimicrobial activity against listeria monocytogenes and five isolates (lact. pentosus coorg 2, lact. plantarum coorg 1, lact. plantarum coorg 4, lact. pentosus coorg 3 and lact. plantarum coorg 6) are active against escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis,  pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, klebsiella pneumonia, enterococcus faecalis. the study also evaluated the cholesterol lowering property of the lactobacillus strains using hen egg yolk as the cholesterol source. the cholesterol in hen egg yolk was assimilated by 74.12 and 68.26 % by lact. plantarum coorg 4 and lact. pentosus coorg 7, respectively. the results of the present study suggest that the lactobacillus strains isolated and characterized from sorghum-based fermented product may be used as probiotic strains for therapeutic applications.

TI  == a food additive with prebiotic properties of an alpha-d-glucan from lactobacillus plantarum dm5.
AB  == an alpha-d-glucan produced by lactobacillus plantarum dm5 was explored for in vitro prebiotic activities. glucan-dm5 demonstrated 21.6% solubility, 316.9% water holding capacity, 86.2% flocculation activity, 71.4% emulsification activity and a degradation temperature (td) of 292.2 degrees c. glucan-dm5 exhibited lowest digestibility of 0.54% by artificial gastric juice, 0.21% by intestinal fluid and 0.32% by alpha-amylase whereas the standard prebiotic inulin, showed 25.23%, 5.97% and 19.13%, hydrolysis, respectively. prebiotic activity assay of glucan-dm5 displayed increased growth of probiotic bacteria such as bifidobacterium infantis and lactobacillus acidophilus, but did not support the growth of non-probiotic bacteria such as escherichia coli and enterobacter aerogenes. the overall findings indicated that glucan from l. plantarum dm5 can serve as a potential prebiotic additive for food products.

TI  == antagonistic effect of lactobacillus strains against gas-producing coliforms isolated from colicky infants.
AB  == background: infantile colic is a common disturb within the first 3 months of life, nevertheless the pathogenesis is incompletely understood and treatment remains an open issue. intestinal gas production is thought to be one of the causes of abdominal discomfort in infants suffering from colic. however, data about the role of the amount of gas produced by infants' colonic microbiota and the correlation with the onset of colic symptoms are scanty. the benefit of supplementation with lactobacilli been recently reported but the mechanisms by which they exert their effects have not yet been fully defined. this study was performed to evaluate the interaction between lactobacillus spp. strains and gas-forming coliforms isolated from stools of colicky infants. results: strains of coliforms were isolated from stools of 45 colicky and 42 control breastfed infants in mcconkey agar and identified using pcr with species-specific primers,  and the bbl enterotube ii system for enterobacteriaceae. gas-forming capability of coliforms was assessed in liquid cultures containing lactose as sole carbon source. the average count of total coliforms in colicky infants was significantly higher than controls: 5.98 (2.00-8.76) log10 vs 3.90 (2.50-7.10) cfu/g of faeces  (p = 0.015). the following strains were identified: escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae and  enterococcus faecalis. then, 27 lactobacillus strains were tested for their antagonistic effect against coliforms both by halo-forming method and in liquid co-cultures. lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii dsm 20074 and l. plantarum mb 456 were able to inhibit all coliforms strains (halo-forming method), also in liquid co-cultures, thus demonstrating an antagonistic activity. conclusions: this study shows that two out of 27 strains of lactobacillus examined possess an antimicrobial effect against six species of gas-forming coliforms isolated from colicky infants. our findings may stimulate new researches to identify which lactobacillus strains can improve colicky symptoms by acting on coliforms gut colonization.

TI  == isolation of bacteriocin-like substances producing bacteria from finished cattle-manure compost and activity evaluation against some food-borne pathogenic  and spoilage bacteria.
AB  == a finished compost sample was examined for bacteriocin-like substance production  against five pathogenic bacteria: salmonella typhimurium ef 85-9, escherichia coli o157:h7 atcc 43888, enterococcus faecalis jcm 8726, staphylococcus aureus jcm 2151, and yersinia enterocolitica jcm 7577. at the preliminary detection of bacterial strains exhibiting antimicrobial activity from the compost sample, thirteen strains could be isolated. screening of the inhibitory activity was done using agar-well diffusion assay and microtiter plate growth assay. six bacterial  strains from the compost showed an antimicrobial activity against one or more of  the tested indicator strains. four strains (m1-m4) belonged to shigella species and the other two strains (m5 and m6) belonged to salmonella species. the antimicrobial activity was sensitive for alpha-chymotrypsin and papain. the antimicrobial substances from m3, m4 and m6 were heat stable when heated for 15 min at 121 degrees c with 100% relative activity. the bacteriocin-like substance  produced by strain m2 was partially characterized. it exhibited an inhibitory activity against the tested food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, except enterobacter aerogenes jcm 1235 and lactobacillus plantarum subsp. plantarum jcm  1149. it was stable at a wide range of ph (3-11). there was no loss of activity for up to 3 weeks when stored at 4 and -20 degrees c or for up to 2 weeks when stored at 28 and -80 degrees c. this is the first report indicating the presence  of bacteriocin-like activity in animal manure compost.

TI  == influence of microbial growth on the redox potential of fermented cucumbers.
AB  == commonly, ph measurements are used during the production of fermented cucumbers to indirectly monitor growth of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and acid production. redox potential (e(h)) measurements, which are determined by the potential of an  electron to reduce an acceptor, could serve as an alternative tool to monitor the progress of fermentation allowing the detection of the metabolic activity and/or  growth of lab and other microorganisms. pasteurized and inoculated jars of cucumbers were observed to better understand how the e(h) changes during the cucumber fermentation and how it could be used as a monitoring tool. jars of diced, brined cucumbers were pasteurized and inoculated with microbes previously  isolated from fermented cucumbers including lactobacillus plantarum, zygosaccharomyces globiformis, and enterobacter aerogenes. although an initial decrease in e(h) was observed for all microorganisms, distinctive trends in e(h)  occurred when these organisms were inoculated. after a 2-wk fermentation period,  the e(h) (ag/agcl, 3 m kcl) in jars inoculated with l. plantarum, z. globiformis, and e. aerogenes was at +453 +/- 55, +104 +/- 5, and -156 +/- 73 mv, respectively. cucumbers inoculated with a mixture of l. plantarum and z. globiformis had a terminal e(h) value of +202 +/- 24 mv, which was between that found for the individual microorganisms. l. plantarum dominated the e(h) trend when inoculated along with e. aerogenes with a final e(h) of +411 +/- 72 mv. the  results showed that changes in e(h) continued after ph measurements became stable. thus e(h) measurement can provide a tool to continuously monitor microbial growth during the course of cucumber fermentations.

TI  == bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus strains isolated from poto poto, a congolese  fermented maize product, and genetic fingerprinting of their plantaricin operons.
AB  == thirty one bacteriocin-producing lactobacillus isolates were identified among 135 lactobacilli isolated from the congolese fermented maize product poto poto, during the preparation and from the finished product. using species-specific pcr  and 16s rrna gene sequencing, 28 and 3 isolates were identified as l. plantarum and l. fermentum, respectively. cluster analysis of rapd-pcr fingerprints revealed two main groups (g1 and g2) plus the l. fermentum isolate c4-13. group g1 contained 23 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 74.5%, and could be divided in two subgroups (g1-1, g1-2) each with several branches, plus the l. plantarum isolate c11. group g2 contained 8 isolates with a similarity coefficient > 86%, with two main branches. using pcr amplification with specific  primers, several genes of the plantaricin cluster found in l. plantarum c11 were  identified in the isolates. the number of genes that were detected varied between the strains. the l. fermentum isolate ec11 also contained the plndefg genes. pcr  amplification of dna from isolates with primers directed to the upstream and downstream region of the plantaricin cluster generated an amplicon identical to that obtained with dna from the control strain l. plantarum wcfs1. amplification  products from the positive strains were used for restriction analysis with hindiii, ecori and kpni in separate reactions. cluster analysis of restriction profiles revealed high similarities for ecori and hindii digest profiles, and an  identical profile for all kpni digests. the l. fermentum ec11 isolate clustered with l. plantarum strains in a group with a high correlation coefficient. the results suggest a low degree of diversity in the plantarincin gene cluster. however, other strains that tested positive for individual plantaricin genes may  present great heterogeneity in the plantaricin operons. because of their broad spectra of inhibition (including escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, enterobacter aerogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, and enterococcus faecalis), isolates from the present study could  be used to improve the safety and storage stability of poto poto.

TI  == detection of low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells by using a fiber-optic immunosensor.
AB  == biosensor technology has a great potential to meet the need for sensitive and nearly real-time microbial detection from foods. an antibody-based fiber-optic biosensor to detect low levels of listeria monocytogenes cells following an enrichment step was developed. the principle of the sensor is a sandwich immunoassay where a rabbit polyclonal antibody was first immobilized on polystyrene fiber waveguides through a biotin-streptavidin reaction to capture listeria cells on the fiber. capture of cells on the fibers was confirmed by scanning electron microscopy. a cyanine 5-labeled murine monoclonal antibody, c11e9, was used to generate a specific fluorescent signal, which was acquired by  launching a 635-nm laser light from an analyte 2000 and collected by a photodetector at 670 to 710 nm. this immunosensor was specific for l. monocytogenes and showed a significantly higher signal strength than for other listeria species or other microorganisms, including escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, salmonella enterica, lactobacillus plantarum, carnobacterium gallinarum, hafnia alvei, corynebacterium glutamicum, enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens, in pure or in mixed-culture setup. fiber-optic results could be obtained within 2.5 h of sampling. the sensitivity threshold was about 4.3 x 10(3) cfu/ml for a pure culture of l. monocytogenes grown at 37 degrees c. when l. monocytogenes was mixed with lactic acid bacteria or grown at 10 degrees c with 3.5% nacl, the detection threshold was 4.1 x 10(4) or 2.8 x 10(7) cfu/ml, respectively. in less  than 24 h, this method could detect l. monocytogenes in hot dog or bologna naturally contaminated or artificially inoculated with 10 to 1,000 cfu/g after enrichment in buffered listeria enrichment broth.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of some cyclic hydroxamic acids and related lactams.
AB  == against enterobacter aerogenes 13048, serratia marcescens 13880, klebsiella pneumoniae 10031, pseudomonas aeruginosa 10145, escherichia coli 9723, lactobacillus casei 7469, lactobacillus plantarum 8014, leuconostoc dextranicum 8086, and streptococcus faecalis 8043, the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of three cyclic hydroxamic acids, 3-amino-3,4-dihydro-1-hydroxycarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 0.6, 0.6, and 0.2 micrograms/ml, and those of the corresponding lactams, 3-amino-3,4-dihydrocarbostyril, the 6-chloro analog, and the 7-chloro analog, were 60, 60, and 6 micrograms/ml, respectively. under the same assay conditions the mean minimal inhibitory concentrations of chloramphenicol and kanamycin were both 2 micrograms/ml. in addition, the cyclic hydroxamic acids but not the lactams inhibited the growth of candida albicans at minimal inhibitory concentrations ranging from 20 to 200 micrograms/ml, at ph 7, as compared with that of amphotericin b, at 2 micrograms/ml.

TI  == analysis of bacterial biotin-proteins.
AB  == the biotin-protein populations in several bacterial strains were analyzed by solubilization of [3h]biotin-labeled cells with sodium dodecylsulfate followed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels containing the detergent. a variety of patterns of biotin-labeled polypeptide chains was seen, ranging from a single biotin-protein in escherichia coli, corresponding to the biotin carboxyl carrier  protein component of acetyl-coa carboxylase, to multiple species in enterobacter  aerogenes, pseudomonas citronellolis, bacillus cereus, propionibacterium shermanii, lactobacillus plantarum, and mycobacterium phlei, which probably represent subunits of multiple biotin-dependent enzymes present in these organisms. in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two major biotin-containing polypeptides with approximate molecular weights of 65 000 and 25 000 were shown to correspond to the biotin carboxyl carrier components of pyruvate carboxylase and acetyl-coa carboxylase, respectively. thus in the case of pseudomonas citronellolis two different biotin-dependent enzymes in the same cell do not share common biotin carboxyl carrier subunits.
