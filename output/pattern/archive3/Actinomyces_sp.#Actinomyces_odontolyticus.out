degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.
[study the inhibitory effects of three oral actinomyces on growth of oral candida albicans in vitro].
objective: the aim of this study was to investigate whether the three species of  oral actinomyces have inhibitory effects on the growth of oral candida albicans in vitro. methods: straight o'clock method was used to observe the bacteriostasis circle. reverse o'clock and mixed culture method were used to study the quantitative changes of candida albicans colony respectively. results: (1) none of the groups had been viewed the bacteriostasis circle. (2) compared with control groups, there was a significant decrease of candida albicans colony on actinomyces viscosus tpy soft agar (p < 0.05). actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus tpy soft agar were both devoid of obvious candida albicans colony (p < 0.01). the former group (actinomyces viscosus) and the two latter groups (actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus) showed a striking contrast (p < 0.01). (3) compared with control groups, a decrease of candida albicans showed up in the mixed culture, and the difference was significant (p < 0.05). the discrepancies among the three experimental groups were of no statistical value (p > 0.05). conclusion: oral actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus could inhibit the growth of candida albicans in vitro. however, which of them contributed more to the inhibitory effects was still not affirmed.
antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.
inhibition of [3h]-thymidine uptake in human gingival fibroblasts by extracts from human dental plaque, oral bacteria of the streptococcus and actinomyces species.
extracts from human dental plaque, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelli and actinomyces odontolyticus inhibited [3h]-thymidine uptake by primary human gingival fibroblast cell lines as previous work has shown in respect of hela cells. the results show that a variety of oral bacteria, not usually considered to be periodontal pathogens, elaborate factors that adversely affect fibroblasts.
bacteriocin from actinomyces odontolyticus with temperature-dependent killing properties.
a strain of actinomyces odontolyticus, originally isolated from human dental plaque, produced a non-dialyzable, trypsin-sensitive substance that was bactericidal for certain strains of bifidobacteria at 42 degrees c but not at 37 degrees c. detectable quantities of the bacteriocin were not produced in liquid media. experimentally useful yields were obtained by extraction from pour plate cultures of producer cells. at 42 degrees c, exponential killing did not occur until indicator cells had doubled at least once. at 37 degrees c, the bacteriocin effected a transient bacteriostasis. partially purified concentrates were obtained by diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography, and such material was not inactivated by ribonuclease, deoxyribonuclease, or lipase. pronase, trypsin, and exposure to 100 degrees c for 20 min completely abolished activity. inhibitory activity was considerably reduced by exposure to a ph of either 3 or 11. treatment of producer cells with curing agents did not induce a high frequency of non-bacteriocinogenic cells. the odontolyticin was adsorbed by susceptible, as well as resistant, bacteria.
