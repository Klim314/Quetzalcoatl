TI  - Culture-independent evaluation of the appendix and rectum microbiomes in children with and without appendicitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: The function of the appendix is largely unknown, but its microbiota likely contributes to function. Alterations in microbiota may contribute to appendicitis, but conventional culture studies have not yielded conclusive information. We conducted a pilot, culture-independent 16S rRNA-based microbiota study of paired appendix and rectal samples. METHODS: We collected appendix and rectal swabs from 21 children undergoing appendectomy, six with normal appendices and fifteen with appendicitis (nine perforated). After DNA extraction, we amplified and sequenced 16S rRNA genes and analyzed sequences using CLoVR. We identified organisms differing in relative abundance using ANOVA (p<0.05) by location (appendix vs. rectum), disease (appendicitis vs. normal), and disease severity (perforated vs. non-perforated). RESULTS: We identified 290 taxa in the study's samples. Three taxa were significantly increased in normal appendices vs. normal rectal samples: Fusibacter (p = 0.009), Selenomonas (p = 0.026), and Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.049). Five taxa were increased in abundance in normal vs. diseased appendices: Paenibacillaceae (p = 0.005), Acidobacteriaceae GP4 (p = 0.019), Pseudonocardinae (p = 0.019), Bergeyella (p = 0.019) and Rhizobium (p = 0.045). Twelve taxa were increased in the appendices of appendicitis patients vs. normal appendix: Peptostreptococcus (p = 0.0003), Bilophila (p = 0.0004), Bulleidia (p = 0.012), Fusobacterium (p = 0.018), Parvimonas (p = 0.003), Mogibacterium (p = 0.012), Aminobacterium (p = 0.019), Proteus (p = 0.028), Actinomycineae (p = 0.028), Anaerovorax (p = 0.041), Anaerofilum (p = 0.045), Porphyromonas (p = 0.010). Five taxa were increased in appendices in patients with perforated vs. nonperforated appendicitis: Bulleidia (p = 0.004), Fusibacter (p = 0.005), Prevotella (p = 0.021), Porphyromonas (p = 0.030), Dialister (p = 0.035). Three taxa were increased in rectum samples of patients with appendicitis compared to the normal patients: Bulleidia (p = 0.034), Dialister (p = 0.003), and Porphyromonas (p = 0.026). CONCLUSION: Specific taxa are more abundant in normal appendices compared to the rectum, suggesting that a distinctive appendix microbiota exists. Taxa with altered abundance in diseased and severely diseased (perforated) samples may contribute to appendicitis pathogenesis, and may provide microbial signatures in the rectum useful for guiding both treatment and diagnosis of appendicitis.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between april 2003 and march 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in abdominal surgery during the period from April 2005 to March 2006 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 384 strains including 18 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 161 (70.3%) of 229 patients with surgical infections. One hundred and ninty-five strains were isolated from primary infections, and 171 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp. in this order, and from postoperative infections, E. coli was the most predominantly isolated, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary and postoperative infections. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, nor multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa. But cefazolin-resistant E. coli producing extended spectrum fl-lactamase was seen in 5.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that the increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and Bilophila wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents--special references to bacteria isolated between April 2003 and March 2004].
AB  - Tendency of isolated bacteria from infections in general surgery during the period from April 2004 to March 2005 were investigated in a multicenter study in Japan, and the following results were obtained. In this series, 645 strains including 17 strains of Candida spp. were isolated from 226 (79.0%) of 286 patients with surgical infections. Three hundred and seventeen strains were isolated from primary infections, and 345 strains were isolated from postoperative infections. From primary infections, anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria were predominant, while aerobic Gram-positive bacteria were predominant from postoperative infections. The isolation rate of aerobic Gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus were higher from both types of infections. Among anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of Peptostreptococcus spp. was the highest from both types of infections. Among aerobic Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii in this order, and from postoperative infections, P. aeruginosa was the most predominantly isolated, followed by E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae. Among anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of Bacteroides fragilis group was the highest from both primary infections followed by Bilophila wadsworthia. While the isolation rate of B. fragilis group was also the highest from postoperative infections, the following bacteria were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and B. wadsworthia in this order. In this series, we noticed no vancomycin-resistant Gram-positive cocci, but a few strains of moderately arbekacin-resistant MRSA. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa but not multidrug-resistant was seen in 13.3 per cents. Also cefazolin-resistant E. coli probably producing extended spectrum beta-lactamase was seen in 7.0 per cents. We should be carefully followed up the facts that an increasing isolation rates of B. fragilis group and B. wadsworthia which were resistant to both penicillins and cephems.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin compared to seven other oral antimicrobial agents against aerobic and anaerobic pathogens isolated from antral sinus puncture specimens from patients with sinusitis.
AB  - Using a microbroth method for aerobes and agar dilution for anaerobes, we studied the comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, three fluoroquinolones, two macrolides and two beta-lactams, against 207 aerobic and 162 anaerobic antral sinus puncture isolates. Gemifloxacin was active at < or = 0.25 ug/mL against 198/207 [96%] aerobes and 127/162 [78%] anaerobes or 325/369 [88%] of all isolates and was the most active quinolone on a weight basis against Gram-positive organisms. All Haemophilus and Moraxella species were susceptible to < or =0.06 ug/mL of gemifloxacin. Thirty-five anaerobic isolates [35/162, 22%] required > or =0.5 ug/mL of gemifloxacin for inhibition, including all Prevotella species [all except one strain of P. bivia were susceptible to < or = 2 ug/mL] and occasional strains of Bacteroides uniformis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bilophila wadsworthia, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, Propionibacterium acnes, and Veillonella species. All fusobacteria were susceptible to < or =0.25 ug/mL of gemifloxacin. Based on our in vitro study results, we conclude that gemifloxacin may offer a therapeutic alternative for sinus infections.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activities of ABT-773 against 362 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of ABT-773, a novel ketolide antibiotic, against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined and compared to the activities of other antimicrobial agents. MICs at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=0.06 microg/ml for Actinomyces spp., Clostridium perfringens, Peptostreptococcus spp., Propionibacterium spp., and Porphyromonas spp. The MIC(50)s and MIC(90)s were </=0.06 and >32 microg/ml, respectively, for Eubacterium spp., Lactobacillus spp., Clostridium difficile, and Clostridium ramosum. The MIC(90) for Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides ureolyticus, and Campylobacter gracilis was 1 microg/ml, and that for Prevotella bivia and other Prevotella spp. was 0.5 microg/ml. The MIC(90) for Fusobacterium nucleatum was 8 microg/ml, and that for Fusobacterium mortiferum and Fusobacterium varium was >32 microg/ml. The MIC(90)s for the Bacteroides fragilis group were as follows: for B. fragilis, 8 microg/ml; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides ovatus, Bacteroides distasonis, and Bacteroides uniformis, >32 microg/ml; and for Bacteroides vulgatus, 4 microg/ml. Telithromycin MICs for the B. fragilis group were usually 1 to 2 dilutions higher than ABT-773 MICs. For all strains, ABT-773 was more active than erythromycin by 4 or more dilutions, and for some strains this drug was more active than clindamycin.
TI  - Bacteriology of histopathologically defined appendicitis in children.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute appendicitis is the most common surgical emergency in childhood. However, the pathogenesis and detailed microbiology are obscure. OBJECTIVE: To determine in detail the bacterial etiology of appendicitis in children in relation to the histologic tissue pathology. STUDY DESIGN: Tissue samples obtained at surgery from 41 children with suspected acute appendicitis were examined histologically and by culture for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria. The patients were analyzed according to histopathologic and clinical findings. RESULTS: Aerobic and anaerobic species were isolated from 40 of 41 (98%) samples; on average, 14.1 isolates per specimen (10.4 anaerobes and 3.7 aerobes). Specimens from patients with gangrenous appendices yielded significantly higher numbers of anaerobic isolates per specimen than did specimens from patients with healthy appendices (11.7 vs. 7.7; P < 0.01). Bacteria belonging to the Bacteroides fragilis group were the most frequently isolated anaerobic microorganisms (95%). Other organisms frequently isolated in all histology groups were Peptostreptococcus micros (66%), Bilophila wadsworthia (63%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (44%), Eggerthella lenta (44%) and a hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (41%). Of the aerobes Escherichia coli (88%) and Streptococcus anginosus group (former Streptococcus "milleri" group) organisms (61%) were the most frequent findings. CONCLUSIONS: The shift from histologically normal toward gangrenous appendices was clearly associated with markedly elevated anaerobic bacterial counts in terms of species. The unusually high frequencies of B. wadsworthia (75%) and the hitherto undescribed bile-resistant, pigment-producing Gram-negative rod (56%) in gangrenous appendices represent unique and different findings from those reported in adults.
TI  - In vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) and seven other antimicrobial agents against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - We assessed the in vitro activity of telithromycin (HMR 3647) and seven other antimicrobials against 292 strains of obligately anaerobic bacteria. MICs were determined with the microdilution technique and Wilkins-Chalgren broth according to DIN 58940-83. MIC50/MIC90s (mg/L) for telithromycin were 4/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides ovatus and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, 2/4 for Fusobacterium spp. and Bilophila wadsworthia, 2/2 for Bacteroides caccae, 1/4 for Bacteroides vulgatus, 0.25/4 for Prevotella spp., > or =0.03/0.5 for Clostridium spp. and 0.125/4 for Peptostreptococcus spp.
TI  - Comparative activity of moxifloxacin in vitro against obligately anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of moxifloxacin and seven other antibiotics (four of them quinolones) against 292 strains of obligately anaerobic bacteria was assessed employing a broth microdilution technique performed in Wilkens-Chalgren broth. MIC50/MIC90 values (mg/l) for moxifloxacin were as follows: Bacteroides fragilis (n = 62) 0.25/2, Bacteroides ovatus (n = 70) 1/4, Bacteroides vulgatus (n = 29) 0.25/1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (n = 17) 2/2, Bacteroides caccae (n = 11) 1/2, Prevotella spp. (n = 11) 0.25/2, Fusobacterium spp. (n = 17) 1/4, Bilophila wadsworthia (n = 29) 0.5/1, and Clostridium spp. (n = 29) 0.125/0.5, respectively. MIC50 values (mg/l) for Bacteroides distasonis (n = 8) and Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 9) were 0.25. The results indicated that moxifloxacin was almost as active as trovafloxacin, as active as gatifloxacin, and more active than levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin against the anaerobes tested.
TI  - Activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) compared to those of other oral antimicrobial agents against unusual anaerobes.
AB  - The activities of gemifloxacin (SB 265805, LB20304) and comparator agents were determined by an agar dilution method against 419 clinical strains of less-commonly identified species of anaerobes. Gemifloxacin was generally more active than trovafloxacin against gram-positive strains by one to two dilutions. Peptostreptococci (Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus micros, and Peptostreptococcus prevotii) and Porphyromonas spp. (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Porphyromonas canoris, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Porphyromonas macacae) were all susceptible to </=0.25 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml. The MICs of gemifloxacin at which 90% of the following strains were inhibited (MIC(90)s) were </=2 microgram/ml: Actinomyces israelii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Clostridium innocuum, Clostridium clostridioforme, Anaerobiospirillum spp., Bacteroides tectum, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Bacteroides gracilis (now Campylobacter gracilis), Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella heparinolytica, and the Prevotella oris-buccae group. Fusobacterium naviforme and Fusobacterium necrophorum were also susceptible to </=2 microgram of gemifloxacin per ml, while Fusobacterium varium strains exhibited a bimodal pattern; the other Fusobacterium species, such as Fusobacterium ulcerans and Fusobacterium russii, as well as Veillonella spp., the Prevotella melaninogenica group, Prevotella bivia, Clostridium difficile, and Bilophila wadsworthia were relatively resistant to gemifloxacin (MIC(90)s, >/=4 microgram/ml).
TI  - Bilophila wadsworthiain brain abscess: case report.
AB  - A case of a patient with a 20-year history of chronic otitis media complicated by cholesteatoma and brain abscess is described. A CT scan with contrast material showed three abscess cavities in the right cerebellar hemisphere. A culture from a specimen of the cholesteatoma yielded a significant amount of growth of Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and a moderate growth of alpha-streptococci and Staphylococcus simulans. From the pus of the brain abscess we also isolated numerous Bilophila wadsworthia, Bacteroides fragilis and Prevotella oris and some Prevotella buccae and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. No aerobes were present. The patient underwent a craniotomy and the biggest abscess was removed together with the capsule. The antimicrobial therapy included penicillin plus metronidazole and later augmentin. The result of the treatment was a complete cure and total recovery of the patient. This is the first documentation of isolation of B. wadsworthia in chronic otitis media and in brain abscess.
TI  - In vitro activities of trovafloxacin against 557 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of trovafloxacin for 557 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique. The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (n = 91), other members of the B. fragilis group (n = 130), Campylobacter gracilis (n = 15), other Bacteroides spp. (n = 16), Prevotella spp. (n = 49), Porphyromonas spp. (n = 15), Fusobacterium spp. (n = 62), Bilophila wadsworthia (n = 24), Sutterella wadsworthensis (n = 21), Clostridium spp. (n = 61), Peptostreptococcus spp. (n = 38), and gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (n = 35). Trovafloxacin inhibited all strains of B. fragilis at < or = 0.5 microgram/ml, 99% of other B. fragilis group species at < or = 2 micrograms/ml, and 96% of all anaerobes tested at < or = 2 micrograms/ml.
TI  - In vitro activity of DU-6859a against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of a new quinolone agent, DU-6859a, against 330 strains of anaerobic bacteria was determined by using the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth brucella laked blood agar method; the activity of DU-6859a was compared with those of amoxicillin-clavulanate (2:1), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, clindamycin, fleroxacin, imipenem, lomefloxacin, metronidazole, sparfloxacin, and temafloxacin. DU-6859a and chloramphenicol inhibited all of the isolates at concentrations of 1 and 16 micrograms/ml, respectively; amoxicillin-clavulanate, imipenem, and metronidazole inhibited > or = 94% of the isolates at their respective breakpoints (8, 8, and 16 micrograms/ml). MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible were 1 to 5 twofold dilutions lower than those of the other quinolones for every group of organisms. MICs of DU-6859a at which 90% of the strains were susceptible (total numbers of strains tested are in parentheses) were < or = 0.25 micrograms/ml for Bacteroides fragilis (57), other B. fragilis group species (84), Bilophila wadsworthia (15), Clostridium species (27) (including C. difficile, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum), Fusobacterium nucleatum (16), Fusobacterium mortiferum-F. varium group species (10), Peptostreptococcus species (20), non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (20), and Prevotella species (25).
TI  - In vitro activity of Bay Y3118 against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of a new quinolone, Bay Y3118, was determined against  326 strains of anaerobic bacteria and compared with the activities of ampicillin-sulbactam, cefotetan, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole, and sparfloxacin. The National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards-approved Wadsworth agar dilution technique with Brucella-laked blood agar was used throughout the study. Breakpoints used to determine the percent susceptible were 2 micrograms/ml for Bay Y3118 and sparfloxacin, 4 micrograms/ml for clindamycin, 8 micrograms/ml for imipenem, 16 micrograms/ml for metronidazole and ampicillin-sulbactam, and 32 micrograms/ml for cefotetan. Species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (57 strains), other B. fragilis group species (79 strains), Bacteroides gracilis (10 strains), other Bacteroides spp. (9 strains), Prevotella spp. (30 strains), Porphyromonas spp. (9 strains), Fusobacterium spp. (36 strains), Bilophila wadsworthia (14 strains), Clostridium spp. (36 strains), Peptostreptococcus spp. (20 strains), and gram-positive non-spore-forming rods (26 strains). Bay Y3118 inhibited all but 1 of 326 anaerobic bacteria tested at the breakpoint level or lower.
TI  - Recent taxonomic changes for anaerobic gram-positive and selected gram-negative organisms.
AB  - The strains formerly classified as Streptococcus anginosus or "Streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, Streptococcus anginosus, Streptococcus constellatus, and Streptococcus intermedius. Streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus Gemella. Four new species within the genus Peptostreptococcus were recently named. A recent addition to the genus Clostridium is Clostridium argentinense, which includes Clostridium botulinum type G. Two new species of Actinomyces have been introduced: Actinomyces georgiae and Actinomyces gerencseriae. Arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed Propionibacterium propionicum. Eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. Lactobacillus uli and Lactobacillus rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. Bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. Wolinella recta and Wolinella curva are now included in the genus Campylobacter. The taxonomic position of Mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family Bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
