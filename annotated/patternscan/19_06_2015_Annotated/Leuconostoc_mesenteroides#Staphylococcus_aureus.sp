TI  == the influence of the cell free solution of lactic acid bacteria on tyramine production by food borne-pathogens in tyrosine decarboxylase broth.
AB  == the function of cell-free solutions (cfss) of lactic acid bacteria (lab) on tyramine and other biogenic amine production by different food borne-pathogens (fbps) was investigated in tyrosine decarboxylase broth (tdb) using hplc. cell free solutions were prepared from four lab strains. two different concentrations  which were 50% (5 ml cfs+5 ml medium/1:1) and 25% (2.5 ml cfs+7.5 ml medium/1:3)  cfs and the control without cfs were prepared. both concentration of cfs of streptococcus thermophilus and 50% cfs of pediococcus acidophilus inhibited tyramine production up to 98% by salmonella paratyphi a. tyramine production by escherichia coli was also inhibited by 50% cfs of lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and 25% cfs of leuconostoc lactis. subsp. cremoris. the inhibitor effect of 50% cfs of p. acidophilus was the highest on tyramine production (55%) by listeria monocytogenes, following lc. lactis subsp. lactis and leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris (20%) whilst 25% cfs of leu. mes. subsp. cremoris and lc. lactis subsp. lactis showed stimulator effects (160%). the stimulation effects of 50% cfs of s. thermophilus and lc. lactis subsp. lactis were more than 70% by staphylococcus aureus comparing to the control. cfs of lab strains showed  statistically inhibitor effect since lactic acid inhibited microbial growth, decreased ph quickly and reduced the formation of amn and bas. consequently, in order to avoid the formation of high concentrations of biogenic amines in fermented food by bacteria, it is advisable to use cfs for food and food products.

TI  == technological aptitude and applications of leuconostoc mesenteroides bioactive strains isolated from algerian raw camel milk.
AB  == two strains (b7 and z8) of the leuconostoc mesenteroides subspecies mesenteroides that were isolated from algerian camel milk from an initial pool of 13 strains and demonstrated a high ability to inhibit the growth of listeria spp. were selected and characterised at the phenotypic and genotypic levels. probiotic profiling and inhibition spectra against food borne pathogens in mixed cultures were also investigated. the bacteriocin produced by l. mesenteroides strain b7 was identified as leucocin b by specific pcr. in vitro studies demonstrated that  both leuconostoc mesenteroides strains exhibited a marked probiotic profile, showing high survival at low ph (2-3 and 4) in the presence of 0.5%, 1%, and 2% of bile salts and at ph 3 in the presence of 3 mg/ml pepsin. susceptibility testing against antimicrobial agents was also performed for both strains. when tested in a mixed culture with listeria innocua, listeria ivanovii, or staphylococcus aureus, strain b7 reduced the numbers of these species by 1.87, 1.78, and 1.38 log units, respectively. consequently, these two strains were found to possess good probiotic properties in vitro and a high capacity for listeria spp. inhibition in mixed cultures. therefore, these strains have a favourable technological aptitude and a potential application as novel probiotic  starters.

TI  == effects of bile salt deconjugation by probiotic strains on the survival of antibiotic-resistant foodborne pathogens under simulated gastric conditions.
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the effects of bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains on the antibiotic susceptibility of antibiotic-sensitive and multiple antibiotic-resistant salmonella typhimurium and staphylococcus aureus. eight probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus brevis kacc 10553, lactobacillus casei kacc 12413, lactobacillus paracasei atcc 25598, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, leuconostoc mesenteroides kacc 12312, and pediococcus acidilactici kacc 12307, were used to examine bile acid tolerance. the ability to deconjugate bile acids was evaluated  using both thin-layer chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography.  the antibiotic susceptibility testing was carried out to determine the synergistic inhibitory activity of deconjugated bile acids. l. acidophilus, l. brevis, and p. acidilactici showed the most tolerance to the conjugated bile acids. p. acidilactici deconjugated glycocholic acid and glycodeoxycholate from 3.18 and 3.09 mm to the detection limits, respectively. the antibiotic susceptibility of selected foodborne pathogens was increased by increasing the concentration of deconjugated bile acids. the study results are useful for understanding the relationship between bile acid deconjugation by probiotic strains and antibiotic susceptibility in the presence of deconjugated bile acids, and they may be useful for designing new probiotic-antibiotic combination therapy based on bile acid deconjugation.

TI  == short communication: characterization of microflora in mexican chihuahua cheese.
AB  == this work was performed to identify the bacterial species present in 10 chihuahua cheeses obtained from commercial producers in mexico using 16s rrna gene analysis. as expected, some of the agar media initially used for isolation were not very selective, supporting the growth of several unrelated bacterial species. sequence analysis identified potential pathogens, including escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus, in all raw milk samples and 2 pasteurized milk samples. streptococcus thermophilus and lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis were identified in  9 and 6 samples, respectively, and would serve as acidifying agents during cheese production. lactobacilli were identified in all cheeses, with the most prevalent  being lactobacillus plantarum identified in 7 raw milk and 1 pasteurized milk cheeses. leuconostoc mesenteroides and streptococcus macedonicus were identified  in 4 raw milk cheeses and both were present in all pasteurized milk samples, suggesting that they may play a role in the development of traditional chihuahua  cheese attributes.

TI  == assessment of cell surface properties and adhesion potential of selected probiotic strains.
AB  == aim: to evaluate the physicochemical cell surface and adhesive properties of selected probiotic strains for human use. methods and results: probiotic strains, bifidobacterium longum b6, lactobacillus acidophilus adh, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and pediococcus acidilactici were tested for the physicochemical properties of cell surfaces and the adhesion abilities against foodborne pathogens. bif. longum b6 (53.6%) and lact. rhamnosus gg (46.5%) showed the highest hydrophobicity, while the least affinity to xylene was observed in ped. acidilactici (10.4%). bifidobacterium longum b6 showed the strongest coaggregation phenotype with listeria monocytogenes (53.0%), shigella boydii (42.0%) and staphylococcus aureus (45.9%). lactobacillus rhamnosus gg had the strong binding ability to caco-2 cells and effectively inhibited the adhesion of  l. monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, sh. boydii and staph. aureus to caco-2  cells. the hydrophobicity was highly correlated with coaggregative abilities and  competitive inhibition, suggesting a good relationship between in vitro adhesion  and in vivo colonization. conclusion: the results suggest that bif. longum b6 and lact. rhamnosus gg can be candidate probiotics available for human consumption. significance and impact of the study: because the use of probiotic strains has been more concerned with their beneficial effects in the gi tract, it is essential to examine the potential of probiotic strains based on the physicochemical properties in terms of bacterial-binding and adhesion capabilities.

TI  == functional properties of selected starter cultures for sour maize bread.
AB  == this paper focuses on the functional properties of maize sour-dough microflora selected and tested for their use as starter cultures for sour maize bread. lactic acid bacteria and yeasts isolated from spontaneously fermented maize dough were selected based on dominance during fermentation and presence at the end of fermentation. functional properties examined included acidification, leavening and production of some antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting matrix. the organisms previously identified as lactobacillus plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. fermentum, lb. acidophilus, pediococcus acidilactici, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc dextranicum and saccharomyces cerevisiae were used singly and as  mixed cultures in the fermentation (fermentation time: 12h at 28+/-2 degrees c) of maize meal (particle size >0.2mm). the ph fell from an initial value of 5.62-3.05 in maize meals fermented with lb. plantarum; 4.37 in l. dextranicum+s.  cerevisiae compared with the value for the control (no starter) of 4.54. significant differences (p <or =0.05) were observed in values obtained for the functional properties tested when starters were inoculated compared with the control (no starter) except for leavening. bivariate correlations at 0.01 levels  (two-tailed) showed that significant correlations existed among ph and production of antimicrobial compounds in the fermenting meals, the highest correlation being between production of diacetyl and acid (0.694), a positive correlation indicating that production of both antimicrobial compounds increase together with time. antimicrobial activities of the fermented maize dough were confirmed by their abilities to inhibit the growth of salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and aspergillus flavus from an initial inoculum concentration of 7 log cfu ml(-1)) for test bacteria and zone of inhibition of up to 1.33 cm for aflatoxigenic a. flavus. the findings of this study form a database for further studies on the development of starter cultures for sour maize bread production as an alternative bread specialty.

TI  == succession of dominant and antagonistic lactic acid bacteria in fermented cucumber: insights from a pcr-based approach.
AB  == the goal of the investigation was to study the succession of major groups of lactic acid bacteria (lab) and their antagonism in salt-fermented cucumber using  pcr. in a direct detection method as well as a short enrichment process, pcr enabled detection of leuconostoc and lactobacillus during early hours of fermentation. subsequently, lactobacillus and pediococcus emerged as the dominant genera. nucleic acid sequence of culture-independent clones confirmed the detection of pediococcus as a dominant genera emerging during late stages of fermentation. pcr also revealed time-dependent emergence of mesentericin, pediocin and plantaricin a producers and accounted for the lab succession in the  fermenting samples. a total of 328 lab isolates were obtained collectively from 30 cucumber samples, of which pcr could identify an overwhelming 186 lactobacillus isolates followed by 113 pediococcus and 29 leuconostoc isolates, respectively. based on antimicrobial assay against target strain leuconostoc mesenteroides nrrl b640, 28% of the lab were bacteriocin producers, of which pediocin producers were substantial, followed by plantaricin a and mesentericin producers. the bacteriocins elaborated by the isolates were active against a large number of gram-positive target lab strains and pathogenic bacteria including bacillus cereus, enterobacter aerogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == isolation and identification of a paenibacillus polymyxa strain that coproduces a novel lantibiotic and polymyxin.
AB  == a new bacterial strain, displaying potent antimicrobial properties against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria, was isolated from food. based on its phenotypical and biochemical properties as well as its 16s rrna gene sequence, the bacterium was identified as paenibacillus polymyxa and it was designated as strain osy-df. the antimicrobials produced by this strain were isolated from the fermentation broth and subsequently analyzed by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. two antimicrobials were found: a known antibiotic, polymyxin e1, which is active against gram-negative bacteria, and an  unknown 2,983-da compound showing activity against gram-positive bacteria. the latter was purified to homogeneity, and its antimicrobial potency and proteinaceous nature were confirmed. the antimicrobial peptide, designated paenibacillin, is active against a broad range of food-borne pathogenic and spoilage bacteria, including bacillus spp., clostridium sporogenes, lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis, leuconostoc mesenteroides, listeria spp., pediococcus cerevisiae, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus agalactiae. furthermore, it  possesses the physico-chemical properties of an ideal antimicrobial agent in terms of water solubility, thermal resistance, and stability against acid/alkali  (ph 2.0 to 9.0) treatment. edman degradation, mass spectroscopy, and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to sequence native and chemically modified paenibacillin. while details of the tentative sequence need to be elucidated in future work, the peptide was unequivocally characterized as a novel lantibiotic,  with a high degree of posttranslational modifications. the coproduction of polymyxin e1 and a lantibiotic is a finding that has not been reported earlier. the new strain and associated peptide are potentially useful in food and medical  applications.

TI  == pih01, a small cryptic plasmid from leuconostoc citreum ih3.
AB  == a small cryptic plasmid pih01 from leuconostoc citreum ih3 was characterized. this 1.8-kb sized plasmid contains single open reading frame that encodes a repc  class protein (342 amino acids) and a conserved pt181-type double strand origin,  suggesting a rolling circle replication mode. this putative replicase protein shows the highest similarity to a replicase from pfr18 plasmid of leuconostoc mesenteroides fr52 (64% identity), one of the pt181-type rolling circle plasmid family and contains a strictly conserved repc-type active site sequence of pt181  family. a shuttle vector that was developed on the basis of this cryptic plasmid  by insertion of both erythromycin resistance gene (ermc) from pe194 and escherichia coli cole1 origin was able to transform leuconostoc strains, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactococcus lactis. therefore, pih01 derivative plasmids might be useful for the manipulation of leuconostoc strains.

TI  == new expression system tightly controlled by zinc availability in lactococcus lactis.
AB  == here we developed the new expression system p(zn) zitr, based on the regulatory signals (p(zn) promoter and zitr repressor) of the lactococcus lactis zit operon, involved in zn(2+) high-affinity uptake and regulation. a p(zn) zitr-controlled expression vector was constructed, and expression regulation was studied with two reporter genes, uspnuc and laclm; these genes encode, respectively, a protein derived from staphylococcus aureus secreted nuclease and leuconostoc mesenteroides cytoplasmic beta-galactosidase. nuclease and beta-galactosidase activities of l. lactis mg1363 cells expressing either uspnuc or laclm under the  control of p(zn) zitr were evaluated on plates and quantified from liquid cultures as a function of divalent metal ion, particularly zn(2+), availability in the environment. our results demonstrate that p(zn) zitr is highly inducible upon divalent cation starvation, obtained either through edta addition or during  growth in chemically defined medium, and is strongly repressed in the presence of excess zn(2+). the efficiency of the p(zn) zitr expression system was compared to that of the well-known nisin-controlled expression (nice) system with the same reporter genes cloned under either p(zn) zitr or p(nisa) nisrk control. laclm induction levels reached with both systems were on the same order of magnitude, even though the nice system is fivefold more efficient than the p(zn) zitr system. an even smaller difference or no difference was observed after 3 h of induction when nuclease was used as a reporter for western blotting detection. p(zn) zitr proved to be a powerful expression system for l. lactis, as it is tightly controlled by the zinc concentration in the medium.

TI  == characterization of mesentericin st99, a bacteriocin produced by leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99 isolated from boza.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-fermented beverage from belogratchik, bulgaria, were screened for the production of bacteriocins. with the first screening, 13 of the 52 isolates inhibited the growth of listeria innocua and lactobacillus plantarum. the cell-free supernatant of one of these strains, classified as leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. dextranicum st99, inhibited the growth of bacillus subtilis, enterococcus faecalis, several lactobacillus spp., lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris, listeria innocua, listeria monocytogenes, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus thermophilus. clostridium spp., carnobacterium spp., l. mesenteroides and gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. maximum antimicrobial activity, i.e. 6,400 arbitrary units (au)/ml, was recorded in mrs broth after 24 h at 30 degrees c. incubation in the presence of protease iv and pronase e resulted in loss of antimicrobial activity, confirming that growth inhibition was caused by a bacteriocin, designated here as mesentericin st99. no  loss in activity was recorded after treatment with alpha-amylase, sds, tween 20,  tween 80, urea, triton x-100, n-laurylsarcosin, edta and phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride. mesentericin st99 remained active after 30 min at 121 degrees c and after 2 h of incubation at ph 2 to 12. metabolically active cells of l. innocua treated with mesentericin st99 did not undergo lysis. mesentericin st99 did not adhere to the cell surface of strain st99. precipitation with ammonium sulfate (70% saturation), followed by sep-pack c18 chromatography and reverse-phase hplc on a c18 nucleosil column yielded one antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of rosemary extracts.
AB  == a rosemary extract commercially exploited (oxy'less) as an antioxidant of lipids  in foods was dissolved in ethanol (100 mg/ml), and the solution was tested against foodborne microorganisms. for gram-positive bacteria, the mic of the ethanolic solution was 1% for leuconostoc mesenteroides, 0.5% for listeria monocytogenes, 0.5% for staphylococcus aureus, 0.13% for streptococcus mutans, and 0.06% for bacillus cereus. it slowed the growth of penicillium roquefortii and botrytis cinerea. up to 1% of the ethanolic solution had no activity on the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, and erwinia carotovora and on the yeasts rhodotorula glutinis and cryptococcus laurentii. antibacterial activity of the rosemary extract was strongly influenced by the composition of the media. the mic was reduced by low ph, high nacl contents, and  low temperatures. low ph and high nacl concentration had a synergistic effect on  the mic of the rosemary extract for s. aureus. lipids, surface-active agents, and some proteins decreased its antibacterial activity, whereas pectin had no effect. the inhibitory effect was little modified by heat treatment (100 degrees c). the  natural microflora of pasteurized zucchini broth was inhibited by 0.5% of the rosemary extract. the antibacterial activity was linked to the compounds extracted with hexane, which are presumably phenolic diterpenoids.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial properties of recombinant asabf, an antimicrobial peptide  isolated from the nematode ascaris suum.
AB  == asabf is a csalphabeta-type antimicrobial peptide that contains four intramolecular disulfide bridges (y. kato and s. komatsu, j. biol. chem. 271:30493-30498, 1996). in the present study, a recombinant asabf was produced by using a yeast expression system, and its antimicrobial activity was characterized in detail. the recombinant asabf was active against all gram-positive bacteria tested (7 of 7; minimum bactericidal concentration [mbc], 0.03 to 1 microg/ml) except leuconostoc mesenteroides, some gram-negative bacteria (8 of 14; mbc, >0.5 microg/ml), and some yeasts (3 of 9; mbc >3 microg/ml). slight hemolytic activity (4.2% at 100 microg/ml) against human erythrocytes was observed only under low-ionic-strength conditions. less than 1 min of contact was enough to kill staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538p. the bactericidal activity against s. aureus was inhibited by salts.

TI  == interaction of hydrostatic pressure, time and temperature of pressurization and pediocin ach on inactivation of foodborne bacteria.
AB  == high hydrostatic pressure, because it can kill microorganisms, is being investigated for potential use as a nonthermal food preservation method. the objective of this study was to determine the hydrostatic pressurization parameters, pressure, time, and temperature, and a bacteriocin that in combination would destroy 7 to 8 log cycles of pathogenic and spoilage bacterial  populations. we suspended cells of staphylococcus aureus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, lactobacillus sake, leuconostoc mesenteroides, serratia liquefaciens, and pseudomonas fluorescens in peptone solution and exposed them to the combination of treatments. the combined parameters used were hydrostatic pressure (138 to 345 mpa), time (5 to 15 min), temperature (25 to 50 degrees c), and pediocin ach (3,000 au/ml, final concentration). in general, cell death increased as the pressure, time, or temperature increased; however, the cells developed proportionately greater sensitivity as the pressure increased to 276 mpa and higher and the temperature increased above 35 degrees c. pressurization for longer than 5 min, especially at lower pressure and temperature ranges, had very little added benefit. among the four gram-negative species, e. coli o157:h7 was the most resistant to pressurization while among the four gram-positive species, l. sake and l. mesenteroides had greater resistance. the death rate at high pressure (345 mpa) and high temperature (50 degrees c) in combination followed first-order kinetics; at lower pressure and temperature combination it showed a late tailing effect. estimated d value data indicated that even at 345 mpa and 50 degrees c an 8-log-cycle viability loss could not be achieved within 5 min for all eight species. however, when pediocin ach was included during pressurization this loss  was achieved.

TI  == a sensitive equilibrium-based assay for d-lactate using d-lactate dehydrogenase:  application to penicillin-binding protein/dd-carboxypeptidase activity assays.
AB  == an assay for d-lactate (d-lac) is described where d-lac in the presence of nad+ is equilibrated to nadh and pyruvate (pyr) by leuconostoc mesenteroides d-lactate dehydrogenase (dldh). this assay was standardized using known concentrations of d-lac and a linearized form of the equilibrium expression. the assay has a lower  limit of about 20 microm d-lac in a 1 ml assay mixture (20 nmol d-lac). as a demonstration of this assay method it is used to characterize the hydrolysis of the standard penicillin-binding protein/dd-carboxypeptidase substrate ac2-l-lys-d-ala-d-lac by penicillin-binding protein 5 from escherichia coli. the  approach adopted here of using an inherently nonlinear response, which however follows precisely determinable physical behavior, has the advantages of providing a wider dynamic range and increased relative precision over analogous linear response-based methods. this approach may be applicable to the development of other enzyme-based assay methods.

TI  == heterogeneity of the vana gene cluster in clinical isolates of enterococci from the northeastern united states.
AB  == in several strains of enterococcus faecium isolated in europe, the cluster of genes encoding high-level resistance to vancomycin (vana phenotype) resides on a  10.85-kb transposon, tn1546, or closely related elements. to determine whether tn1546 was conserved in recent enterococcal isolates from the northeastern united states, seven strains were compared by restriction mapping and dna hybridization  with probes from within the van cluster. two of the seven strains contained intact tn1546-like sequences; however, in five of the strains, the organization of the van cluster differed from that of tn1546. three of the five strains with variations harbored a novel dna segment within the van gene cluster. this 1,496-bp segment was similar to is1165 of leuconostoc mesenteroides and is1181 of staphylococcus aureus and was flanked by 24- and 23-bp imperfect inverted repeats and 8-bp direct repeats. on the basis of these findings, we propose that this element comprises a novel insertion-like sequence, is1251. multiple copies of is1251 were also present at other sites in both resistant and susceptible clinical isolates. our findings suggest that the van cluster in recent isolates from the northeastern united states differs from that present in the early european vana phenotype strains.

TI  == binding studies of vancomycin to the cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors by affinity capillary electrophoresis.
AB  == the ability of vancomycin to bind three cytoplasmic peptidoglycan precursors in bacterial species was studied using affinity capillary electrophoresis (ace). the ace binding assay was established with the normal precursor, udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-ala, from staphylococcus aureus 209p under conditions where vancomycin served as substrate ligand included in the buffer system. this precursor was found to bind to vancomycin with a binding constant of 1.6 x 10(-5) m-1 (or a dissociation constant of 62.5 microm) obtained from scatchard plots. no migration shifting was observed under the same conditions for the other two precursors from leuconostoc mesenteroides vr1 and lactobacillus casei 7469, suggesting structural modifications at the stem peptide terminus. the reduction of their affinity to vancomycin is consistent with proposed structures, udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-(l-ala)-d-ala-d-lactate and udp-n-acetylmuramyl-l-ala-d-glu-l-lys-d-ala-d-lactate, from l. mesenteroides vr1  and l. casei 7469, respectively, based on mass spectrometry. this rapid technique provides additional evidence in the understanding of one mechanism of bacterial resistance.

TI  == isolation and characterization of is1181, an insertion sequence from staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == the repeated nucleotide sequence isolated from a methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus isolate displays the characteristic features of an insertion sequence and was named is1181. it has a size of 1512 bp and consists of a 1359-bp open reading frame that encodes a 439-amino-acid protein which is predicted to be highly basic and 23-bp terminal inverted complementary repeated sequences exhibiting six mismatches. the three copies of is1181 isolated from distinct parts of the chromosome of s. aureus, bm3121, are flanked at their ends  by 8-bp direct repeats, suggesting a duplication of the target sequence. is1181 exhibits similarities with is1165 from leuconostoc mesenteroides and is1001 from  bordetella parapertusis. is1181 was detected in at least two to eight copies in 41 of the 52 s. aureus isolates tested, whereas none of the 26 coagulase-negative staphylococci, 24 streptococci, or 11 enterococci analyzed carried nucleotide sequences hybridizing with is1181.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of shredded carrot extracts on food-borne bacteria and yeast.
AB  == purified ethanolic extracts of peeled and shredded carrots showed an antimicrobial effect against a range of food-borne micro-organisms. the minimum inhibitory concentration, expressed as mg ml-1 dried carrot material used for the extraction were: leuconostoc mesenteroides, 27; listeria monocytogenes, > 27 < 55; staphylococcus aureus, > 27 < 55; pseudomonas fluorescens, > 55 < 110; candida lambica, > 55 < 110; escherichia coli, > 110 < 220. the antimicrobial activity was not linked to phenolic compounds but was presumably due to apolar components. free saturated fatty acid (dodecanoic acid) and methyl esters of saturated fatty acids (of dodecanoic and pentadecanoic acids) were identified in  purified active extracts of carrots by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry and could be responsible for the antimicrobial activity. this effect did not seem to play a role in the resistance of shredded carrots to microbial spoilage, although the antimicrobial activity was present in fresh carrots at concentrations sufficient to inhibit spoilage bacteria.

AB  == cultures of lactic acid bacteria, mostly from foods, were tested for their effect on the growth of staphylococcus aureus in trypticase soy broth (bbl). some of the effectors, e.g., streptococcus faecalis, s. faecium, lactobacillus lactis, l. brevis, and leuconostoc mesenteroides, stimulated growth of s. aureus during early hours of growth, especially at higher temperatures of incubation, but most  cultures were inhibitory, and some (s. faecium and l. mesenteroides) were even killing by the time of attainment of the maximal phase of growth of the staphylococcus. low-temperature meat lactobacilli and leuconostoc dextranicum inhibited s. aureus at 10, 15, 20, and 25 c throughout its growth. streptococcus  faecalis var. liquefaciens inhibited at these temperatures and at 30 and 37 c, as well. when the ratio of effectors to staphylococci in the inoculum was 100:1, the three enterococci, the meat lactobacillus, and l. dextranicum prevented the attainment of 5 x 10(6) staphylococci per milliliter at 15 c, and all but the meat lactobacillus did so at 22 c. a ratio of 1:1 accomplished similar results at 15 c, except that s. aureus was only delayed for 12 hr by s. faecalis. a ratio of 1:100 usually was ineffective. in general, the more effector bacteria there were  in the inoculum, the greater was the overall inhibition (or stimulation) of s. aureus. inhibition was most effective at 10 or 15 c, less so at 20 or 25 c, and least at 30 or 37 c, whereas stimulation during early growth was greater at the higher temperatures. results with different strains of the effectors and with two strains of s. aureus were similar, for the most part.
