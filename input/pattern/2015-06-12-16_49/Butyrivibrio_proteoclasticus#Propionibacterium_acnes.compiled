TI  - Ricinoleic acid inhibits methanogenesis and fatty acid biohydrogenation in ruminal digesta from sheep and in bacterial cultures.
AB  - Ricinoleic acid (RA; 12-hydroxy-cis-9-18:1) is the main fatty acid component of castor oil. Although a precursor for CLA synthesis in lactic acid bacteria, RA was found previously not to form CLA in ruminal digesta but to have some inhibitory properties. The present study was undertaken to evaluate the potential of RA to modulate ruminal biohydrogenation and methanogenesis. Ruminal digesta from 4 sheep receiving a mixed hay-concentrate diet was incubated in vitro with 0.167 g/L of linoleic acid (LA; cis-9,cis-12-18:2) or with a combination of LA and RA or LA and castor oil (LA, RA, and castor oil added to a final concentration of 0.167 g/L) in the presence and absence of lipase. The CLA rumenic acid (cis-9,trans-11-18:2) accumulated when either RA or castor oil and lipase was present. Vaccenic acid (VA; trans-11-18:1) also accumulated, and a decrease of the rate of production of stearic acid (SA; 18:0) was observed. When LA was incubated with castor oil in the absence of lipase, no effects on biohydrogenation were observed. Ricinoleic acid at 0.02 g/L did not affect growth of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens but it inhibited growth of Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus. Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus but not B. fibrisolvens metabolized RA to 12-hydroxystearate. Linoleic acid metabolism by B. proteoclasticus appeared to be unaffected by RA addition whereas rumenic acid accumulation increased (P = 0.015 at 12 h) when RA was added. A 28% decrease (P = 0.004) in methane was obtained in 24 h in vitro incubations of diluted buffered ruminal fluid with added 0.2 g RA/L. There was no effect on the total concentration of VFA after 24 h as a result of RA addition, but the molar proportions of acetate and butyrate were decreased (P = 0.041 and P < 0.001, respectively) whereas that of propionate increased (P < 0.001). It was concluded that, at least in vitro, RA or the combination of castor oil and lipase inhibit biohydrogenation, causing the accumulation of rumenic acid and VA, with potential health benefits for ruminant products. The effect appeared to be mediated via an inhibitory effect on the biohydrogenating activity of B. proteoclasticus. An added environmental benefit could be a concomitant decrease in methane emissions. In vivo studies are now required to confirm the potential of these additives.
TI  - Metabolism of conjugated linoleic acids and 18 : 1 fatty acids by ruminal bacteria: products and mechanisms.
AB  - Cultures of ruminal bacteria known to metabolize unsaturated fatty acids were grown in medium containing 50 microg ml(-1) of geometric and positional isomers of conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) or 18 : 1 fatty acids and 37.4 % deuterium oxide to investigate the mechanisms responsible for fatty acid metabolism. Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens JW11 converted cis-9,trans-11-18 : 2 and trans-9,trans-11-18 : 2 to trans-11-18 : 1 as the main product, labelled at C-9, and metabolized trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2 to trans-10-18 : 1, labelled at C-13, and smaller amounts of trans-12-18 : 1 and cis-12-18 : 1. Butyrivibrio proteoclasticus P-18 did not grow in the presence of cis-9,trans-11-18 : 2 or trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2, but grew in medium containing trans-9,trans-11-18 : 2, forming 18 : 0. Propionibacterium acnes, a ruminal species that isomerizes linoleic acid to trans-10,cis-12-18 : 2, did not metabolize CLA isomers further. B. fibrisolvens metabolized small amounts of trans-10-18 : 1, trans-11-18 : 1 and cis-9-18 : 1, but the products formed were not detected. B. proteoclasticus, on the other hand, carried out substantial conversion of 18 : 1 substrates to 18 : 0. P. acnes hydrated cis-9-18 : 1 and trans-11-18 : 1 to 10-OH-18 : 0, which was further oxidized to yield 10-O-18 : 0. The deuterium enrichment in the intermediates formed during incubations with 9,11 geometric isomers of CLA was about half that of the products from trans-10,cis-12 CLA and 18 : 1 isomers, suggesting that the reduction of 9,11 geometric isomers CLA by ruminal bacteria occurs via different mechanisms compared with the metabolism of other unsaturated fatty acids.
