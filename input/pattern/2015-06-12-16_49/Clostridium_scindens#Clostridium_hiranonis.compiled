TI  - Bacterial conversion of secoisolariciresinol and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol.
AB  - AIMS: It has been investigated whether secoisolariciresinol (SECO) and anhydrosecoisolariciresinol (AHS), an acid degradation product of SECO, could be fermented in a similar way, and to a similar extent, by members of the intestinal microbiota. METHODS AND RESULTS: AHS and SECO were demethylated by Peptostreptococcus productus, Eubacterium limosum and Clostridium methoxybenzovorans. These bacteria have been identified as members of the human intestinal flora or closely related species. Demethylated AHS and demethylated SECO were purified by preparative RP-HPLC, and subsequently subjected to fermentation with Eggerthella lenta, Clostridium scindens and Clostridium hiranonis. Eggerthella lenta efficiently dehydroxylated demethylated SECO to enterodiol, whereas the other bacteria showed no dehydroxylation activity. CONCLUSIONS: The conversion of the diol structure of SECO into the furan ring in AHS did not influence the demethylation capability of the tested bacteria. The results also showed that the extent of dehydroxylation of demethylated AHS was much lower than that of demethylated SECO. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Plant lignans are converted into bioactive mammalian lignans by the human intestinal bacteria. This study showed that the modification of plant lignans resulted in the formation a new type of mammalian lignan.
TI  - Development and application of a polymerase chain reaction assay for the detection and enumeration of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria in human feces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary bile acids are synthesized in the human colon from the bacterial 7alpha-dehydroxylation of primary bile acids. Increased levels of secondary bile acids have been correlated with an increased risk of colon cancer and cholesterol gallstone disease. Based on 16s rDNA sequence analysis, stock cultures of bacterial strains with bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation all belong to the genus Clostridium. METHODS: We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay that can specifically amplify the baiCD gene, specific to bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation pathway. The PCR primer pair was designed using known nucleotide sequences from two different baiCD genes described for Clostridium scindens VPI 12708 and Clostridium hiranonis TO931. Although the DNA sequences of these genes were <70% identical, several regions were conserved enough to design primers with little or no redundancy. RESULTS: The PCR assay was effective in detecting the baiCD gene in several strains known to exhibit bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylation activity. The PCR assay also detected the baiCD gene in DNA extracted from fecal dilution series and correlated with the levels of cholic acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria detected by activity assays. The PCR assay was sensitive enough to detect the baiCD gene in DNA samples extracted directly from as little as 0.5 mg feces. CONCLUSIONS: This new method should be useful for the monitoring of levels of bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating bacteria in human fecal samples.
TI  - PCR detection method of Clostridium scindens and C. hiranonis in human fecal samples.
AB  - Clostridium scindens and C. hiranonis have high bile acid 7alpha-dehydroxylating  activity. Direct PCR and nested PCR with the specific primers for C. scindens and C. hiranonis were developed and tested for the detection of them in human fecal samples. Nested PCR detected C. scindens in all samples, but direct PCR detected it in 27 of 34 samples. Regarding C. hiranonis, nested PCR detected it in only 18 of 34 samples although nested PCR has a high level of sensitivity. Nested PCR was a specific and sensitive method for the detection of C. scindens and C. hiranonis in fecal samples.
