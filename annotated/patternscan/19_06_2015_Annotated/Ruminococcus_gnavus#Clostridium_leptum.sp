TI  == butyrylated starch intake can prevent red meat-induced o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine adducts in human rectal tissue: a randomised clinical trial.
AB  == epidemiological studies have identified increased colorectal cancer (crc) risk with high red meat (hrm) intakes, whereas dietary fibre intake appears to be protective. in the present study, we examined whether a hrm diet increased rectal o6-methyl-2-deoxyguanosine (o6meg) adduct levels in healthy human subjects, and whether butyrylated high-amylose maize starch (hamsb) was protective. a group of  twenty-three individuals consumed 300 g/d of cooked red meat without (hrm diet) or with 40 g/d of hamsb (hrm+hamsb diet) over 4-week periods separated by a 4-week washout in a randomised cross-over design. stool and rectal biopsy samples were collected for biochemical, microbial and immunohistochemical analyses at baseline and at the end of each 4-week intervention period. the hrm diet increased rectal o6meg adducts relative to its baseline by 21 % (p< 0.01), whereas the addition of hamsb to the hrm diet prevented this increase. epithelial proliferation increased with both the hrm (p< 0.001) and hrm+hamsb (p< 0.05) diets when compared with their respective baseline levels, but was lower following the hrm+hamsb diet compared with the hrm diet (p< 0.05). relative to its baseline, the hrm+hamsb diet increased the excretion of scfa by over 20 % (p< 0.05) and increased the absolute abundances of the clostridium coccoides group (p< 0.05), the clostridium leptum group (p< 0.05), lactobacillus spp. (p< 0.01),  parabacteroides distasonis (p< 0.001) and ruminococcus bromii (p< 0.05), but lowered ruminococcus torques (p< 0.05) and the proportions of ruminococcus gnavus, ruminococcus torques and escherichia coli (p< 0.01). hrm consumption could increase the risk of crc through increased formation of colorectal epithelial o6meg adducts. hamsb consumption prevented red meat-induced adduct formation, which may be associated with increased stool scfa levels and/or changes in the microbiota composition.

TI  == ribosomal dna sequence analysis of mucosa-associated bacteria in crohn's disease.
AB  == background: enteric bacteria are implicated in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease (cd); however, no specific causative organisms have been identified. aims: this study was undertaken to correlate disease activity with changes in intestinal biota in patients with cd. subjects: ribosomal dna analysis was used to explore the composition of the intestinal biota in patients with (1) cd undergoing colonoscopy, (2) cd undergoing surgical resection, and (3) no inflammatory bowel disease. methods: primers targeting bacterial 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) were used to amplify bacterial dna associated with active cd lesions,  comparable normal tissue from patients with cd, and normal control tissue. each amplicon was cloned. seven hundred thirty-nine rdna clones were sequenced from 16 biopsies from cd patients, 15 surgical samples, and 10 biopsies from normal control patients. results: known extracellular or intracellular pathogens were not found. no rdna sequence, phylogenetic group, or subgroup was consistently associated with cd lesions compared with normal tissues from the same patients. colonic biopsies from cd-afflicted patients compared with biopsies from normal control subjects had an increase in facultative bacteria; in small bowel, cd patients had an increase in the ruminococcus gnavus subgroup with a decrease in the clostridium leptum and prevotella nigrescens subgroups. however, differences  in small bowel may have reflected individual variation rather than disease association. surgical samples showed differences when compared with biopsy-derived samples. conclusions: these findings suggest that cd is not caused by invasive pathogens associated specifically with the sites of lesions but that  dysbiosis exists in this condition.
