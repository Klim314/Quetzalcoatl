TI  == clostron-mediated engineering of clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium is a diverse assemblage of gram positive, anaerobic, endospore-forming bacteria. whilst certain species have achieved notoriety as important animal and human pathogens (e.g. clostridium difficile, clostridium botulinum, clostridium tetani, and clostridium perfringens), the vast majority of the genus are entirely benign, and are able to undertake all manner of useful biotransformations. prominent amongst them are those species able to produce the  biofuels, butanol and ethanol from biomass-derived residues, such as clostridium  acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinkii, clostridium thermocellum, and clostridium phytofermentans. the prominence of the genus in disease and biotechnology has led to the need for more effective means of genetic modification. the historical absence of methods based on conventional strategies  for "knock-in" and "knock-out" in clostridium has led to the adoption of recombination-independent procedures, typified by clostron technology. the clostron uses a retargeted group ii intron and a retro-transposition-activated marker to selectively insert dna into defined sites within the genome, to bring about gene inactivation and/or cargo dna delivery. the procedure is extremely efficient, rapid, and requires minimal effort by the operator.

TI  == small rnas in the genus clostridium.
AB  == the genus clostridium includes major human pathogens and species important to cellulose degradation, the carbon cycle, and biotechnology. small rnas (srnas) are emerging as crucial regulatory molecules in all organisms, but they have not  been investigated in clostridia. research on srnas in clostridia is hindered by the absence of a systematic method to identify srna candidates, thus delegating clostridial srna research to a hit-and-miss process. thus, we wanted to develop a method to identify potential srnas in the clostridium genus to open up the field  of srna research in clostridia. using comparative genomics analyses combined with predictions of rho-independent terminators and promoters, we predicted srnas in 21 clostridial genomes: clostridium acetobutylicum, c. beijerinckii, c. botulinum (eight strains), c. cellulolyticum, c. difficile, c. kluyveri (two strains), c. novyi, c. perfringens (three strains), c. phytofermentans, c. tetani, and c. thermocellum. although more than one-third of predicted srnas have shine-dalgarno (sd) sequences, only one-sixth have a start codon downstream of sd sequences; thus, most of the predicted srnas are noncoding rnas. quantitative reverse transcription-pcr (q-rt-pcr) and northern analysis were employed to test the presence of a randomly chosen set of srnas in c. acetobutylicum and several c. botulinum strains, leading to the confirmation of a large fraction of the tested  srnas. we identified a conserved, novel srna which, together with the downstream  gene coding for an atp-binding cassette (abc) transporter gene, responds to the antibiotic clindamycin. the number of predicted srnas correlated with the physiological function of the species (high for pathogens, low for cellulolytic,  and intermediate for solventogenic), but not with 16s rrna-based phylogeny.

TI  == phylogenomic analyses of clostridia and identification of novel protein signatures that are specific to the genus clostridium sensu stricto (cluster i).
AB  == the species of clostridium comprise a very heterogeneous assemblage of bacteria that do not form a phylogenetically coherent group. it has been proposed previously that only a subset of the species of clostridium that form a distinct  cluster in the 16s rrna tree (cluster i) should be regarded as the true representatives of the genus clostridium (i.e. clostridium sensu stricto). however, this cluster is presently defined only in phylogenetic terms, and no biochemical, molecular or phenotypic characteristic is known that is unique to species from this cluster. we report here phylogenomic and comparative analyses based on sequenced clostridial genomes in an attempt to bridge this gap and to clarify the evolutionary relationships among species of clostridia. in phylogenetic trees for species of clostridia based on concatenated sequences for  37 highly conserved proteins, the species of clostridium cluster i formed a strongly supported clade that was separated from all other clostridia by a long branch. several other clostridium species that are not part of this cluster grouped reliably with other species of clostridia in a number of well-resolved clades. our comparative genomic analyses have identified three conserved indels in three highly conserved proteins (a 4 aa insert in dna gyrase a, a 1 aa deletion in atp synthase beta subunit and a 1 aa insert in ribosomal protein s2)  that are unique to the species of clostridium cluster i and are not found in any  other bacteria. blastp searches on various proteins in the genomes of clostridium tetani e88 and clostridium perfringens sm101 have also identified more than 10 proteins that are found uniquely in the cluster i species. these results provide  evidence that the species of clostridium cluster i not only are phylogenetically  distinct but also share many unique molecular characteristics. these newly identified molecular markers provide useful tools to define and circumscribe the  genus clostridium sensu stricto in more definitive terms. we have also identified a 7-9 aa conserved insert in the enzyme phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase that is uniquely found in the clostridium thermocellum, thermoanaerobacter pseudethanolicus, thermoanaerobacter tengcogensis and caldicellulosiruptor saccharolyticus homologues, and is absent from all other bacteria. these species  form a well-defined clade in the phylogenetic trees and this indel provides a potential molecular marker for this clostridial cluster.
