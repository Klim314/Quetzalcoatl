TI  == molecular detection of bacteria associated to dental caries in 4-12-year-old tunisian children.
AB  == the occurrence of several microbial species in the oral cavity of 4-12-year-old tunisian children was investigated. samples were taken from 158 children (81 caries actives and 77 caries free). genomic dna was extracted and analyzed for the presence of 17 microbial species using a polymerase chain reaction assay. all samples were positive for at least one of the target microbial strains. streptococcus mutans was the most prevalent species (76.5%) detected in genomic dna collected from carious lesions. other prevalent species were candida spp (63%), streptococcus salivarius (59%) and streptococcus oralis (42%). the frequency of lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus plantarum, and lactobacillus casei-group in caries lesions was 29.5%, 34.5% and 22% respectively. pathogenic bacteria such as staphylococcus aureus was found in 28.5% of carious lesion samples compared to 15.5% in the control. frequency of porphyromonas endodontali, actinomyces radicidentis and treponema denticola recovery did not differ significantly between origins of samples. pcr analysis of genomic dna detect various oral bacteria that differ between caries actives and caries-free children. in addition, the association of same aciduric bacteria (s.  mutans, s. salivarius, l. acidophilus) and caries formation was noticed.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179 displays probiotic potential in vitro and protects against trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (tnbs)-induced colitis and salmonella infection in murine models.
AB  == lactobacillus fermentum aca-dc 179, lactobacillus plantarum aca-dc 287 and streptococcus macedonicus aca-dc 198 were studied for their probiotic potential.  firstly, strains were screened for antimicrobial activity towards a broad range of target strains, including lactic acid bacteria, food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria. l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was active against five streptococci, including the two pathogenic strains streptococcus oralis lmg 14532t and streptococcus pneumoniae lmg 14545t. s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 was active against the majority  of the strains tested, including not only lactic acid bacteria but also many food spoilage or pathogenic species. the three potential probiotic strains were found  to survive variably at ph 2.5 and were unaffected by bile salts. only s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 exhibited bile salt hydrolase activity, while none of the  strains was haemolytic. moreover, strains exhibited variable susceptibility towards commonly used antibiotics. l. plantarum aca-dc 287 and s. macedonicus aca-dc 198 induced the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokines il-12, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. also elevated levels of the anti-inflammatory il-10 were observed with l. fermentum aca-dc 179. this strain consequently was found to significantly reduce colitis in a tnbs-induced colitis mouse model. furthermore, l. fermentum aca-dc 179 was successfully applied in an experimental salmonella-infection mouse model. to conclude, strain l. fermentum aca-dc 179 possesses desirable probiotic properties, such as antimicrobial activity and immunomodulation in vitro, which were confirmed in vivo by the use of animal models.

TI  == microbial flora of sinus tracts and root canals of non-vital teeth.
AB  == the occurrence of bacteria in 12 endodontically induced periodontal lesions associated with sinus tracts was examined. the microbial flora encountered in the sinus tract was compared with that of the root canal of the involved teeth which  had not experienced any prior endodontic therapy. all microbiological samples taken from the sinus tract and from the root canal system contained bacteria. seventy-one strains were detected in the extraradicular lesions. of the anaerobic species, fusobacterium nucleatum (7 strains), prevotella intemedia (4 strains) and p. oralis (4 strains) were most frequently found. in the group of the facultative anaerobes streptococcus spp. were predominant. ninety-four strains were isolated from the root canal system of the 12 teeth. p. intermedia (6 strains), p. buccae (5 strains), f. nucleatum (5 strains) and lactobacillus plantarum (5 strains) were most common. in 9 cases, species present in the root canal could be revealed in the extraradicular lesions. it was concluded that a variety of microorganisms were capable of colonizing endodontically induced, extraradicular lesions clinically characterized by sinus tracts.

TI  == immunobiological activities of bacteria isolated from the root canals of postendodontic teeth with persistent periapical lesions.
AB  == although intraradicular bacteria are widely considered to be the primary etiological agents of periapical lesions, the immunobiological properties of the  species in question are not adequately known. the aim of this study, therefore, was to investigate the pathobiological properties of the 10 most frequently isolated endodontopathic bacterial species. using cellular components of the pathogens obtained by sonic extraction, we have investigated their ability to induce monocyte migration, interleukin 1 production, mitogenic responses of lymphocytes, and the polyclonal activation of b lymphocytes. it was found that all of the tested species enhanced the migration of monocytes and induced mitogenesis in b lymphocytes. the polyclonal activation of b cells and the induction of interleukin 1 by monocytes were found to be stronger in gram-negative anaerobes. furthermore, all of the tested species excluding bacteroides oralis were poor t cell mitogens. these findings show that a wide range of pathobiological properties are attributable to the most frequently isolated endodontic pathogens. it thus seems plausible that a battery of complex  immunological responses induced by such microbes lead to the formation of persistent periapical lesions.
