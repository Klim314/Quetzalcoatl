TI  == levels of selenomonas species in generalized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria associated with canine periodontal disease.
AB  == periodontal disease is one of the most common diseases of adult dogs, with up to  80% of animals affected. the aetiology of the disease is poorly studied, although bacteria are known to play a major role. the purpose of this study was to identify the bacteria associated with canine gingivitis and periodontitis and to  compare this with the normal oral flora. swabs were obtained from the gingival margin of three dogs with gingivitis and three orally healthy controls, and subgingival plaque was collected from three dogs with periodontitis. samples were subjected to routine bacterial culture. the prevalent species identified in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups were uncultured bacterium (12.5% of isolates), bacteroides heparinolyticus/pasteurella dagmatis (10.0%) and actinomyces canis (19.4%), respectively. bacteria were also identified using culture-independent methods (16s rrna gene sequencing) and the predominant species identified were pseudomonas sp. (30.9% of clones analysed), porphyromonas cangingivalis (16.1%) and desulfomicrobium orale (12.0%) in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups, respectively. uncultured species accounted for 13.2%, 2.0% and 10.5%, and potentially novel species for 38.2%, 38.3% and 35.3%, of clones in the normal, gingivitis and periodontitis groups, respectively. this is the first study to use utilise culture-independent methods  for the identification of bacteria associated with this disease. it is concluded  that the canine oral flora in health and disease is highly diverse and also contains a high proportion of uncultured and, in particular, potentially novel species.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of diterpenes from viguiera arenaria against endodontic bacteria.
AB  == six pimarane-type diterpenes isolated from viguiera arenaria baker and two semi-synthetic derivatives were evaluated in vitro against a panel of representative microorganisms responsible for dental root canal infections. the microdilution method was used for the determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) against porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, prevotella buccae, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacteroides fragilis, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, peptostreptococcus micros, enterococcus faecalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the compounds ent-pimara-8(14),15-dien-19-oic acid, its sodium salt and ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-3beta-ol were the most active, displaying mic values ranging from 1 to 10 mug ml-1. the results also allow us to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to the discovery of new chemicals for use as a complement to instrumental endodontic procedures.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == influence of local tetracycline on the microbiota of alveolar osteitis in rats.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the effects of local tetracycline on the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in rats, and on the microbiota associated to  this infection. forty wistar rats were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n=10): i -  the rats had the maxillary right incisor extracted and the alveolar wound did not receive any treatment; ii - adrenaline and ringer-pras were introduced into the alveolar wound; iii - the alveolar wound was irrigated with sterile saline; and iv - the alveolar wound was irrigated with an aqueous solution of tetracycline. microbial samples from the alveolar wounds were collected 2 days after surgery and inoculated on blood agar (with and without 8 microg/ml of tetracycline) and other selective media, and were incubated in either aerobiosis or anaerobiosis at 37 degrees c, for 2 to 14 days. it was verified that tetracycline reduced the occurrence of alveolar osteitis in the rats and caused significant changes in the microbiota of the surgical sites, decreasing the number of anaerobes and increasing the participation of tetracycline-resistant and multi-resistant microorganisms.

TI  == urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections due to anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == anaerobes have been involved in many different types of urinary tract infection.  this review describes the microbiology, diagnosis and management of urinary tract and genito-urinary suppurative infections caused by anaerobic bacteria. the types of infections of the urinary tract in which anaerobes have been involved include  para- or periurethral cellulitis or abscess, acute and chronic urethritis, cystitis, acute and chronic prostatitis, prostatic and scrotal abscesses, periprostatic phlegmon, ureteritis, periureteritis, pyelitis, pyelonephritis, renal abscess, scrotal gangrene, metastatic renal infection pyonephrosis, perinephric abscess, retroperitoneal abscess and other infections. the anaerobes  recovered in these studies were gram-negative bacilli (including bacteroides fragilis and pigmented prevotella and porphyromonas sp.), clostridium sp., anaerobic gram-positive cocci and actinomyces sp. in many cases, they were recovered mixed with coliforms or streptococci. the recovery of anaerobes requires the administration of antimicrobial therapy that is effective against these organisms. these antimicrobials include metronidazole, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, a carbapenem, cefoxitin and the combination of a penicillin and a beta-lactamase inhibitor. percutaneous drainage, open surgical drainage or nephectomy might be indicated for abscesses.

TI  == characteristics of brain abscess with isolation of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == in view of its localization, brain abscess (ba) usually requires medical and surgical care. a broad spectrum of bacteria is involved. recent reports stress the increasing frequency of anaerobes, but their impact has not been well evaluated. a retrospective review was conducted of all episodes of documented ba  admitted in a tertiary-care hospital over a 10 y period. ba due to anaerobic bacteria (group a) were compared with other cases (group b) to determine the frequency and eventual characteristics of ba with isolated anaerobic bacteria. between 1991 and 2000, ba were diagnosed in 42 patients (28m, 14f, mean age 54.6  y). no differences in clinical features and laboratory findings were found between patients with ba caused by anaerobic (n = 22) and only aerobic (n = 20) bacteria. using appropriate microbiological techniques, 41 anaerobic bacteria strains were isolated in 22 of 42 patients (52.4%) with ba. anaerobic bacteria were associated with aerobic strains in 5 patients (12%), whereas in 17 patients  (40.5%) only anaerobic strains were isolated in cerebral puncture cultures. the most frequently isolated species were fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 14), prevotella sp. (n = 8), actinomyces sp. (n = 6) and bacteroides sp. (n = 4). compared with group b, group a had more cases of a single abscess (p = 0.03) and  ear, nose and throat (ent) as a source of infection (p = 0.04), and seemed to have a better outcome (p = 0.07). these results emphasize the important role that anaerobic bacteria play in ba. the presence of such pathogens must be evoked when faced with a single abscess, an ent infection, or both. therapy should take into  account this high frequency.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to other micro-organisms in adult refractory periodontitis.
AB  == forty-six adult periodontal patients, selected on the basis of clinical examination, and 46 adult healthy subjects were examined. the subgingival plaque  samples from one inflammatory and one non-inflammatory site of each periodontal patient were studied to determine porphyromonas gingivalis prevalence related to  other periodontal micro-organisms and to periodontal tissue destruction. the results showed porphyromonas gingivalis as the main pathogenic micro-organism isolated in the inflammatory sites together with bacteroides forsythus. peptostreptococcus sp., actinomyces sp. and prevotella sp. were found as a normal oral flora in the healthy subjects. fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus and eikenella corrodens were detected both in inflammatory and in non-inflammatory sites of periodontal patients as well as in  the healthy subjects.

TI  == intrauterine bacterial findings and hormonal profiles in post-partum cows with normal puerperium.
AB  == the post-partum intrauterine bacterial flora, prostaglandin release, uterine involution and resumption of ovarian activity were studied in 9 swedish dairy cows during the first 8-week period. uterine involution was monitored by transrectal examinations of the reproductive tract 3 times weekly. bacteriological examination was performed from twice weekly uterine biopsies. the main pgf2 alpha metabolite (15-ketodihydro-pgf2 alpha) was monitored from twice daily blood plasma samples, while morning samples were used for progesterone determinations. the cows were assigned to 2 groups: group i (n = 7) with an uncomplicated puerperal period and group ii (n = 2) with signs of intrauterine infections. a total of 143 biopsies were collected, of which 129 (90.2%) were found to be bacteriologically negative. thirteen (9.1%) of the remaining 14 biopsies were bacteriologically positive, while one (0.7%) was probably a contamination on a single occasion. the 13 bacteriologically positive biopsies belonged to the group ii cows from which 31 isolates contained 6 different genera of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria. actinomyces pyogenes along with bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium necrophorum were found to predominate in a mixed flora. the bacteria were rapidly eliminated and disappeared completely from the uteri towards the end of the third week post-partum. the average number of days required for completion of uterine involution was 21.8 +/- 3.0 for all animals. the plasma levels of the pgf2 alpha metabolite were significantly elevated for the first 12-18, and 18 and 27 days in group i and group ii, respectively. there was no significant relationship between the duration of pgf2  alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution (p > 0.05). progesterone analysis showed resumption of ovarian activity and subsequent ovulation in 4 of the 9 cows 44-55 days post-partum. thus, intrauterine infections are not commonly seen in cows with normal calving and comparison between the duration of pgf2 alpha release and the time required for completion of uterine involution showed insignificant correlation. however, the longer duration of pgf2 alpha release recorded in the 2 cows with intrauterine infections are related to the increased frequency of infections.

TI  == sub-gingival microflora in macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey.
AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp. (66%, 0-2.6), capnocytophaga sp. (30%), eikenella corrodens (4.7%, 0), campylobacter sp. (28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic bacteriology of intracranial abscesses.
AB  == the bacteriologic and clinical findings of 39 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. twenty-three children presented with brain abscess and 16 with subdural empyema. predisposing conditions were present in all instances. sinusitis was present in 25 children and 4 patients each had chronic otitis media, dental abscess, and congenital heart disease. the abscess was located in the frontal area in 14 patients, parietal in 13, and temporal in 12. anaerobic organisms alone were recovered in 22 patients (56%), aerobic bacteria alone in 7 (18%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in 10 (26%) patients.  there were 79 anaerobic isolates (2 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (29 isolates); bacteroides sp. (12, including 5 bacteroides fragilis group), fusobacterium sp. (14 isolates); and prevotella sp.  and actinomyces sp. (6 isolates each). a total of 17 aerobic or facultative isolates (0.4 per specimen), including 11 gram-positive cocci and 6 haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. nine patients (i.e., 6 with sinusitis and subdural empyema, 3 with sinusitis and brain abscess) did not respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess,  and required surgical drainage of inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

TI  == [effects of antibiotics and anti-bacterial components of preparations for local treatment of suppurative wounds on pathogens of odonto- genic infections].
AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

TI  == studies on the possible role of cattle nuisance flies, especially hydrotaea irritans, in the transmission of summer mastitis in denmark.
AB  == the summer mastitis pathogens actinomyces pyogenes, peptococcus indolicus, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii, fusobacterium necrophorum and streptococcus dysgalactiae were isolated from the polyphagous symbovine dipterans hydrotaea irritans (fallen) and morellia sp. caught around dairy heifers on pasture, but not from the haematophagous species haematobia irritans (l.), haematobosca stimulans (meigen), culicoides sp. and simulium sp. secretions from  clinical cases of summer mastitis proved to be sources of summer mastitis bacteria for more than 3 weeks despite antibiotic treatment and teat amputation.  taking into account the seasonal activity pattern of hydrotaea irritans and its topographical distribution on grazing cattle, it appears evident that this fly may play a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the bacterial contamination with summer mastitis pathogens on the teats of healthy cattle. in the present study the survival of a.pyogenes and p.indolicus for 7 days in experimentally infected hydrotaea irritans, as demonstrated by the recovery of these microorganisms from agar plates exposed to live infected flies, is described. however, experimental transmission of summer mastitis from sick to healthy heifers by hydrotaea irritans proved unsuccessful.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == changes in subgingival microbiota during puberty. a 4-year longitudinal study.
AB  == it was the purpose of the present investigation to monitor the composition of the subgingival microbiota at selected sites in individuals passing through puberty and to correlate observed changes with the development of pubertal maturation. between the ages of 11 and 14 years, pubertal and skeletal maturation was monitored annually in 22 boys and 20 girls. during this time, subgingival microbial samples were taken every 4th to 5th month (10 times in 4 years) mesially of the upper first molars. high values in total bacterial counts were reached after the onset of puberty, followed by a decrease towards the end of the observation period. the frequency of detection of actinomyces odontolyticus and of capnocytophaga sp. increased with time. the frequencies of other selected species, specifically of black pigmenting bacteriodes sp. were not found to increase when tested by linear and quadratic models of time trend. however, a statistically significant rise in the frequency of detecting b. intermedius and b. melaninogenicus was noted in the initial pubertal phase identified by the onset of testicular growth in boys (p = 0.05). a significant relationship also existed between testes growth and increase of a. odontolyticus (p less than 0.01). in girls, a similar increase was obtained for a. odontolyticus when studied in relation to the tanner scores for breast development (p less than 0.01). the changes observed in the subgingival microbiota during puberty may be related to the development of gingivitis, which was demonstrated by a higher tendency for gingival bleeding during the course of the pubertal maturation process.

TI  == microbial changes associated with the development of puberty gingivitis.
AB  == in this study, longitudinal changes in the composition of the subgingival microbiota of children between the ages of 11 and 14 and their association with changes of clinical parameters describing gingival health were investigated. during 4 years, subgingival microbial samples were taken in 22 boys and 20 girls  10 times. at the same time the gingival bleeding tendency was recorded by the papillary bleeding index (pbi). a total of 840 samples was evaluated using darkfield microscopy and anaerobic culturing on non-selective and selective media. children, who developed a marked and sustained increase in mean pbi scores (n = 21), had higher frequencies and mean proportions of spirochetes and eikenella corrodens than children without pronounced puberty gingivitis (p less than = 0.05). the mean proportion of actinomyces viscosus was also higher in these children (p less than = 0.05). among the species discriminated, only capnocytophaga sp. were found at a higher rate in samples taken immediately before a rise of pbi (p less than = 0.05). the detection frequencies of black-pigmented bacteroides (particularly b. intermedius) increased later, and were significantly elevated after the establishment of a high bleeding tendency (p less than = 0.05). these findings implicate capnocytophaga sp. in the initiation of puberty gingivitis, whereas the increased presence of bacteroides may reflect a change in the subgingival environment secondary to increased bleeding.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  == in the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. as a matter of fact it has been  proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation  (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). on the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved.  in endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. the most frequently found obligate anaerobes are bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. (gram- rods) anaerobic diphtheroides (gram+ rods) peptostreptococcus sp. (gram+ cocci) and veilonella sp. (gram- cocci). actinomyces sp., lactobacillus sp., streptococcus sp., and staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.

TI  == glucanase-producing organisms in human dental plaques.
AB  == selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran-  and starch-containing media. all sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. the glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. of these 38% were gram-positive rods, 27% gram-positive cocci, 28% gram-negative rods and 7% were gram-negative cocci.  the cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and gram-negative anaerobes. species prominent among these isolates included streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema  matruchotii, bifidobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp. no isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as streptococcus milleri, rothia dentocariosa or fusobacterium sp. this study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. in order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.

TI  == [microbiological changes in subgingival flora after treatment with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid].
AB  == the association amoxicillin-clavulanic acid can be employed as an alternative to  the usual antibiotic therapy of periodontitis. the purpose of this study was to determine subgingival microbial changes in 33 patients with periodontitis after using amoxicillin (500 mgrs.-t.i.d.) and clavulanic acid (125 mgrs.-t.i.d.) for 5 days. it resulted clinically in a decrease of both gingival index and plaque index (not significant) and microbiologically in absence of the main bacterial pathogens found pretreatment, such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides intermedius, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces sp., although it was not able to eliminate actinobacillus asinomycetemcomitans from a juvenile periodontitis and from a prepuberal periodontitis patient. atibiotic susceptibility testing showed  that all bacteria tested were sensitive to this antibiotic. although this short term study shows good microbial response of main periodontal pathogens, long term studies are necessary to assess the effect of this antibiotic in periodontitis therapy.

TI  == fusobacterium necrophorum and actinomyces pyogenes associated facial and mandibular abscesses in blue duiker.
AB  == anaerobic and aerobic cultures of facial and mandibular abscesses were made from  12 blue duiker (cephalophus monticola fusicolor) housed at the deer and duiker research facility of the pennsylvania state university (usa). increases in concentrations of total protein and serum globulin occurred in all cases. actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from nine animals. fusobacterium necrophorum was present in eight and bacteroides sp. was found in seven animals; other genera of isolated bacteria included: streptococcus (from two animals), lactobacillus (one), staphylococcus (one) and actinomyces (two). eight (67%) of affected animals were less than or equal to 2 yr of age. facial soft tissues and mandibles were the tissues most often affected. tissues within the oral cavity were not affected at the time of presentation. a common finding, not reported in other host species with necrobacillosis, was the presence of nondestructive mandibular  proliferation.

TI  == relationship of subgingival microbial complexes to clinical features at the sampled sites.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples from 100 active destructive periodontal lesions and 150 inactive subgingival sites in 33 subjects were analyzed by predominant cultivable microbiota techniques. 50 isolates were characterized from each sample and where possible, the isolate was placed in 1 of 134 microbial species or groups. the sites were clustered on the basis of the proportions of all of the species detected in each sample using a minimum similarity matching coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. 10 clusters containing 166 sites were formed which exhibited greater than 35% minimum similarities. all clusters were made up of sites from multiple subjects and were formed on the basis of different combinations of micro-organisms. certain complexes of micro-organisms appeared to relate to the severity of periodontal destruction and the activity of the sampled site. the combination of f. nucleatum, b. forsyth and w. recta (cluster vii) or b. gingivalis, b. intermedius and s. intermedius (cluster viii) distinguished clusters made up of sites which on average had the most attachment loss and the deepest pockets. these clusters contained the highest proportions of active sites and sites which lost greater than 3 mm of attachment after therapy. clusters dominated by v. parvula (cluster iii), the actinomyces sp. (cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == the predominant cultivable microbiota of active and inactive lesions of destructive periodontal diseases.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were taken from active and inactive lesions in 33 subjects exhibiting active destructive periodontal diseases. active diseased sites were those which showed a significant loss of attachment within a 2-month interval as computed by the "tolerance method". the predominant cultivable species from 100 active sites were compared with those found in 150 inactive sites of comparable pocket depth and attachment level loss. among the 33 subjects, w. recta, b. intermedius, f. nucleatum, b. gingivalis and b. forsythus  were elevated more often in active sites; whereas, s. mitis, c. ochracea, s. sanguis ii, v. parvula and an unnamed actinomyces sp. were elevated in inactive sites. the likelihood of a site being active was increased if b. forsythus, b. gingivalis, p. micros, a. actinomycetemcomitans, w. recta, or b. intermedius were detected in that site, and decreased if s. sanguis ii, the actinomyces sp., or c. ochracea were detected.

TI  == susceptibility of anaerobic bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the antimicrobial susceptibility of 1,117 clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria was determined by the agar dilution technique. metronidazole was the most active  agent; only propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces sp. isolates were resistant.  clindamycin and chloramphenical were the next most effective agents. beta-lactam  antibiotics, with the exception of penicillin, were active against most anaerobes other than the bacteroides fragilis group. at a breakpoint of 8 mg/l, 25% of fusobacterium spp. and 30% of the non-fragilis bacteroides spp. were resistant to penicillin. the highest resistance to beta-lactams was seen in the b. fragilis group. within the indole-positive members of the group, resistance rates of 71% were seen for cefoxitin, 49% for moxalactam, 79% for cefotaxime, 22% for piperacillin and 89% for penicillin. we conclude that metronidazole has the most  predictable in vitro activity against common clinical anaerobic isolates and that resistance to beta-lactams was frequent and of potential clinical importance as these latter agents are frequently used in the prophylaxis and therapy of mixed anaerobic infections.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == normal cultivable microflora in upper jejunal fluid in children without gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == bacteriological studies of uncontaminated upper jejunal fluid were performed in 51 danish children without gastrointestinal disorders. thirty-seven percent of the samples were sterile [less than 10(1) colony-forming units (cfu)/ml]. in 25%  of the cases, the total number of microorganisms exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml. the microorganisms isolated most frequently were: streptococcus, sp. ("viridans group"), veillonella parvula, hemophilus parainfluenzae, lactobacillus, sp., corynebacterium, sp., actinomyces, sp., bacteroides, sp., and hemophilus influenzae, each found in more than 10% of the children. the upper range for the  number of microorganisms isolated exceeded 10(5) cfu/ml for most of the species isolated of which the vast majority belonged to an "oral type" of flora. enterococci were isolated in small numbers in three children, and enterobacteriaceae were not found.

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == relationship between oxygen tension and subgingival bacterial flora in untreated  human periodontal pockets.
AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.

TI  == recovery of microorganisms from synovial and pleural fluids of animals using hyperosmolar media.
AB  == l-phase (cwd) broth and plate media were used in parallel with conventional microbiological media during a 3-year period for culturing synovial and pleural fluids of animals. two kinds of recoveries were obtained where parallel conventional methods were negative: (1) parent or normal bacteria, in very low numbers; and (2) type b cwd variants in equally low numbers. organisms in group 1 were: streptococcus zooepidemicus from horses (2x); beta-hemolytic streptococci,  lancefield gp. g (2x); staphylococcus aureus; actinobacillus, and actinomyces viscosus. group 2 consisted of bacteroides sp., propionibacterium acnes, and three "nocardia-like" sp. catalase + actinomyces was not recovered equally well on cwd plates as on conventional media with fluids obtained during ampicillin treatment. this occurred in spite of the fact that the cwd media was shown to support growth and reversion of laboratory induced l-phase variants of nocardia caviae and n. asteroides, and had facilitated recovery of a bacteroides l-phase variant from a pleural fluid. the nature of this fault in the media is under investigation in this laboratory.

AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings in 19 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. ten children presented with subdural empyema  and nine had brain abscess. sinusitis was present in 14 children, and dental abscess in two. the abscess was located in the frontal and parietal area in seven instances each, and in the temporal area in five. anaerobic organisms alone were  recovered in 12 (63%) of the patients (including eight with subdural empyema and  four with brain abscess), aerobic bacteria alone were present in two children (11%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in five (26%) patients. there were 43 anaerobic isolates (2.3 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (16 isolates); bacteroides sp. (10,  including two b. fragilis); fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and actinomyces sp. (five isolates). a total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five gram-positive cocci and three haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. five patients, four with  sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not  respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

TI  == bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  == the plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. when the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the actinomyces sp. at the expense of the streptococcus sp. in particular, the percentage of actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. a. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. when the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, a. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but a. viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis  developed. the availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. the bacteriological profile showed that when  bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of a. viscosus and b. melaninogenicus increased significantly. these findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.
