TI  == type aii lantibiotic bovicin hj50 with a rare disulfide bond: structure, structure-activity relationships and mode of action.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesized antimicrobial peptides containing unusual amino acids. as promising alternatives to conventional antibiotics, they  have a high potential for alleviating the problem of emergent antibiotic resistance, with possible applications in many industries that have antibacterial demand. bovicin hj50 is a type aii lantibiotic, the largest group of lantibiotics, comprising a linear n-terminal region and a globular c-terminal region. interestingly, bovicin h50 has a disulfide bond that is rare in this group. owing to limited information about the spatial structures of type aii lantibiotics, the functional regions of this type and the role of the disulfide bond are still unknown. in the present study, we resolved the solution structure  of bovicin hj50 using nmr spectroscopy. this is the first spatial structure of a  type aii lantibiotic. bovicin hj50 exhibited high flexibility in aqueous solution, whereas varied rigidities were observed in the different rings with the conserved ring a being the most rigid. the charged residues lys(1)(1), asp(1)(2)  and lys(3)(0), as well as the essential disulfide bond were critical for antimicrobial activity. importantly, bovicin hj50 showed not only peptidoglycan precursor lipid ii-binding ability, but also pore-forming activity, which is significantly different from other bacteriostatic type aii lantibiotics, suggesting a novel antimicrobial mechanism.

TI  == lipopeptide biosurfactants from paenibacillus polymyxa inhibit single and mixed species biofilms.
AB  == although biofilms are recognised as important in microbial colonisation, solutions to their inhibition are predominantly based on planktonic assays. these solutions have limited efficacy against biofilms. here, a series of biofilm-orientated tests were used to identify anti-biofilm compounds from marine micro-flora. this led to the isolation of a complex of anti-biofilm compounds from an extract of paenibacillus polymyxa (ppe). a combination of rphplc and mass spectrometry identified the principle components of ppe as fusaricidin b (li-fo4b) and polymyxin d1, with minor contributions from surfactins. this complex (ppe) reduced the biofilm biomass of bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus bovis. in contrast, ampicillin was only effective against s. aureus. ppe also inhibited a self-assembling marine biofilm (samb) in co-incubation assays by 99.3% +/- 1.9 and disrupted established samb by 72.4% +/- 4.4, while ampicillin showed no significant reduction. the effectiveness of this complex of lipopeptides against  single and multispecies biofilms suggests a future role in biofilm prevention strategies.

TI  == resistance of rumen bacteria murein to bovine gastric lysozyme.
AB  == background: lysozymes, enzymes mostly associated with defence against bacterial infections, are mureinolytic. ruminants have evolved a gastric c type lysozyme as a digestive enzyme, and profit from digestion of foregut bacteria, after most dietary components, including protein, have been fermented in the rumen. in this  work we characterized the biological activities of bovine gastric secretions against membranes, purified murein and bacteria. results: bovine gastric extract  (bge) was active against both g+ and g- bacteria, but the effect against gram- bacteria was not due to the lysozyme, since purified bgl had only activity against gram+ bacteria. we were unable to find small pore forming peptides in the bge, and found that the inhibition of gram negative bacteria by bge was due to an artefact caused by acetate. we report for first time the activity of bovine gastric lysozyme (bg lysozyme) against pure bacterial cultures, and the specific  resistance of some rumen gram positive strains to bgl. conclusions: some gram+ rumen bacteria showed resistance to abomasum lysozyme. we discuss the implications of this finding in the light of possible practical applications of such a stable antimicrobial peptide.

TI  == characterization of a bacteriocin produced by a newly isolated bacillus sp. strain 8 a.
AB  == aims: the aim of this research was to investigate the production of bacteriocins  by bacillus spp. isolated from native soils of south of brazil. methods and results: a bacteriocin produced by the bacterium bacillus cereus 8 a was identified. the antimicrobial activity was produced starting at the exponential growth phase, although maximum activity was at stationary growth phase. a crude bacteriocin obtained from culture supernatant fluid was inhibitory to a broad range of indicator strains, including listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and several species of bacillus. clinically relevant bacteria such as streptococcus bovis and micrococcus luteus were also inhibited. bacteriocin was stable at 80 degrees c, but the activity was lost when the temperature reached 87 degrees c. it was resistant to the proteolytic action of trypsin and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k and pronase e. bacteriocin activity was observed in the ph range of 6.0-9.0. conclusions: a bacteriocin produced by bacillus cereus 8 a was characterized, presenting a broad spectrum of activity and potential for use as biopreservative in food. significance and impact of study: the identification of a bacteriocin with large activity spectrum, including pathogens and spoilage microorganisms, addresses an important aspect of food safety.

TI  == physiological characterization of streptococcus bovis mutants that can resist 2-deoxyglucose-induced lysis.
AB  == streptococcus bovis jb1 does not normally lyse, but stationary phase lysis can be induced by including 2-deoxyglucose (2dg) in the growth medium. isolates deficient in glucose/2dg phosphotransferase activity (pts-) also lysed when 2dg was present (lys+) and this result indicated that 2dg phosphorylation via the pts was not an obligate requirement for 2dg-induced lysis. cells and cell walls from  2dg-grown cultures lysed faster when proteinase k was added, but glucose-grown cultures and cell walls were not affected. a lipoteichoic acid (lta) extract (aqueous phase from hot phenol treatment) from glucose-grown cells inhibited the  lysis of 2dg-grown cultures, but a similar extract prepared from 2dg-grown cells  was without effect. thin-layer chromatography and differential staining indicated that wild-type and lys+ pts- cells incorporated 2dg into lta, but lysis-resistant cultures (lys- pts+ and lys- pts-) did not. lta from lysis-resistant (lys- pts+ and lys- pts-) cells grown with glucose and 2dg also prevented 2dg-dependent lysis of the wild-type. lta could not inhibit degradation of cell walls isolated  from 2dg-grown cultures, but lta inhibited the lysis of micrococcus lysodeikticus (micrococcus luteus) cells that were exposed to supernatants from 2dg-grown s. bovis cultures. group d streptococci (including s. bovis) normally have an alpha-1,2 linked glucose disaccharide (kojibiose) in their lta, but kojibiose cannot be synthesized from 2dg. this observation suggested that the kojibiose moiety of lta was involved in autolysin inactivation. wild-type s. bovis had atp- as well as pep-dependent mechanisms of 2dg phosphorylation and one lysis-resistant phenotype (lys- pts-) had reduced levels of both activities. however, the lys- pts+ phenotype was still able to phosphorylate 2dg via atp and  pep and this result indicated that some other step of 2dg incorporation into lta  was being inhibited. based on these results, growth in the presence of 2dg appears to prevent synthesis of normal lta, which is involved in the regulation of autolytic enzymes.
