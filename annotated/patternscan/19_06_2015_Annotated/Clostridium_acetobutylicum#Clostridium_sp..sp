TI  == solution phase dynamics of the dna repair enzyme spore photoproduct lyase as probed by h/d exchange.
AB  == spore photoproduct lyase (spl) catalyzes the repair of the uv lesion spore photoproduct (sp) in a reaction dependent on s-adenosyl-l-methionine (sam). we have utilized h/d exchange to show that in the presence of sam, a significant reduction in h/d exchange is observed upon binding sptpt or undamaged oligonucleotide, indicating a shift of 20 or 10 amide protons, respectively, from a rapidly-exchangable state to a fully-protected conformation. in the absence of  sam, neither the oligonucleotide nor the sptpt produce a significant perturbation in h/d exchange, indicating sam is a requisite binding partner. performing the same experiments in aerobic conditions reduced the magnitude of ligand-induced structural changes, consistent with the importance of the oxygen-sensitive iron-sulfur cluster for sam and substrate binding.

TI  == microbial production of short-chain alkanes.
AB  == increasing concerns about limited fossil fuels and global environmental problems  have focused attention on the need to develop sustainable biofuels from renewable resources. although microbial production of diesel has been reported, production  of another much in demand transport fuel, petrol (gasoline), has not yet been demonstrated. here we report the development of platform escherichia coli strains that are capable of producing short-chain alkanes (scas; petrol), free fatty acids (ffas), fatty esters and fatty alcohols through the fatty acyl (acyl carrier protein (acp)) to fatty acid to fatty acyl-coa pathway. first, the beta-oxidation pathway was blocked by deleting the fade gene to prevent the degradation of fatty acyl-coas generated in vivo. to increase the formation of short-chain fatty acids suitable for subsequent conversion to scas in vivo, the activity of 3-oxoacyl-acp synthase (fabh), which is inhibited by unsaturated fatty acyl-acps, was enhanced to promote the initiation of fatty acid biosynthesis by deleting the fadr gene; deletion of the fadr gene prevents upregulation of the faba and fabb genes responsible for unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis. a modified thioesterase was used to convert short-chain fatty acyl-acps to the corresponding ffas, which were then converted to scas by the sequential reactions of e. coli fatty acyl-coa synthetase, clostridium acetobutylicum fatty acyl-coa reductase and arabidopsis thaliana fatty aldehyde decarbonylase. the final engineered strain produced up to 580.8 mg l(-1) of scas  consisting of nonane (327.8 mg l(-1)), dodecane (136.5 mg l(-1)), tridecane (64.8 mg l(-1)), 2-methyl-dodecane (42.8 mg l(-1)) and tetradecane (8.9 mg l(-1)), together with small amounts of other hydrocarbons. furthermore, this platform strain could produce short-chain ffas using a fadd-deleted strain, and short-chain fatty esters by introducing the acinetobacter sp. adp1 wax ester synthase (atfa) and the e. coli mutant alcohol dehydrogenase (adhe(mut)).

TI  == [key enzymes in butanol fermentation by a facultative anaerobe bacillus sp. tsh1].
AB  == bacillus sp. tsh1 is a butanol-producing microorganism newly isolated in our laboratory; it can grow and ferment under facultative anaerobic conditions, while sharing similar fermentation pathways and products with clostridium acetobutylicum. to illustrate the relationships between the products and the enzyme activities in bacillus sp. tsh1, key butanol- and ethanol-forming enzymes  were studied, including butyraldehyde dehydrogenase, butanol dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. the activities of the three enzymes increased rapidly after the initiation of fermentation. activities of three enzymes peaked before 21 h, and simultaneously, product concentrations also began to increase gradually. the maximum activity of alcohol dehydrogenase was 0.054 u/mg at 12 h,  butyraldehyde dehydrogenase 0.035 u/mg at 21 h and butanol dehydrogenase 0.055 u/mg at 15 h. the enzyme activities then decreased, but remained constant at a low level after 24 h, while the concentrations of butanol, acetone, and ethanol continued increasing until the end of the fermentation. the results will attribute to the understanding of the butanol metabolic mechanism, and provide a  reference for further study of a facultative bacillus metabolic pathway.

TI  == deriving metabolic engineering strategies from genome-scale modeling with flux ratio constraints.
AB  == optimized production of bio-based fuels and chemicals from microbial cell factories is a central goal of systems metabolic engineering. to achieve this goal, a new computational method of using flux balance analysis with flux ratios  (fbratio) was further developed in this research and applied to five case studies to evaluate and design metabolic engineering strategies. the approach was implemented using publicly available genome-scale metabolic flux models. synthetic pathways were added to these models along with flux ratio constraints by fbratio to achieve increased (i) cellulose production from arabidopsis thaliana; (ii) isobutanol production from saccharomyces cerevisiae; (iii) acetone production from synechocystis sp. pcc6803; (iv) h2 production from escherichia coli mg1655; and (v) isopropanol, butanol, and ethanol (ibe) production from engineered clostridium acetobutylicum. the fbratio approach was applied to each case to simulate a metabolic engineering strategy already implemented experimentally, and flux ratios were continually adjusted to find (i) the end-limit of increased production using the existing strategy, (ii) new potential strategies to increase production, and (iii) the impact of these metabolic engineering strategies on product yield and culture growth. the fbratio approach  has the potential to design "fine-tuned" metabolic engineering strategies in silico that can be implemented directly with available genomic tools.

TI  == proliferation of diversified clostridial species during biological soil disinfestation incorporated with plant biomass under various conditions.
AB  == biological soil disinfestation (bsd) involves the anaerobic decomposition of plant biomass by microbial communities leading to control of plant pathogens. we  analyzed bacterial communities in soil of a model experiment of bsd, as affected  by biomass incorporation under various conditions, to find out the major anaerobic bacterial groups which emerged after bsd treatments. the soil was treated with brassica juncea plants, wheat bran, or avena strigosa plants, irrigated at 20 or 30 % moisture content and incubated at 25-30 degrees c for 17  days. the population of fusarium oxysporum f. sp. spinaciae incorporated at the start of the experiment declined markedly for some bsd conditions and rather high concentrations of acetate and butyrate were detected from these bsd-treated soils. the polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis based on the v3 region of 16s rrna gene sequences from the soil dna revealed that bacterial profiles greatly changed according to the treatment conditions. based on the clone library analysis, phylogenetically diverse clostridial species appeared exceedingly dominant in the bacterial community of bsd soil incorporated with brassica plants or wheat bran, in which the pathogen was suppressed completely. species in the class clostridia such as clostridium saccharobutylicum, clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium xylanovorans, oxobacter pfennigii, clostridium pasteurianum, clostridium sufflavum, clostridium cylindrosporum, etc. were commonly recognized as closely related species of the dominant clone groups from these soil samples.

TI  == characterization of a butanol-acetone-producing clostridium strain and identification of its solventogenic genes.
AB  == a unique clostridium species strain g117 was obtained in this study to be capable of producing dominant butanol from glucose. butanol of 13.50 g/l was produced when culture g117 was fed with 60 g/l glucose, which is ~20% higher than previously reported butanol production by wild-type clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 under similar conditions. strain g117 also distinguishes itself by generating negligible amount of ethanol, but producing butanol and acetone as biosolvent end-products. a butanol dehydrogenase gene (bdh gene) was identified in strain g117, which demonstrated a ~200-fold increase in transcription level measured by quantitative real-time pcr after 10h of culture growth. the high transcription suggests that this bdh gene could be a putative gene involved in butanol production. in all, clostridium sp. strain g117 serves as a potential candidate for industrial biobutanol production while the absence of ethanol ensures an economic-efficient separation and purification of butanol.

TI  == production of biofuels from pretreated microalgae biomass by anaerobic fermentation with immobilized clostridium acetobutylicum cells.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to study the possible use of pretreated biomass of various microalgae and cyanobacteria as substrates for acetone-butanol-ethanol (abe) fermentation by clostridium acetobutylicum cells immobilized into poly(vinyl alcohol) cryogel. to this end, the biochemical composition of photosynthetic microorganisms cultivated under various conditions was studied. the most efficient technique for pretreating microalgal biomass for its subsequent conversion into biofuels appeared to be thermal decomposition at 108 degrees c. for the first time the maximum productivity of the abe fermentation in terms of hydrogen (8.5 mmol/l medium/day) was obtained using pretreated biomass of nannochloropsis sp. maximum yields of butanol and ethanol were observed with arthrospira platensis biomass used as the substrate. immobilized clostridium cells were demonstrated to be suitable for multiple reuses (for a minimum of five cycles) in abe fermentation for producing biofuels from pretreated microalgal biomass.

TI  == solar hydrogen-producing bionanodevice outperforms natural photosynthesis.
AB  == although a number of solar biohydrogen systems employing photosystem i (psi) have been developed, few attain the electron transfer throughput of oxygenic photosynthesis. we have optimized a biological/organic nanoconstruct that directly tethers f(b), the terminal [4fe-4s] cluster of psi from synechococcus sp. pcc 7002, to the distal [4fe-4s] cluster of the [fefe]-hydrogenase (h(2)ase)  from clostridium acetobutylicum. on illumination, the psi-[fefe]-h(2)ase nanoconstruct evolves h(2) at a rate of 2,200 +/- 460 mumol mg chlorophyll(-1) h(-1), which is equivalent to 105 +/- 22 e(-)psi(-1) s(-1). cyanobacteria evolve  o(2) at a rate of approximately 400 mumol mg chlorophyll(-1) h(-1), which is equivalent to 47 e(-)psi(-1) s(-1), given a psi to photosystem ii ratio of 1.8. the greater than twofold electron throughput by this hybrid biological/organic nanoconstruct over in vivo oxygenic photosynthesis validates the concept of tethering proteins through their redox cofactors to overcome diffusion-based rate limitations on electron transfer.

TI  == rewiring hydrogenase-dependent redox circuits in cyanobacteria.
AB  == hydrogenases catalyze the reversible reaction 2h(+) + 2e(-) <--> h(2) with an equilibrium constant that is dependent on the reducing potential of electrons carried by their redox partner. to examine the possibility of increasing the photobiological production of hydrogen within cyanobacterial cultures, we expressed the [fefe] hydrogenase, hyda, from clostridium acetobutylicum in the non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium synechococcus elongatus sp. 7942. we demonstrate that the heterologously expressed hydrogenase is functional in vitro  and in vivo, and that the in vivo hydrogenase activity is connected to the light-dependent reactions of the electron transport chain. under anoxic conditions, hyda activity is capable of supporting light-dependent hydrogen evolution at a rate > 500-fold greater than that supported by the endogenous [nife] hydrogenase. furthermore, hyda can support limited growth solely using h(2) and light as the source of reducing equivalents under conditions where photosystem ii is inactivated. finally, we demonstrate that the addition of exogenous ferredoxins can modulate redox flux in the hydrogenase-expressing strain, allowing for greater hydrogen yields and for dark fermentation of internal energy stores into hydrogen gas.

TI  == complete stereospecific repair of a synthetic dinucleotide spore photoproduct by  spore photoproduct lyase.
AB  == spore photoproduct lyase (sp lyase), a member of the radical s-adenosylmethionine superfamily of enzymes, catalyzes the repair of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine [spore photoproduct (sp)], a type of uv-induced dna damage unique to bacterial spores. the anaerobic purification and characterization of clostridium acetobutylicum sp lyase heterologously expressed in escherichia coli, and its catalytic activity in repairing stereochemically defined synthetic dinucleotide sps was investigated. the purified enzyme contains between 2.3 and 3.1 iron atoms per protein. electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) spectroscopy reveals an isotropic signal centered at g = 1.99, characteristic of a [3fe-4s](+) cluster accounting for 3-4% of the iron in the sample. upon reduction, a nearly axial signal (g = 2.03, 1.93 and 1.92) characteristic of a [4fe-4s](+) cluster is observed that accounts for 34-45% of total iron. addition of s-adenosylmethionine to the reduced enzyme produces a rhombic signal (g = 2.02, 1.93, 1.82) unique to  the s-adenosyl-l: -methionine complex while decreasing the overall epr intensity. this reduced enzyme is shown to rapidly and completely repair the 5r diastereomer of a synthetic dinucleotide sp with a specific activity of 7.1 +/- 0.6 nmol min(-1) mg(-1), whereas no repair was observed for the 5s diastereomer.

TI  == spore photoproduct lyase catalyzes specific repair of the 5r but not the 5s spore photoproduct.
AB  == bacterial spores are remarkable in their resistance to chemical and physical stresses, including exposure to uv radiation. the unusual uv resistance of bacterial spores is a result of the unique photochemistry of spore dna, which results in accumulation of 5-thyminyl-5,6-dihydrothymine (spore photoproduct, or  sp), coupled with the efficient repair of accumulated damage by the enzyme spore  photoproduct lyase (spl). spl is a member of the radical adomet superfamily of enzymes, and utilizes an iron-sulfur cluster and s-adenosylmethionine to repair sp by a direct reversal mechanism initiated by h atom abstraction from c-6 of the thymine dimer. while two distinct diastereomers of sp (5r or 5s) could in principle be formed upon uv irradiation of bacterial spores, only the 5r configuration is possible for sp formed from adjacent thymines in double helical  dna, due to the constraints imposed by the dna structure; the 5s configuration is possible in less well-defined dna structures or as an interstrand cross-link. we  report here results from hplc and ms analysis of in vitro enzymatic assays on stereochemically defined sp substrates demonstrating that spl specifically repairs only the 5r isomer of sp. the observation that 5r-sp, but not 5s-sp, is a substrate for spl is consistent with the expectation that 5r is the sp isomer produced in vivo upon uv irradiation of bacterial spore dna.

TI  == optimization strategies based on sequential quadratic programming applied for a fermentation process for butanol production.
AB  == in this work, the mathematical optimization of a continuous flash fermentation process for the production of biobutanol was studied. the process consists of three interconnected units, as follows: fermentor, cell-retention system (tangential microfiltration), and vacuum flash vessel (responsible for the continuous recovery of butanol from the broth). the objective of the optimization was to maximize butanol productivity for a desired substrate conversion. two strategies were compared for the optimization of the process. in one of them, the process was represented by a deterministic model with kinetic parameters determined experimentally and, in the other, by a statistical model obtained using the factorial design technique combined with simulation. for both strategies, the problem was written as a nonlinear programming problem and was solved with the sequential quadratic programming technique. the results showed that despite the very similar solutions obtained with both strategies, the problems found with the strategy using the deterministic model, such as lack of convergence and high computational time, make the use of the optimization strategy with the statistical model, which showed to be robust and fast, more suitable for the flash fermentation process, being recommended for real-time applications coupling optimization and control.

TI  == new solvent-producing clostridium sp. strains, hydrolyzing a wide range of polysaccharides, are closely related to clostridium butyricum.
AB  == thirteen new clostridium strains, previously isolated from soil and found to produce high amounts of solvents from glucose, hydrolyzed a great variety of alpha- and beta-glycans, including raw starch, xylan, pectin, inulin and cellulose. the sequences of the pcr-amplified dna fragments containing the variable 3' part of one of the 16s rrna genes were 99.5% identical. the macrorestriction pattern of two endonucleolytic digests of chromosomal dna in the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) confirmed their high homogeneity on the dna level. the complete 16s rrna gene sequence of three selected strains was 99.8% identical to the 16s rrna gene sequence from clostridium butyricum and separates them from c. acetobutylicum. to the closely related four species of solventogenic clostridia a new group of strains has to be added, which has a great potential for the direct fermentation of biomass.

TI  == emended descriptions of clostridium acetobutylicum and clostridium beijerinckii,  and descriptions of clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum sp. nov. and clostridium saccharobutylicum sp. nov.
AB  == on the basis of 16s rrna gene sequencing and dna-dna reassociation, industrial solvent-producing clostridia have been assigned to four species. in this study, the phenotypic characteristics of clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinckii, 'clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum', and an unnamed clostridium sp. represented by the strains ncp 262t and nrrl b643 are compared. in addition, a further 40 strains of solvent-producing clostridia have been classified by biotyping, dna fingerprinting and 16s rrna gene sequencing. these included 14 c. beijerinckii strains, two strains currently designated as 'clostridium kaneboi' and 'clostridium butanologenum', and 24 production strains  used in the commercial acetone-butanol fermentation. all of the c. beijerinckii strains were confirmed to have been classified correctly. the 'c. kaneboi' and 'c. butanologenum' strains require reclassification as c. acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii, respectively. the commercial production strains were found to belong either to c. beijerinckii or to the unnamed clostridium sp. for the comparative phenotypic studies of the four species, representative strains were selected from each of the dna-fingerprint subgroups within each species. these strains were analysed for their ability to utilize different carbohydrates, hydrolyse gelatin or aesculin, and produce indole, and were tested for the presence of catalase and urease. on the basis of these results, several phenotypic traits were found to be useful for differentiating between the four species. the descriptions of c. acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii have been emended. the names clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum sp. nov. [type strain = n1-4 (hmt) = atcc 27021t] and clostridium saccharobutylicum sp. nov. (type strain = dsm 13864t = atcc baa-117t) are proposed for the two new species.

TI  == clostridium uliginosum sp. nov., a novel acid-tolerant, anaerobic bacterium with  connecting filaments.
AB  == an anaerobic, acid-tolerant bacterium, ck55t, was isolated from an acidic forest  bog. cells of ck55t stained gram-negative but did not have an outer membrane. cells were spore-forming, motile rods with peritrichous flagella, formed chains or aggregates and were linked by connecting filaments that were composed of a core and outer sheath. cellobiose, glucose, xylose, mannose, mannitol, sucrose and peptone supported growth. arabinose, lactose, raffinose, h2/co2, co/co2, vanillate, casamino acids and various purines and pyrimidines did not support growth. growth on carbohydrates yielded acetate, butyrate, lactate, formate and h2 as end-products. growth was observed at ph 4.0-9.0, with an optimum at ph 6.5, and at 10-30 degrees c, with an optimum at 20-25 degrees c. at 20 degrees c, doubling times were 4 and 6 h at ph 6.5 and 4.0, respectively. hydrogenase activity in cell-free extracts was 12 u (mg protein)-1. ck55t did not: (i) contain detectable levels of co, formate, lactate dehydrogenases or cytochromes;  (ii) carry out dissimilatory reduction of nitrate or sulfate; or (iii) produce methane. thus, ck55t was characterized as a non-acetogenic, fermentative chemo-organotroph. the g+c content of ck55t was 28.0 mol%. ck55t was phylogenetically most closely related to clostridium botulinum (types b, e and f), clostridium acetobutylicum and other saccharolytic clostridia; the 16s rrna gene sequence similarity values to the nearest relatives of ck55t were approximately 97%. based on morphological, physiological and phylogenetic properties of ck55t, it is proposed that ck55t be termed clostridium uliginosum sp. nov. (= dsm 12992t = atcc baa-53t).

TI  == analysis of kdpc of the k(+)-transporting kdpfabc complex of escherichia coli.
AB  == the kdp complex, a high affinity atp-driven k(+) transport system of escherichia  coli, is composed of the four membrane-bound subunits kdpf, kdpa, kdpb and kdpc.  whereas the role of kdpb (catalytical subunit), kdpa (k(+)-translocating subunit) and kdpf (stabilizing peptide) is well understood, the function of kdpc is still  unknown. therefore, a kdpc deletion strain was constructed and complementation experiments were performed using different kdpc constructs. truncations of the kdpc gene revealed that only one derivative, which lacks base pairs coding for the four c-terminal amino acids, was able to complement the chromosomal deletion  of kdpc. furthermore, complementation was also observed with kdpc of mycobacterium tuberculosis, but not with kdpc from clostridium acetobutylicum or  synechocystis sp. pcc6803. sequence alignment of 17 different kdpc proteins led to the construction of hybrids between kdpc of e. coli and that of c. acetobutylicum. complementation revealed that the n-terminal transmembrane segment as well as the c-terminal-third of the protein can be exchanged between both species, but only one after the other. a simultaneous substitution of both regions was not possible.

TI  == cloning of an ef-p homologue from bacteroides fragilis that increases b. fragilis glutamine synthetase activity in escherichia coli.
AB  == investigations of possible regulators of bacteroides fragilis glutamine synthetase (gs) activity were done in escherichia coli using a compatible dual-plasmid system. the b. fragilis glna gene, together with upstream and downstream flanking regions, was cloned onto the low copy number plasmid pacyc184 and expressed in the e. coli glna ntrb ntrc deletion strain, ymc11. gs activity was monitored following co-transformation with a b. fragilis genomic library carried on the compatible plasmid pecor251. a gene was cloned that caused a twofold increase in b. fragilis gs activity but did not affect the activity of the e. coli gs enzyme or the b. fragilis sucrase (scrl). deletion of the b. fragilis glna downstream region decreased basal levels of gs activity, but did not affect the ability of the cloned gene to increase the b. fragilis gs activity. reporter gene analysis, using the b. fragilis glna promoter region fused to the promoterless clostridium acetobutylicum endoglucanase gene, showed no increase in reporter gene activity. this demonstrated that the increase in gs  activity was not regulated at the transcriptional level, and that the cloned gene product was not affecting the copy number of the plasmid in trans. sequence data  indicated that the cloned gene had good amino acid identity to a range of elongation factor p (ef-p) proteins, the highest being to that of a synechocystis sp (48%), and the least to mycobacterium genitalium (27%). amino acid identity to the e. coli ef-p was intermediate (37%). a possible role for ef-p in enhancing translation of the b. fragilis glna mrna is proposed.

TI  == the kdp system of clostridium acetobutylicum: cloning, sequencing, and transcriptional regulation in response to potassium concentration.
AB  == the complete sequence of the kdp gene region of clostridium acetobutylicum has been determined. this part of the chromosome comprises two small open reading frames (orfz and orfy), putatively encoding hydrophobic peptides, and the genes kdpa, kdpb, kdpc, and kdpx, followed by an operon encoding a pair of sensor-effector regulatory proteins (kdpd and kdpe). except for orfz, orfy, and kdpx, all genes showed significant homology to the kdp genes of escherichia coli, encoding a high-affinity potassium transport atpase and its regulators. the complete genome sequence of synechocystis sp. strain pcc 6803 and a recently published part of the mycobacterium tuberculosis genome indicate the existence of a kdp system in these organisms as well, but all three systems comprise neither a second orf upstream of kdpa nor an additional kdpx gene. expression of the clostridial kdp genes, including the unique kdpx gene, was found to be inducible  by low potassium concentrations. a transcription start point could be mapped upstream of orfz. a promoter upstream of kdpd was active only under noninducing conditions. lowering the potassium content of the medium led to formation of a common transcript (orfzykdpabcxde), with a putative internal rnase e recognition  site, which could be responsible for the instability of the common transcript. except for the two small peptides, all gene products could be detected in in vitro transcription-translation experiments.

TI  == evidence for the bacterial origin of genes encoding fermentation enzymes of the amitochondriate protozoan parasite entamoeba histolytica.
AB  == entamoeba histolytica is an amitochondriate protozoan parasite with numerous bacterium-like fermentation enzymes including the pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (por), ferredoxin (fd), and alcohol dehydrogenase e (adhe). the goal of this study was to determine whether the genes encoding these cytosolic e. histolytica fermentation enzymes might derive from a bacterium by horizontal transfer, as has previously been suggested for e. histolytica genes encoding heat shock protein 60, nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. in this study, the e. histolytica por gene and the adhe gene of a second amitochondriate protozoan parasite, giardia lamblia, were sequenced, and their phylogenetic positions were estimated in relation to por, adhe, and fd cloned from eukaryotic and eubacterial organisms. the e. histolytica por gene encodes a 1,620-amino-acid peptide that contained conserved iron-sulfur- and thiamine pyrophosphate-binding sites. the predicted e. histolytica por showed fewer positional identities to the por of g. lamblia (34%) than to the por of the enterobacterium klebsiella pneumoniae (49%), the cyanobacterium anabaena sp. (44%), and the protozoan trichomonas vaginalis (46%), which targets its por to anaerobic organelles called hydrogenosomes. maximum-likelihood, neighbor-joining, and parsimony analyses also suggested as less likely e. histolytica por sharing more recent common ancestry with g. lamblia por than with por of bacteria and the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome. the g. lamblia adhe encodes an 888-amino-acid fusion  peptide with an aldehyde dehydrogenase at its amino half and an iron-dependent (class 3) adh at its carboxy half. the predicted g. lamblia adhe showed extensive positional identities to adhe of escherichia coli (49%), clostridium acetobutylicum (44%), and e. histolytica (43%) and lesser identities to the class 3 adh of eubacteria and yeast (19 to 36%). phylogenetic analyses inferred a closer relationship of the e. histolytica adhe to bacterial adhe than to the g. lamblia adhe. the 6-kda fd of e. histolytica and g. lamblia were most similar to  those of the archaebacterium methanosarcina barkeri and the delta-purple bacterium desulfovibrio desulfuricans, respectively, while the 12-kda fd of the t. vaginalis hydrogenosome was most similar to the 12-kda fd of gamma-purple bacterium pseudomonas putida. e. histolytica genes (and probably g. lamblia genes) encoding fermentation enzymes therefore likely derive from bacteria by horizontal transfer, although it is not clear from which bacteria these amebic genes derive. these are the first nonorganellar fermentation enzymes of eukaryotes implicated to have derived from bacteria.

TI  == cultures of "clostridium acetobutylicum" from various collections comprise clostridium acetobutylicum, clostridium beijerinckii, and two other distinct types based on dna-dna reassociation.
AB  == the best-known acetone-butanol (solvent)-producing bacterium is the weizmann organism, clostridium acetobutylicum, which was used for starch-based industrial  fermentation. in the past two decades, cultures of "c. acetobutylicum" from various culture collections have included organisms that were isolated for sugar  (molasses)-based industrial solvent production. recent biochemical and genetic studies have revealed significant differences among some of these "c. acetobutylicum" strains. we used dna-dna reassociation to analyze 39 cultures of  "c. acetobutylicum" and phenotypically similar organisms from major collections.  the results of this study clearly identified four groups intergroup reassociation values of less than 30%. all of the intragroup values except the value for one strain were 68% or more, which supported species status for each group. the c. acetobutylicum group (with atcc 824 as the type strain) consisted of 17 cultures  and had average reassociation values of 10% with the other three groups. all strains of c. acetobutylicum produced riboflavin in milk, and the cultures were bright yellow, which is useful for differentiating this species from the other three groups. the clostridium beijerinckii group (with vpi 5481 [= atcc 25752] as the type strain) consisted of 16 cultures and included strains ncimb 8052 and ncp 270. strains ncp 262 and nrrl b643 constituted the third group, whereas strain n1-4 ("clostridium saccharoperbutylacetonicum") and its derivative, strain n1-4081, formed the fourth group. at present, the last two groups are each represented by only one independent strain; definitive descriptions of these two  groups as two new or revived species will require further phenotypic characterization, as well as identification of additional strains. c. beijerinckii ncp 270, clostridium sp. strain nrrl b643, and "c. saccharoperbutylacetonicum" were used in industrial solvent production from molasses, which confirms that the new organisms used for the sugar-based processes are distinct from c. acetobutylicum.

AB  == alcohol dehydrogenase (adh) is a key enzyme for the production of butanol, ethanol, and isopropanol by the solvent-producing clostridia. initial studies of  adh in extracts of several strains of clostridium acetobutylicum and c. beijerinckii gave conflicting molecular properties. a more coherent picture has emerged because of the following results: (i) identification of adhs with different coenzyme specificities in these species; (ii) discovery of structurally conserved adhs (type 3) in three solvent-producing species; (iii) isolation of mutants with deficiencies in butanol production and restoration of butanol production with a cloned alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase gene; and (iv) resolution of various 'c. acetobutylicum' cultures into four species. the three adh isozymes of c. beijerinckii nrrl b592 have high sequence similarities to adh-1 of clostridium sp. ncp 262 (formerly c. acetobutylicum p262) and to the adh domain of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenase of c. acetobutylicum atcc 824/dsm 792. the  nadh-dependent activity of the adhs from c. beijerinckii nrrl b592 and the bdhs from c. acetobutylicum atcc 824 is profoundly affected by the ph of the assay, and the relative importance of nadh and nadph to butanol production may be misappraised when nad(p)h-dependent activities were measured at different ph values. the primary/secondary adh of isopropanol-producing c. beijerinckii is a type-1 enzyme and is highly conserved in thermoanaerobacter brockii (formerly thermoanaerobium brockii) and entamoeba histolytica. several solvent-forming enzymes (primary adh, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and 3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase) are very similar between c. beijerinckii and the species represented by clostridium sp. ncp 262 and nrrl b643. the realization of such relationships will facilitate the elucidation of the roles of different adhs because each type of adh can now be studied in an organism most amenable to experimental manipulations.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a chromosomal fragment from clostridium acetobutylicum  strain abkn8 conferring chemical-damaging agents and uv resistance to e. coli reca strains.
AB  == a 3.3-kb dna fragment of clostridium acetobutylicum conferred methyl methane sulfonate (mms), mitomycin c (mc), and uv resistance to reca strains of e. coli when cloned on the puc19 plasmid. analysis of the nucleotide sequence of the total insert and results of in vitro transcription-translation experiments showed that the insert directed the synthesis of three polypeptides referred to as orfa, orfb, and orfc of 23.6, 15.3, and 21 kda, respectively. none of the polypeptides  presented a relationship with the reca protein of e. coli or products of genes involved in the sos response. the deduced amino acid sequence of orfb and orfc are highly homologous to those deduced from two genes specifying resistance to tellurium salts present on plasmid pmer610 harbored by alcaligenes sp.strains and to an amp-binding protein (cabp1) found in dictyostelium discoideum. the existence of these homologous proteins suggests that they may perform a similar key function in the three unrelated organisms.

TI  == purification and some properties of an alkaline xylanase from alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain 41m-1.
AB  == an alkaliphilic bacillus sp. strain, 41m-1, isolated from soil produced multiple  xylanases extracellularly. one of these xylanases was purified to homogeneity by  ammonium sulfate fractionation and anion-exchange chromatography. the moleculr mass of this enzyme (xylanase j) was 36 kda, and the isoelectric point was ph 5.3. xylanase j was most active at ph 9.0. the optimum temperature for the activity at ph 9.0 was around 50 degrees c. the enzyme was stable up to 55 degrees c at ph 9.0 for 30 min. xylanase j was completely inhibited by the hg2+ion and n-bromosuccinimide. the predominant products of xylan hydrolysate were xylobiose, xylotriose, and higher oligosaccharides, indicating that the enzyme was an endoxylanase. the apparent km and vmax values on xylan were 3.3 mg/ml and 1,100 micromol-1 mg-1, respectively. xylanase j showed high sequence homology with the xylanases from bacillus pumilus and clostridium acetobutylicum  in the n-terminal region. xylanase j acted on neither crystalline cellulose nor carboxymethyl cellulose, indicating a possible application of the enzyme in biobleaching processes.

TI  == purification and characterization of an extracellular muramidase of clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824 that acts on non-n-acetylated peptidoglycan.
AB  == an extracellular enzyme showing lytic activity on non-n-acetylated peptidoglycan  has been isolated from clostridium acetobutylicum atcc 824. the lytic enzyme was  purified to homogeneity by anion-exchange chromatography and gel filtration, with a recovery of 24%. the enzyme was monomeric and had an estimated molecular weight of 41,000 and an isoelectric point of 3.8. it has been characterized as a muramidase whose 23-amino-acid n terminus displayed 39% homology with the n,o-diacetyl muramidase of the fungus chalaropsis sp. the muramidase hydrolyzed purified cell walls at an optimum ph of 3, with a maximum velocity of 9.1 mumol of reducing sugars released min-1 mg of muramidase-1 and a concentration of cell  walls giving a half-maximum rate of 0.01 mg ml-1. its activity was inhibited by glucosamine, n-acetylglucosamine, hg2+, fe3+, and ag+ but not by choline. the muramidase-peptidoglycan complex rapidly dissociated before total hydrolysis of the chain and randomly reassociated on another peptidoglycan chain. the affinity  of the muramidase was affected by the protein content and the acetylation of the  cell wall.

TI  == electron microscopic analysis and biochemical characterization of a novel methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1.
AB  == methanol dehydrogenase from the thermotolerant bacillus sp. c1 was studied by electron microscopy and image processing. two main projections can be distinguished: one exhibits 5-fold symmetry and has a diameter of 15 nm, the other is rectangular with sides of 15 and 9 nm. subsequent image processing showed that the 5-fold view possesses mirror symmetry. the rectangular views can  be divided into two separate classes, one of which has 2-fold rotational symmetry. it is concluded that methanol dehydrogenase is a decameric molecule, and a tentative model is presented. the estimated molecular weight is 430,000, based on a subunit molecular weight of 43,000. the enzyme contains one zinc and one to two magnesium ions per subunit. n-terminal amino acid sequence analysis revealed substantial similarity with alcohol dehydrogenases from saccharomyces cerevisiae, zymomonas mobilis, clostridium acetobutylicum, and escherichia coli,  which contain iron or zinc but no magnesium. in view of the aberrant structural and kinetic properties, it is proposed to distinguish the enzyme from common alcohol dehydrogenases (ec 1.1.1.1) by using the name nad-dependent methanol dehydrogenase.
