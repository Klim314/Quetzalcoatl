TI  == exploring the variation of oral microbiota in supragingival plaque during and after head-and-neck radiotherapy using pyrosequencing.
AB  == objective: the aim of this article was to study the variation in oral microflora  of the subgingival plaque during and after radiotherapy. design: during and after radiotherapy, microbial samples were collected at seven time points (early stage, medium stage, and later stage of radiotherapy, and 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after radiotherapy) in three subjects for a total of 21 samples. polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification was carried out on the 16s rdna hypervariable v1-v3 region, and then the pcr products were determined by high-throughput pyrosequencing. results: the rarefaction curve indicating the richness of the microflora demonstrated that the number of operational taxonomic  units (otus) was in decline from the early stage of radiotherapy to the time point 1 month after radiotherapy and then trended upward. the shannon diversity index declined during radiotherapy (ranging from 4.59 to 3.73), and generally rose after radiotherapy, with the lowest value of 3.5 (1 month after radiotherapy) and highest value of 4.75 (6 months after radiotherapy). a total of 120 genera were found; five genera (actinomyces, veillonella, prevotella, streptococcus, campylobacter) were found in all subjects across all time points.  conclusion: the richness and diversity of oral ecology decreased with increased radiation dose, and it was gradually restored with time.

TI  == a study of the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == objective: to explore the fluorescence characteristics of common cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella intermedia, lactobacillus acidophilus, and candida albicans. methods: the bacteria were cultured on brain heart infusion (bhi) agar and bhi blood agar, and bacterial colonies were collected for further amplification in liquid medium. bacterial suspensions in physiological saline were equally divided into three parts for bacteria counting, fluorescence spectrometry detection, and fluorescence microscope examination. results: the optimal excitation wavelength of the bacteria was 350 nm; their characteristic fluorescence peak position was at 436 +/- 4 nm. there was a significant linear correlation between fluorescence  intensity and bacterial concentration. the mean optical density (mod) of s. mutans and l. acidophilus cultivated in bhi blood was significantly higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (110 +/- 10 vs. 57 +/- 20; 94 +/- 16 vs. 31 +/- 12, respectively, p < 0.05). the mod of s. sanguis, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia cultivated in bhi blood agar was higher than that cultivated in bhi agar (37 +/-  12 vs. 36 +/- 11; 43 +/- 17 vs. 38 +/- 6; 86 +/- 21 vs. 72 +/- 8, respectively, p > 0.05); the opposite was observed for c. albicans. conclusion: at 350 nm excitation wavelength, 436 +/- 4 nm is an indicator for detecting six cariogenic  bacteria. the fluorescence energy, q, is a valuable index reflecting bacterial concentration under fluorescence spectrometry detection. exogenous fluorescence groups have greater influence on fluorescence intensity and little influence on fluorescence peak position detection.

TI  == removal of dental biofilms with an ultrasonically activated water stream.
AB  == acidogenic bacteria within dental plaque biofilms are the causative agents of caries. consequently, maintenance of a healthy oral environment with efficient biofilm removal strategies is important to limit caries, as well as halt progression to gingivitis and periodontitis. recently, a novel cleaning device has been described using an ultrasonically activated stream (uas) to generate a cavitation cloud of bubbles in a freely flowing water stream that has demonstrated the capacity to be effective at biofilm removal. in this study, uas  was evaluated for its ability to remove biofilms of the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans ua159, as well as actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104 and streptococcus oralis atcc 9811, grown on machine-etched glass slides to generate  a reproducible complex surface and artificial teeth from a typodont training model. biofilm removal was assessed both visually and microscopically using high-speed videography, confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), and scanning electron microscopy (sem). analysis by cslm demonstrated a statistically significant 99.9% removal of s. mutans biofilms exposed to the uas for 10 s, relative to both untreated control biofilms and biofilms exposed to the water stream alone without ultrasonic activation (p < 0.05). the water stream alone showed no statistically significant difference in removal compared with the untreated control (p = 0.24). high-speed videography demonstrated a rapid rate (151 mm2 in 1 s) of biofilm removal. the uas was also highly effective at s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and s. oralis biofilm removal from machine-etched glass and s. mutans from typodont surfaces with complex topography. consequently, uas technology represents a potentially effective method for biofilm removal and improved oral hygiene.

TI  == co-aggregation of candida albicans, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans is candida albicans strain dependent.
AB  == microbial interactions are necessarily associated with the development of polymicrobial oral biofilms. the objective of this study was to determine the co-aggregation of eight strains of candida albicans with actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. in auto-aggregation assays, c. albicans strains were grown in rpmi-1640 and artificial saliva medium (asm) whereas bacteria were grown in heart infusion broth. c. albicans, a. naeslundii and s. mutans were suspended  to give 106 cells ml-1, 107 cells ml-1 and 108 cells ml-1, respectively, in co-aggregation buffer followed by a 1 h incubation. the absorbance difference at  620 nm (deltaabs) between 0 h and 1 h was recorded. to study co-aggregation, the  same protocol was used, except combinations of microorganisms were incubated together. the mean deltaabs% of auto-aggregation of the majority of rpmi-1640-grown c. albicans was higher than in asm-grown. co-aggregation of c. albicans with a. naeslundii and/or s. mutans was variable among c. albicans strains.. scanning electron microscopy images showed that a. naeslundii and s. mutans co-aggregated with c. albicans in dual- and tri-culture. in conclusion, the co-aggregation of c. albicans, a. naeslundii and s. mutans is c. albicans strain dependent.

TI  == microbial dynamics during conversion from supragingival to subgingival biofilms in an in vitro model.
AB  == the development of dental caries and periodontal diseases result from distinct shifts in the microbiota of the tooth-associated biofilm. this in vitro study aimed to investigate changes in biofilm composition and structure, during the shift from a "supragingival" aerobic to a "subgingival" anaerobic profile. biofilms consisting of actinomyces oris, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar were aerobically grown in saliva-containing medium on hydroxyapatite discs. after 64 h, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus anginosus were further added along with human serum, while culture conditions were shifted to microaerophilic. after 96 h, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola were finally added and the biofilm was grown anaerobically for another 64 h. at the end of each phase, biofilms were harvested for species-specific quantification and localization. apart from c. albicans, all other species gradually increased during aerobic and microaerophilic conditions,  but remained steady during anaerobic conditions. biofilm thickness was doubled during the microaerophilic phase, but remained steady throughout the anaerobic phase. extracellular polysaccharide presence was gradually reduced throughout the growth period. biofilm viability was reduced during the microaerophilic conversion, but was recovered during the anaerobic phase. this in vitro study has characterized the dynamic structural shifts occurring in an oral biofilm model during the switch from aerobic to anaerobic conditions, potentially modeling the  conversion of supragingival to subgingival biofilms. within the limitations of this experimental model, the findings may provide novel insights into the ecology of oral biofilms. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific oral microflora - in vitro study.
AB  == aim: to determine and compare the antimicrobial efficacy of ten commercially available herbal dentifrices against specific strains of oral microflora using a  standard diffusion method at full strength and 1:1 dilution at 24 h. materials and methods: the standard strains of streptococcus. mutans (atcc 21293), streptococcus sangius (mtcc 442), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 3268), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 2592), streptococcus pyogenes (mtcc 442) and candida  albicans (atcc 183) were obtained. antimicrobial efficacy of the dentifrices was  tested in triplicate, at full strength and 1:1 dilution with the sterile water using a standard diffusion method for 24 h at 37 degrees c. the antimicrobial efficacy was tested by observing the zones of inhibition in millimeters surrounding disk containing the dentifrice. mean standard deviation and standard  error of mean of the inhibitory zones was calculated for each herbal dentifrice.  p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. results: danth kanthi (dk) was the most effective against all the microorganisms producing larger zones of inhibition at 24 h (f.s - 40+/-1.5; 1:1 dilution - 40+/-2.71). amar premium (ap)  also produced larger zones of inhibition against all microorganisms except s. aureus. of all the dentifrices, least zones of inhibitions i.e., around 5 mm was  observed against s. aureus by amar premium (ap) and dabur babool (db) at 24 h. conclusion: based on the results of the present study, it can be concluded that all herbal dentifrices exhibited antimicrobial activity against the selected oral microorganisms, with dk being the most effective. hence, it can be inferred that  herbal dentifrices can also be recommended like the conventional formulations.

TI  == maturation of oral microbiota in children with or without dental caries.
AB  == background: the aim of this longitudinal study was to evaluate the oral microbiota in children from age 3 months to 3 years, and to determine the association of the presence of caries at 3 years of age. methods and findings: oral biofilms and saliva were sampled from children at 3 months (n = 207) and 3 years (n = 155) of age, and dental caries was scored at 3 years of age. oral microbiota was assessed by culturing of total lactobacilli and mutans streptococci, pcr detection of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, 454 pyrosequencing and homim (human oral microbe identification microarray) microarray detection of more then 300 species/ phylotypes. species richness and taxa diversity significantly increased from 3 months to 3 years. three bacterial  genera, present in all the 3-month-old infants, persisted at 3 years of age, whereas three other genera had disappeared by this age. a large number of new taxa were also observed in the 3-year-olds. the microbiota at 3 months of age, except for lactobacilli, was unrelated to caries development at a later age. in contrast, several taxa in the oral biofilms of the 3-year-olds were linked with the presence or absence of caries. the main species/phylotypes associated with caries in 3-year-olds belonged to the actinobaculum, atopobium, aggregatibacter,  and streptococcus genera, whereas those influencing the absence of caries belonged to the actinomyces, bergeyella, campylobacter, granulicatella, kingella, leptotrichia, and streptococcus genera. conclusions: thus, during the first years of life, species richness and taxa diversity in the mouth increase significantly. besides the more prevalent colonization of lactobacilli, the composition of the overall microbiota at 3 months of age was unrelated to caries development at a later age. several taxa within the oral biofilms of the 3-year-olds could be linked to the presence or absence of caries.

TI  == the cultivable microbiota of primary and secondary infected root canals, their susceptibility to antibiotics and association with the signs and symptoms of infection.
AB  == aim: to examine the presence of microbial species in primary and secondary infections and identify the signs and symptoms associated with them. methodology: a total number of 37 root canals from 33 patients undergoing root canal treatment were selected. samples were taken using a sterile paper point following chemomechanical canal instrumentation. microbiological identification was performed by macromorphological, micromorphological, and commercial biochemical tests (atb system). the antibiotic susceptibility profile of isolated enterococcus, streptococcus and propionibacterium spp. was evaluated. results: a  total number of 54 species were isolated. the most common was e. faecalis followed by propionibacterium acnes and streptococcus spp. five multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains were isolated. however, resistance to linezolid or glycopeptides was not found. radiolucency was observed significantly more often in symptomatic infections (p=0.0061) caused by actinomyces spp. than in asymptomatic ones. conclusions: enterococci and streptococci were the most commonly isolated bacteria from root canals. the resistance of enterococci to many antimicrobials may pose a problem in their eradication. this article is protected by copyright. all rights reserved.

TI  == lung microbiota across age and disease stage in cystic fibrosis.
AB  == understanding the significance of bacterial species that colonize and persist in  cystic fibrosis (cf) airways requires a detailed examination of bacterial community structure across a broad range of age and disease stage. we used 16s ribosomal rna sequencing to characterize the lung microbiota in 269 cf patients spanning a 60 year age range, including 76 pediatric samples from patients of age 4-17, and a broad cross-section of disease status to identify features of bacterial community structure and their relationship to disease stage and age. the cf lung microbiota shows significant inter-individual variability in community structure, composition and diversity. the core microbiota consists of five genera - streptococcus, prevotella, rothia, veillonella and actinomyces. cf-associated pathogens such as pseudomonas, burkholderia, stenotrophomonas and achromobacter are less prevalent than core genera, but have a strong tendency to  dominate the bacterial community when present. community diversity and lung function are greatest in patients less than 10 years of age and lower in older age groups, plateauing at approximately age 25. lower community diversity correlates with worse lung function in a multivariate regression model. infection by pseudomonas correlates with age-associated trends in community diversity and lung function.

TI  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 adhesin sspb v-region mediates coaggregation via receptor polysaccharide of actinomyces oris t14v.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb proteins, members of the antigen i/ii (agi/ii) family of streptococcus adhesins, mediate adherence to cysteine-rich scavenger glycoprotein gp340 and cells of other oral microbial species. in this article we investigated further the mechanism of coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and actinomyces oris t14v. previous mutational analysis of s. gordonii suggested that sspb was necessary for coaggregation with a. oris t14v. we have confirmed this by showing that lactococcus lactis surrogate host cells expressing sspb coaggregated with a. oris t14v and pk606 cells, while l. lactis cells expressing sspa did not. coaggregation occurred independently of expression of a. oris type 1 (fimp) or type 2 (fima) fimbriae. polysaccharide was prepared from cells of a. oris t14v and found to contain 1,4-, 4,6- and 3,4-linked glucose, 1,4-linked mannose, and 2,4-linked galactose residues. when immobilized  onto plastic wells this polysaccharide supported binding of l. lactis expressing  sspb, but not binding of l. lactis expressing other agi/ii family proteins. purified recombinant navp region of sspb, comprising amino acid (aa) residues 41-847, bound a. oris polysaccharide but the c-domain (932-1470 aa residues) did  not. a site-directed deletion of 29 aa residues (delta691-718) close to the predicted binding cleft within the sspb v-region ablated binding of the navp region to polysaccharide. these results infer that the v-region head of sspb recognizes an actinomyces polysaccharide ligand, so further characterizing a lectin-like coaggregation mechanism occurring between two important primary colonizers.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of filling materials used in primary teeth pulpotomy.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial activity of pulp capping materials used in primary teeth (formocresol [fc], zinc oxide and eugenol cement [zoe], zoe mixed with fc [zoefc], mineral trioxide aggregate [mta] and calcium hydroxide [ch]) against cariogenic bacteria. the agar plate diffusion test was used for the cultures, including saline solution as a negative control.  a base layer of 15 ml of brain heart infusion agar was inoculated with 300 ml of  each inoculum. twelve wells were made and completely filled with one of the testing materials for each bacteria strain. the plates were incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 h. zones of microbial inhibition and material diffusion were measured and photographed. the results obtained were analyzed by kruskal-wallis and mann-whitney non-parametric tests. respectively, the medium zones of bacteria inhibition of fc, zoe, zoefc, mta and ch against streptococcus mutans growth were 28.5, 15.2, 20.8, 9.3 and 11.6; against lactobacillus acidophilus growth were 28.7, 14.8, 15.3, 15.2 and 20.0, and against actinomyces viscosus growth were 13.6, 13.5, 14.7, 10.0 and 13.6. we might confirmed the high antibacterial activity of fc solution, especially against s. mutans and l. acidophilus, as wells as, the low inhibitory effect of mta cement on the cariogenic bacteria studied.

TI  == analysis of microbiota in stable patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
AB  == to identify the bacterial diversity (microbiota) in expectorated sputum, a pyrosequencing method that investigates complex microbial communities of expectorated sputum was done in 19 stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients (mean (sd) fev1: 47 (18%) of predicted value). using conventional culture, 3 phyla and 20 bacterial genera were identified, whereas the pyrosequencing approach detected 9 phyla and 43 genera (p < 0.001). in sputum the prevalent genera with pyrosequencing approach were streptococcus, actinomyces, neisseria, haemophilus, rothia, fusobacterium, gemella, granulicatella, porphyromonas, prevotella and veillonella. enterobacteriaceae, detected frequently in conventional culture, were not significantly detected with pyrosequencing methods. in addition, we found that important pathogens such as haemophilus and moraxella were detected more frequently with the new genetic procedures. the presence of enterobacteriaceae is probably overestimated with conventional culture, whereas other difficult cultivable pathogens are underestimated. these studies open a new perspective for evaluating the role of bacterial colonization in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease pathogenesis and  progression.

TI  == critical roles of arginine in growth and biofilm development by streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii is an oral commensal and an early coloniser of dental plaque. in vitro, s. gordonii is conditionally auxotrophic for arginine in monoculture but biosynthesises arginine when coaggregated with actinomyces oris.  here, we investigated the arginine-responsive regulatory network of s. gordonii and the basis for conditional arginine auxotrophy. arcb, the catabolic ornithine  carbamoyltransferase involved in arginine degradation, was also essential for arginine biosynthesis. however, arcb was poorly expressed following arginine depletion, indicating that arcb levels may limit s. gordonii arginine biosynthesis. arginine metabolism gene expression was tightly co-ordinated by three argr/ahrc family regulators, encoded by argr, ahrc and arcr genes. microarray analysis revealed that > 450 genes were regulated in response to rapid shifts in arginine concentration, including many genes involved in adhesion and biofilm formation. in a microfluidic salivary biofilm model, low concentrations of arginine promoted s. gordonii growth, whereas high concentrations (> 5 mm arginine) resulted in dramatic reductions in biofilm biomass and changes to biofilm architecture. collectively, these data indicate that arginine metabolism  is tightly regulated in s. gordonii and that arginine is critical for gene regulation, cellular growth and biofilm formation. manipulating exogenous arginine concentrations may be an attractive approach for oral biofilm control.

TI  == comparison of oral microbial profiles between children with severe early childhood caries and caries-free children using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == objective: early childhood caries (ecc) has become a prevalent public health problem among chinese preschool children. the bacterial microflora is considered  to be an important factor in the formation and progress of dental caries. however, high-throughput and large-scale studies of the primary dentition are lacking. the present study aimed to compare oral microbial profiles between children with severe ecc (secc) and caries-free children. methods: both saliva and supragingival plaque samples were obtained from children with secc (n = 20) and caries-free children (n = 20) aged 3 to 4 years. the samples were assayed using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). results: a total  of 379 bacterial species were detected in both the saliva and supragingival plaque samples from all children. thirteen (including streptococcus) and two (streptococcus and actinomyces) bacterial species in supragingival plaque and saliva, respectively, showed significant differences in prevalence between the two groups. of these, the frequency of streptococcus mutans detection was significantly higher in both saliva (p = 0.026) and plaque (p = 0.006) samples from the secc group than in those from the caries-free group. conclusions: the findings of our study revealed differences in the oral microbiota between the secc and caries-free groups several genera, including streptococcus, porphyromonas, and actinomyces, are strongly associated with secc and can be potential biomarkers of dental caries in the primary dentition.

TI  == periodontal therapy effects on nitrite related to oral bacteria: a 6-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == background: nitrite is a biological factor relevant to oral and systemic homeostasis. through an oral bacteria reduction process it was suggested that periodontal therapy and chlorhexidine rinse could impact nitrite levels leading to negative effects such as increase in blood pressure. this 6-month randomized clinical trial evaluated the effects of periodontal therapeutic protocols on salivary nitrite and its relation to subgingival bacteria. methods: 90 periodontitis patients were randomly allocated to debridement procedures in 4 weekly sections (quadrant scaling-qs) or within 24 hours (full-mouth scaling-fms) in conjunction with a 60-day chlorhexidine (chx) (qs+chx and fms+chx), placebo (qs+placebo and fms+placebo), or no mouth rinse (qs+none and fms+none) use. real-time pcr determined total bacterial, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans,  porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundi levels. salivary nitrite concentration was determined with griess reagent. data were statistically analyzed at baseline, 3, and 6 months by anova (analysis of variance), kruskal-wallis, mann-whitney, and spearman correlation tests (p<0.05). results: nitrite concentrations did not tend to change over time. regarding chx use, there was a negative correlation between nitrite and total bacterial load at 6 months (fms+chx) and one positive correlation between p.gingivalis and nitrite at baseline (qs+chx). independently of rinse type, in the fms group nitrite negatively correlated with several microbial parameters and also with a higher percentage of deep periodontal pockets. conclusions: the relation between nitrite and bacterial levels appear weak. short-term scaling exhibited a greater influence on nitrite concentrations then the long-term chx use.

TI  == intracranial bacterial infections of oral origin.
AB  == brain abscesses are rare but potentially deadly complications of odontogenic infections. this phenomenon has been described mainly in the form of case reports, as large-scale studies are difficult to perform. we compiled a total of  60 previously published cases of such a complication to investigate the predisposing factors, microbiology, and clinical outcomes of intracranial abscesses of odontogenic origin. a systematic review of the literature using the  pubmed database was performed. men accounted for 82.1% of cases, and the mean age was 42.1 years. caries with periapical involvement and periodontitis were the two most common intra-oral sources, and wisdom tooth extraction was the most common preceding dental procedure. in 56.4% of cases, there were obvious signs of dental disease prior to development of intracranial infection. commonly implicated microorganisms included streptococcus viridans (especially the anginosus group),  actinomyces, peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella corrodens. there was an 8.3% mortality rate.  intracranial abscesses can form anywhere within the brain, and appear unrelated to the side of dental involvement. this suggests that hematogenous spread is the  most likely route of dissemination.

TI  == highly efficient antibacterial surface grafted with a triclosan-decorated poly(n-hydroxyethylacrylamide) brush.
AB  == this work presented a highly efficient antibacterial ti-surface which was grafted with poly(n-hydroxyethylacrylamide) (pheaa) brush and further decorated with triclosan (tcs). the modified surfaces were characterized using contact angle measurements, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and attenuated total reflectance  fourier transform infrared. the antibacterial performance of the modified surfaces was evaluated using the streptococcus mutans and actinomyces naeslundii  attachment test. the ti surface with pheaa brush (ti-pheaa) was able to resist the adhesion of the bacteria, while the tcs-decorated ti surface (ti-tcs) showed  the capability of killing the bacteria adhered on the surface. as we coupled the  tcs to the pheaa brush, the surface showed highly efficient antibacterial performance due to the combination of the resistance to the bacteria adhesion and its activity of killing bacteria.

TI  == one-step high-efficiency crispr/cas9-mediated genome editing in streptomyces.
AB  == the rna-guided dna editing technology crisprs (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/cas9 had been used to introduce double-stranded breaks into genomes and to direct subsequent site-specific insertions/deletions or the replacement of genetic material in bacteria, such as escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumonia, and lactobacillus reuteri. in this study, we established a high-efficiency crispr/cas9 genome editing plasmid pkccas9do for use in streptomyces genetic manipulation, which comprises a target-specific guide rna, a codon-optimized cas9, and two homology-directed repair templates. by delivering pkccas9do series editing plasmids into the model strain streptomyces coelicolor m145, through one-step intergeneric transfer, we achieved the genome editing at different levels with high efficiencies of 60%-100%, including single gene deletion, such as actii-orf4, redd, and glnr, and single large-size gene cluster  deletion, such as the antibiotic biosynthetic clusters of actinorhodin (act) (21.3 kb), undecylprodigiosin (red) (31.6 kb), and ca(2+)-dependent antibiotic (82.8 kb). furthermore, we also realized simultaneous deletions of actii-orf4 and redd, and of the act and red biosynthetic gene clusters with high efficiencies of 54% and 45%, respectively. finally, we applied this system to introduce nucleotide point mutations into the rpsl gene, which conferred the mutants with resistance to streptomycin. notably, using this system, the time required for one round of genome modification is reduced by one-third or one-half of those for conventional methods. these results clearly indicate that the established crispr/cas9 genome editing system substantially improves the genome editing efficiency compared with the currently existing methods in streptomyces, and it has promise for application to genome modification in other actinomyces species.

TI  == 16s rrna gene-based metagenomic analysis identifies a novel bacterial co-prevalence pattern in dental caries.
AB  == objective: to identify the prevalence of acidogenic and nonacidogenic bacteria in patients with polycaries lesions, and to ascertain caries specific bacterial prevalence in relation to noncaries controls. materials and methods: total genomic dna extracted from saliva of three adults and four children from the same family were subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing analysis on a next generation sequencer, the pgs-ion torrent. those bacterial genera with read counts > 1000 were considered as significant in each of the subject and used to associate the occurrence with caries. results and conclusion: sequencing analysis indicated a higher prevalence of streptococcus, rothia, granulicatella, gemella, actinomyces, selenomonas, haemophilus and veillonella in the caries group relative to controls. while higher prevalence of streptococcus, rothia and granulicatella were observed in all caries samples, the prevalence of others was observable in 29-57% of samples. interestingly, rothia and selenomonas, which are known to occur within anaerobic environments of dentinal caries and subgingival plaque biofilms, were seen in the saliva of these caries patients. taken together, the study has identified for the first time a unique co-prevalence pattern of bacteria in caries patients that may be explored as distinct caries specific bacterial signature to predict cariogenesis in high-risk primary and mixed dentition age groups.

TI  == [antibacterial activity of synthetic antimicrobial decapeptide against oral bacteria].
AB  == objective: this study aims to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide, a novel antimicrobial peptide, against several major cariogenic and periodontopathogenic bacteria in vitro. methods in this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity of decapeptide against streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and saccharomyces albicans in vitro using the agar diffusion method and broth dilution method. furthermore, a time-kill kinetic study of decapeptide against s. mutans was performed. results: the results showed that decapeptide exhibited antimicrobial activity against various  oral bacteria and fungi. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of main cariogenic bacteria ranged from 62.5 mug . ml(-1) to 125 mug . ml(-1), and the mic of periodontopathogenic bacteria tested ranged from 250 mug . ml(-1) to 1,000 mug . ml(-1). among the bacteria tested, decapeptide had a strong inhibitory effect on cariogenic s. mutans. results of the time-kill kinetic studies showed that decapeptide reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by more than one order of magnitude after 20 min of incubation, and thoroughly killed s. mutans after 30 min. no viable cells could be detected after 24 h of incubation. conclusion: this study suggest that decapeptide might have potential clinical application in treating dental caries by killing s. mutans within dental plaque.

AB  == background and objective: bacterial invasion into pulps of primary teeth can lead to infection and premature tooth loss in children. this pilot study aimed to explore whether the microbiota of carious exposures of dental pulps resembles that of carious dentin or that of infected root canals. design: children with severe early childhood caries were studied. children were consented and extent of caries, plaque, and gingivitis measured. bacteria were sampled from carious lesion biofilms and vital carious exposures of pulps, and processed by anaerobic  culture. isolates were characterized from partial sequences of the 16s rrna gene  and identified by comparison with taxa in the human oral microbiome database (http://www.homd.org). the microbiotas of carious lesions and dental pulps were compared using univariate and multivariate approaches. results: the microbiota of cariously exposed pulps was similar in composition to that of carious lesion biofilms except that fewer species/taxa were identified from pulps. the major taxa identified belonged to the phyla firmicutes (mainly streptococci) and actinobacteria (mainly actinomyces species). actinomyces and selenomonas species  were associated with carious lesions whereas veillonella species, particularly veillonella dispar was associated with pulps. other bacteria detected in pulps included streptococcus mutans, parascardovia denticolens, bifidobacterium longum, and several lactobacillus and actinomyces species. by principal, component analysis pulp microbiotas grouped together, whereas those in caries biofilms were widely dispersed. conclusions: we conclude that the microbiota of cariously exposed vital primary pulps is composed of a subset of species associated with carious lesions. vital primary pulps had a dominant firmicutes and actinobacteria microbiota which contrasts with reports of endodontic infections which can harbor a gram-negative microbiota. the microbiota of exposed primary pulps may provide insight into bacterial species at the forefront of caries invasion in dentinal lesions that can invade into the pulp and the nature of species that need suppressing for successful pulp therapy.

TI  == [analysis of microbial diversity of supra-gingival plaque in dental caries].
AB  == objective: to investigate the microbial composition and differences in dental plaque of caries and caries-free adults. methods: caries-active (n = 16) was defined as an individual who had at least three untreated decayed tooth and decayed-missing-filled-tooth (dmft) score greater than 6. caries-free (n = 16) was defined as an individual who had a dmft score equal to zero. the patients were 18-35 years old. samples from supra-gingival plaque were obtained and pcr-denaturing gel electrophoresis cloning and sequencing of caries pathogens were used to catch the core microbial of dental caries. results: six phylum, 28 genus and 88 species were detected. in caries group, prevotella, capnocytophaga,  actinomyces, veillonella and corynebacterium were predominant, accounting for 56.2% (334/594) of the total cloning number of caries group. caries-free group contained more predonminant genus than caries group. prevotella, veillonella, capnocytophaga, corynebacterium, streptococcus, actinomyces, aggregatibacter and  neisseria were predominant, accounting for 65.2% (354/543) of the total cloning number of caries-free group. caries group had less diversity than the caries-free group. the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.05). conclusions: caries might be caused by potentially pathogenic microbial communities rather than a single pathogen. in the progress of dental caries, the microbial diversity decreased.

TI  == establishment of an oral infection model resembling the periodontal pocket in a perfusion bioreactor system.
AB  == periodontal infection involves a complex interplay between oral biofilms, gingival tissues and cells of the immune system in a dynamic microenvironment. a  humanized in vitro model that reduces the need for experimental animal models, while recapitulating key biological events in a periodontal pocket, would constitute a technical advancement in the study of periodontal disease. the aim of this study was to use a dynamic perfusion bioreactor in order to develop a gingival epithelial-fibroblast-monocyte organotypic co-culture on collagen sponges. an 11 species subgingival biofilm was used to challenge the generated tissue in the bioreactor for a period of 24 h. the histological and scanning electron microscopy analysis displayed an epithelial-like layer on the surface of the collagen sponge, supported by the underlying ingrowth of gingival fibroblasts, while monocytic cells were also found within the sponge mass. bacterial quantification of the biofilm showed that in the presence of the organotypic tissue, the growth of selected biofilm species, especially campylobacter rectus, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, and porphyromonas gingivalis, was suppressed, indicating a potential antimicrobial effect by the tissue. multiplex immunoassay analysis of cytokine secretion showed that interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-2, il-4, and tumor necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha levels in cell culture supernatants were significantly up-regulated in presence of the biofilm, indicating a positive inflammatory response of the organotypic tissue to the biofilm challenge. in conclusion, this  novel host-biofilm interaction organotypic model might resemble the periodontal pocket and have an important impact on the study of periodontal infections, by minimizing the need for the use of experimental animal models.

TI  == rapid and sensitive pcr-dipstick dna chromatography for multiplex analysis of the oral microbiota.
AB  == a complex of species has been associated with dental caries under the ecological  hypothesis. this study aimed to develop a rapid, sensitive pcr-dipstick dna chromatography assay that could be read by eye for multiplex and semiquantitative analysis of plaque bacteria. parallel oligonucleotides were immobilized on a dipstick strip for multiplex analysis of target dna sequences of the caries-associated bacteria, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, scardovia wiggsiae, actinomyces species, and veillonella parvula. streptavidin-coated blue-colored latex microspheres were to generate signal. target dna amplicons with an oligonucleotide-tagged terminus and a biotinylated terminus were coupled with latex beads through a streptavidin-biotin interaction  and then hybridized with complementary oligonucleotides on the strip. the accumulation of captured latex beads on the test and control lines produced blue  bands, enabling visual detection with the naked eye. the pcr-dipstick dna chromatography detected quantities as low as 100 pg of dna amplicons and demonstrated 10- to 1000-fold higher sensitivity than pcr-agarose gel electrophoresis, depending on the target bacterial species. semiquantification of bacteria was performed by obtaining a series of chromatograms using serial 10-fold dilution of pcr-amplified dna extracted from dental plaque samples. the assay time was less than 3 h. the semiquantification procedure revealed the relative amounts of each test species in dental plaque samples, indicating that this disposable device has great potential in analysis of microbial composition in the oral cavity and intestinal tract, as well as in point-of-care diagnosis of microbiota-associated diseases.

TI  == synergistic effect of 2% chlorhexidine combined with proteolytic enzymes on biofilm disruption and killing.
AB  == aim: to investigate the dynamics of a disinfection regimen using 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k in combination with 2% chlorhexidine (with or without ultrasonics) using a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies model biofilm. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus  epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth. the treatment groups included 1% trypsin and 2% chlorhexidine (chx), 1% proteinase k and 2% chx (with and without ultrasonics). 2% chx was the positive control and untreated group, and sterile saline (with and without ultrasonics) was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective in reducing viable counts and the substratum coverage than those of all other groups (p < 0.05). the viable counts of the proteinase k and chx group used with (4.26 +/- 0.58 log10 cfu ml-1 ) or without ultrasonics (5.05 +/-  1.36 log10 cfu ml-1 ) were significantly reduced (p < 0.05) as compared with the  untreated control (7.67 +/- 0.84 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and saline groups used with (6.57 +/- 0.73 log10 cfu ml-1 ) and without ultrasonics (6.74 +/- 0.10 log10 cfu  ml-1 ). the chx group was less effective in biofilm disruption compared to when used in combination with trypsin and proteinase k. conclusion: the trypsin and chx group with ultrasonics was significantly more effective at reducing bacterial viable counts and disrupting biofilm.

TI  == identification of non-streptococcal organisms from human dental plaque grown on the streptococcus-selective medium mitis-salivarius agar.
AB  == objective: mitis-salivarius (ms) agar has been used widely in microbial epidemiological studies because oral viridans streptococci can be selectively grown on this medium. even though the previous findings reported the limited selecting power of ms agar for streptococcus strains, the identities of non-streptococcal strains from human oral samples which can grow on this medium are not clear yet. in this study, we identified non-streptococcal organisms grown on ms agar plates by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene. design: eighty bacterial colonies on ms plates were isolated from plaque samples, and bacterial identification was achieved with the rapid id 32 strep system and mini api reader. the bacterial colonies identified as non-streptococci by the api system were selected for further identification. the 16s rrna gene was amplified by pcr and verified using dna sequencing analysis for identification. sequences were compared with those of reference organisms in the genome database of the national center for biotechnology information using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). results: among the 11 isolated non-streptococcal strains on ms plates, 3 strains  were identified as actinomyces naeslundii, 7 strains were identified as actinomyces oris and 1 strain were identified as actinomyces sp. using blastn. conclusions: in this study, we showed that some oral actinomyces species can grow on streptococcus-selective ms agar plates.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of lactobacillus reuteri on cariogenic bacteria streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, and periodontal diseases actinomyces naeslundii and tannerella forsythia.
AB  == lactic acid bacteria (lab) are well known for their beneficial effects on human health in the intestine and immune system; however, there are few studies on the  impact they can generate in oral health. the aim of this study was to test and compare in vitro antimicrobial activity of l. reuteri on pathogenic bacteria involved in the formation of dental caries: s. mutans, s. gordonii, and periodontal disease: a. naeslundii and t. forsythia. also, we determined the growth kinetics of each bacterium involved in this study. before determining the  antimicrobial action of l. reuteri on cariogenic bacteria and periodontal disease, the behavior and cell development time of each pathogenic bacterium were studied. once the conditions for good cell growth of each of selected pathogens were established according to their metabolic requirements, maximum exponential growth was determined, this being the reference point for analyzing the development or inhibition by lab using the kirby bauer method. chlorhexidine 0.12 % was positive control. l. reuteri was shown to have an inhibitory effect against s. mutans, followed by t. forsythia and s. gordonii, and a less significant effect against a. naeslundii. regarding the effect shown by l. reuteri on the two major pathogens, we consider its potential use as a possible functional food in the prevention or treatment of oral diseases.

TI  == antibiofilm efficacy of photosensitizer-functionalized bioactive nanoparticles on multispecies biofilm.
AB  == introduction: newer disinfection strategies based on antibacterial nanoparticles  and photodynamic therapy (pdt) aim to eliminate residual biofilm bacteria during  root canal treatment. the aim of the current study was to test the newly developed rose bengal-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles (csrbnps) for their interaction/uptake with monospecies bacteria/biofilm and assess their antibiofilm efficacy on a multispecies biofilm model in vitro. methods: the interaction of csrbnps with bacterial cells was conducted using atomic force microscopy. their membrane-damaging effect was determined by measuring the absorbance at 260 nm (od260nm) using enterococcus faecalis. the penetration of csrbnps into e. faecalis biofilms was evaluated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm).  multispecies biofilms of streptococcus oralis, prevotella intermedia, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown on dentin sections for 21 days to assess the antibiofilm efficacy. the biofilms were subjected to pdt (60 j/cm(2)) using csrbnps and rose bengal. the treated/untreated biofilms were examined under scanning electron microscopy and clsm. results: the csrbnps synthesized were 60 +/- 20 nm and showed absorption spectra similar to rose bengal. atomic force microscopy showed adherence of csrbnps to bacteria, roughening of cell surface, and cell disruption after pdt. csrbnp treatment resulted in significantly increased bacterial membrane damage (p < .05). csrbnps exhibited deeper penetration into the biofilm structure. scanning electron microscopy and clsm confirmed the complete disruption of multispecies biofilm with a reduction in viable bacteria and biofilm thickness (p < .05). conclusions: these novel photosensitizer functionalized bioactive nanoparticles with increased affinity to bacterial cell membrane, higher penetration into biofilm structure, and enhanced  ability to eliminate clinically relevant multispecies bacterial biofilm present a potential antibiofilm agent for root canal disinfection.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of gaseous and aqueous ozone on caries pathogen microorganisms grown in biofilms.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the anti-microbial effect of gaseous and aqueous ozone on biofilms of caries pathogen microorganisms with regard to concentration and time  dependency. methods: biofilm cultures of actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus paracasei were grown on nitro-cellulose-membranes for 48 hours. the membranes were cut into equal-sized pieces and exposed to chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) (positive control; 0.1-20%), gaseous (1-64 g m3)  and aqueous ozone (1.25-20 microg ml(-1)) for 60 seconds. the influence of exposure time (30-120 seconds) was tested for exemplary concentrations of the three agents. colony forming units of bacteria were counted. the bacteria survival rate was given as percentage of the negative control (pbs for chx/aqueous ozone, ambient air for gaseous ozone). results: there was no difference in bacterial reduction of different species with general reduction close to zero for high concentrations of all agents. univariate anova with partial eta-squared (eta2) statistics showed major effects for concentration/contact time of the agent on bacteria survival. high concentrated gaseous and aqueous ozone seem to be potential alternatives to chx with equivalent antimicrobial activity.

TI  == the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavity of one-year-old infants delivered pre-term with very low birthweights: a case control study.
AB  == background: recently, the dental literature has focused mainly on the microbial colonization of healthy full-term infants and their mothers or caretakers. however, oral microbial acquisition by premature infants has not been adequately  investigated, and the correlation between pre-term birth and the presence of cariogenic and periodontal pathogens has not been determined. the aim of this study was to identify the presence and quantities of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens in the oral cavities of 12-month-old infants and compare the occurrence of these microbes between a cohort of pre-term infants with very low birthweights and a control cohort comprising full-term infants. methods: the research cohort was composed of 69 one-year-old infants, of whom 24  were born prematurely with very low birthweights and 45 of whom were carried to full term. information regarding the infants' gestational age, mode of delivery,  general health status, birthweight and antibiotic use were obtained from hospital records and through oral interviews. at 12 months of age, both groups of infants  were examined, and unstimulated saliva samples from the dorsum of the tongue and  dental plaque samples were collected. the microorganisms (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp., actinomyces spp., aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum) were identified and their quantities were evaluated using a pcr-based method. the chi-squared and fisher's factorial tests were used for the statistical evaluations. results: the infants had a high prevalence of cariogenic microbes and of fusosbacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. cariogenic microbes were detected in 91.7% of the very low birthweight infants and in all full-term infants. periodontal pathogens were present in 83% of the pre-term infants and in 96% of the full-term infants. a significant difference was found between the cohorts in terms of the presence of s. mutans. most of the  very low birthweight infants had negative values of this microbe, while the full-term infants had positive values. conclusions: this study confirms the early transmission of representative cariogenic and periodontal pathogens to the oral cavity of one-year-old infants and a higher prevalence of s. mutans in full-term  infants than in premature infants.

AB  == objectives: the objective of this study is to analyse the correlation of our own  design of oral health scale (grades 0 and 1-better oral health vs. grades 2 and 3-poorer oral health) with the salivary microbiota. patients and methods: the oral health scale we elaborated was evaluated in 100 adults (25 patients from each global oral health grade). saliva samples collected from these patients were analysed using microbiological culture techniques, determining the presence/absence and the concentrations of some odontopathogens and periodontopathogens. results: in comparison with the global oral health grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the presence of odontopathogens (78 vs. 38 %; streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (100 vs. 90 %; aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, campylobacter spp., fusobacterium spp. and prevotella gingivalis). in comparison with the grades 0-1, the grades 2-3 presented significantly higher values for the concentrations (cfu/ml log10) of facultative  anaerobes, strict anaerobes, odontopathogens (s. mutans, lactobacillus spp. and actinomyces spp.) and periodontopathogens (a. actinomycetemcomitans, capnocytophaga spp., campylobacter spp. and fusobacterium spp.). conclusion: our  new global oral health scale shows a positive correlation with the detection and  quantification of certain odontopathogens and periodontopathogens present in the  saliva, confirming their possible infectious potential. clinical relevance: our own design of oral health scale could be particularly useful for the epidemiological study of different populations, the evaluation of the influence of oral health on the development of certain systemic diseases as well as the analysis of inter- and intra-individual variability of the oral microbiota in relation to the different grades of the oral health scale.

TI  == the oral microbiome in dental caries.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common chronic and multifactorial diseases affecting the human population. the appearance of a caries lesion is determined by the coexistence of three main factors: acidogenic and acidophilic microorganisms, carbohydrates derived from the diet, and host factors. socio-economic and behavioral factors also play an important role in the etiology of the disease. caries develops as a result of an ecological imbalance in the stable oral microbiom. oral microorganisms form dental plaque on the surfaces of  teeth, which is the cause of the caries process, and shows features of the classic biofilm. biofilm formation appears to be influenced by large scale changes in protein expression over time and under genetic control cariogenic microorganisms produce lactic, formic, acetic and propionic acids, which are a product of carbohydrate metabolism. their presence causes a decrease in ph level  below 5.5, resulting in demineralization of enamel hydroxyapatite crystals and proteolytic breakdown of the structure of tooth hard tissues. streptococcus mutans, other streptococci of the so-called non-mutans streptococci group, actinomyces and lactobacillus play a key role in this process. dental biofilm is  a dynamic, constantly active metabolically structure. the alternating processes of decrease and increase of biofilm ph occur, which are followed by the respective processes of de- and remineralisation of the tooth surface. in healthy conditions, these processes are in balance and no permanent damage to the tooth enamel surface occurs.

TI  == an in vitro biofilm model associated to dental implants: structural and quantitative analysis of in vitro biofilm formation on different dental implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: the impact of implant surfaces in dental biofilm development is presently unknown. the aim of this investigation was to assess in vitro the development of a complex biofilm model on titanium and zirconium implant surfaces, and to compare it with the same biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite surface. methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop an in vitro biofilm over sterile titanium, zirconium and hydroxyapatite discs, coated with saliva within the wells of pre-sterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates. the  selected species used represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the developed biofilms (growth time 1 to 120h) were studied with confocal laser scanning microscopy using a vital fluorescence technique and with low-temperature scanning electron microscopy. the number (colony forming units/biofilm) and kinetics of the bacteria within the biofilm were studied with quantitative pcr (qpcr). as outcome variables, the biofilm thickness, the percentage of cell vitality and the number of bacteria were compared using the analysis of variance. results: the bacteria adhered and matured within the biofilm over the three surfaces with similar dynamics. different surfaces, however, demonstrated differences both in the thickness, deposition of the extracellular polysaccharide matrix as well as in the organization of the bacterial cells. significance: while the formation and dynamics of an in vitro biofilm model was similar irrespective of the surface of  inoculation (hydroxyapatite, titanium or zirconium), there were significant differences in regards to the biofilm thickness and three-dimensional structure.

TI  == axenic culture of a candidate division tm7 bacterium from the human oral cavity and biofilm interactions with other oral bacteria.
AB  == the diversity of bacterial species in the human oral cavity is well recognized, but a high proportion of them are presently uncultivable. candidate division tm7  bacteria are almost always detected in metagenomic studies but have not yet been  cultivated. in this paper, we identified candidate division tm7 bacterial phylotypes in mature plaque samples from around orthodontic bonds in subjects undergoing orthodontic treatment. successive rounds of enrichment in laboratory media led to the isolation of a pure culture of one of these candidate division tm7 phylotypes. the bacteria formed filaments of 20 to 200 mum in length within agar plate colonies and in monospecies biofilms on salivary pellicle and exhibited some unusual morphological characteristics by transmission electron microscopy, including a trilaminated cell surface layer and dense cytoplasmic deposits. proteomic analyses of cell wall protein extracts identified abundant polypeptides predicted from the tm7 partial genomic sequence. pleiomorphic phenotypes were observed when the candidate division tm7 bacterium was grown in dual-species biofilms with representatives of six different oral bacterial genera. the tm7 bacterium formed long filaments in dual-species biofilm communities with actinomyces oris or fusobacterium nucleatum. however, the tm7 isolate grew as short rods or cocci in dual-species biofilms with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, parvimonas micra, or streptococcus gordonii, forming notably robust biofilms with the latter two species. the ability to cultivate tm7 axenically should majorly advance understanding of the physiology,  genetics, and virulence properties of this novel candidate division oral bacterium.

TI  == probing of microbial biofilm communities for coadhesion partners.
AB  == investigations of interbacterial adhesion in dental plaque development are currently limited by the lack of a convenient assay to screen the multitude of species present in oral biofilms. to overcome this limitation, we developed a solid-phase fluorescence-based screening method to detect and identify coadhesive partner organisms in mixed-species biofilms. the applicability of this method was demonstrated using coaggregating strains of type 2 fimbrial adhesin-bearing actinomyces and receptor polysaccharide (rps)-bearing streptococci. specific adhesin/receptor-mediated coadhesion was detected by overlaying bacterial strains immobilized to a nitrocellulose membrane with a suspended, fluorescein-labeled bacterial partner strain. coadhesion was comparable regardless of which cell type was labeled and which was immobilized. formaldehyde treatment of bacteria, either in suspension or immobilized on nitrocellulose, abolished actinomyces type 2 fimbrial adhesin but not streptococcal rps function, thereby providing a simple method for assigning complementary adhesins and glycan receptors to members of a  coadhering pair. the method's broader applicability was shown by overlaying colony lifts of dental plaque biofilm cultures with fluorescein-labeled strains of type 2 fimbriated actinomyces naeslundii or rps-bearing streptococcus oralis.  prominent coadhesion partners included not only streptococci and actinomyces, as  expected, but also other bacteria not identified in previous coaggregation studies, such as adhesin- or receptor-bearing strains of neisseria pharyngitis, rothia dentocariosa, and kingella oralis. the ability to comprehensively screen complex microbial communities for coadhesion partners of specific microorganisms  opens a new approach in studies of dental plaque and other mixed-species biofilms.

TI  == identification of the microbiota in carious dentin lesions using 16s rrna gene sequencing.
AB  == while mutans streptococci have long been assumed to be the specific pathogen responsible for human dental caries, the concept of a complex dental caries-associated microbiota has received significant attention in recent years.  molecular analyses revealed the complexity of the microbiota with the predominance of lactobacillus and prevotella in carious dentine lesions. however, characterization of the dentin caries-associated microbiota has not been extensively explored in different ethnicities and races. in the present study, the bacterial communities in the carious dentin of japanese subjects were analyzed comprehensively with molecular approaches using the16s rrna gene. carious dentin lesion samples were collected from 32 subjects aged 4-76 years, and the 16s rrna genes, amplified from the extracted dna with universal primers,  were sequenced with a pyrosequencer. the bacterial composition was classified into clusters i, ii, and iii according to the relative abundance (high, middle, low) of lactobacillus. the bacterial composition in cluster ii was composed of relatively high proportions of olsenella and propionibacterium or subdominated by heterogeneous genera. the bacterial communities in cluster iii were characterized by the predominance of atopobium, prevotella, or propionibacterium with streptococcus or actinomyces. some samples in clusters ii and iii, mainly related to atopobium and propionibacterium, were novel combinations of microbiota in carious dentin lesions and may be characteristic of the japanese population. clone library analysis revealed that atopobium sp. hot-416 and p. acidifaciens were specific species associated with dentinal caries among these genera in a japanese population. we summarized the bacterial composition of dentinal carious  lesions in a japanese population using next-generation sequencing and found typical japanese types with atopobium or propionibacterium predominating.

AB  == aims: to design and synthesize a library of structurally related, small molecules related to homologues of compounds produced by the plant petiveria alliacea and determine their ability to interfere with ai-2 cell-cell communication and biofilm formation by oral bacteria. many human diseases are associated with persistent bacterial biofilms. oral biofilms (dental plaque) are problematic as they are often associated with tooth decay, periodontal disease and systemic disorders such as heart disease and diabetes. methods and results: using a microplate-based approach, a bio-inspired small molecule library was screened for anti-biofilm activity against the oral species streptococcus mutans ua159, streptococcus sanguis 10556 and actinomyces oris mg1. to complement the static screen, a flow-based bioflux microfluidic system screen was also performed under  conditions representative of the human oral cavity. several compounds were found  to display biofilm inhibitory activity in all three of the oral bacteria tested.  these compounds were also shown to inhibit bioluminescence by vibrio harveyi and  were thus inferred to be quorum sensing (qs) inhibitors. conclusion: due to the structural similarity of these compounds to each other, and to key molecules in ai-2 biosynthetic pathways, we propose that these molecules potentially reduce biofilm formation via antagonism of qs or qs-related pathways. significance and impact of the study: this study highlights the potential for a non-antimicrobial-based strategy, focused on ai-2 cell-cell signalling, to control the development of dental plaque. considering that many bacterial species use ai-2 cell-cell signalling, as well as the increased concern of the use of antimicrobials in healthcare products, such an anti-biofilm approach could also be used to control biofilms in environments beyond the human oral cavity.

TI  == biofilm formation on the surface of modern implant abutment materials.
AB  == objective: to investigate the formation of biofilms on the surface of materials applied for the fabrication of implant abutments. material and methods: specimens were prepared from the implant abutment materials titanium, zirconia, and polyetheretherketone (peek); specimens made from polymethylmethacrylate (pmma) were used for reference. all specimens were polished to high gloss using silicon  carbide paper; surface roughness was determined using profilometry, and surface free energy was calculated from contact angle measurements. after the simulation  of salivary pellicle formation, multispecies biofilm formation was initiated by exposing the specimens to a suspension of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans for either 20 or 44 h. viable microbial biomass adherent to the specimens (n = 10 per material and incubation time) and the percentage of dead microorganisms in the different biofilms (n = 5, accordingly) were determined. results: significantly lower surface roughness was identified for peek and pmma than for zirconia and titanium (p < 0.001); surface free energy was significantly lower for zirconia than for peek (p = 0.038). significantly higher viable biomass and a significantly higher  percentage of dead microorganisms were identified after 44 h than after 20 h of biofilm formation (p < 0.001, respectively); after 20 h, peek surfaces harbored significantly lower viable biomass than the surfaces of the other materials (p <  0.0125). after 44 h, significant differences were identified in the percentage of dead microorganisms organized in the biofilms on the different materials (p = 0.012). conclusions: within the limitations of a laboratory study, the results suggest that biofilm formation on the surface of peek is equal or lower than on the surface of conventionally applied abutment materials such as zirconia and titanium. however, clinical studies are necessary to corroborate these preliminary results.

TI  == the female urinary microbiome: a comparison of women with and without urgency urinary incontinence.
AB  == bacterial dna and live bacteria have been detected in human urine in the absence  of clinical infection, challenging the prevailing dogma that urine is normally sterile. urgency urinary incontinence (uui) is a poorly understood urinary condition characterized by symptoms that overlap urinary infection, including urinary urgency and increased frequency with urinary incontinence. the recent discovery of the urinary microbiome warrants investigation into whether bacteria  contribute to uui. in this study, we used 16s rrna gene sequencing to classify bacterial dna and expanded quantitative urine culture (equc) techniques to isolate live bacteria in urine collected by using a transurethral catheter from women with uui and, in comparison, a cohort without uui. for these cohorts, we demonstrated that the uui and non-uui urinary microbiomes differ by group based on both sequence and culture evidences. compared to the non-uui microbiome, sequencing experiments revealed that the uui microbiome was composed of increased gardnerella and decreased lactobacillus. nine genera (actinobaculum, actinomyces, aerococcus, arthrobacter, corynebacterium, gardnerella, oligella, staphylococcus, and streptococcus) were more frequently cultured from the uui cohort. although lactobacillus was isolated from both cohorts, distinctions existed at the species level, with lactobacillus gasseri detected more frequently in the uui cohort and  lactobacillus crispatus most frequently detected in controls. combined, these data suggest that potentially important differences exist in the urinary microbiomes of women with and without uui, which have strong implications in prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of uui. importance: new evidence indicates that the human urinary tract contains microbial communities; however, the role of these communities in urinary health remains to be elucidated. urgency urinary incontinence (uui) is a highly prevalent yet poorly understood urinary condition  characterized by urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. given the significant overlap of uui symptoms with those of urinary tract infections, it is possible that uui may have a microbial component. we compared the urinary microbiomes of women affected by uui to those of a comparison group without uui,  using both high-throughput sequencing and extended culture techniques. we identified statistically significant differences in the frequency and abundance of bacteria present. these differences suggest a potential role for the urinary microbiome in female urinary health.

TI  == the effect of hydro alcoholic extract of seven plants on cariogenic bacteria--an  in vitro evaluation.
AB  == aim: to compare the antibacterial effect of hydro alcoholic extract of salvia officinalis, pimpinella anisum, satureja hortensis, rhus coriaria, carum copticum, mentha longifolia, achillea millefolium against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces viscosus through two in vitro methods. methods: in this experimental study, hydro-alcoholic extracts have been prepared  from the shoot of salvia officinalis, satureja hortensis, mentha longifolia and achillea millefolium, the seed of pimpinella anisum and carum copticum and the fruit of rhus coriaria with maceration method. their antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces viscosus have been evaluated with broth macrodilution and agar diffusion methods. results: in broth macrodilution method mic (minimum inhibitory concentration) of pimpinella anisum, salvia officinalis, mentha longifolia, achillea millefolium, satureja hortensis, carum copticum and rhus coriaria for streptococcus mutans were respectively 12.5, 6.25, 12.5, 50, 50, 12.5 and 50 mug/ml, for lactobacillus rhamnosus 12.5, 1.56, 3.12, 12.5, 6.25, 6.25 and 6.25 mug/ml and for actinomyces  viscosus 50, 12.5, 100, 50, 100, 25 and 25 mug/ml. in agar diffusion method pimpinella anisum, salvia officinalis and rhus coriaria against streptococcus mutans, pimpinella anisum, carum copticum and rhus coriaria against lactobacillus rhamnosus and mentha longifolia, rhus coriaria and carum copticum against actinomyces viscosus had antibacterial effects. conclusion: all seven extracts had growth inhibitory effects on all three bacteria. salvia officinalis had the greatest inhibitory effect on growth of all three bacteria. all of the extracts except carum copticum had bactericidal effect in the range of concentration. by agar diffusion method rhus coriaria had antibacterial effect against all three cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == colonisation of gingival epithelia by subgingival biofilms in vitro: role of "red complex" bacteria.
AB  == objectives: biofilm formation on tooth surface results in colonisation and invasion of the juxtaposed gingival tissue, eliciting strong inflammatory responses that lead to periodontal disease. this in vitro study investigated the  colonisation of human gingival multi-layered epithelium by multi-species subgingival biofilms, and evaluated the relative effects of the "red complex" species (porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia and treponema denticola). methods: the grown biofilm consisted of fusobacterium nucleatum, campylobacter rectus, veillonella dispar, p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, t. forsythia, t. denticola, actinomyces oris, streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus oralis, or its variant lacking the "red complex". after 48h in co-culture with the gingival epithelia, the bacterial species in the biofilm were quantified, whereas their localisation on the cell surface was investigated by combining confocal-laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescence in situ hybridisation  (fish), as well as by scanning electron microscopy (sem). results: exclusion of the "red complex" quantitatively affected s. oralis, but not other species. the "red-complex" species were all able to colonise the gingival epithelial cells. a  co-localisation trend was observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola, as determined by fish. however, in the absence of all three "red complex" bacteria from the biofilm, an immense colonisation of streptococci (potentially s. oralis) was observed on the gingival epithelia, as confirmed by both clsm and sem. conclusions: while the "red complex" species synergise in colonizing gingival epithelia, their absence from the biofilm enhances streptococcal colonisation. this antagonism with streptococci reveals that the "red complex" may regulate biofilm virulence, with potential implications in periodontal pathogenesis.

TI  == improving photodynamic inactivation of bacteria in dentistry: highly effective and fast killing of oral key pathogens with novel tooth-colored type-ii photosensitizers.
AB  == increasing antibiotic resistances in microorganisms create serious problems in public health. this demands alternative approaches for killing pathogens to supplement standard treatment methods. photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) uses light activated photosensitizers (ps) to generate reactive oxygen species immediately upon illumination, inducing lethal phototoxicity. positively  charged phenalen-1-one derivatives are a new generation of ps for light-mediated  killing of pathogens with outstanding singlet oxygen quantum yield phidelta of >97%. upon irradiation with a standard photopolymerizer light (bluephase c8, 1260 +/- 50 mw/cm(2)) the ps showed high activity against the oral key pathogens enterococcus faecalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. at a concentration of 10 mum, a maximum efficacy of more than 6 log10 steps (>/= 99.9999%) of bacteria killing is reached in less than 1 min (light dose 50 j/cm(2)) after one single treatment. the pyridinium substituent as positively charged moiety is especially advantageous for antimicrobial action.

AB  == objectives: to characterise the antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating cross-linked quaternised polyethyleneimine (qpei) nanoparticles in  relation to their distribution in the bulk material. methods: the antibacterial effect of resin composite incorporating qpei nanoparticle was tested against various oral pathogens, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscousus, lactobacilus casei and whole saliva. nanoparticle distribution in the modified resin composite was assessed using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps). additionally, the degree of conversion was recorded. results: total bacterial inhibition was detected against all the tested pathogens following direct contact with the outer surface of the modified resin composite. similarly, the inner surface of the modified resin composite caused total inhibition. electron microscope images showed bacterial death. xps revealed surface i(-) ions on both the outer and the inner surfaces of the modified composite. no i(-) ions were detected in the unmodified composite. nanoparticle distribution was higher on the inner surface of the modified composite. the composite's degree of conversion was unaffected by nanoparticle addition. conclusions: qpei nanoparticles represent a new generation of antibacterial nanoparticles which are highly promising in preventing bacterial recontamination  when restoring teeth.

AB  == objectives: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacy of clearfil se protect (cp) and clearfil se bond (cb) after curing and rinsed against five individual oral microorganisms as well as a mixture of bacterial culture prepared from the selected test organisms. methods: bacterial suspensions were prepared from single species of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus gordonii,  actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus lactis, as well as mixed bacterial suspensions from these organisms. dentin bonding system discs (6 mmx2 mm) were prepared, cured, washed and placed on the bacterial suspension of single species  or multispecies bacteria for 15, 30 and 60 min. mtt, live/dead bacterial viability (antibacterial effect), and xtt (metabolic activity) assays were used to test the two dentin system's antibacterial effect. all assays were done in triplicates and each experiment repeated at least three times. data were submitted to anova and scheffe's f-test (5%). results: greater than 40% bacteria  killing was seen within 15 min, and the killing progressed with increasing time of incubation with cp discs. however, a longer (60 min) period of incubation was  required by cp to achieve similar antimicrobial effect against mixed bacterial suspension. cb had no significant effect on the viability or metabolic activity of the test microorganisms when compared to the control bacterial culture. cp was significantly effective in reducing the viability and metabolic activity of the test organisms. significance: the results demonstrated the antimicrobial efficacy of cp both on single and multispecies bacterial culture. cp may be beneficial in  reducing bacterial infections in cavity preparations in clinical dentistry.

TI  == effect of a novel quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) on adhesion and antibacterial properties of dental adhesives.
AB  == this study investigated the resin-dentin bond strength (mutbs), degree of conversion (dc), and antibacterial potential of an innovative adhesive system containing a quaternary ammonium methacrylate polymer (qamp) using in situ and in vitro assays. forty-two human third molars were flattened until the dentin was exposed and were randomly distributed into three groups of self-etching adhesive  systems: clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp (experimental group), clearfil protect bond (positive control) and clearfil se bond (negative control). after light curing, three 1 mm-increments of composite resin were bonded to each dentin surface. a total of thirty of these bonded teeth (10 teeth per group) was sectioned to obtain stick-shaped specimens and tested under tensile stress immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of storage in distilled water. twelve bonded teeth (4 teeth per group) were longitudinally sectioned in a mesio-to-distal direction to obtain resin-bonded dentin slabs. in situ dc was evaluated by micro-raman spectroscopy. in vitro dc of thin films of each adhesive system was measured using fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. in vitro susceptibility tests of these three adhesive systems were performed by the minimum inhibitory/minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc) assays against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces naeslundii. no statistically significant difference in mutbs was observed between clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp and clearfil se bond (p>0.05) immediately, and after 6 and 12 months of water storage. however clearfil protect bond showed a significant reduction of mutbs after 12 months of storage (p=0.039). in addition, qamp provided no significant change in dc after incorporating into clearfil se bond (p>0.05). clearfil se bond containing 5% qamp demonstrated mic/mbc values similar to the positive control against l. casei and a. naeslundii and higher than the negative control for all evaluated bacterial strains. the use of qamp in an adhesive system demonstrated effective bond strength, a suitable degree of conversion, and adequate antibacterial effects against oral bacteria, and may be  useful as a new approach to provide long-lasting results for dental adhesives.

TI  == molecular studies of the structural ecology of natural occlusal caries.
AB  == microbiological studies of occlusal dental biofilms have hitherto been hampered by inaccessibility to the sampling site and demolition of the original biofilm architecture. this study shows for the first time the spatial distribution of bacterial taxa in vivo at various stages of occlusal caries, applying a molecular methodology involving preparation of embedded hard dental tissue slices for fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and confocal microscopy. eleven freshly extracted teeth were classified according to their occlusal caries status. the teeth were fixed, embedded, sectioned and decalcified before fish was performed using oligonucleotide probes for selected abundant species/genera associated with occlusal caries including streptococcus, actinomyces, veillonella, fusobacterium, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium. the sites showed distinct differences in the bacterial composition between different ecological niches in occlusal caries. biofilm observed along the entrance of fissures showed an inner layer of microorganisms organized in palisades often identified as actinomyces, covered by a more loosely structured bacterial layer consisting of diverse genera, similar to supragingival biofilm. biofilm within the fissure proper seemed less metabolically active, as judged by low fluorescence signal intensity and presence of material of non-bacterial origin. bacterial invasion (often lactobacillus and  bifidobacterium spp.) into the dentinal tubules was seen only at advanced stages  of caries with manifest cavity formation. it is concluded that the molecular methodology represents a valuable supplement to previous methods for the study of microbial ecology in caries by allowing analysis of the structural composition of the undisturbed biofilm in caries lesions in vivo.

TI  == an investigation of the effect of scaling-induced surface roughness on bacterial  adhesion in common fixed dental restorative materials.
AB  == statement of problem: bacterial plaque must be routinely removed from teeth, adjacent structures, and prostheses. however, the removal of this plaque can inadvertently increase the risk of future bacterial adhesion. purpose: the purpose of this investigation was to assess the change in the surface roughness of 3 different surfaces after dental prophylactic instrumentation and how this influenced bacterial adhesion. material and methods: forty specimens each of type iii gold alloy, lithium disilicate, and zirconia were fabricated in the same dimensions. the specimens were divided into 4 groups: ultrasonic scaler, stainless steel curette, prophylaxis cup, and control. pretreatment surface roughness measurements were made with a profilometer. surface treatments in each  group were performed with a custom mechanical scaler. posttreatment surface roughness values were measured. in turn, the specimens were inoculated with streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus. bacterial adhesion was assessed by rinsing the specimens with sterile saline to remove unattached cells. the specimens were then placed in sterile tubes with 1 ml of sterile saline. the solution was plated and quantified. scanning electron microscopy was performed. the statistical analysis of surface roughness was completed by using repeated-measures single-factor anova with a bonferroni correction. results: the surface roughness values for gold alloy specimens increased as a result of prophylaxis cup treatment (0.221 to 0.346 ra) (p<.01) and stainless steel curette treatment (0.264 to 1.835 ra) (p<.01). the results for bacterial adhesion to gold alloy proved inconclusive. a quantitative comparison indicated no statistically significant differences in pretreatment and posttreatment surface roughness values for lithium disilicate and zirconia specimens. in spite of these similarities, the overall bacterial adherence values for lithium disilicate were significantly greater than those recorded for gold alloy or zirconia (p<.05). instrumentation of the lithium disilicate and zirconia with the stainless steel curette significantly increased bacterial adhesion compared with the control (p<.05). conclusions: the results of this investigation indicate that type iii gold alloy exhibited increased surface roughness values after stainless steel curette and prophylaxis cup treatments. zirconia was less susceptible to bacterial adhesion than lithium disilicate, and greater bacterial  adhesion was found for the stainless steel curette than the other instrumentation methods.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of a multispecies oral biofilm on different implant surfaces.
AB  == biofilm accumulation on implant surfaces is one of the most important factors for early and late implant failure. because of the related clinical implications, the aim of this in vitro study was to compare the bacterial cell attachment of a four-species oral biofilm on titanium discs of purity grade 2 and 4, with machined surfaces and etched-thermochemically modified with avantblast(r). the in vitro biofilm model was composed of early (actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus  gordonii), secondary (veillonella parvula), and intermediate (fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum) colonizers of tooth surfaces. a total of 36 discs were divided into four groups: tigr2-c (titanium grade 2, machined surface), tigr2-t (titanium grade 2, modified surface with avantblast(r)), tigr4-c (titanium grade 4, machined surface), tigr4-t (titanium grade 4, modified surface with avantblast(r)). the experiment was repeated three times. biofilm viability was tested with 1% 2, 3, 5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution and bacterial cell quantification by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. descriptive analysis was performed to evaluate biofilm composition and differences between groups were checked with the mann-whitney test (p < 0.05). after one week, multispecies biofilms showed a similar pattern of bacterial composition on all analyzed implant surfaces. the most prevalent bacterium was v. parvula ( approximately 50% of the total biomass), followed by s. gordonii ( approximately 30%), f. nucleatum ssp. polymorphum ( approximately 10%) and a. naeslundii (<5%). total bacterial biomass was significantly higher in both grade-4-titanium surfaces (p < 0.05). the results demonstrated that not only implant surface treatment, but also titanium purity, influence early bacterial colonization.

TI  == a three-species biofilm model for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization.
AB  == although streptococcus mutans biofilms have been useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates and the effects of fluoride on dental demineralization, a more appropriate biofilm should be developed to demonstrate the influence of other oral bacteria on cariogenic biofilms. this study describes the development and validation of a three-species biofilm model comprising streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus gordonii for the evaluation of enamel and dentin demineralization after cariogenic challenges and fluoride exposure. single- or three-species biofilms were developed on dental substrata for 96 h, and biofilms were exposed to feast and famine episodes. the three-species biofilm model produced a large biomass, mostly comprising s. mutans (41%) and s. gordonii (44%), and produced significant demineralization in the dental substrata, although enamel demineralization was decreased by fluoride treatment. the findings indicate that the three-species biofilm model may be useful for evaluating the cariogenic potential of dietary carbohydrates other than sucrose and determining the effects of fluoride on dental substrata.

TI  == bacterial profile of dentine caries and the impact of ph on bacterial population  diversity.
AB  == dental caries is caused by the release of organic acids from fermentative bacteria, which results in the dissolution of hydroxyapatite matrices of enamel and dentine. while low environmental ph is proposed to cause a shift in the consortium of oral bacteria, favouring the development of caries, the impact of this variable has been overlooked in microbial population studies. this study aimed to detail the zonal composition of the microbiota associated with carious dentine lesions with reference to ph. we used 454 sequencing of the 16s rrna gene (v3-v4 region) to compare microbial communities in layers ranging in ph from 4.5-7.8 from 25 teeth with advanced dentine caries. pyrosequencing of the amplicons yielded 449,762 sequences. nine phyla, 97 genera and 409 species were identified from the quality-filtered, de-noised and chimera-free sequences. among the microbiota associated with dentinal caries, the most abundant taxa included lactobacillus sp., prevotella sp., atopobium sp., olsenella sp. and actinomyces sp. we found a disparity between microbial communities localised at acidic versus neutral ph strata. acidic conditions were associated with low diversity microbial populations, with lactobacillus species including l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and  l. crispatus, being prominent. in comparison, the distinctive species of a more diverse flora associated with neutral ph regions of carious lesions included alloprevotella tanerrae, leptothrix sp., sphingomonas sp. and streptococcus anginosus. while certain bacteria were affected by the ph gradient, we also found that approximately 60% of the taxa associated with caries were present across the investigated ph range, representing a substantial core. we demonstrated that some bacterial species implicated in caries progression show selective clustering with respect to ph gradient, providing a basis for specific therapeutic strategies.

TI  == massive parallel sequencing provides new perspectives on bacterial brain abscesses.
AB  == rapid development within the field of massive parallel sequencing (mps) is about  to bring this technology within reach for diagnostic microbiology laboratories. we wanted to explore its potential for improving diagnosis and understanding of polymicrobial infections, using bacterial brain abscesses as an example. we conducted a prospective nationwide study on bacterial brain abscesses. fifty-two  surgical samples were included over a 2-year period. the samples were categorized as either spontaneous intracerebral, spontaneous subdural, or postoperative. bacterial 16s rrna genes were amplified directly from the specimens and sequenced using ion torrent technology, with an average of 500,000 reads per sample. the results were compared to those from culture- and sanger sequencing-based diagnostics. compared to culture, mps allowed for triple the number of bacterial  identifications. aggregatibacter aphrophilus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and streptococcus intermedius or combinations of them were found in all spontaneous polymicrobial abscesses. f. nucleatum was systematically detected in samples with anaerobic flora. the increased detection rate for actinomyces spp. and facultative gram-negative rods further revealed several species associations. we  suggest that a. aphrophilus, f. nucleatum, and s. intermedius are key pathogens for the establishment of spontaneous polymicrobial brain abscesses. in addition,  f. nucleatum seems to be important for the development of anaerobic flora. mps can accurately describe polymicrobial specimens when a sufficient number of reads is used to compensate for unequal species concentrations and principles are defined to discard contaminant bacterial dna in the subsequent data analysis. this will contribute to our understanding of how different types of polymicrobial infections develop.

AB  == multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (m-fish) constitutes a favorable microbiological method for the analysis of spatial distribution of highly variable phenotypes found in multispecies oral biofilms. the combined use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) produces high-resolution three-dimensional (3d) images of individual bacteria in their natural environment. here, we describe the application of m-fish on early (streptococcus  spp., actinomyces naeslundii) and late colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella spp.) of in situ-formed oral biofilms, the acquisition of clsm images, as well as the qualitative and quantitative analysis of these digitally obtained and processed images.

TI  == salivary microbiota and metabolome associated with celiac disease.
AB  == this study aimed to investigate the salivary microbiota and metabolome of 13 children with celiac disease (cd) under a gluten-free diet (treated celiac disease [t-cd]). the same number of healthy children (hc) was used as controls. the salivary microbiota was analyzed by an integrated approach using culture-dependent and -independent methods. metabolome analysis was carried out by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry-solid-phase microextraction. compared to  hc, the number of some cultivable bacterial groups (e.g., total anaerobes) significantly (p < 0.05) differed in the saliva samples of the t-cd children. as  shown by community-level catabolic profiles, the highest shannon's diversity and  substrate richness were found in hc. pyrosequencing data showed the highest richness estimator and diversity index values for hc. levels of lachnospiraceae,  gemellaceae, and streptococcus sanguinis were highest for the t-cd children. streptococcus thermophilus levels were markedly decreased in t-cd children. the saliva of t-cd children showed the largest amount of bacteroidetes (e.g., porphyromonas sp., porphyromonas endodontalis, and prevotella nanceiensis), together with the smallest amount of actinobacteria. t-cd children were also characterized by decreased levels of some actinomyces species, atopobium species, and corynebacterium durum. rothia mucilaginosa was the only actinobacteria species found at the highest level in t-cd children. as shown by multivariate statistical analyses, the levels of organic volatile compounds markedly differentiated t-cd children. some compounds (e.g., ethyl-acetate, nonanal, and 2-hexanone) were found to be associated with t-cd children. correlations (false discovery rate [fdr], <0.05) were found between the relative abundances of bacteria and some volatile organic compounds (vocs). the findings of this study indicated that cd is associated with oral dysbiosis that could affect the oral metabolome.

TI  == in vitro comparison of commercial oral rinses on bacterial adhesion and their detachment from biofilm formed on hydroxyapatite disks.
AB  == purpose: this in vitro study was designed to assess the effectiveness of three oral rinses on bacterial adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite surfaces. the role of oral rinses on the detachment of bacteria from biofilm was  also evaluated. materials and methods: the efficacy of three oral rinses, acclean, noplak and prevention were tested against a wide range of oral bacteria. oral rinse antimicrobial activity was determined by an mtt assay for bacterial viability, by live/ dead staining and by measuring the bacterial metabolic activity using an xtt assay. results: the two oral rinses that contained 0.12% chlorhexidine had the greatest antibacterial activity on both planktonic and bio  lm-grown organisms when compared to the prevention oral rinse. conclusion: both acclean and noplak were extremely effective in lowering the number of bacteria attached to buccal epithelial cells and pelllicles. in addition, these two oral rinses were also effective against the biofilm bacteria.

TI  == systematic screening of plant extracts from the brazilian pantanal with antimicrobial activity against bacteria with cariogenic relevance.
AB  == this study proposes a bioprospection methodology regarding the antimicrobial potential of plant extracts against bacteria with cariogenic relevance. sixty extracts were obtained from ten plants--(1) jatropha weddelliana, (2) attalea phalerata, (3) buchenavia tomentosa, (4) croton doctoris, (5) mouriri elliptica,  (6) mascagnia benthamiana, (7) senna aculeata, (8) unonopsis guatterioides, (9) allagoptera leucocalyx and (10) bactris glaucescens--using different extraction methods - (a) 70 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees c, (b) water 5 min/100 degrees c, (c) water 1 h/55 degrees c, (d) water 72 h/25 degrees c, (e) hexane 72 h/25 degrees c and (f) 90 degrees ethanol 72 h/25 degrees c. the plants were screened  for antibacterial activity at 50 mg/ml using the agar well diffusion test against actinomyces naeslundii atcc 19039, lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus mutans atcc 35688, streptococcus sanguinis atcc 10556, streptococcus sobrinus atcc 33478 and streptococcus mitis atcc 9811. the active extracts were tested to determine their minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic), minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc), cytotoxicity and chemical characterization. forty-seven extracts (78%) were active against at least one microorganism. extract 4a demonstrated the lowest mic and mbc for all microorganisms except s. gordonii and the extract at mic concentration was non-cytotoxic. the concentrated extracts were slightly cytotoxic. electrospray ionization with tandem mass spectrometry analyses demonstrated that the extract constituents coincided with the mass of the terpenoids and phenolics. overall, the best results were obtained for extraction methods a, b and c. the present work proved the antimicrobial activity of several plants. particularly, extracts  from c. doctoris were the most active against bacteria involved in dental caries  disease.

TI  == plaque bacterial microbiome diversity in children younger than 30 months with or  without caries prior to eruption of second primary molars.
AB  == objective: our primary objective is to phylogenetically characterize the supragingival plaque bacterial microbiome of children prior to eruption of second primary molars by pyrosequencing method for studying etiology of early childhood  caries. methods: supragingival plaque samples were collected from 10 caries children and 9 caries-free children. plaque dna was extracted, used to generate dna amplicons of the v1-v3 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rrna gene, and subjected to 454-pyrosequencing. results: on average, over 22,000 sequences per sample were generated. high bacterial diversity was noted in the plaque of children with caries [170 operational taxonomical units (otu) at 3% divergence] and caries-free children (201 otu at 3% divergence) with no significant difference. a total of 8 phyla, 15 classes, 21 orders, 30 families, 41 genera and 99 species were represented. in addition, five predominant phyla (firmicute, fusobacteria, proteobacteria, bacteroidetes and actinobacteria) and seven genera  (leptotrichia, streptococcus, actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, neisseria,  and veillonella) constituted a majority of contents of the total microbiota, independent of the presence or absence of caries. principal component analysis (pca) presented that caries-related genera included streptococcus and veillonella; while leptotrichia, selenomonas, fusobacterium, capnocytophaga and porphyromonas were more related to the caries-free samples. neisseria and prevotella presented approximately in between. in both groups, the degree of shared organism lineages (as defined by species-level otus) among individual supragingival plaque microbiomes was minimal. conclusion: our study represented for the first time using pyrosequencing to elucidate and monitor supragingival plaque bacterial diversity at such young age with second primary molar unerrupted. distinctions were revealed between caries and caries-free microbiomes in terms of microbial community structure. we observed differences in abundance for several microbial groups between the caries and caries-free host populations, which were consistent with the ecological plaque hypothesis. our approach and findings could be extended to correlating microbiomic changes after occlusion establishment and caries treatment.

TI  == pilus hijacking by a bacterial coaggregation factor critical for oral biofilm development.
AB  == the formation of dental plaque, a highly complex biofilm that causes gingivitis and periodontitis, requires specific adherence among many oral microbes, including the coaggregation of actinomyces oris with streptococcus oralis that helps to seed biofilm development. here, we report the discovery of a key coaggregation factor for this process. this protein, which we named coaggregation factor a (cafa), is one of 14 cell surface proteins with the lpxtg motif predicted in a. oris mg1, whose function was hitherto unknown. by systematic mutagenesis of each of these genes and phenotypic characterization, we found that the actinomyces/streptococcus coaggregation is only abolished by deletion of cafa. subsequent biochemical and cytological experiments revealed that cafa constitutes the tip of a unique form of the type 2 fimbria long known for its role in coaggregation. the direct and predominant role of cafa in adherence is evident from the fact that cafa or an antibody against cafa inhibits coaggregation, whereas the shaft protein fima or a polyclonal antibody against fima has no effect. remarkably, fima polymerization was blocked by deletion of genes for both cafa and fimb, the previously described tip protein of the type 2  fimbria. together, these results indicate that some surface proteins not linked to a pilus gene cluster in gram-positive bacteria may hijack the pilus. these unique tip proteins displayed on a common pilus shaft may serve distinct physiological functions. furthermore, the pilus shaft assembly in gram-positive bacteria may require a tip, as is true for certain gram-negative bacterial pili.

TI  == an assessment of the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning of essix orthodontic retainer.
AB  == objectives: to determine the effectiveness of mechanical and chemical cleaning on the removal of microorganisms from essix orthodontic retainers. design: in vitro  laboratory study. setting: department of orthodontics and microbiology, eastman dental institute, university college london, uk. methods: study 1: 120 essix retainers were divided into four cleaning groups. the effectiveness of each cleaning method to remove a single species biofilm of streptococcus mutans from the retainer was assessed. study 2: 140 essix retainers were divided into four study groups (brushing with fluoride toothpaste, chlorhexidine gel, immersion in  chlorhexidine solution only and a control) to investigate the chemical and mechanical cleaning of the multispecies biolfilm of (streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and candida albicans). relevant results: in study 1, brushing with toothpaste resulted in 99% reduction of streptococcus mutans. in study 2, all three cleaning methods recorded similarly statistically significant reductions in colony forming units per millilitre compared to the control. there were no statistically significant differences between any of the cleaning groups for any of the microorganisms except mrsa-16. for mrsa-16, chlorhexidine mouthwash and gel were significantly more potent in eliminating the microorganism than the fluoride toothpaste. conclusions: all three cleaning methods effectively removed 99% of microorganisms from the essix retainers. brushing with fluoride toothpaste can therefore be confirmed as an effective method for cleaning retainers in most circumstances. the use of chlorhexidine gel or mouthwash is recommended in patients where bacterial infection has to be avoided due to immunosuppression or other reasons.

TI  == hiv infection and microbial diversity in saliva.
AB  == limited information is available about the effects of hiv and subsequent antiretroviral treatment on host-microbe interactions. this study aimed to determine the salivary microbial composition for 10 hiv-seropositive subjects, before and 6 months after highly active antiretroviral therapy (haart), compared  with that for 10 hiv-seronegative subjects. a conventional culture and two culture-independent analyses were used and consistently demonstrated differences  in microbial composition among the three sets of samples. hiv-positive subjects had higher levels of total cultivable microbes, including oral streptococci, lactobacilli, streptococcus mutans, and candida, in saliva than did hiv-negative  subjects. the total cultivable microbial levels were significantly correlated with cd4+ t cell counts. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), which compared the overall microbial profiles, showed distinct fingerprinting profiles  for each group. the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) assay, which compared the 16s rrna genes, showed clear separation among the three sample groups. veillonella, synergistetes, and streptococcus were present in all 30 saliva samples. only minor changes or no changes in the prevalence of neisseria,  haemophilus, gemella, leptotrichia, solobacterium, parvimonas, and rothia were observed. seven genera, capnocytophaga, slackia, porphyromonas, kingella, peptostreptococcaceae, lactobacillus, and atopobium, were detected only in hiv-negative samples. the prevalences of fusobacterium, campylobacter, prevotella, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, actinomyces, granulicatella, and atopobium were increased after haart. in contrast, the prevalence of aggregatibacter was significantly decreased after haart. the findings of this study suggest that hiv infection and haart can have significant effects on salivary microbial colonization and composition.

TI  == structures of cas9 endonucleases reveal rna-mediated conformational activation.
AB  == type ii crispr (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-cas (crispr-associated) systems use an rna-guided dna endonuclease, cas9, to generate double-strand breaks in invasive dna during an adaptive bacterial immune response. cas9 has been harnessed as a powerful tool for genome editing and gene  regulation in many eukaryotic organisms. we report 2.6 and 2.2 angstrom resolution crystal structures of two major cas9 enzyme subtypes, revealing the structural core shared by all cas9 family members. the architectures of cas9 enzymes define nucleic acid binding clefts, and single-particle electron microscopy reconstructions show that the two structural lobes harboring these clefts undergo guide rna-induced reorientation to form a central channel where dna substrates are bound. the observation that extensive structural rearrangements occur before target dna duplex binding implicates guide rna loading as a key step in cas9 activation.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of oral microbiota shifting in various caries states in childhood.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most prevalent childhood diseases worldwide, but little is known about the dynamic characteristics of oral microbiota in the development of dental caries. to investigate the shifting bacterial profiles in different caries states, 60 children (3-7-year-old) were enrolled in this study,  including 30 caries-free subjects and 30 caries-active subjects. supragingival plaques were collected from caries-active subjects on intact enamel, white spot lesions and carious dentin lesions. plaques from caries-free subjects were used as a control. all samples were analyzed by 454 pyrosequencing based on 16s rrna gene v1-v3 hypervariable regions. a total of 572,773 pyrosequencing reads passed  the quality control and 25,444 unique phylotypes were identified, which represented 18 phyla and 145 genera. reduced bacterial diversity in the cavitated dentin was observed as compared with the other groups. thirteen genera (including capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, abiotrophia, comamonas, tannerella, eikenella, paludibacter, treponema, actinobaculum, stenotrophomonas, aestuariimicrobium, and peptococcus) were found to be associated with dental health, and the bacterial profiles differed considerably depending on caries status. eight genera (including cryptobacterium, lactobacillus, megasphaera, olsenella, scardovia, shuttleworthia, cryptobacterium, and streptococcus) were increased significantly in cavitated dentin lesions, and actinomyces and corynebacterium were present at significant high levels in white spot lesions (p  < 0.05), while flavobacterium, neisseria, bergeyella, and derxia were enriched in the intact surfaces of caries individuals (p < 0.05). our results showed that oral bacteria were specific at different stages of caries progression, which contributes to informing the prevention and treatment of childhood dental caries.

TI  == antibiotic resistance and capacity for biofilm formation of different bacteria isolated from endodontic infections associated with root-filled teeth.
AB  == introduction: to date, a variety of microbial species have been isolated from endodontic infections. however, endodontic clinical bacterial isolates have not been sufficiently characterized with regard to their capacity for antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation. in this study, antibiotic resistance and biofilm formation of 47 different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial isolates, belonging to 32 different species previously isolated from infected filled root canals, were studied. methods: antibiotic sensitivity to 11 antibiotics including penicillin g, amoxicillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, tetracycline, doxycycline, fosfomycin, rifampicin, ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin was tested using the standardized etest method (bio merieux, marcy-1'etoile, france). the antibiotic sensitivity of 4 control strains was also estimated in parallel. additionally, the capacity to form biofilms was quantified using the microtiter plate test. results: different aerobic and anaerobic bacterial species were either resistant against a number of antibiotics or showed high minimal inhibitory concentrations against clinically relevant antibiotics. five aerobic and 2 anaerobic isolates, including enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus fermentum, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, prevotella buccae, and propionibacterium acidifaciens, were characterized as being high biofilm producers, whereas 8 aerobic and 3 anaerobic isolates were found to be moderate biofilm producers. most isolates with resistance or markedly high minimal inhibitory concentration values were also either moderate biofilm producers or high biofilm producers. conclusions: these results suggest that the  clinical significance of endodontic infections could include that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance. furthermore, endodontic treatment should consider the adhesion and biofilm formation by a variety of bacteria.

TI  == genetic basis of coaggregation receptor polysaccharide biosynthesis in streptococcus sanguinis and related species.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between streptococci and actinomyces promotes early dental plaque biofilm development. recognition of coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) on strains of streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus oralis by actinomyces spp. type 2 fimbriae is the principal mechanism of these interactions. previous studies of genetic loci for synthesis of rps (rps) and rps precursors (rml, gale1 and gale2) in s. gordonii 38 and s. oralis 34 revealed differences between these strains. to determine whether these differences are strain-specific or species-specific, we identified  and compared loci for polysaccharide biosynthesis in additional strains of these  species and in several strains of the previously unstudied species, s. sanguinis. genes for synthesis of rps precursors distinguished the rps loci of different streptococci. hence, rml genes for synthesis of tdp-l-rha were in rps loci of s.  oralis strains but at other loci in s. gordonii and s. sanguinis. genes for two distinct galactose epimerases were also distributed differently. hence, gale1 for epimerization of udp-glc and udp-gal was in galactose operons of s. gordonii and  s. sanguinis strains but surprisingly, this gene was not present in s. oralis. moreover, gale2 for epimerization of both udp-glc and udp-gal and udp-glcnac and  udp-galnac was at a different locus in each species, including rps operons of s.  sanguinis. the findings provide insight into cell surface properties that distinguish different rps-producing streptococci and open an approach for identifying these bacteria based on the arrangement of genes for synthesis of polysaccharide precursors.

TI  == dental caries and vaccination strategy against the major cariogenic pathogen, streptococcus mutans.
AB  == although dental caries is a global problem in modern times, no vaccines are available for preventing these diseases. among the bacterial pathogens that cause dental caries, including streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, s. mutans is the most prominent and prevalent species. during the past, much effort has been focused on developing vaccines against s. mutans. early attempts used fixed whole cells of s. mutans, but later it was found that serological cross-reactivity between heart tissue antigens and streptococcus antigens occurs in patients resulting in rheumatic fever. recently, with the aid of molecular biology, the genome sequences of s. mutans strains are available, which can greatly accelerate the development of subunit vaccines. many desirable candidate subunit vaccines have been or are going to be evaluated in either experimental animal models or in human clinical trials. in this review article, we summarized the updated progress made in deciphering the mechanisms of disease development and the achievements of vaccine research against s. mutans.

AB  == our previous study showed that bacterial genomes can be identified using 16s rrna sequencing in urine specimens of both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are culture negative according to standard urine culture protocols. in the present study, we used a modified culture protocol that included plating larger volumes of urine, incubation under varied atmospheric conditions, and prolonged incubation times to demonstrate that many of the organisms identified in urine by 16s rrna gene sequencing are, in fact, cultivable using an expanded quantitative  urine culture (equc) protocol. sixty-five urine specimens (from 41 patients with  overactive bladder and 24 controls) were examined using both the standard and equc culture techniques. fifty-two of the 65 urine samples (80%) grew bacterial species using equc, while the majority of these (48/52 [92%]) were reported as no growth at 10(3) cfu/ml by the clinical microbiology laboratory using the standard urine culture protocol. thirty-five different genera and 85 different species were identified by equc. the most prevalent genera isolated were lactobacillus (15%), followed by corynebacterium (14.2%), streptococcus (11.9%), actinomyces (6.9%), and staphylococcus (6.9%). other genera commonly isolated include aerococcus, gardnerella, bifidobacterium, and actinobaculum. our current study demonstrates that urine contains communities of living bacteria that comprise a resident female urine microbiota.

TI  == impact of early colonizers on in vitro subgingival biofilm formation.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the impact of early colonizing species on the structure and the composition of the bacterial community developing in a subgingival 10-species biofilm model system. the model included streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, actinomycesoris, fusobacterium nucleatum subsp.  nucleatum, veillonella dispar, campylobacter rectus, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola. based on literature, we considered streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, and actinomyces oris as early colonizers and examined their role in the biofilms by either a delayed addition to the consortium, or by not inoculating at all the biofilms with these species. we quantitatively evaluated the resulting biofilms by real-time quantitative pcr and further compared the structures using confocal  laser scanning microscopy following fluorescence in situ hybridisation. the absence of the early colonizers did not hinder biofilm formation. the biofilms reached the same total counts and developed to normal thickness. however, quantitative shifts in the abundances of individual species were observed. in the absence of streptococci, the overall biofilm structure appeared looser and more dispersed. moreover, besides a significant increase of p. intermedia and a decrease of p. gingivalis , p. intermedia appeared to form filamented long chains that resembled streptococci. a. oris, although growing to significantly higher abundance in absence of streptococci, did not have a visible impact on the biofilms. hence, in the absence of the early colonizers, there is a pronounced effect on p. intermedia and p. gingivalis that may cause distinct shifts in the structure of the biofilm. streptococci possibly facilitate the establishment of p. gingivalis into subgingival biofilms, while in their absence p. intermedia became more dominant and forms elongated chains.

(p = 0.001) compared to the non-discoloured plaque samples of the control group. comparing the children with  bs and non-discoloured plaque, higher counts for a. naeslundii (p = 0.013) were observed in caries-free children with bs while in caries-affected children with bs, lower counts of f. nucleatum (p = 0.007) were found. counts of lactobacillus  sp. were higher in non-discoloured plaque samples than in bs of caries-free and caries-affected children. conclusion: results suggest that the different microbial composition of bs might be associated with the lower caries experience  in affected subjects. the role of black-pigmented bacteria associated with periodontitis needs further studies.

TI  == effects of maltitol and xylitol chewing-gums on parameters involved in dental caries development.
AB  == aim: the effects on plaque parameters of sugar free chewing-gums (cg) sweetened with either maltitol or xylitol were assessed to better understand the role polyols can play in dental caries prevention. materials and methods: a double-blind, parallel, randomised, controlled study was conducted in china. subjects (n = 258, age = 13 to 15 years-old) were divided into 4 groups: 2 receiving polyols cg, containing respectively maltitol or xylitol, a group receiving gum base (placebo) and a negative control group not receiving any gum.  cg were chewed for 30 days. this corresponds to a 10 g consumption of polyol per  day. plaque parameters (growth, ph, bacteria and insoluble glucans) were evaluated throughout the experimental period. results: all parameters studied were significantly modified with gum base compared to no-gum: plaque ph increased; plaque growth, bacteria (s. mutans, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus and lactobacillus) and insoluble glucans decreased. maltitol and xylitol cg led similarly to a higher plaque ph (auc, p=/<0.05) on short (at baseline after the first cg consumption) and long term (after 4 weeks of daily cg consumption), with or without saliva stimulation compared to both control and placebo groups. they led to a decrease in plaque growth (p=0.02) over the experimental period compared to controls. moreover, they significantly reduced the concentration of 4 cariogenic bacteria species (p=/<0.05) in dental plaque compared to gum base. conclusion: sugar free cg sweetened with either maltitol or xylitol can similarly reduce plaque acidogenicity compared to gum base through a decrease in oral bacteria presence. the use of a gum base placebo allowed to isolate effects on parameters involved in dental caries development specific to maltitol and xylitol, and to show these effects were similar.

AB  == background and objective: smoking has been reported to increase the risk of periodontal disease by disrupting the balance of immune responses and tissue repair processes; however, this risk varies among smokers. cotinine levels in saliva are routinely used to measure the level of smoking, and reflect the quantity of nicotine, and other smoking-related xenobiotics that challenge host systems. this study delineated characteristics of inflammatory mediators in saliva and serum antibody responses to both periodontal pathogens and commensal bacteria in smokers as they related to cotinine levels. materials and methods: this case-control study (n = 279) examined salivary inflammatory mediator responses [interleukin (il)-1ss, il-10, prostaglandin e2, myeloperoxidase and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1], and serum igg antibody responses to three periodontal pathogens (aggregatibacter actinomyce-temcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola) and five commensal oral microorganisms (veillonella parvula, streptococcus sanguis, prevotella loescheii, actinomyces naeslundii, capnocytophaga ochracea). results: the patients were stratified into  health (n = 30), gingivitis (n = 55) and periodontitis (n = 184); cotinine levels correlated with reported smoking habits in health, less so with gingivitis, and were not correlated in periodontitis. of the inflammatory mediators/acute phase proteins, only il-1ss levels were positively associated (p < 0.001) with the pack years and cotinine levels. as might be predicted, patients with periodontitis smoked more (p < 0.001) and had higher levels of cotinine. il-1ss and antibody to a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis and t. denticola were significantly higher in the patients with periodontitis than either patients with gingivitis or who were healthy. conclusions: generally, antibody to the pathogens and commensals was lower with decreased cotinine levels. smoking exacerbated differences in both inflammatory mediators and three antibody in periodontal disease compared to healthy subjects.

TI  == analysis of bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis using obligate anaerobic culture technique and 16s rdna gene sequence.
AB  == purpose: to analyze and characterize the predominant bacterial flora associated with peri-implantitis by using culture techniques under obligate anaerobic conditions and 16s rdna gene sequences. materials and methods: subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from 30 patients: control (n = 15), consisting of  patients with only healthy implants; and test (n = 15), consisting of patients with peri-implantitis. in both groups, subgingival bacterial specimens were taken from the deepest sites. an anaerobic glove box system was used to cultivate bacterial strains. the bacterial strains were identified by 16s rdna genebased polymerase chain reaction and comparison of the gene sequences. results: peri-implantitis sites had approximately 10-fold higher mean colony forming units (per milliliter) than healthy implant sites. a total of 69 different bacterial species were identified in the peri-implantitis sites and 53 in the healthy implant sites. the predominant bacterial species in the peri-implantitis sites were eubacterium nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, parascardovia denticolens, prevotella intermedia, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, centipeda periodontii, and parvimonas micra. the predominant bacteria in healthy implant sites apart from streptococcus were pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, veillonella species, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces species, propionibacterium acnes, and parvimonas micra. conclusion: these results suggest that the environment in the depths of the sulcus showing peri-implantitis is well suited for growth of obligate anaerobic bacteria. the present study demonstrated that the sulcus around oral implants with peri-implantitis harbors high levels of asaccharolytic anaerobic gram-positive rods (aagprs) such as e. nodatum, e. brachy, e. saphenum, filifactor alocis, slackia exigua, and gram-negative anaerobic rods, suggesting that conventional periodontopathic bacteria are not the only periodontal pathogens active in peri-implantitis, and that aagprs may also play an important role.

TI  == the effectiveness of enzymic irrigation in removing a nutrient-stressed endodontic multispecies biofilm.
AB  == aim: to establish a nutrient-stressed multispecies model biofilm and investigate  the dynamics of biofilm killing and disruption by 1% trypsin and 1% proteinase k  with or without ultrasonic activation. methodology: nutrient-stressed biofilms (propionibacterium acnes, staphylococcus epidermidis, actinomyces radicidentis, streptococcus mitis and enterococcus faecalis omgs 3202) were grown on hydroxyapatite discs and in prepared root canals of single-rooted teeth in modified fluid universal medium. the treatment groups included trypsin, proteinase k, 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 1% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) (with and without ultrasonics). naocl and chlorhexidine were the positive controls and untreated group, and sterile saline was the negative control. the biofilms were investigated using confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) with live/dead staining and quantitative microbial culture. results: nutrient stress in the multispecies biofilm was apparent as the medium ph became alkaline, glucose was absent, and serum proteins were degraded in the supernatant. the clsm showed the percentage reduction in viable bacteria at the biofilm surface level due to nutrient starvation. on the disc model, trypsin and proteinase k were effective in killing bacteria; their aerobic viable counts were significantly lower (p < 0.01) than the negative control and chlorhexidine. naocl was the most  effective agent (p < 0.001). in the tooth model, when compared to saline, trypsin with ultrasonics caused significant killing both aerobically and anaerobically (p < 0.05). chlorhexidine (1.46 +/- 0.42), trypsin (3.56 +/- 1.18) and proteinase k  (4.2 +/- 1.01) with ultrasonics were significantly effective (p < 0.05) in reducing the substratum coverage as compared to saline with ultrasonics (12% +/-  4.9). conclusion: trypsin with ultrasonic activation has a biofilm killing and disrupting potential.

TI  == antibacterial efficacy of a human beta-defensin-3 peptide on multispecies biofilms.
AB  == introduction: the aggregation of mixed bacterial flora into sessile biofilms on root canal surfaces can be one of the causes of persistent apical periodontitis.  the aim of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial efficacy of human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3) peptide on multispecies biofilms by using confocal laser scanning microscopy. methods: actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, and enterococcus faecalis were cultured in a peptone-yeast-glucose broth, and their culture suspensions were combined in equal proportions. the mixed bacteria were inoculated on sterile coverslips placed into the wells of tissue culture plates to permit the formation of mixed species biofilm. after incubation for 3 weeks, the samples were treated for 24 hours with saline (control), saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ch), 2% chlorhexidine solution (chx), and 50 mug/ml hbd3 solution. a commercial biofilm/viability assay kit was used to assess cell viability and analyze the 3-dimensional architecture  of biofilms. the percentage of dead cells was determined from the ratio of biovolumes for the red subpopulation and the total biofilm. results: three medication groups showed a significant reduction of biovolume within the biofilms compared with the control group (p < .001). the hbd3-treated biofilms had a higher percentage of dead cells than the other medication groups (p < .05). the ch and chx groups showed higher levels of bactericidal activity than saline (p <  .05), and there was no significant difference between the 2 groups (p > .05). conclusions: hbd3 peptide exhibited more antibacterial activity against mature multispecies biofilms in vitro than either ch or chx.

TI  == pro-oxidative synergic bactericidal effect of no: kinetics and inhibition by nitroxides.
AB  == no plays diverse roles in physiological and pathological processes, occasionally  resulting in opposing effects, particularly in cells subjected to oxidative stress. no mostly protects eukaryotes against oxidative injury, but was demonstrated to kill prokaryotes synergistically with h2o2. this could be a promising therapeutic avenue. however, recent conflicting findings were reported  describing dramatic protective activity of no. the previous studies of no effects on prokaryotes applied a transient oxidative stress while arbitrarily checking the residual bacterial viability after 30 or 60min and ignoring the process kinetics. if no-induced synergy and the oxidative stress are time-dependent, the  elucidation of the cell killing kinetics is essential, particularly for survival  curves exhibiting a "shoulder" sometimes reflecting sublethal damage as in the linear-quadratic survival models. we studied the kinetics of no synergic effects  on h2o2-induced killing of microbial pathogens. a synergic pro-oxidative activity toward gram-negative and gram-positive cells is demonstrated even at sub-mum/min  flux of no. for certain strains, the synergic effect progressively increased with the duration of cell exposure, and the linear-quadratic survival model best fit the observed survival data. in contrast to the failure of sod to affect the bactericidal process, nitroxide sod mimics abrogated the pro-oxidative synergy of no/h2o2. these cell-permeative antioxidants, which hardly react with diamagnetic  species and react neither with no nor with h2o2, can detoxify redox-active transition metals and catalytically remove intracellular superoxide and nitrogen-derived reactive species such as (*)no2 or peroxynitrite. the possible mechanism underlying the bactericidal no synergy under oxidative stress and the potential therapeutic gain are discussed.

TI  == fluoride-sensitivity of growth and acid production of oral actinomyces: comparison with oral streptococcus.
AB  == actinomyces are predominant oral bacteria; however, their cariogenic potential in terms of acid production and fluoride sensitivity has not been elucidated in detail and compared with that of other caries-associated oral bacteria, such as streptococcus. therefore, this study aimed to elucidate and compare the acid production and growth of actinomyces and streptococcus in the presence of bicarbonate and fluoride to mimic conditions in the oral cavity. acid production  from glucose was measured by ph-stat at ph 5.5 and 7.0 under anaerobic conditions. growth rate was assessed by optical density in anaerobic culture. although actinomyces produced acid at a lower rate than did streptococcus, their  acid production was more tolerant of fluoride (idacid production 50 = 110-170 ppm at ph 7.0 and 10-13 ppm at ph 5.5) than that of streptococcus (idacid production  50 = 36-53 ppm at ph 7.0 and 6.3-6.5 ppm at ph 5.5). bicarbonate increased acid production by actinomyces with prominent succinate production and enhanced their  fluoride tolerance (idacid production 50 = 220-320 ppm at ph 7.0 and 33-52 ppm at ph 5.5). bicarbonate had no effect on these variables in streptococcus. in addition, although the growth rate of actinomyces was lower than that of streptococcus, actinomyces growth was more tolerant of fluoride (idgrowth 50 = 130-160 ppm) than was that of streptococcus (idgrowth 50 = 27-36 ppm). these results indicate that oral actinomyces are more tolerant of fluoride than oral streptococcus, and bicarbonate enhances the fluoride tolerance of oral actinomyces. because of the limited number of species tested here, further study  is needed to generalize these findings to the genus level.

TI  == microbial basis of oral malodor development in humans.
AB  == to better understand the microbial basis of oral malodor development in humans, we used a cross-sectional and longitudinal study design and the pyrosequencing approach to track and compare the tongue microbiota associated with oral malodor  in 29 chinese adults who underwent a consecutive three-day evaluation for the amount of h2s excreted orally. three levels of the oral malodor state (healthy, oral malodor, and severe oral malodor) were defined based on the h2s level. community structure of the tongue plaques was more sensitive to changes of malodor state than to interpersonal variations or differences in sampling times.  within each individual, the structure of microbiota was relatively stable, while  their variations were correlated with the change in the h2s level. severe oral malodor microbiota were the most conserved in community structure, whereas the healthy ones were relatively varied. oral-malodor-associated bacteria were identified. the relative abundance of leptotrichia and prevotella was positively  correlated with oral malodor severity, whereas hemophilus and gemella exhibited a negative relationship with oral malodor severity. our study provides one of the first landscapes of oral microbiota changes associated with oral malodor development and reveals microbes potentially useful to the evaluation and control of oral malodor.

TI  == characterization and in vitro properties of oral lactobacilli in breastfed infants.
AB  == background: lactobacillus species can contribute positively to general and oral health and are frequently acquired by breastfeeding in infancy. the present study aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in breast and formula-fed 4 month-old infants and to evaluate potential probiotic properties of the dominant lactobacillus species detected. saliva and oral swab samples were collected from 133 infants who were enrolled in a longitudinal study (n=240) examining the effect of a new infant formula on child growth and development. saliva was cultured and lactobacillus isolates were identified from 16s rrna gene sequences. five l. gasseri isolates that differed in 16s rrna sequence were tested for their ability to inhibit growth of selected oral bacteria and for adhesion to oral tissues. oral swab samples were analyzed by qpcr for lactobacillus gasseri. results: 43 (32.3%) infants were breastfed and 90 (67.7%) were formula-fed with either a standard formula (43 out of 90) or formula supplemented with a milk fat globule membrane (mfgm) fraction (47 out of 90). lactobacilli were cultured from saliva of 34.1% breastfed infants, but only in 4.7% of the standard and 9.3% of the mfgm supplemented formula-fed infants. l. gasseri was the most prevalent (88% of lactobacillus positive infants) of six lactobacillus species detected. l. gasseri isolates inhibited streptococcus mutans binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite,  and inhibited growth of s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces oris, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum in a concentration dependent fashion. l. gasseri isolates bound to parotid and submandibular saliva, salivary gp340 and muc7, and purified mfgm, and adhered to  epithelial cells. l. gasseri was detected by qpcr in 29.7% of the oral swabs. breastfed infants had significantly higher mean dna levels of l. gasseri (2.14 pg/ul) than infants fed the standard (0.363 pg/ul) or mfgm (0.697 pg/ul) formula. conclusions: lactobacilli colonized the oral cavity of breastfed infants significantly more frequently than formula-fed infants. the dominant lactobacillus was l. gasseri, which was detected at higher levels in breastfed than formula-fed infants and displayed probiotic traits in vitro.

TI  == microbiological diversity of peri-implantitis biofilm by sanger sequencing.
AB  == background and objective: to examine the microbial diversity associated with implants with or without peri-implantitis and to identify differences between the bacterial communities in these clinical conditions. material and methods: twenty  subjects were assigned to a control group consisting of subjects with healthy implants and a test group consisting of subjects with peri-implantitis sites, as  well as a healthy implant site (n = 10/group). in the test group, subgingival biofilm samples were taken from the deepest sites of the diseased implant. in both groups, samples were collected from one site around a healthy implant. dna was extracted and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and sequenced, and the phylotypes were identified by comparison with known 16s rrna sequences. results:  the phylogenetic identity of 1387 16s rrna gene clones was determined. healthy implants demonstrated higher proportions of actinomyces, atopobium, gemella, kingella and rothia and lower levels of campylobacter, desulfobulbus, dialister,  eubacterium, filifactor, mitsukella, porphyromonas and pseudoramibacter (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). fusobacterium nucleatum, dialister invisus, streptococcus sp. human oral taxon (hot) 064, filifactor alocis and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 presented a higher mean proportion, while veillonella dispar, actinomyces meyeri, granulicatella adiacens showed lower mean proportions in the  peri-implantitis sites when compared with healthy implants in both the control and test groups (mann-whitney u-test; p < 0.05). conclusion: marked differences were observed in the composition of the subgingival biofilm between healthy and diseased implants. the biofilm associated with peri-implantitis harbored more pathogenic bacterial species from the orange complex and other "unusual" putative pathogens, such as f. alocis, d. invisus and mitsuokella sp. hot 131.

TI  == characterization and application of a flow system for in vitro multispecies oral  biofilm formation.
AB  == background and objective: bacteria in the oral cavity grow in the form of biofilms; these structures are subject to constant saliva or gingival crevicular  fluid flow conditions. the aims of this study were: (i) to develop and to characterize an in-vitro biofilm model with oral bacteria growing under flow and  shear conditions; and (ii) to demonstrate the usefulness of the model for evaluating the activity of three antiplaque agents. material and methods: we used a bioreactor to grow the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and porphyromonas gingivalis under planktonic conditions. biofilms were established using a modified robbins device on hydroxyapatite (hap) discs. three- to 7-d-old biofilms were analysed using culture methods, scanning electron microscopy, live/dead staining and fluorescence in-situ hybridization (confocal laser scanning microscopy). finally, we assessed the antimicrobial activity of three mouthrinses [0.12% chlorhexidine (chx), 0.12% chlorhexidine and sodium fluoride (chx+naf) and 0.12% chlorhexidine and 0.05% cetylpyridinium chloride (chx+cpc)] using a planktonic test (short interval-killing test) and in  our 4-d biofilm model. results: the viable cell counts showed that each species was consistently found in the biofilms throughout the study. the architecture and cell distribution were similar to those described for biofilms in situ, with the  exception of a thin layer of living cells that was found close to the hap. the effectiveness test of the mouthwashes demonstrated that cells in biofilms showed  more tolerance compared with planktonic cells. moreover, it was observed that in  4-d biofilm formed in vitro, chx+cpc caused significantly higher mortality compared with chx (p = 0.003) and chx+naf (p < 0.001). conclusion: our results suggest that we have a highly reproducible system for multispecies oral biofilm formation and that it is a useful tool for assessing antibacterial molecules before their clinical evaluation. it also has great potential to be used in basic research on supragingival and subgingival biofilms.

TI  == a consortium of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and filifactor alocis is present in sites prior to bone loss in a  longitudinal study of localized aggressive periodontitis.
AB  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans-induced localized aggressive periodontitis  (lap) in african-american adolescents has been documented but is poorly understood. two thousand fifty-eight adolescents aged 11 to 17 years were screened for their periodontal status and the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans in their oral cavity. seventy-one a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative and 63 a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive periodontally healthy subjects were enrolled, sampled, examined, and radiographed yearly for 3 years. gingival and periodontal pocket depth and attachment levels were recorded. disease presentation was characterized by bone loss (bl). subgingival sites were sampled every 6 months to assess (i) the role of a. actinomycetemcomitans in bl and (ii) the association of a. actinomycetemcomitans  and other microbes in their relationships to bl. sixteen of 63 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans developed bl (the other 47 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans had no bl). no a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative subjects developed bl. human oral microbe identification microarray (homim) was used for subgingival microbial assessment. on a subject level, pooled data from a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects who remained healthy had higher prevalences of streptococcus and actinomyces species, while a. actinomycetemcomitans-positive subjects with bl had higher prevalences of parvimonas micra, filifactor alocis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and peptostreptococcus sp. human oral taxon 113 (hot-113). at vulnerable sites, a. actinomycetemcomitans, streptococcus parasanguinis, and f. alocis levels were elevated prior to bl. in cases where the three-organism consortium (versus a. actinomycetemcomitans alone) was detected, the specificity for detecting sites of future bl increased from 62% to 99%, with a sensitivity of 89%. we conclude that  detecting the presence of a. actinomycetemcomitans, s. parasanguinis, and f. alocis together indicates sites of future bl in lap. a synergistic interaction of this consortium in lap causation is possible and is the subject of ongoing research.

TI  == pontic morphology as local risk factor in root decay and periodontal disease.
AB  == introduction: in absence of treatment, old single edentulous spaces are subjected to progressively decrease in length due to tilting and rotation of the teeth situated mesial and distal. lately when these spaces are prosthetically restored  with a bridge and these teeth are becoming abutments, sanitizing of the prosthetic restoration is achieved with difficulty, the space between the pontic  and the gingival surface becoming an area rich in pathogens that can cause various complications on the abutments. aim: considering these aspects, in this study we wanted to highlight the presence and the types of the microorganisms that can be found under the pontic even in an ideal situation, selecting only young adult patients with a good oral hygiene and only with metal-ceramic bridges. materials and methods: determination of microorganisms was achieved by growing on bd columbia agar with 5% sheep blood. incubation was done in anaerobe  condition using genbag system produced by biomerieux company. results: the microorganisms that we determined were streptococcus mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, gram-negative bacilli (bacteroides ovatus, b. thetaiotaomicron) and gram-positive bacilli (bifidobacterium spp., actinomyces israelii, clostridium butyricum / beijerinckii) with relevance in the carious and periodontal disease. conclusions: in cases of single unit bridges with very narrow pontics, even in patients with a very good oral hygiene and metal-ceramic restorations, we can still find micro-organisms that can potentially generate decay or periodontal disease on the abutments, located in the gingival area underneath these pontics. these bacteria  can have negative implications on the long-term prognosis of prosthetic restorations.

AB  == severe early childhood caries are a prevalent public health problem among preschool children throughout the world. however, little is known about the microbiota found in association with severe early childhood caries. our study aimed to explore the bacterial microbiota of dental plaques to study the etiology of severe early childhood caries through pyrosequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene v1-v3 hypervariable regions. forty participants were enrolled in the study, and we obtained twenty samples of supragingival plaque from caries-free subjects and twenty samples from subjects with severe early childhood caries. a total of 175,918 reads met the quality control standards, and the bacteria found  belonged to fourteen phyla and sixty-three genera. our results show the overall structure and microbial composition of oral bacterial communities, and they suggest that these bacteria may present a core microbiome in the dental plaque microbiota. three genera, streptococcus, granulicatella, and actinomyces, were increased significantly in children with severe dental cavities. these data may facilitate improvements in the prevention and treatment of severe early childhood caries.

TI  == effects of short-chain fatty acids on actinomyces naeslundii biofilm formation.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii is an early colonizer and has important roles in the development of the oral biofilm. short-chain fatty acids (scfa) are secreted extracellularly as a product of metabolism by gram-negative anaerobes, e.g. porphyromonas gingivalis and fusobacterium nucleatum; and the scfa may affect biofilm development with interaction between a. naeslundii and gram-negative bacteria. our aim was to investigate the effects of scfa on biofilm formation by  a. naeslundii and to determine the mechanism. we used the biofilm formation assay in 96-well microtiter plates in tryptic soy broth without dextrose and with 0.25% sucrose using safranin stain of the biofilm monitoring 492 nm absorbance. to determine the mechanism by scfa, the production of chaperones and stress-response proteins (grpe and groel) in biofilm formation was examined using western blot fluorescence activity with grpe and groel antibodies. adding butyric acid (6.25 mm) 0, 6 and 10 h after beginning culture significantly increased biofilm formation by a. naeslundii, and upregulation was observed at 16 h. upregulation was also observed using appropriate concentrations of other scfa. in the upregulated biofilm, production of grpe and groel was higher where membrane-damaged or dead cells were also observed. the upregulated biofilm was significantly reduced by addition of anti-groel antibody. the data suggest biofilm formation by a. naeslundii was upregulated dependent on the production of stress proteins, and addition of scfa increased membrane-damaged or dead cells. production of groel may physically play an important role in biofilm development.

AB  == coeliac disease is characterized by intestinal inflammation caused by gluten, proteins which are widely contained in the western diet. mammalian digestive enzymes are only partly capable of cleaving gluten, and fragments remain that induce toxic responses in patients with coeliac disease. we found that the oral microbiome is a novel and rich source of gluten-degrading organisms. here we report on the isolation and characterization of the cultivable resident oral microbes that are capable of cleaving gluten, with special emphasis on the immunogenic domains. bacteria were obtained by a selective culturing approach and enzyme activities were characterized by: (i) hydrolysis of paranitroanilide-derivatized gliadin-derived tripeptide substrates; (ii) gliadin  degradation in-gel (gliadin zymography); (iii) gliadin degradation in solution; (iv) proteolysis of the highly immunogenic alpha-gliadin-derived 33-mer peptide.  for selected strains ph activity profiles were determined. the culturing strategy yielded 87 aerobic and 63 anaerobic strains. species with activity in at least two of the four assays were typed as: rothia mucilaginosa hot-681, rothia aeria hot-188, actinomyces odontolyticus hot-701, streptococcus mitis hot-677, streptococcus sp. hot-071, neisseria mucosa hot-682 and capnocytophaga sputigena  hot-775, with rothia species being active in all four assays. cleavage specificities and substrate preferences differed among the strains identified. the approximate molecular weights of the enzymes were ~75 kd (rothia spp.), ~60 kd (a. odontolyticus) and ~150 kd (streptococcus spp.). in conclusion, this study identified new gluten-degrading microorganisms in the upper gastrointestinal tract. a cocktail of the most active oral bacteria, or their isolated enzymes, may offer promising new treatment modalities for coeliac disease.

TI  == in vivo study of the initial bacterial adhesion on different implant materials.
AB  == objective: biofilm formation on implant materials plays a major role in the aetiology of periimplantitis. the aim of this study was to examine in vivo the initial bacterial adhesion on six different implant materials. methods: the implant materials ti-m, tiunite(r), ziunite(r), atz-m, atz-s, tzp-a-m were tested using bovine enamel slabs as controls. all materials, fixed on splint systems, were examined after 30 min and 120 min of oral exposure. dapi staining was used for quantitative analysis of the initially adherent microorganisms. initial adherent microorganisms were visualised by fluorescence in situ-hybridisation (fish) and quantified by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). the targets of the oligonucleotide probes were eubacteria, veillonella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus spp. results: dapi analysis showed that increasing the time of oral exposure resulted in an increasing amount of initial adherent bacteria. the highest level of colonisation was on ziunite(r), with the lowest occurring on the bovine enamel, followed by ti-m. this early colonisation correlated significantly with the surface roughnesses of  the materials. fish and clsm showed no significant differences relating to total  bacterial composition. however, streptococcus spp. was shown to be the main colonisers on each of the investigated materials. conclusion: it could be shown that within an oral exposure time of 30 min and 120 min, despite the salivary acquired pellicle initial biofilm formation is mainly influenced directly or indirect by the material surface topography. highly polished surfaces should minimise the risk of biofilm formation, plaque accumulation and possibly periimplantitis.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of laminaria japonica against oral microorganisms.
AB  == laminaria japonica is a brown alga, which is consumed widely in korea, japan, and china. this study investigated the antimicrobial activity of ethanol extracts of  l. japonica against oral microbial species to assess the possible application of  l. japonica extracts in dental care products. the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) were determined  in culture medium using a microdilution method. the mics of ethanol extracts of l. japonica with oral streptococci were 62.5-500 mug/ml and the mbcs were 125-1000 mug/ml. the mics of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml, respectively. the mbcs of a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were 500 and 250 mug/ml, respectively. the mics were 250 and 62.5 mug/ml for fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis, respectively. the killing of streptococcus mutans and p. gingivalis was dependent on the incubation time. the killing of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis was significantly dependent on the extract concentration. bacterial treatment with l. japonica extracts changed the cell surface texture of s. mutans, a. odontolyticus, and p. gingivalis. the results of this study suggest that l. japonica extracts may be useful for the development of antimicrobial agents to combat oral pathogens.

TI  == quantitative real-time pcr combined with propidium monoazide for the selective quantification of viable periodontal pathogens in an in vitro subgingival biofilm model.
AB  == background and objectives: differentiation of live and dead cells is an important challenge when using molecular diagnosis for microbial identification. this is particularly relevant when bacteria have been exposed to antimicrobial agents. the objective of this study was to test a method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) combined with propidium monoazide (pma), developed for the selective quantification of viable p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans, f. nucleatum and total bacteria in an in vitro biofilm model after antimicrobial treatment. material and methods: pma-qpcr method was tested in an in vitro biofilm model, using isopropyl alcohol as the antimicrobial agent. matured biofilms were exposed for 1, 5, 10 and 30 min to isopropyl alcohol by immersion. biofilms were disrupted and pma added (final concentration of 100 mum). after dna isolation, qpcr was carried out using specific primers and probes for the target bacteria. the differentiation of live and dead cells was tested by analysis of variance. results: when pma was used in the presence of viable target bacterial cells, no statistically significant inhibition of qpcr amplification was detected (p > 0.05 in all cases). conversely, after immersion in isopropyl alcohol of the biofilm, pma resulted in a significant total reduction of qpcr amplification of about 4 log10 . p. gingivalis showed a vitality reduction in the biofilm of 3 log10 , while a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum showed a 2 log10 reduction. conclusion: these results demonstrate the efficiency of pma for  differentiating viable and dead p. gingivalis, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum cells, as well as total bacteria, in an in vitro biofilm model, after being exposed to an antimicrobial agent. hence, this pma-qpcr method may be useful for studying the effect of antimicrobial agents aimed at oral biofilms.

TI  == inhibition of attachment of oral bacteria to immortalized human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) by tea extracts and tea components.
AB  == background: tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the oral cavity. most studies have focused on prevention of bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel. findings: this study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green, oolong, black, pu-erh and  chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components (epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral pathogens (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175,  streptococcus mutans atcc 35668, streptococcus mitis atcc 49456, streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 51655) to the hgf-1 gingival cell line. extracts of two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced attachment of all the streptococcus strains by up to 4 log cfu/well but effects of other teas and components were small. conclusions: pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral soft tissues.

TI  == characterization of oral bacterial diversity of irradiated patients by high-throughput sequencing.
AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the compositional profiles and microbial shifts of oral microbiota during head-and-neck radiotherapy. bioinformatic analysis based on 16s rrna gene pyrosequencing was performed to assess the diversity and variation of oral microbiota of irradiated patients. eight patients with head and neck cancers were involved in this study. for each patient, supragingival plaque samples were collected at seven time points before  and during radiotherapy. a total of 147,232 qualified sequences were obtained through pyrosequencing and bioinformatic analysis, representing 3,460 species level operational taxonomic units (otus) and 140 genus level taxa. temporal variations were observed across different time points and supported by cluster analysis based on weighted unifrac metrics. moreover, the low evenness of oral microbial communities in relative abundance was revealed by lorenz curves. this study contributed to a better understanding of the detailed characterization of oral bacterial diversity of irradiated patients.

TI  == effect of water-aging on the antimicrobial activities of an ormosil-containing orthodontic acrylic resin.
AB  == quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silicate (qams), an organically modified silicate (ormosil) functionalized with polymerizable methacrylate groups and an antimicrobial agent with a long lipophilic alkyl chain quaternary ammonium group, was synthesized through a silane-based sol-gel route. by dissolving qams in methyl methacrylate monomer, this ormosil molecule was incorporated into an auto-polymerizing, powder/liquid orthodontic acrylic resin system, yielding qams-containing poly(methyl methacrylate). the qams-containing acrylic resin showed a predominant contact-killing effect on streptococcus mutans (atcc 35668)  and actinomyces naeslundii (atcc 12104) biofilms, while inhibiting adhesion of candida albicans (atcc 90028) on the acrylic surface. the antimicrobial activities of qams-containing acrylic resin were maintained after a 3month water-aging period. bromophenol blue assay showed minimal leaching of quaternary  ammonium species when an appropriate amount of qams (<4wt.%) was incorporated into the acrylic resin. the results suggest that qams is predominantly co-polymerized with the poly(methyl methacrylate) network, and only a minuscule amount of free qams molecules is present within the polymer network after water-aging. acrylic resin with persistent antimicrobial activities represents a  promising method for preventing bacteria- and fungus-induced stomatitis, an infectious disease commonly associated with the wearing of removable orthodontic  appliances.

TI  == exploring the dynamic core microbiome of plaque microbiota during head-and-neck radiotherapy using pyrosequencing.
AB  == radiotherapy is the primary treatment modality used for patients with head-and-neck cancers, but inevitably causes microorganism-related oral complications. this study aims to explore the dynamic core microbiome of oral microbiota in supragingival plaque during the course of head-and-neck radiotherapy. eight subjects aged 26 to 70 were recruited. dental plaque samples  were collected (over seven sampling time points for each patient) before and during radiotherapy. the v1-v3 hypervariable regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes  were amplified, and the high-throughput pyrosequencing was performed. a total of  140 genera belonging to 13 phyla were found. four phyla (actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, firmicutes, and proteobacteria) and 11 genera (streptococcus, actinomyces, veillonella, capnocytophaga, derxia, neisseria, rothia, prevotella,  granulicatella, luteococcus, and gemella) were found in all subjects, supporting  the concept of a core microbiome. temporal variation of these major cores in relative abundance were observed, as well as a negative correlation between the number of otus and radiation dose. moreover, an optimized conceptual framework was proposed for defining a dynamic core microbiome in extreme conditions such as radiotherapy. this study presents a theoretical foundation for exploring a core microbiome of communities from time series data, and may help predict community responses to perturbation as caused by exposure to ionizing radiation.

TI  == high strength re-mineralizing, antibacterial dental composites with reactive calcium phosphates.
AB  == objective: development of high strength dental composites with adhesive, antibacterial and re-mineralizing potential. materials: urethane and triethylene  glycol dimethacrylates were combined with hema (10 or 20wt%) and 2mp (2 or 10wt%), antibacterial chlorhexidine (2.5wt%) and chemical cure initiators. reactive mono/tri calcium phosphate (cp) mixed with silica/silicon carbide nanoparticles (s) (cp:s weight ratio 1:2 or 2:1) was added (50wt%). results: decreasing cp/s ratio and hema content reduced monomer conversion at 15min from 93 to 63%. conversely, decreasing cp/s increased initial "dry" compressive (137-203mpa) and flexural (79-116mpa) strength. with high hema content, these decreased by approximately 15-20mpa upon 24h water storage. with low hema content, average decline was <8mpa due to reduced water sorption. early water sorption induced mass increase, volume expansion, mono calcium phosphate dissolution and chlorhexidine release, were proportional to the initial calcium phosphate content. furthermore, they increased approximately 1.5 fold upon raising hema wt%. these diffusion controlled processes and strength decline slowed after 24h as phosphates reaction bound water within the materials. increasing 2mp concentration reduced calcium release but did not affect strength. formulations with high cp/s indicated greater antibacterial activity in agar diffusion and in vitro biofilm tests. significance: new material use beneath a conventional composite could potentially reduce high failure rates associated with residual caries and bacterial microleakage.

TI  == dynamic changes in the initial colonization of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii using a new animal model.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii are the predominant bacteria and initial colonizers of oral microflora. the binding of a. naeslundii and s. gordonii and the interaction between them on the salivary pellicle-coated tooth surface play an important role in the biofilm development. recently, we reported  that nod/scid.e2f1(-) mice are a useful model for studying oral biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans on the tooth surface. in this study, we aimed to determine whether nod/scid.e2f1(-) mice can be used for studying oral colonization of a. naeslundii and s. gordonii. colonization of a. naeslundii in mice fed with 1% sucrose water for 24 h before inoculation was higher than that among mice fed with sucrose water for 1 h. a. naeslundii colonization using mixed species-inoculation was lower than that using single-species inoculation 30-90 min after inoculation; however, the colonization was higher 120-180 min after inoculation. the mixed inoculation induced better colonization of s. gordonii than single-species inoculation 60-180 min after inoculation. polyclonal and fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled antibody stained bacteria showed better colonization of s. gordonii when a mixed culture is used in vivo. nod/scid.e2f1(-) mice were useful for studying the initial colonization of a. naeslundii and s. gordonii. long-term supply of sucrose water creates a favorable environment for the initial colonization of a. naeslundii that, in turn, supports the colonization of s. gordonii.

TI  == identification of organic acids in cichorium intybus inhibiting virulence-related properties of oral pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the low molecular mass (lmm) extract of cichorium intybus var. silvestre (red chicory) has been shown to inhibit virulence-linked properties of oral pathogens  including streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and prevotella intermedia. in the present study hplc-dad-esi/ms(2) was used to investigate the compounds contained in this extract for their anti-virulence activity. the extract contained a number of components, including oxalic, succinic, shikimic and quinic acids, which interfere with the growth and virulence traits (i.e., biofilm formation, adherence to epithelial cells and hydroxyapatite) of oral pathogens involved in gingivitis and tooth decay. succinic and quinic acid seem to be the most potent, mainly by interfering with the ability of oral pathogens to form biofilms (either through inhibition of their development or promotion of their disruption). our findings suggest that one or more of these compounds may modulate plaque formation in vivo, which is a prerequisite for the development of both caries and gingivitis.

AB  == this study investigated the presence of the black-pigmented bacteria prevotella nigrescens and prevotella intermedia, the non-black-pigmented bacteria actinomyces spp and particularly the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans in  the dental biofilms of patients with or without black extrinsic tooth stains, using the multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique. analysis of the dental biofilms of patients with (n=26) or without (n=26) black tooth stains was  performed using duplex pcr for the 16s ribosomal rna gene (p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, actinomyces spp) and glucosyltransferase-i gene for s. mutans. p. nigrescens and s. mutans were the most frequent bacteria detected in both groups. the least frequently detected were p. intermedia and actinomyces spp. the similar bacterial composition of dental biofilms of black tooth stains and healthy tooth  surfaces indicates that black tooth stains are not free of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == adhesion of streptococcus mitis and actinomyces oris in co-culture to machined and anodized titanium surfaces as affected by atmosphere and ph.
AB  == background: with the rising demand for osseointegrated titanium implants for replacing missing teeth, often in patients with a history of periodontitis, implant-related infections have become an issue of growing concern. novel methods for treating and preventing implant-associated infections are urgently needed. the aim of this study was to investigate if different ph, atmosphere and surface  properties could restrict bacterial adhesion to titanium surfaces used in dental  implants. methods: titanium discs with machined or anodized (tiunite) surface were incubated with a co-culture of streptococcus mitis and actinomyces oris (early colonizers of oral surfaces) at ph 5.0, 7.0 and 9.0 at aerobic or anaerobic atmosphere. the adhesion was analysed by counting colony forming (cfu)  units on agar and by confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). results: the cfu  analysis showed that a ph of 5.0 was found to significantly decrease the adhesion of s. mitis, and an aerobic atmosphere, the adhesion of a. oris. s. mitis was found in significantly less amounts on the anodized surface than the machined surface, while a. oris was found in equal amounts on both surfaces. the clsm analysis confirmed the results from the cfu count and provided additional information on how the two oral commensal species adhered to the surfaces: mainly in dispersed clusters oriented with the groves of the machined surface and the pores of the anodized surface. conclusions: bacterial adhesion by s. mitis and a. oris can be restricted by acidic ph and aerobic atmosphere. the anodized surface  reduced the adhesion of s. mitis compared to the machined surface; while a. oris  adhered equally well to the pores of the anodized surface and to the grooves of the machined surface. it is difficult to transfer these results directly into a clinical situation. however, it is worth further investigating these findings from an in vitro perspective, as well as clinically, to gain more knowledge of the effects acid ph and aerobic atmosphere have on initial bacterial adhesion.

AB  == background and objective: subgingival biofilms are the prime etiological factor of periodontal disease. owing to their complex polymicrobial nature, quantification of individual bacterial species within the biofilm for research and diagnostic purposes can be methodologically challenging. the aims of this study were to establish a quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) assay to quantify the bacteria used in our 10-species in vitro 'subgingival' biofilm model and to compare the quantitative outcome with fluorescence microscopy and colony-forming  unit (cfu) counts on selective agar plates. material and methods: the 10 species  included in the in vitro biofilm were streptococcus oralis, streptococcus anginosus, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola, tannerella forsythia, actinomyces oris, campylobacter rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia. the numbers of each species were quantified at two time points using qpcr, microscopy counting following fluorescence in-situ hybridization (fish) or immunofluorescence staining, and counting of cfus after growth on selective agar plates. results: all 10 species were successfully quantified using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, and the eight species culturable on selective agar plates were also quantified by counting the numbers  of cfus after growth on selective agar. in early biofilm cultures, all methods showed a significant correlation, although the absolute numbers differed between  methods. in late biofilm cultures, measurements obtained using qpcr and fish or immunofluorescence, but not by cfu counts, maintained significant correlation. cfu counts yielded lower values than did measurements made using the other two methods. conclusion: quantitative pcr and epifluorescence microscopy can be easily combined with each other to determine species-specific bacterial numbers within biofilms. however, conventional bacterial cultures cannot be as efficiently combined using these molecular detection methods. this may be crucial in designing and selecting appropriate clinical diagnostic methods for subgingival biofilm samples.

TI  == clinical and microbiological evaluation of the carious dentin before and after application of papacarie gel.
AB  == objective: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the efficacy of papacarie in the removal of carious dentin in both permanent and primary teeth. study design: thirty permanent and primary molars with dentinal carious lesions were excavated and subjected to clinical and microbiological assessment before and after application of papacarie. the gel was further tested for in vitro antimicrobial efficacy against standard cariogenic micro-organisms using agar diffusion assay. results: papacarie was able to differentiate between infected and affected dentin clinically along with high patient comfort during caries excavation. the mean time taken for caries removal and restoration was observed to be 4.17 +/- 0.40 min. and 8.57 +/- 0.45 min. for permanent teeth and 4.21 +/-  0.36 min. and 9.24 +/- 0.58 min. for primary teeth. there was a significant reduction in the total viable colony forming units from the dentin samples before and after application of papacarie. it was also observed that papacarie had no inhibitory effect on standard cariogenic microorganisms in the agar diffusion assay. conclusions: papacarie is an effective caries removal method clinically in both permanent and primary teeth. the number of viable microorganisms after complete caries excavation using papacarie still appears to be high and this bacterial count should be tackled by a suitable restorative material with potent  antimicrobial activity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of probiotic candidates for oral health.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the probiotic potential of autochthonous oral lactobacilli. for this, 66 strains were screened for antibacterial activity  against two cariogenic strains (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and two periodontopathogenic strains (fusobacterium nucleatum and porphyromonas gingivalis). the inhibitory activity was investigated with the agar overlay technique. positive results led us to explore some mechanisms of action. the ability to produce h(2)o(2) and the glycerol dehydratase gene were searched among all the strains. the gassericin a gene was checked among the lactobacillus gasseri. all the tested strains inhibited s. mutans and a. viscosus; only one did not inhibited f. nucleatum and 52 strains inhibited slightly the growth of p. gingivalis. no inactivation of antibacterial activity was observed after treatment with proteinase k. the gene of the gassericin a was not found in any strain. only one strain showed a 275-bp amplicon corresponding to the glycerol dehydratase gene. this strain has been identified by dna 16s sequencing as a l. gasseri. among the 66 tested strains, 7 produced hydrogen peroxide. our findings  suggest that in addition to the previous results, some of the autochthonous oral  lactobacilli tested could be considered as suitable probiotics.

TI  == bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes.
AB  == the objective of the present study was to evaluate the bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with different oral hygiene indexes using of two 16s rrna gene libraries. each library was composed of samples from patients with different averages of the differentiated silness-loe biofilm index: the first library (a) with an index between 1.0 and 3.0 (considered a high index) and the second library (b) between 0 and 0.5 (considered a low index). saliva dna was extracted  and the 16s rrna gene was amplified and cloned. the obtained sequences were compared with those stored at ncbi and rdp genbank. the saliva of patients with high index presented five known genera - streptococcus, granulicatella, gemella,  veillonella and peptostreptococcus - and 33.3% of nonculturable bacteria grouped  into 23 operational taxonomic units (otus). the saliva of patients with low index differed significantly from the first library (p=0.000) and was composed of 42 otus distributed into 11 known genera - streptococcus, granulicatella, gemella, veillonella, oribacterium, haemophilus, escherichia, neisseria, prevotella, capnocytophaga, actinomyces - including 24.87% of nonculturable bacteria. it was  possible to conclude that there is greater bacterial diversity in the saliva of patients with low dental plaque in relation to patients with high dental plaque.

TI  == effect of osteopontin on the initial adhesion of dental bacteria.
AB  == bacterial biofilms are involved in numerous infections of the human body, including dental caries. while conventional therapy of biofilm diseases aims at eradication and mechanical removal of the biofilms, recent therapeutic approaches target the mechanisms of biofilm formation and bacterial adhesion in particular.  the effect of bovine milk osteopontin, a highly phosphorylated whey protein, on adhesion of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and actinomyces naeslundii, three prominent colonizers in dental biofilms, to saliva-coated surfaces was investigated. while adhesion of a. naeslundii was not affected by osteopontin, a strong, dose-dependent reduction in the number of adhering s. mitis was shown. no difference in bacterial adhesion was observed for caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. osteopontin did not affect bacterial viability, but changed bacterial surface hydrophobicity, and may be suggested to prevent the adhesins of s. mitis from interacting with their  salivary receptors. the antiadhesive effect of osteopontin may be useful for caries prevention.

TI  == nurture trumps nature in a longitudinal survey of salivary bacterial communities  in twins from early adolescence to early adulthood.
AB  == variation in the composition of the human oral microbiome in health and disease has been observed. we have characterized inter- and intra-individual variation of microbial communities of 107 individuals in one of the largest cohorts to date (264 saliva samples), using culture-independent 16s rrna pyrosequencing. we examined the salivary microbiome in up to three time-points during 10 yr spanning adolescence, and determined the influence of human genotype, gender, age, and weight class. participants, including 27 monozygotic and 18 dizygotic twin pairs, were sampled mainly at ages 12-13, 17-18, and 22-24, with a few sampled as early  as 8 yr of age. in contrast to gut or skin microbiomes, there is a core genus-level salivary microbiome. individuals are more similar to themselves and their co-twins in the 12-17 and in the 17-22 cohorts than to the whole sample population, but not over the 10 yr from 12 to 22; and monozygotic twin pairs are  statistically not more similar than dizygotic twin pairs. the data are most consistent with shared environment serving as the main determinant of microbial populations. twins resemble each other more closely than the whole population at  all time-points, but become less similar to each other when they age and no longer cohabit. several organisms have age-specific abundance profiles, including members of the genera veillonella, actinomyces, and streptococcus. there is no clear effect of weight class and gender. the results of this work will provide a  basis to further study oral microbes and human health.

TI  == bacterial flora of dental periradicular lesions analyzed by the 454-pyrosequencing technology.
AB  == introduction: symptomatic teeth with periradicular lesions of infectious origin remain a significant challenge in dentistry, and the reason for the acute perturbation is incompletely understood. the present study used pyrosequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes to characterize the microbiota of periradicular lesions. methods: thirteen periradicular lesions from 11 symptomatic and 2 asymptomatic teeth were sampled during apical surgery. samples  were subjected to dna extraction and 16s rrna polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification. pcr amplicons were then sequenced by using the roche 454 gs flx platform. data were analyzed with the quantitative insights into microbial ecology (qiime) software package. results: seven of the 13 periradicular lesions  (53.8%) yielded pcr amplicons, which generated 35,731 high-quality dna sequences  belonging to 10 bacterial phyla and 73 bacterial genera. all 7 lesions were associated with symptoms. the phyla with most bacterial taxa were proteobacteria  (proportion of total bacterial taxa, 33.3%), firmicutes (30.9%), actinobacteria (12.2%), and bacteroidetes (11.4%). the most abundant genera were fusobacterium (average of total sequences, 21.0%), streptococcus (8.0%), prevotella (7.5%), corynebacterium (7.2%), porphyromonas (6.0%). and actinomyces (5.8%). conclusions: this study demonstrated that the microbiota of symptomatic periapical lesions is predominated by anaerobic bacteria but also contains substantial levels of streptococci, actinomyces, and bacteria not previously identified in the oral cavity. the etiopathogenic role and therapeutic implication of periradicular bacteria need to be determined.

TI  == streptococcus mutans protein synthesis during mixed-species biofilm development by high-throughput quantitative proteomics.
AB  == biofilms formed on tooth surfaces are comprised of mixed microbiota enmeshed in an extracellular matrix. oral biofilms are constantly exposed to environmental changes, which influence the microbial composition, matrix formation and expression of virulence. streptococcus mutans and sucrose are key modulators associated with the evolution of virulent-cariogenic biofilms. in this study, we  used a high-throughput quantitative proteomics approach to examine how s. mutans  produces relevant proteins that facilitate its establishment and optimal survival during mixed-species biofilms development induced by sucrose. biofilms of s. mutans, alone or mixed with actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis, were initially formed onto saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surface under carbohydrate-limiting condition. sucrose (1%, w/v) was then introduced to cause environmental changes, and to induce biofilm accumulation. multidimensional protein identification technology (mudpit) approach detected up to 60% of proteins encoded by s. mutans within biofilms. specific proteins associated with  exopolysaccharide matrix assembly, metabolic and stress adaptation processes were highly abundant as the biofilm transit from earlier to later developmental stages following sucrose introduction. our results indicate that s. mutans within a mixed-species biofilm community increases the expression of specific genes associated with glucan synthesis and remodeling (gtfbc, dexa) and glucan-binding  (gbpb) during this transition (p<0.05). furthermore, s. mutans up-regulates specific adaptation mechanisms to cope with acidic environments (f1f0-atpase system, fatty acid biosynthesis, branched chain amino acids metabolism), and molecular chaperones (groel). interestingly, the protein levels and gene expression are in general augmented when s. mutans form mixed-species biofilms (vs. single-species biofilms) demonstrating fundamental differences in the matrix assembly, survival and biofilm maintenance in the presence of other organisms. our data provide insights about how s. mutans optimizes its metabolism and adapts/survives within the mixed-species community in response to a dynamically changing environment. this reflects the intricate physiological processes linked  to expression of virulence by this bacterium within complex biofilms.

TI  == environmental and centrifugal factors influencing the visco-elastic properties of oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  == centrifugal compaction causes changes in the surface properties of bacterial cells. it has been shown previously that the surface properties of planktonic cells change with increasing centrifugal compaction. this study aimed to analyze  the influences of centrifugal compaction and environmental conditions on the visco-elastic properties of oral biofilms. biofilms were grown out of a layer of  initially adhering streptococci, actinomyces or a combination of these. different uni-axial deformations were induced on the biofilms and the load relaxations were measured over time. linear-regression-analysis demonstrated that both the centrifugation coefficient for streptococci and induced deformation influenced the percentage relaxation. centrifugal compaction significantly influenced relaxation only upon compression of the outermost 20% of the biofilm (p < 0.05),  whereas biofilm composition became influential when 50% deformation was induced,  invoking re-arrangement of the bacteria in deeper biofilm structures. in summary, the effects of centrifugal compaction of initially adhering, centrifuged bacteria extend to the visco-elastic properties of biofilms, indicating that the initial bacterial layer influences the structure of the entire biofilm.

TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of the salivary microbiota of healthy chinese children and adults.
AB  == describing the biogeography of bacterial communities within the human body is critical for establishing healthy baselines from which to detect differences associated with diseases. little is known, however, about the baseline of normal  salivary microbiota from healthy chinese children and adults. with parallel barcoded 454 pyrosequencing, the bacterial diversity and richness of saliva were  thoroughly investigated from ten healthy chinese children and adults. the overall taxonomic distribution of our metagenomic data demonstrated that the diversity of salivary microbiota from children was more complex than adults, while the composition and richness of salivary microbiota were similar in children and adults, especially for predominant bacteria. a large number of bacterial phylotypes were shared by healthy children and adults, indicating the existence of a core salivary microbiome. in children and adults, the vast majority of sequences in salivary microbiota belonged to streptococcus, prevotella, neisseria, haemophilus, porphyromonas, gemella, rothia, granulicatella, fusobacterium, actinomyces, veillonella, and aggregatibacter, which constituted the major components of normal salivary microbiota. with the exception of actinomyces, the other seven non-predominant bacteria including moraxella, leptotrichia, peptostreptococcus, eubacterium, and members of neisseriaceae, flavobacteriaceae, and sr1 showed significant differences between children and adults (p < 0.05). we first established the framework of normal salivary microbiota from healthy chinese children and adults. our data represent a critical step for determining the diversity of healthy microbiota in chinese children and adults, and our data established a platform for additional large-scale studies focusing on the interactions between health and diseases in the future.

TI  == osteopontin reduces biofilm formation in a multi-species model of dental biofilm.
AB  == background: combating dental biofilm formation is the most effective means for the prevention of caries, one of the most widespread human diseases. among the chemical supplements to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures, non-bactericidal adjuncts that target the mechanisms of bacterial biofilm formation have gained increasing interest in recent years. milk proteins, such as lactoferrin, have been shown to interfere with bacterial colonization of saliva-coated surfaces. we here study the effect of bovine milk osteopontin (opn), a highly phosphorylated whey glycoprotein, on a multispecies in vitro model of dental biofilm. while considerable research effort focuses on the interaction of opn with mammalian cells, there are no data investigating the influence of opn on bacterial biofilms. methodology/principal findings: biofilms consisting of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and streptococcus sanguinis were grown in a flow cell system that permitted in situ microscopic analysis. crystal violet staining showed significantly less biofilm formation in the presence of opn, as compared to biofilms grown without opn or biofilms grown in the presence of caseinoglycomacropeptide, another phosphorylated milk protein. confocal microscopy revealed that opn bound to the surface of bacterial cells and reduced mechanical stability of the biofilms without affecting cell viability. the bacterial composition of the biofilms, determined by fluorescence in situ hybridization, changed considerably in the presence of opn. in particular, colonization of s. mitis, the best biofilm former in the model, was reduced dramatically. conclusions/significance: opn strongly reduces the amount of biofilm formed in a well-defined laboratory model of acidogenic dental biofilm. if a similar effect can be observed in vivo, opn might serve as a valuable adjunct to mechanical tooth cleaning procedures.

TI  == an ormosil-containing orthodontic acrylic resin with concomitant improvements in  antimicrobial and fracture toughness properties.
AB  == global increase in patients seeking orthodontic treatment creates a demand for the use of acrylic resins in removable appliances and retainers. orthodontic removable appliance wearers have a higher risk of oral infections that are caused by the formation of bacterial and fungal biofilms on the appliance surface. here, we present the synthetic route for an antibacterial and antifungal organically-modified silicate (ormosil) that has multiple methacryloloxy functionalities attached to a siloxane backbone (quaternary ammonium methacryloxy silicate, or qams). by dissolving the water-insoluble, rubbery ormosil in methyl  methacrylate, qams may be copolymerized with polymethyl methacrylate, and covalently incorporated in the pressure-processed acrylic resin. the latter demonstrated a predominantly contact-killing effect on streptococcus mutans atcc  36558 and actinomyces naselundii atcc 12104 biofilms, while inhibiting adhesion of candida albicans atcc 90028 on the acrylic surface. apart from its favorable antimicrobial activities, qams-containing acrylic resins exhibited decreased water wettability and improved toughness, without adversely affecting the flexural strength and modulus, water sorption and solubility, when compared with  qams-free acrylic resin. the covalently bound, antimicrobial orthodontic acrylic  resin with improved toughness represents advancement over other experimental antimicrobial acrylic resin formulations, in its potential to simultaneously prevent oral infections during appliance wear, and improve the fracture resistance of those appliances.

AB  == background and objective: antimicrobial agents provide valuable adjunctive therapy for the prevention and the control of oral diseases. limitations in their prolonged use have stimulated the search for new, naturally occurring agents with more specific activity and fewer adverse effects. here we sought to determine the antibacterial properties of blackberry extract (bbe) in vitro against oral bacterial commensals and periodontopathogens. material and methods: the effects of whole and fractionated bbe on the metabolism of 10 different oral bacteria were evaluated using the colorimetric water-soluble tetrazolium-1 assay. the bactericidal effects of whole bbe against fusobacterium nucleatum were determined by quantitating the numbers of colony-forming units (cfus). cytotoxicity was determined in oral epithelial (okf6) cells. results: bbe at 350-1400 mug/ml reduced the metabolic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis, f. nucleatum and streptococcus mutans. the reduced metabolic activity observed for f. nucleatum corresponded to a reduction in the numbers of cfus following exposure to bbe for  as little as 1 h, indicative of its bactericidal properties. an anthocyanin-enriched fraction of bbe reduced the metabolic activity of f. nucleatum, but not of p. gingivalis or s. mutans, suggesting the contribution of  species-specific agents in the whole bbe. oral epithelial cell viability was not  reduced following exposure to whole bbe (2.24-1400 mug/ml) for </= 6 h. conclusion: bbe alters the metabolic activity of oral periodontopathogens while demonstrating a minimal effect on commensals. the specific antibacterial properties of bbe shown in this study, along with its previously demonstrated anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties, make this natural extract a promising target as an adjunct for prevention and/or complementary therapy of periodontal infections.

TI  == possible variation of the human oral bacterial community after wearing removable  partial dentures by dgge.
AB  == although it is well-known that variations of the microbial community in a specific location of human body may be associated with some diseases, the developing change of the oral microbiota related to oral diseases before and after wearing the removable partial dentures (rpd) is not completely understood.  in this study, three kinds of samples (saliva, supra- and subgingival plaque, and oral mucosal surfaces) were collected from the 10-patients group at three different times: before, 1-month and 6-months after the treatment. ten healthy adults were also selected as the control group. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was applied to identify the bacterial profiles and to analyze the dynamics of the oral microbial population in the pre- and post-therapy. the anova of repeated measurement data indicated that, in the saliva and mucosal surfaces,  wearing rpds caused significant change of numbers of amplicons. as many as 607 amplicons were chosen to cut out and re-amplify by pcr. after cloning and sequencing, a total of 16 bacterial genera were identified. the health-associated genera such as streptococcus, neisseria, rothia, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, gemella, veillonella, selenomona and actinomyces tended to decrease, whereas the  disease-associated species including streptococcus mutans tended to increase. in  general, wearing rpds influenced the diversity of the bacterial species in the oral microbial ecosystem. it is noteworthy that the oral environment will be changed from the healthy status towards the disease status after the treatment.

TI  == subgingival biodiversity in subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: there is a bidirectional relationship between periodontal disease and type-2 diabetes mellitus (dm). inflammatory mediators may negatively affect glycemic control, and increased glucose levels and resultant glycation end-products may alter the host response against bacterial infection. however, no agreement has been reached regarding the effect of dm on periodontal  subgingival microbiota. therefore, the purpose of the present study was to compare the subgingival biodiversity in deep periodontal pockets of subjects with chronic periodontitis and either uncontrolled type-2 diabetes or no diabetes using 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing. material and methods: twelve subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes (glycated hemoglobin > 8%) and eleven nondiabetic subjects presenting severe and generalized chronic periodontitis were selected. subgingival biofilm from periodontal pockets > 5 mm were assessed using the 16s rrna gene cloning and sequencing technique. results: significant differences were observed in subgingival microbiota between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects. diabetic subjects presented higher percentages of total clones of tm7, aggregatibacter, neisseria, gemella, eikenella, selenomonas, actinomyces, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, veillonella and streptococcus genera, and lower percentages of porphyromonas, filifactor, eubacterium, synergistetes, tannerella and treponema genera than nondiabetic individuals (p < 0.05). moreover, some phylotypes, such as fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula,  v. dispar and eikenella corrodens were detected significantly more often in diabetic subjects than in nondiabetic subjects (p < 0.05). conclusion: subjects with uncontrolled type-2 diabetes and chronic periodontitis presented significant dissimilarities in subgingival biodiversity compared with nondiabetic subjects.

TI  == bacterial flora and extraradicular biofilm associated with the apical segment of  teeth with post-treatment apical periodontitis.
AB  == introduction: microorganisms are able to survive and cause persistent infection in the extraradicular area. the aims of this study were to investigate the primary bacterial flora and the localization of extraradicular biofilm in persistent apical periodontitis lesions. methods: apical root samples from root-end surgery were collected from 23 root-filled teeth with apical periodontitis. five samples were examined for the presence of biofilm by scanning electron microscopy. another 5 samples were examined for the presence of biofilm  by brown and brenn-modified gram staining. the dna from 13 samples was processed  for amplification via polymerase chain reaction and separated with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. selected bands were excised from the gel and sequenced for identification. results: the extraradicular biofilm present on the  external root surface of treated teeth consisted of abundant, amorphous extracellular material and multiple bacterial species. the following species were detected in the microbial community from the apical samples: actinomyces sp. oral, propionibacterium, prevotella sp. oral, streptococcus, porphyromonas endodontalis, and burkholderia. the prevalence of actinomyces sp. oral and propionibacterium were highest (84.6% and 61.5%, respectively). conclusions: extraradicular biofilm was present on the external root surface of treated teeth  with persistent periapical lesions. actinomyces sp. oral and propionibacterium are likely important contributors to extraradicular biofilm formation and persistent periapical infection.

TI  == antimicrobial constituents of artemisia afra jacq. ex willd. against periodontal  pathogens.
AB  == the phytochemical investigation of an ethanol extract of artemisia afra led to the isolation of six known compounds, acacetin (1), 12alpha,4alpha-dihydroxybishopsolicepolide (2), scopoletin (3), alpha-amyrin (4), phytol (5), and a pentacyclic triterpenoid betulinic acid (6). the compounds were evaluated for antimicrobial activity against gram positive (actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus mutans), gram negative bacteria (prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans previously known as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans),  and candida albicans. the crude extract of a. afra inhibited the growth of all tested microbial species at concentration range of 1.6 mg/ml to 25 mg/ml. the compounds 1-6 also showed activity range at 1.0 mg/ml to 0.25 mg/ml. three best compounds (scopoletin, betulinic acid, and acacetin) which showed good antimicrobial activity were selected for further studies. cytotoxicity of extract and compounds was determined using the xtt cell proliferation kit. the antioxidant activity of the extract and compounds was done using the dpph scavenging method. the extract showed good antioxidant activity with an ic(50) value of 22.2 mug/ml. scopoletin had a strong transformation of the dpph radical  into its reduced form, with an ic(50) value of 1.24 mug/ml which was significant  to that of vitamin c (1.22 mug/ml). acacetin and betulinic acid exhibited a decreased scavenging activity with the ic(50) of 2.39 and 2.42 mug/ml, respectively. the extract and compounds showed moderate toxicity on mccoy fibroblast cell line and scopoletin was relatively nontoxic with an ic(50) value  of 132.5 mug/ml. acacetin and betulinic acid also showed a smooth trend of non-toxic effects with ic(50) values of 35.44 and 30.96 mug/ml. the obtained results in this study confirm the use of a. afra in the treatment of microbial infections.

TI  == bacterial viability on surface-modified resin-based dental restorative materials.
AB  == the purpose of the present investigation was to investigate the viability of early colonizers on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative materials modified with low-surface tension active agents in comparison with the unmodified material. a novel polymeric sorption material, loaded with two low-surface tension gamma(l) active agents (hydroxyfunctional polydimethylsiloxane and polydimethylsiloxane) or a polymerizable active agent (silicone polyether acrylate), was used to modify commonly formulated experimental dental resin composites. the non-modified resin was used as the standard (st). the viability of actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis on water-stored, polished, and  human saliva pellicle-coated specimens was determined using a fluorescence microscope after 8 and 24h. total, vital, and non-vital cells were calculated from the microscopic images by counting pixels per colour. means, standard deviations, univariate anova and multiple comparisons with post hoc scheffe's tests were calculated. t-test was done to compare 8-h and 24-h bacteria counts. for all tests p<0.05 was chosen. null hypothesis: the test materials and the standard did not differ either in the total bacterial counts or in the respective bacterium's viability after 8 or 24h. the test materials modified with the silicone polyether acrylate showed lower total bacteria count after 8 or 24h than st. but all test materials had significantly fewer vital cells after 8 or 24h compared to st. the contact angle did not influence bacterial adhesion, but low total sfe and a low polar term of sfe resulted in fewer bacteria. the material's  chemistry also affected the total and vital cell counts. different bacteria viabilities needed to be explored to obtain relevant information regarding bacterial adhesion on dental composite resins. the novel sorption material loaded with low gamma(l) active agents or with a low gamma(l) polymerizable silicone polyether acrylate used to modify the chemistry of the test materials was appropriate to reduce bacterial adhesion or cell viability, respectively.

TI  == quaternary ammonium silane-functionalized, methacrylate resin composition with antimicrobial activities and self-repair potential.
AB  == the design of antimicrobial polymers to address healthcare issues and minimize environmental problems is an important endeavor with both fundamental and practical implications. quaternary ammonium silane-functionalized methacrylate (qams) represents an example of antimicrobial macromonomers synthesized by a sol-gel chemical route; these compounds possess flexible si-o-si bonds. in present work, a partially hydrolyzed qams co-polymerized with 2,2-[4(2-hydroxy 3-methacryloxypropoxy)-phenyl]propane is introduced. this methacrylate resin was  shown to possess desirable mechanical properties with both a high degree of conversion and minimal polymerization shrinkage. the kill-on-contact microbiocidal activities of this resin were demonstrated using single-species biofilms of streptococcus mutans (atcc 36558), actinomyces naeslundii (atcc 12104) and candida albicans (atcc 90028). improved mechanical properties after hydration provided the proof-of-concept that qams-incorporated resin exhibits self-repair potential via water-induced condensation of organic modified silicate (ormosil) phases within the polymerized resin matrix.

TI  == effects of xylitol on xylitol-sensitive versus xylitol-resistant streptococcus mutans strains in a three-species in vitro biofilm.
AB  == we studied the effects of xylitol on biofilms containing xylitol-resistant (xr) and xylitol-sensitive (xs) streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii and s. sanguinis. the biofilms were grown for 8 and 24 h on hydroxyapatite discs. the viable microorganisms were determined by plate culturing techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) was performed using a s. mutans-specific probe. extracellular cell-bound polysaccharides (eps) were determined by spectrofluorometry from single-species s. mutans biofilms. in the presence of 5 % xylitol, the counts of the xs s. mutans decreased tenfold in the  young (8 h) biofilm (p < 0.05) but no effect was seen in the mature (24 h) biofilm. no decrease was observed for the xr strains, and fish confirmed these results. no differences were detected in the eps production of the xs s. mutans grown with or without xylitol, nor between xr and xs s. mutans strains. thus, it  seems that xylitol did not affect the eps synthesis of the s. mutans strains. since the xr s. mutans strains, not inhibited by xylitol, showed no xylitol-induced decrease in the biofilms, we conclude that growth inhibition could be responsible for the decrease of the counts of the xs s. mutans strains in the clinically relevant young biofilms.

AB  == background and objective: to compare the levels of selenomonas sputigena and uncultivated/unrecognized selenomonas species in subgingival biofilms from periodontally healthy subjects and from subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis. material and methods: fifteen periodontally healthy subjects and 15 subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis were recruited and their clinical periodontal parameters were evaluated. nine subgingival plaque samples were collected from each subject and all were individually analyzed for the levels of 10 bacterial taxa, including cultured and uncultivated/unrecognized microorganisms, using the rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique. between-group differences in the levels of the test taxa were determined using the mann-whitney u-test. results: subjects with generalized aggressive periodontitis showed significantly higher mean counts of porphyromonas gingivalis, s. sputigena and the mitsuokella sp. human oral taxon (hot) 131 (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone cs002), while higher mean counts of actinomyces gerencseriae and streptococcus sanguinis were found in periodontally healthy subjects (p < 0.01). selenomonas sp. hot 146 was only detected in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group. in the generalized aggressive periodontitis group, the levels of p. gingivalis and s. sputigena were higher in deep sites (probing depth >/= 5 mm) than in shallow sites (probing depth </= 3 mm) (p < 0.01). furthermore, in subjects with generalized aggressive  periodontitis, sites with probing depth of </= 3 mm harbored higher levels of these two species than sites with the same probing depth in periodontally healthy subjects. there were positive correlations between probing depth and the levels of p. gingivalis (r = 0.77; p < 0.01), s. sputigena (r = 0.60; p < 0.01) and selenomonas dianae (previously described as selenomonas sp. oral clone ew076) (r  = 0.42, p < 0.05). conclusion: s. sputigena and mitsuokella sp. hot 131 may be associated with the pathogenesis of generalized aggressive periodontitis, and their role in the onset and progression of this infection should be investigated  further.

TI  == modeling of s mutans and a naeslundii acid production in vitro with caries incidence of low- and high-risk children.
AB  == objectives: nowadays, the extended ecological plaque hypothesis equates dental health with the occurrence of acidogenic generalists in the plaque flora and explains disease?the irreversible demineralization of the dental hard tissue?by an ecologic shift in plaque composition, favoring acidogenic and aciduric specialists, following repeated conditions of high sugar. in the present study, aspects of the extended ecological plaque hypothesis were examined in retrospect. method and materials: serving as a basis were data on (1) the caries incidence of children, classified according to their dmft as having low or high caries risk; (2) the qualitative plaque composition of the children with the prevalence of mutans streptococci and actinomyces; (3) the amounts of acid and acid tolerance,  determined by ph state titration (glucose), of representatively isolated strains  of mutans streptococci and actinomyces; (4) the extrapolation of the acid amount  to the occurrence of mutans streptococci and actinomyces in the plaque of children; and (5) the relationship between the extrapolated acid amount in plaque and caries incidence and the respective classification of the children into low and high caries risk. results: the synoptic consideration of the numbers of a naeslundii and s mutans in plaque of children, with their capacity for acid production in vitro, reflected the caries risk classification. conclusion: the analysis of the clinical, microbiologic, and in vitro findings concerning the virulence of the plaque isolates supports the extended ecological plaque hypothesis. children with low caries risk had developed one new decayed surface within 4 years; children with high caries risk developed four within the same time period.

TI  == deep metaproteomic analysis of human salivary supernatant.
AB  == the human salivary proteome is extremely complex, including proteins from salivary glands, serum, and oral microbes. much has been learned about the host component, but little is known about the microbial component. here we report a metaproteomic analysis of salivary supernatant pooled from six healthy subjects.  for deep interrogation of the salivary proteome, we combined protein dynamic range compression (drc), multidimensional peptide fractionation, and high-mass accuracy ms/ms with a novel two-step peptide identification method using a database of human proteins plus those translated from oral microbe genomes. peptides were identified from 124 microbial species as well as uncultured phylotypes such as tm7. streptococcus, rothia, actinomyces, prevotella, neisseria, veilonella, lactobacillus, selenomonas, pseudomonas, staphylococcus, and campylobacter were abundant among the 65 genera from 12 phyla represented. taxonomic diversity in our study was broadly consistent with metagenomic studies  of saliva. proteins mapped to 20 kegg pathways, with carbohydrate metabolism, amino acid metabolism, energy metabolism, translation, membrane transport, and signal transduction most represented. the communities sampled appear to be actively engaged in glycolysis and protein synthesis. this first deep metaproteomic catalog from human salivary supernatant provides a baseline for future studies of shifts in microbial diversity and protein activities potentially associated with oral disease.

TI  == using high throughput sequencing to explore the biodiversity in oral bacterial communities.
AB  == high throughput sequencing of 16s ribosomal rna gene amplicons is a cost-effective method for characterization of oral bacterial communities. however, before undertaking large-scale studies, it is necessary to understand the technique-associated limitations and intrinsic variability of the oral ecosystem. in this work we evaluated bias in species representation using an in vitro-assembled mock community of oral bacteria. we then characterized the bacterial communities in saliva and buccal mucosa of five healthy subjects to investigate the power of high throughput sequencing in revealing their diversity  and biogeography patterns. mock community analysis showed primer and dna isolation biases and an overestimation of diversity that was reduced after eliminating singleton operational taxonomic units (otus). sequencing of salivary  and mucosal communities found a total of 455 otus (0.3% dissimilarity) with only  78 of these present in all subjects. we demonstrate that this variability was partly the result of incomplete richness coverage even at great sequencing depths, and so comparing communities by their structure was more effective than comparisons based solely on membership. with respect to oral biogeography, we found inter-subject variability in community structure was lower than site differences between salivary and mucosal communities within subjects. these differences were evident at very low sequencing depths and were mostly caused by  the abundance of streptococcus mitis and gemella haemolysans in mucosa. in summary, we present an experimental and data analysis framework that will facilitate design and interpretation of pyrosequencing-based studies. despite challenges associated with this technique, we demonstrate its power for evaluation of oral diversity and biogeography patterns.

TI  == zoocin a and lauricidin in combination reduce streptococcus mutans growth in a multispecies biofilm.
AB  == dental caries is the most prevalent human infection. it is a multifactorial disease in which the microbial composition of dental plaque plays a major role in the development of clinical symptoms. the bacteria most often implicated in the development of caries are that group of streptococci referred to as the mutans streptococci, in particular streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. one  approach to the prevention of caries is to reduce the numbers of mutans streptococci in plaque to a level insufficient to support demineralization of the tooth. in this study, zoocin a, a peptidoglycan hydrolase, combined with lauricidin, a cell membrane active lipid, was shown over a 72 h period to selectively suppress the growth of s. mutans in a triple species biofilm. growth  of the non-target species streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus was not inhibited. in treated systems the amount of extracellular polysaccharide matrix produced was much reduced as determined by use of fluorescein isothiocyanate conjugated wheat germ agglutinin. the ph of treated biofilms remained above neutral as opposed to a value of 4.3 in untreated controls. we conclude that use  of antimicrobial compounds that specifically target cariogenic bacteria should be further explored.

TI  == the exopolysaccharide matrix modulates the interaction between 3d architecture and virulence of a mixed-species oral biofilm.
AB  == virulent biofilms are responsible for a range of infections, including oral diseases. all biofilms harbor a microbial-derived extracellular-matrix. the exopolysaccharides (eps) formed on tooth-pellicle and bacterial surfaces provide  binding sites for microorganisms; eventually the accumulated eps enmeshes microbial cells. the metabolic activity of the bacteria within this matrix leads  to acidification of the milieu. we explored the mechanisms through which the streptococcus mutans-produced eps-matrix modulates the three-dimensional (3d) architecture and the population shifts during morphogenesis of biofilms on a saliva-coated-apatitic surface using a mixed-bacterial species system. concomitantly, we examined whether the matrix influences the development of ph-microenvironments within intact-biofilms using a novel 3d in situ ph-mapping technique. data reveal that the production of the eps-matrix helps to create spatial heterogeneities by forming an intricate network of exopolysaccharide-enmeshed bacterial-islets (microcolonies) through localized cell-to-matrix interactions. this complex 3d architecture creates compartmentalized acidic and eps-rich microenvironments throughout the biofilm, which triggers the dominance of pathogenic s. mutans within a mixed-species system. the establishment of a 3d-matrix and eps-enmeshed microcolonies were largely mediated by the s. mutans gtfb/gtfc genes, expression of which was enhanced in the presence of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. acidic pockets were found only in the interiors of bacterial-islets that are protected by eps, which impedes rapid neutralization by buffer (ph 7.0). as a result, regions of low ph (<5.5) were detected at specific locations along the surface of attachment. resistance to chlorhexidine was enhanced in cells within eps-microcolony complexes compared to those outside such structures within the biofilm. our results illustrate the critical interaction between matrix architecture and ph heterogeneity in the 3d environment. the formation of structured acidic-microenvironments in close proximity to the apatite-surface is  an essential factor associated with virulence in cariogenic-biofilms. these observations may have relevance beyond the mouth, as matrix is inherent to all biofilms.

TI  == structural determinants of actinomyces sortase srtc2 required for membrane localization and assembly of type 2 fimbriae for interbacterial coaggregation and oral biofilm formation.
AB  == as a pioneer colonizer of the oral cavity, actinomyces oris expresses proteinaceous pili (also called fimbriae) to mediate the following two key events in biofilm formation: adherence to saliva deposits on enamel and interbacterial associations. assembly of type 2 fimbriae that directly facilitate coaggregation  with oral streptococci and actinomyces biofilm development requires the class c sortase srtc2. although the general sortase-associated mechanisms have been elucidated, several structural attributes unique to the class c sortases require  functional investigation. mutational studies reported here suggest that the n-terminal transmembrane (tm) region of srtc2, predicted to contain a signal peptide sequence, is cleaved off the mature protein and that this processing is critical for the proper integration of the enzyme at the cytoplasmic membrane, which is mediated by the extended hydrophobic c terminus containing a tm domain and a cytoplasmic tail. deletion of this putative tm or the entire cytoplasmic domain abolished the enzyme localization and functionality. alanine substitution  of the conserved catalytic cys-his dyad abrogated the srtc2 enzymatic activity. in contrast, mutations designed to alter a "lid" domain that covers the catalytic pocket of a class c sortase showed no effect on enzyme activity. finally, each of the deleterious mutations that affected srtc2 activity or membrane localization also eliminated actinomyces species biofilm development and bacterial coaggregation with streptococci. we conclude that the n terminus of srtc2, which  contains the signal sequence, is required for proper protein translocation and maturation, while the extended c-terminal hydrophobic region serves as a stable membrane anchor for proper enzyme functionality.

TI  == adjunctive azithromycin in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis: microbiological findings of a 12-month randomized clinical trial.
AB  == objectives: to compare the subgingival microbiological outcomes of azithromycin or placebo as adjuncts to scaling and root planing (srp) in the treatment of aggressive periodontitis (agp), and to secondarily evaluate the microbiological effect of supragingival scaling in agp patients. methods: twenty-four agp subjects 13-26 years of age received a 15-day programme of supragingival scaling  (sc) and were then randomly assigned to srp with systemic azithromycin or placebo. subgingival samples were taken with sterile paper points at baseline, 15 days after sc, and at 3, 6 and 12 months following srp. microbiological analysis  was performed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. results: changes in bacterial levels from baseline to 15 days after sc were similar in the 2 groups.  when subjects were analysed as a single group, significant reductions after sc were observed for actinomyces gerencseriae, capnocytophaga ochracea, and treponema denticola. during the 12-month follow-up, levels of most of the bacteria decreased in both groups in a similar pattern. for instance, actinomyces israelli, veillonella parvula, streptococcus gordonii, c. ochracea, eikenella corrodens, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium periodonticum and fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum decreased significantly within the groups. conclusions: azithromycin was ineffective in lowering the subgingival levels of important putative periodontal pathogens in young agp subjects compared to placebo. clinical significance: scaling and root planing with adjunctive systemic azithromycin provides little additional benefit compared to placebo in reductions of major subgingival periodontal pathogens.

TI  == pyrosequencing reveals unique microbial signatures associated with healthy and failing dental implants.
AB  == aim: although it is established that peri-implantitis is a bacterially induced disease, little is known about the bacterial profile of peri-implant communities  in health and disease. the purpose of the present investigation was to examine the microbial signatures of the peri-implant microbiome in health and disease. materials and methods: subgingival and submucosal plaque samples were collected from forty subjects with periodontitis, peri-implantitis, periodontal and peri-implant health and analysed using 16s pyrosequencing. results: peri-implant  biofilms demonstrated significantly lower diversity than subgingival biofilms in  both health and disease, however, several species, including previously unsuspected and unknown organisms, were unique to this niche. the predominant species in peri-implant communities belonged to the genera butyrivibrio, campylobacter, eubacterium, prevotella, selenomonas, streptococcus, actinomyces,  leptotrichia, propionibacterium, peptococcus, lactococcus and treponema. peri-implant disease was associated with lower levels of prevotella and leptotrichia and higher levels of actinomyces, peptococcus, campylobacter, non-mutans streptococcus, butyrivibrio and streptococcus mutans than healthy implants. these communities also demonstrated lower levels of prevotella, non-mutans streptococcus, lactobacillus, selenomonas, leptotrichia, actinomyces and higher levels of peptococcus, mycoplasma, eubacterium, campylobacter, butyrivibrio, s. mutans and treponema when compared to periodontitis-associated biofilms. conclusion: the peri-implant microbiome differs significantly from the  periodontal community in both health and disease. peri-implantitis is a microbially heterogeneous infection with predominantly gram-negative species, and is less complex than periodontitis.

AB  == introduction: many pathogenic microorganisms were found in an infected root canal. the object of this study was to evaluate the effect of mtad in combination with nisin on the pathogens associated with root canal infection. methods: the survival rates of 9 pathogenic bacteria were determined after 1-, 5-, and 10-minute treatment with mtad, mtan (substitution of doxycycline with nisin), and mtadn (nisin in combination with doxycycline). the survival rates of enterococcus faecalis in the starvation phase and pretreatment alkalization as well as in the  normal physiological state under mtad, mtan, and mtadn challenge for 1, 5, and 10 minutes were evaluated and compared. furthermore, scanning electron microscopy was used to observe the morphologic modification of actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus paracasei, and porphyromonas gingivalis after mtad and mtadn treatment. results: l. fermenti, l. paracasei, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus gordonii, and peptostreptococcus were more sensitive to mtadn and mtan than to mtad. mtad, mtan, and mtadn showed a rapid antibacterial effect on p. gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum. enterococcus faecalis in the stress state was as sensitive to mtad, mtan, and mtadn as the control e. faecalis. furthermore, in the observation of scanning electron microscopy, the membranes in a. naeslundii and l. paracasei presented significant rupture, and p. gingivalis did not exhibit significant damage after mtadn treatment. conclusions: mtad in combination with nisin improved antibacterial efficacy against pathogens, especially for some gram-positive bacteria associated with persistent intracanal infection. therefore, the combination had the potential to be used as an effective intracanal irrigation.

AB  == objectives: the purpose of the study was to determine the prevalence of different oral microbes in gingival plaque samples and in samples from the dorsum of the tongue in a swiss adolescent population. materials and methods: ninety-nine adolescents between 15 and 18 years were enrolled. plaque index, bleeding on probing (bop), the periodontal screening index, and decayed missed filled tooth (dmft) index were recorded. samples from subgingival plaque and swabs from the tongue were analyzed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. additionally, counts of streptococus mutans and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, tannerella forsythia, and treponema denticola were determined by real-time pcr. results: periodontitis was  not diagnosed in any of the subjects but all of them presented signs of gingival  inflammation displaying a mean bop of 28%. ten (10.1%) subjects were tested positive for p. gingivalis, each 22 (22.2%) for a. actinomycetemcomitans and t. forsythia, (47.5%) for t. denticola. t. denticola and s. mutans showed a high affinity to the gingival plaque, whereas t. forsythia was often detected from the dorsum of the tongue. dmft was associated with s. mutans counts, and bop correlated with counts of p. gingivalis and t. denticola. conclusions: the present data indicate that: (a) gingivitis but not periodontitis is a common finding among swiss adolescents, and (b) bacteria associated with periodontitis were frequently detected in the subgingival dental plaque and on the dorsum of the tongue in swiss adolescents with gingivitis. clinical relevance: although gingivitis was a frequent finding in swiss adolescents, periodontitis was not detected in this population. the dorsum of the tongue appears to represent an important reservoir for periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == development of a multispecies biofilm community by four root canal bacteria.
AB  == introduction: the development of multispecies biofilm models are needed to explain the interactions that take place in root canal biofilms during apical periodontitis. the aim of this study was to investigate the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to establish a multispecies biofilm community and to characterize  the main structural, compositional, and physiological features of this community. methods: four clinical isolates isolated from infected root canals, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus gordonii, and enterococcus faecalis, were grown together in a miniflow cell system. simultaneous detection of the 4 species in the biofilm communities was achieved by fluorescence in situ  hybridization in combination with confocal microscopy at different time points. the live/dead baclight technique (molecular probes, carlsbad, ca) was used to assess cell viability and to calculate 3-dimensional architectural parameters such as biovolume (mum(3)). redox fluorescence dye 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride was used to assess the metabolic activity of biofilm bacteria. results: the 4 species tested were able to form stable and reproducible biofilm communities. the biofilms formed in rich medium generally showed continuous growth over time, however, in the absence of glucose biofilms showed significantly smaller biovolumes. a high proportion of viable cells (>90%) were generally observed, and biofilm growth was correlated with high metabolic activity of cells. the community structure of biofilms formed in rich medium did  not change considerably over the 120-hour period, during which e. faecalis, l. salivarius, and s. gordonii were most abundant. conclusions: the ability of 4 root canal bacteria to form multispecies biofilm communities shown in this study  give insights into assessing the community lifestyle of these microorganisms in vivo. this multispecies model could be useful for further research simulating stresses representative of in vivo conditions.

TI  == microbiologic profile of endodontic infections from hiv- and hiv+ patients using  multiple-displacement amplification and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == objective: to compare the microbiota of endodontic infections in necrotic pulp from hiv-negative and hiv-positive subjects. materials and methods: root canal samples from necrotic pulp were collected from 40 hiv- and 20 hiv+ subjects. pulps were amplified using multiple displacement amplification (mda). then, checkerboard dna-dna hybridization was employed to assess the levels of 107 microbial taxa. the percentage of dna probe count and the percentage of teeth colonized by each test species were investigated. significant differences between groups regarding proportions of taxa and prevalence of the test species were sought using the mann-whitney test and the chi-square analysis, respectively. results: the most prevalent taxa detected were dialister pneumosintes, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, streptococcus sobrinus, corynebacterium diphteriae, and helicobacter pylori among hiv- subjects and d. pneumosintes, prevotella tannerae, porphyromonas gingivalis, parvimonas micra, prevotella nigrescens, and  corynebacterium diphtheriae among hiv+ individuals. d. pneumosintes, c. diphtheria, and c. albicans were the most abundant species in the hiv- group, whereas the predominant taxa in hiv+ samples were p. tannerae, d. pneumosintes and olsenella uli. p. tannerae, o. uli, veilonella dispar, bacteroides fragilis,  and actinomyces meyeri were significantly more abundant in hiv+ samples. conclusions: there were significant differences in the prevalence and proportions of specific microbial taxa between hiv- and hiv+ individuals. the root canal microbiota may represent a reservoir of important oral and medical pathogens, mainly in hiv+ individuals.

TI  == effect of periodontal pathogens on the metatranscriptome of a healthy multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms are highly complex microbial communities with up to 700 different bacterial taxa. we report here the use of metatranscriptomic analysis to study patterns of community gene expression in a multispecies biofilm model composed of species found in healthy oral biofilms (actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, and fusobacterium  nucleatum) and the same biofilm plus the periodontopathogens porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. the presence of the periodontopathogens altered patterns in gene expression, and data indicate that transcription of protein-encoding genes and small noncoding rnas is stimulated. in the healthy biofilm hypothetical proteins, transporters and transcriptional regulators were upregulated while chaperones and cell division proteins were downregulated. however, when the pathogens were present, chaperones were highly upregulated, probably due to increased levels of stress. we also observed a significant upregulation of abc transport systems and putative transposases. changes in clusters of orthologous groups functional categories as well as gene set enrichment analysis based on kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes (kegg) pathways showed that in the absence of pathogens, only sets of proteins related to transport and secondary metabolism were upregulated, while in the presence of  pathogens, proteins related to growth and division as well as a large portion of  transcription factors were upregulated. finally, we identified several small noncoding rnas whose predicted targets were genes differentially expressed in the open reading frame libraries. these results show the importance of pathogens controlling gene expression of a healthy oral community and the usefulness of metatranscriptomic techniques to study gene expression profiles in complex microbial community models.

TI  == [analysis of community composition in dental plaque of elder people with root caries].
AB  == objective: to analyze the community in dental plaque of elder people with root caries. methods: total dnas were extracted from the root caries dental plaques of nine elders over 60 years of age. polymerase chaid reaction-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) was used to analyze the microbial composition, dgge bands were excised from the gels for sequencing and identification. results: the dominant genus in root caries dental plaque of elder people were: acinetobacte [0.9% (1/114)], actinobaculum [1.8% (2/114)], actinomyces [15.8% (18/114)], aggregatibacter [0.9% (1/114)], capnocytophaga [14.0% (16/114)], corynebacterium [0.9% (1/114)], haemophilus [0.9% (1/114)], mobiluncus [0.9% (1/114)], naxibacter [0.9% (1/114)], neisseriaceae [10.5% (12/114)], porphyromonas [0.9% (1/114)], prevotella [12.3% (14/114)], selenomonas [6.1% (7/114)], staphylococcus [1.8% (2/114)], oralis streptococcus [6.1% (7/114)], mutans streptococcu [7.9% (9/114)], tannerella [0.9% (1/114)], treponema [1.8% (2/114)], veillonella [10.5% (12/114)] and two uncultured unknown genus [1.8% (2/114)]. uncultred genotypes accounted for 19.30% of the total. gram-positive bacteria genotype accounted for 31.6% (36/114), and gram-negative bacteria genotype accounted for 66.7% (76/114). conclusions: there were many bacteria genotypes in root caries dental plaque in the elderly, which were widely distributed. gram-negative bacteria accounted for the majority. genotype-specific pathogenic bacteria were not found.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine, listerine and fluoride listerine mouthrinses on four putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm.
AB  == objective: to investigate the effects of chlorhexidine (chx), listerine and fluoride listerine on putative root-caries pathogens in the biofilm in the artificial mouth model. methods: a total of 24 human dentine discs were prepared. a biofilm composed of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii was cultured on the surfaces of human dentine discs in an artificial-mouth model. sucrose was supplied by computer-controlled release on a daily basis to simulate the real-life situation. three treatment reagents, chx, listerine and fluoride listerine, were supplied at a flow rate of 15 ml/h for 6 min twice a day. the dentine discs with biofilm were removed from the artificial mouth after being cultured for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 days. the bacteria in the biofilm were analysed by plating on bhis agar and the colony-forming units of each species were counted. results: the total number of bacteria in the chx group was significantly lower than in the other three groups  (including control). there was no decline in the number of bacteria in the listerine group. s. mutans was reduced significantly in the chx group compared with the control group. the number and proportion of a. naeslundii in the chx group were significantly lower than in the other three groups. the proportion of  l. rhamnosus in the chx group was significantly higher than in the other three groups. conclusion: chx has the most significant effect on inhibition of the putative root-caries bacteria, with the exception of l. rhamnosus. both listerine and a combination of fluoride and listerine could not effectively reduce the numbers of bacteria in the biofilm. the effects of chx, listerine and fluoride listerine on root caries prevention need further investigation.

TI  == effect of a novel antimicrobial peptide chrysophsin-1 on oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans biofilms.
AB  == dental caries and pulpal diseases are common oral bacterial infectious diseases.  controlling and reducing the causative pathogens, such as streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis, is a key step toward prevention and treatment of the two diseases. chrysophsin-1 is a cationic antimicrobial peptide having broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we investigated the antibacterial activity of chrysophsin-1 against several oral pathogens and s. mutans biofilms and performed a preliminary study of the antimicrobial mechanism. cytotoxic activity of chrysophsin-1 against human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs) was investigated. minimal inhibitory concentration (mic), minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) and time-kill assay were used to evaluate the killing effect of chrysophsin-1. scanning electron microscopy (sem) was used to analyze morphological and membrane change in oral pathogens. live/dead staining, in conjunction with confocal scanning laser microscopy (cslm), was used to observe and analyze s. mutans biofilms. mic and mbc results demonstrated that chrysophsin-1 had different antimicrobial activities against the tested oral microbes. lysis and pore formation of the cytomembrane were observed following treatment of the bacteria with chrysophsin-1 for 4h or 24h by sem. furthermore, clsm images showed that chrysophsin-1 remarkably reduced the viability of cells within biofilms and had a significantly lethal effect against s. mutans biofilms. toxicity studies showed that chrysophsin-1 at concentration between 8 mug/ml and 32 mug/ml had little effect on viability of hgfs in 5 min. our findings suggest that chrysophsin-1 may have potential clinical applications in the prevention and treatment of dental caries and pulpal diseases.

TI  == oral microbial biofilm stimulation of epithelial cell responses.
AB  == oral bacterial biofilms trigger chronic inflammatory responses in the host that can result in the tissue destructive events of periodontitis. however, the characteristics of the capacity of specific host cell types to respond to these biofilms remain ill-defined. this report describes the use of a novel model of bacterial biofilms to stimulate oral epithelial cells and profile select cytokines and chemokines that contribute to the local inflammatory environment in the periodontium. monoinfection biofilms were developed with streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii,  fusobacterium nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses. biofilms, as well as planktonic cultures of these same bacterial  species, were incubated under anaerobic conditions with a human oral epithelial cell line, okf4, for up to 24h. gro-1alpha, il1alpha, il-6, il-8, tgfalpha, fractalkine, mip-1alpha, and ip-10 were shown to be produced in response to a range of the planktonic or biofilm forms of these species. p. gingivalis biofilms significantly inhibited the production of all of these cytokines and chemokines,  except mip-1alpha. generally, the biofilms of all species inhibited gro-1alpha, tgfalpha, and fractalkine production, while f. nucleatum biofilms stimulated significant increases in il-1alpha, il-6, il-8, and ip-10. a. naeslundii biofilms induced elevated levels of il-6, il-8 and ip-10. the oral streptococcal species in biofilms or planktonic forms were poor stimulants for any of these mediators from the epithelial cells. the results of these studies demonstrate that oral bacteria in biofilms elicit a substantially different profile of responses compared to planktonic bacteria of the same species. moreover, certain oral species are highly stimulatory when in biofilms and interact with host cell receptors to trigger pathways of responses that appear quite divergent from individual bacteria.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in adult down syndrome periodontitis.
AB  == background and objective: the subgingival microbiota in down syndrome and non-down syndrome adults receiving periodic dental care was examined for 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and the results were related to clinical periodontal attachment loss. material and methods: a total of 44 down syndrome, 66 non-down syndrome mentally retarded and 83 mentally normal adults were clinically evaluated. this involved, for each subject, the removal of subgingival specimens from three interproximal sites on different teeth; all subgingival samples per subject were then pooled and assessed for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial species using species-specific whole-genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significant group differences in species proportions averaged across subjects were evaluated using the kruskal-wallis test, and associations between subgingival species and mean subject attachment loss within down syndrome and non-down syndrome subject groups were quantified using pearson correlation and multiple linear regression analysis. results: down syndrome subjects exhibited greater attachment loss than  non-down syndrome subjects (p=0.05). most microbial species were present in down  syndrome subjects at levels similar to non-down syndrome subjects, except for higher proportions of selenomonas noxia, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus oralis in down syndrome subjects  compared with non-down syndrome study subjects, higher proportions of treponema socranskii in down syndrome subjects compared with non-down syndrome mentally retarded subjects, and higher proportions of streptococcus constellatus in down syndrome subjects compared with mentally normal subjects. down syndrome adults classified with periodontitis revealed higher subgingival levels of t. socranskii than down syndrome subjects with no periodontitis (p=0.02). higher subgingival proportions of s. constellatus, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, s. noxia  and prevotella nigrescens showed significant positive correlations (r=0.35-0.42)  and higher proportions of actinomyces naeslundii ii and actinomyces odontolyticus showed negative correlations (r=-0.36 to -0.40), with increasing mean subject attachment loss in down syndrome adults. conclusion: individuals with down syndrome show higher levels of some subgingival bacterial species and specific associations between certain subgingival bacterial species and loss of periodontal attachment. these findings are consistent with the notion that certain subgingival bacteria may contribute to the increased level of periodontal disease seen in down syndrome individuals and raise the question as to the reason for increased colonization in down syndrome.

TI  == molecular detection of in-vivo microbial contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets by checkerboard dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == introduction: knowing the microbiota that colonizes orthodontic appliances is important for planning strategies and implementing specific preventive measures during treatment. the purpose of this clinical trial was to evaluate in vivo the  contamination of metallic orthodontic brackets with 40 dna probes for different bacterial species by using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cddh) technique. methods: eighteen patients, 11 to 29 years of age having fixed orthodontic treatment, were enrolled in the study. each subject had 2 new metallic brackets bonded to different premolars in a randomized manner. after 30  days, the brackets were removed and processed for analysis by cddh. data on bacterial contamination were analyzed descriptively and with the kruskal-wallis and dunn post tests (alpha = 0.05). forty microbial species (cariogenic microorganisms, bacteria of the purple, yellow, green, orange complexes, "red complex +treponema socranskii," and the cluster of actinomyces) were assessed. results: most bacterial species were present in all subjects, except for streptococcus constellatus, campylobacter rectus, tannerella forsythia, t socranskii, and lactobacillus acidophillus (94.4%), propionibacterium acnes i and eubacterium nodatum (88.9%), and treponema denticola (77.8%). among the cariogenic microorganisms, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were found in larger numbers than l acidophillus and lactobacillus casei (p <0.001). the periodontal pathogens of the orange complex were detected in larger numbers than those of the "red complex +t socranskii" (p <0.0001). among the bacteria not associated with specific pathologies, veillonella parvula (purple complex) was the most frequently detected strain (p <0.0001). the numbers of yellow and green  complex bacteria and the cluster of actinomyces were similar (p >0.05). conclusions: metallic brackets in use for 1 month were multi-colonized by several bacterial species, including cariogenic microorganisms and periodontal pathogens, reinforcing the need for meticulous oral hygiene and additional preventive measures to maintain oral health in orthodontic patients.

TI  == profiling of dental plaque microflora on root caries lesions and the protein-denaturing activity of these bacteria.
AB  == purpose: to profile plaque microflora on root-caries lesions, and to examine the  protein-denaturing activity as a pilot study. methods: six subjects with root-caries were investigated. plaque samples on root caries lesions (r), as well as from healthy supragingival sites (s) and periodontal pockets (> or = 5 mm) (p) were collected and cultured anaerobically on blood agar plates. the isolated bacteria were identified by 16s rrna sequencing analysis, and examined for the protein-denaturing activity using the skim-milk plates and the sds-page, and for  the acidogenicity using the fab broth containing 1% glucose. results: propionibacterium, actinomyces, streptococcus, lactobacillus and bifidobacterium  were predominant in r, while actinomyces, streptococcus, veillonella and capnocytophaga in s, and actinomyces, prevotella, actinobaculum, streptococcus, olsenella and eubacterium were predominant in p. proteolytic bacteria comprised 40%, 26% and 57% of microflora in r, s and p, respectively. the skim-milk plates  distinguished between protein-degrading and protein-coagulating bacteria, which comprised 7 and 33%, 0 and 26%, and 17 and 40% of microflora, in r, s and p, respectively. the sds-page analysis revealed that protein-degrading isolates were capable of degrading collagen molecules. furthermore, the final culture phs of protein-degrading and -coagulating bacteria were 5.0-5.4 and 3.8-3.9, respectively. the latter ph was low enough to denature proteins in skim milk. the microbial composition of r was distinct from those of s and p.

TI  == evidence of a robust resident bacteriophage population revealed through analysis  of the human salivary virome.
AB  == viruses are the most abundant known infectious agents on the planet and are significant drivers of diversity in a variety of ecosystems. although there have  been numerous studies of viral communities, few have focused on viruses within the indigenous human microbiota. we analyzed 2 267 695 virome reads from viral particles and compared them with 263 516 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences from the saliva of five healthy human subjects over a 2- to 3-month period, in order to improve our understanding of the role viruses have in the complex oral ecosystem. our data reveal viral communities in human saliva dominated by bacteriophages whose constituents are temporally distinct. the preponderance of shared homologs between the salivary viral communities in two unrelated subjects  in the same household suggests that environmental factors are determinants of community membership. when comparing salivary viromes to those from human stool and the respiratory tract, each group was distinct, further indicating that habitat is of substantial importance in shaping human viromes. compared with coexisting bacteria, there was concordance among certain predicted host-virus pairings such as veillonella and streptococcus, whereas there was discordance among others such as actinomyces. we identified 122 728 virulence factor homologs, suggesting that salivary viruses may serve as reservoirs for pathogenic gene function in the oral environment. that the vast majority of human oral viruses are bacteriophages whose putative gene function signifies some have a prominent role in lysogeny, suggests these viruses may have an important role in  helping shape the microbial diversity in the human oral cavity.

TI  == effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation between oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == background: the co-aggregation of oral bacteria leads to their clearance from the oral cavity. poor oral hygiene and high saliva viscosity are common amongst the elderly; thus, they frequently suffer from pneumonia caused by the aspiration of  oral microorganisms. objectives: to examine the direct effect of saliva viscosity on the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces. materials and methods: fifteen oral streptococcal and a single actinomyces strain were used. co-aggregation was assessed by a visual assay in phosphate buffer and a spectrophotometric assay in the same buffer containing 0-60% glycerol or whole saliva. results: nine oral streptococci co-aggregated with actinomyces naeslundii atcc12104 in the visual assay and were subsequently used for the spectrophotometric analysis. all tested strains displayed a decrease in co-aggregation with increasing amounts of glycerol in the buffer. the co-aggregation of streptococcus oralis with a. naeslundii recovered to baseline level following the removal of glycerol. the per cent co-aggregation of s. oralis with a. naeslundii was significantly correlated with the viscosity in unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva samples (correlation coefficients: -0.52 and -0.48, respectively). conclusion: this study suggests that saliva viscosity affects the co-aggregation of oral streptococci with actinomyces and that bacterial co-aggregation decreases with increasing saliva viscosity.

TI  == community-based interference against integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa into human salivary microbial biofilm.
AB  == as part of the human gastrointestinal tract, the oral cavity represents a complex biological system and harbors diverse bacterial species. unlike the gut microbiota, which is often considered a health asset, studies of the oral commensal microbiota have been largely limited to their implication in oral conditions such as dental caries and periodontal disease. less emphasis has been  given to their potential beneficial roles, especially the protective effects against oral colonization by foreign or pathogenic bacteria. in this study, we used salivary microbiota derived from healthy human subjects to investigate protective effects against colonization and integration of pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic bacterial pathogen, into developing or pre-formed salivary biofilms. when co-cultivated in saliva medium, p. aeruginosa persisted in the planktonic phase, but failed to integrate into the salivary microbial community during biofilm formation. furthermore, in saliva medium supplemented with sucrose, the oral microbiota inhibited the growth of p. aeruginosa by producing lactic acid. more interestingly, while pre-formed salivary biofilms were able to prevent p. aeruginosa colonization, the same biofilms recovered from mild chlorhexidine gluconate treatment displayed a shift in microbial composition and showed a drastic reduction in protection. our study indicates that normal oral communities with balanced microbial compositions could be important in effectively preventing the integration of foreign or pathogenic bacterial species, such as p. aeruginosa.

TI  == identification of interspecies interactions affecting porphyromonas gingivalis virulence phenotypes.
AB  == background: periodontitis is recognized as a complex polymicrobial disease, however, the impact of the bacterial interactions among the 700-1,000 different species of the oral microbiota remains poorly understood. we conducted an in vitro screen for oral bacteria that mitigate selected virulence phenotypes of the important periodontal pathogen, porphyromonas gingivalis. method: we isolated and identified oral anaerobic bacteria from subgingival plaque of dental patients. when cocultured with p. gingivalis w83, specific isolates reduced the cytopathogenic effects of p. gingivalis on oral epithelial cells. result: in an initial screen of 103 subgingival isolates, we identified 19 distinct strains from nine species of bacteria (including actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, and veilonella dispar) that protect oral epithelial  cells from p. gingivalis-induced cytotoxicity. we found that some of these strains inhibited p. gingivalis growth in plate assays through the production of  organic acids, whereas some decreased the gingipain activity of p. gingivalis in  coculture or mixing experiments. conclusion: in summary, we identified 19 strains isolated from human subgingival plaque that interacted with p. gingivalis, resulting in mitigation of its cytotoxicity to oral epithelial cells, inhibition  of growth, and/or reduction of gingipain activity. understanding the mechanisms of interaction between bacteria in the oral microbial community may lead to the development of new probiotic agents and new strategies for interrupting the development of periodontal disease.

TI  == ph landscapes in a novel five-species model of early dental biofilm.
AB  == background: despite continued preventive efforts, dental caries remains the most  common disease of man. organic acids produced by microorganisms in dental plaque  play a crucial role for the development of carious lesions. during early stages of the pathogenetic process, repeated ph drops induce changes in microbial composition and favour the establishment of an increasingly acidogenic and aciduric microflora. the complex structure of dental biofilms, allowing for a multitude of different ecological environments in close proximity, remains largely unexplored. in this study, we designed a laboratory biofilm model that mimics the bacterial community present during early acidogenic stages of the caries process. we then performed a time-resolved microscopic analysis of the extracellular ph landscape at the interface between bacterial biofilm and underlying substrate. methodology/principal findings: strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus downei and actinomyces naeslundii were employed in the model. biofilms were grown in flow channels that allowed for direct microscopic analysis of the biofilms in situ. the architecture and composition of the biofilms were analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. both biofilm structure and composition were highly reproducible and showed similarity to in-vivo-grown dental plaque. we employed the ph-sensitive ratiometric probe c-snarf-4 to perform real-time microscopic analyses of the biofilm ph in response to salivary solutions containing glucose. anaerobic glycolysis in the model biofilms created a mildly acidic environment. decrease in ph in different areas of the biofilms varied, and distinct extracellular ph-microenvironments were conserved over several hours. conclusions/significance: the designed biofilm model represents a promising tool to determine the effect of potential therapeutic agents on biofilm growth, composition and extracellular ph. ratiometric ph analysis using c-snarf-4 gives detailed insight into the ph landscape of living biofilms and contributes to our general understanding of metabolic processes in in-vivo-grown bacterial biofilms.

TI  == comparative analysis of salivary bacterial microbiome diversity in edentulous infants and their mothers or primary care givers using pyrosequencing.
AB  == bacterial contribution to oral disease has been studied in young children, but there is a lack of data addressing the developmental perspective in edentulous infants. our primary objectives were to use pyrosequencing to phylogenetically characterize the salivary bacterial microbiome of edentulous infants and to make  comparisons against their mothers. saliva samples were collected from 5 edentulous infants (mean age = 4.6+/-1.2 mo old) and their mothers or primary care givers (mean age = 30.8+/-9.5 y old). salivary dna was extracted, used to generate dna amplicons of the v4-v6 hypervariable region of the bacterial 16s rdna gene, and subjected to 454-pyrosequencing. on average, over 80,000 sequences per sample were generated. high bacterial diversity was noted in the saliva of adults [1012 operational taxonomical units (otu) at 3% divergence] and infants (578 otu at 3% divergence). firmicutes, proteobacteria, actinobacteria, and fusobacteria were predominant bacterial phyla present in all samples. a total of  397 bacterial genera were present in our dataset. of the 28 genera different (p<0.05) between infants and adults, 27 had a greater prevalence in adults. the exception was streptococcus, which was the predominant genera in infant saliva (62.2% in infants vs. 20.4% in adults; p<0.05). veillonella, neisseria, rothia, haemophilus, gemella, granulicatella, leptotrichia, and fusobacterium were also predominant genera in infant samples, while haemophilus, neisseria, veillonella,  fusobacterium, oribacterium, rothia, treponema, and actinomyces were predominant  in adults. our data demonstrate that although the adult saliva bacterial microbiome had a greater otu count than infants, a rich bacterial community exists in the infant oral cavity prior to tooth eruption. streptococcus, veillonella, and neisseria are the predominant bacterial genera present in infants. further research is required to characterize the development of oral microbiota early in life and identify environmental factors that impact colonization and oral and gastrointestinal disease risk.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of nanoemulsion on cariogenic planktonic and biofilm organisms.
AB  == introduction: nanoemulsions (ne) are a unique class of disinfectants produced by  mixing a water immiscible liquid phase into an aqueous phase under high shear forces. ne have antimicrobial properties and are also effective anti-biofilm agents. materials and methods: the effectiveness of nanoemulsion and its components was determined against streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus casei by live/dead staining. in vitro antimicrobial effectiveness of nanoemulsion against  planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, actinomyces viscosus, candida albicans and mixed  culture was determined by a serial dilution technique to obtain minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). in addition, efficacy was investigated by kinetics of killing, adherence and biofilm assays. results: compared to its components, nanoemulsion showed notable antimicrobial activity against biofilm organisms, up to 83.0% kill within 1min. ne dilutions ranging from 243 to 19683 were effective against planktonic s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed culture of these four strains as shown through mic/mbc assays. ne showed antimicrobial activity against planktonic cells at high dilutions, confirmed by time kill studies. the level of  adhesion on glass surface was reduced by 94.2-99.5% in nanoemulsion treated groups (p<0.001). 4-day-old s. mutans, l. casei, a. viscosus, c. albicans and mixed cultures biofilms treated with ne showed reductions of bacterial counts with decreasing dilutions (p<0.001). conclusion: these results suggest that nanoemulsion has effective anti-cariogenic activity against cariogenic microorganisms and may be a useful medication in the prevention of caries.

TI  == in situ analysis of multispecies biofilm formation on customized titanium surfaces.
AB  == many studies to identify surfaces that enhance the incorporation of dental implants into bone and soft-tissue have been undertaken previously. however, to succeed in the clinical situation, an implant surface must not support development of microbial biofilms with a pathogenic potential. as a first step in investigating this, we used two-species and three-species biofilm models with 16s ribosomal rna fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy to examine the effect of surface characteristics on biofilm formation  by species that can colonize titanium implants in vivo: streptococcus sanguinis,  actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus salivarius. surfaces blasted with al(2)  o(3) (s(a) = 1.0-2.0 mum) showed a seven-fold higher bacterial adhesion after 2 h than turned surfaces (s(a) = 0.18 mum) whereas porous surfaces, generated by anodic oxidation (s(a) = 0.4 mum), showed four-fold greater adhesion than turned  surfaces. hence, increased roughness promoted adhesion, most likely through protection of bacteria from shear forces. chemical modification of the blasted and oxidized surfaces by incorporation of ca(2+) ions reduced adhesion compared with the corresponding non-modified surfaces. after 14 h, biofilm growth occurred in the three-species model but not in the two-species consortium (containing s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii only). the biofilm biovolume on all surfaces was similar, suggesting that the influence of surface characteristics on adhesion was compensated for by biofilm development.

TI  == two autonomous structural modules in the fimbrial shaft adhesin fima mediate actinomyces interactions with streptococci and host cells during oral biofilm development.
AB  == by combining x-ray crystallography and modelling, we describe here the atomic structure of distinct adhesive moieties of fima, the shaft fimbrillin of actinomyces type 2 fimbriae, which uniquely mediates the receptor-dependent intercellular interactions between actinomyces and oral streptococci as well as host cells during the development of oral biofilms. the fima adhesin is built with three igg-like domains, each of which harbours an intramolecular isopeptide  bond, previously described in several gram-positive pilins. genetic and biochemical studies demonstrate that although these isopeptide bonds are dispensable for fimbrial assembly, cell-cell interactions and biofilm formation,  they contribute significantly to the proteolytic stability of fima. remarkably, fima harbours two autonomous adhesive modules, which structurally resemble the staphylococcus aureus cna b domain. each isolated module can bind the plasma glycoprotein asialofetuin as well as the polysaccharide receptors present on the  surface of oral streptococci and epithelial cells. thus, fima should serve as an  excellent paradigm for the development of therapeutic strategies and elucidating  the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the interactions between cellular receptors and gram-positive fimbriae.

AB  == objective: the purpose of this study was to quantify nine selected cariogenic bacteria in plaque from sound root surfaces and initial carious root lesions using taqman pcr and to analyse a putative dependence on the kind of initial periodontal treatment. material and methods: fifty-four subjects with generalized chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to one of the following initial periodontal therapies: full-mouth disinfection, full-mouth scaling and root planing or scaling and root planing within 7 days. plaque samples were taken before and after periodontal treatment and analysed by taqman pcr. results: the quantity of the cariogenic bacteria actinomyces spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacilllus spp., rothia dentocariosa, parvimonas micra, propionibacterium acnes and neisseria mucosa were significantly higher, while the quantity of veillonella parvula was significantly lower on initial carious lesions than on the sound surfaces both before and after periodontal therapy. no significant differences could be found in any of the tested bacteria  except p. micra on initial carious lesions and sound surfaces for both examinations between the groups. conclusion: all the nine species analysed were found to be present in initial carious root lesions as well as sound root surfaces but in different quantities, independent of the different periodontal therapies.

TI  == garlic allicin as a potential agent for controlling oral pathogens.
AB  == garlic has been used medicinally throughout human history. allicin is considered  the most therapeutic constituent of garlic. this study tested the antimicrobial activity of garlic allicin on oral pathogens associated with dental caries and periodontitis. allicin was found effective against all the tested bacteria. the broth dilution method revealed that planktonic growth of the cariogenic, gram-positive species streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, and actinomyces oris was inhibited by an allicin concentration of 600 mug/ml or higher. planktonic growth  of the tested gram-negative periopathogenic species aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and fusobacterium nucleatum was inhibited by a minimum allicin concentration of 300 mug/ml. porphyromonas gingivalis, an anaerobic, gram-negative pathogen and the bacterium most associated with chronic periodontitis, demonstrated the lowest sensitivity to allicin (2,400 mug/ml). gel zymography and the synthetic chromogenic substrate n(alpha)-benzoyl-l-arginine 4-nitroanilide hydrochloride demonstrated that allicin inhibits the proteases of  p. gingivalis, including the arginine and lysine gingipains known as major virulence factors of this organism. a gingipain-inactivated mutant demonstrated high sensitivity to allicin (<300 mug/ml), revealing that gingipains confer resistance to allicin. live/dead staining followed by analysis with confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that allicin was bactericidal to s. mutans grown in mature biofilms. however, this bactericidal effect was reduced as biofilm depth increased. in conclusion, these results support the traditional medicinal use of garlic and suggest the use of allicin for alleviating dental diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial penetration and efficacy in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == the penetration and overall efficacy of six mouthrinse actives was evaluated by using an in vitro flow cell oral biofilm model. the technique involved preloading biofilm cells with a green fluorescent dye that leaked out as the cells were permeabilized by a treatment. the loss of green color, and of biomass, was observed by time-lapse microscopy during 60 min of treatment under continuous flow conditions. the six actives analyzed were ethanol, sodium lauryl sulfate, triclosan, chlorhexidine digluconate (chx), cetylpyridinium chloride, and nisin.  each of these agents effected loss of green fluorescence throughout biofilm cell  clusters, with faster action at the edge of a cell cluster and slower action in the cluster center. the time to reach half of the initial fluorescent intensity at the center of a cell cluster, which can be viewed as a combined penetration and biological action time, ranged from 0.6 to 19 min for the various agents. these times are much longer than the predicted penetration time based on diffusion alone, suggesting that anti-biofilm action was controlled more by the biological action time than by the penetration time of the active. none of the agents tested caused any removal of the biofilm. the extent of fluorescence loss  after 1 h of exposure to an active ranged from 87 to 99.5%, with chx being the most effective. the extent of fluorescence loss in vitro, but not penetration and action time, correlated well with the relative efficacy data from published clinical trials.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of gel-entrapped catechins toward oral microorganisms.
AB  == the oral cavity contains almost half of the commensal bacterial population present in the human body. an increase in the number of these microorganisms may  result in systemic diseases such as infective endocarditis and aspiration pneumonia as well as oral infections. it is essential to control the total numbers of these microorganisms in order to suppress disease onset. thus, we examined the antimicrobial activity of a newly developed gel-entrapped catechin (gec) preparation against oral microorganisms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of gec was determined based on the relationship between a modified agar diffusion method and a broth microdilution method. gec inhibited the growth of the actinomyces, periodontopathic bacteria and candida strains tested, but did not inhibit the growth of the oral streptococci that are important in the normal oral flora. commercially available moisture gels containing antimicrobial components showed antimicrobial activity against all of  the tested strains. after a series of washes and after a 24-h incubation, gec retained the antimicrobial activity of the catechins. catalase prevented gec-induced growth inhibition of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans  suggesting that hydrogen peroxide may be involved in the antimicrobial activity of catechins. these results suggest that gec may be useful for controlling oral microorganism populations and reducing the accumulation of dental plaque, thereby helping to prevent periodontal disease and oral candidiasis.

TI  == effects of compounds found in nidus vespae on the growth and cariogenic virulence factors of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == nidus vespae (honeycomb) is a kind of traditional chinese medicine that has been  demonstrated to inhibit the growth and acid-production of oral cariogenic bacteria. subsequent studies showed that the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) chemical extraction of nidus vespae was the most effective inhibitor of growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans. in this study, we isolated the chemical compounds of the nidus vespae chl/meoh extraction, tested their antimicrobial activity against six cariogenic bacteria and further evaluated the  acid inhibition properties, anti-f-atpase activity and anti-ldh activity against  s. mutans. the isolated flavonoids, quercetin and kaempferol, inhibited the growth of bacteria (s. mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus) with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/ml and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) from 4 to 16 mg/ml. in addition, quercetin and kaempferol at sub-mic levels significantly inhibited acidogenicity and acidurity  of s. mutans cells. treated with the test agents, the f-atpase activity was reduced by 47.37% with 1mg/ml quercetin and by 49.66% with 0.5mg/ml kaempferol. the results showed that quercetin and kaempferol contained in chl/meoh extraction presented remarkably biological activity, suggesting that nidus vespae might be useful as a potential preventive and therapeutic agent in dental caries.

TI  == influences of trans-trans farnesol, a membrane-targeting sesquiterpenoid, on streptococcus mutans physiology and survival within mixed-species oral biofilms.
AB  == trans-trans farnesol (tt-farnesol) is a bioactive sesquiterpene alcohol commonly  found in propolis (a beehive product) and citrus fruits, which disrupts the ability of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) to form virulent biofilms. in this study, we investigated whether tt-farnesol affects cell-membrane function, acid production and/or acid tolerance by planktonic cells and biofilms of s. mutans ua159. furthermore, the influence of the agent on s. mutans gene expression and ability to form biofilms in the presence of other oral bacteria (streptococcus oralis (s. oralis) 35037 and actinomyces naeslundii (a. naeslundii) 12104) was also examined. in general, tt-farnesol (1 mmol x l(-1)) significantly increased the membrane proton permeability and reduced glycolytic activity of s. mutans in  the planktonic state and in biofilms (p < 0.05). moreover, topical applications of 1 mmol x l(-1) tt-farnesol twice daily (1 min exposure/treatment) reduced biomass accumulation and prevented ecological shifts towards s. mutans dominance  within mixed-species biofilms after introduction of 1% sucrose. s. oralis (a non-cariogenic organism) became the major species after treatments with tt-farnesol, whereas vehicle-treated biofilms contained mostly s. mutans (>90% of total bacterial population). however, the agent did not affect significantly the  expression of s. mutans genes involved in acidogenicity, acid tolerance or polysaccharide synthesis in the treated biofilms. our data indicate that tt-farnesol may affect the competitiveness of s. mutans in a mixed-species environment by primarily disrupting the membrane function and physiology of this  bacterium. this naturally occurring terpenoid could be a potentially useful adjunctive agent to the current anti-biofilm/anti-caries chemotherapeutic strategies.

TI  == novel model for multispecies biofilms that uses rigid gas-permeable lenses.
AB  == oral biofilms comprise complex multispecies consortia aided by specific inter- and intraspecies interactions occurring among commensals and pathogenic bacterial species. oral biofilms are primary initiating factors of periodontal disease, although complex multifactorial biological influences, including host cell responses, contribute to the individual outcome of the disease. to provide a system to study initial stages of interaction between oral biofilms and the host  cells that contribute to the disease process, we developed a novel in vitro model system to grow biofilms on rigid gas-permeable contact lenses (rgpls), which enable oxygen to permeate through the lens material. bacterial species belonging  to early- and late-colonizing groups were successfully established as single- or  three-species biofilms, with each group comprising streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus sanguinis; s. gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum; or s. gordonii, f. nucleatum, and porphyromonas gingivalis. quantification of biofilm numbers by quantitative pcr (qpcr) revealed substantial differences in the magnitude of bacterial numbers in  single-species and multispecies biofilms. we evaluated cell-permeable conventional nucleic acid stains acridine orange, hexidium iodide, and hoechst 33258 and novel syto red, blue, and green fluorochromes for their effect on bacterial viability and fluorescence yield to allow visualization of the aggregates of individual bacterial species by confocal laser scanning microscopy  (clsm). substantial differences in the quantity and distribution of the species in the multispecies biofilms were identified. the specific features of these biofilms may help us better understand the role of various bacteria in local challenge of oral tissues.

AB  == all bacteria, both pathogenic and saprophytic, are unicellular organisms that reproduce by binary fission. most bacteria are capable of independent metabolic existence and growth, but species of chlamydia and rickettsia are obligately intracellular organisms. bacterial cells are extremely small and are most conveniently measured in microns (10-6 m). they range in size from large cells such as bacillus anthracis (1.0 to 1.3 microm x 3 to 10 microm) to very small cells such as pasteurella tularensis (0.2 x 0.2 to 0.7 microm) mycoplasmas (atypical pneumonia group) are even smaller, measuring 0.1 to 0.2 microm in diameter. bacteria therefore have a surface-to-volume ratio that is very high: about 100,000. bacteria have characteristic shapes. the common microscopic morphologies are cocci (round or ellipsoidal cells, such as staphylococcus aureus or streptococcus, respectively); rods, such as bacillus and clostridium species;  long, filamentous branched cells, such as actinomyces species; and comma-shaped and spiral cells, such as vibrio cholerae and treponema pallidum, respectively. the arrangement of cells is also typical of various species or groups of bacteria (fig. 2-1). some rods or cocci characteristically grow in chains; some, such as staphylococcus aureus, form grapelike clusters of spherical cells; some round cocci form cubic packets. bacterial cells of other species grow separately. the microscopic appearance is therefore valuable in classification and diagnosis. the higher resolving power of the electron microscope not only magnifies the typical  shape of a bacterial cell but also clearly resolves its prokaryotic organization  (fig. 2-2).

AB  == it has become increasingly recognized that groups of microorganisms interact within the subgingival plaque of adult subjects with periodontitis. it is much less clear, however, whether the consortia of microorganisms associated with periodontitis are different in early and more advanced cases of periodontitis. to investigate this point further, subgingival plaque was collected from six sites in 87 adolescents with periodontitis and 73 controls and the samples were analyzed for the detection of 18 microbial species using the dna-dna hybridization technique. actinomyces oris accounted for the highest proportion of the flora and was more predominant among controls. prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and tannerella forsythia were present at higher levels among the subjects with periodontitis. factor analyses identified one factor characterized by highly positive loadings for t. forsythia, campylobacter rectus, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, parvimonas micra, and treponema denticola, and another factor characterized by highly positive loadings of a. oris, capnocytophaga ochracea, eikenella corrodens, streptococcus intermedius, selenomonas noxia, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, and veillonella parvula. aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans and streptococcus mutans did not load on any of the two factors, while fusobacterium  nucleatum loaded on both. these findings confirm the occurrence of clustering of  subgingival bacteria according to case status also among young individuals.

TI  == modeling of diffusion transport through oral biofilms with the inverse problem method.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to develop a mathematical model to quantitatively describe the passive transport of macromolecules within dental biofilms. methodology: fluorescently labeled dextrans with different molecular mass (3 kd, 10 kd, 40 kd, 70 kd, 2000 kd) were used as a series of diffusion probes. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces naeslundii and fusobacterium nucleatum were used as inocula for biofilm formation. the diffusion processes of different probes through the in vitro biofilm were recorded with a confocal laser microscope. results: mathematical function of biofilm penetration  was constructed on the basis of the inverse problem method. based on this function, not only the relationship between average concentration of steady-state and molecule weights can be analyzed, but also that between penetrative time and  molecule weights. conclusion: this can be used to predict the effective concentration and the penetrative time of anti-biofilm medicines that can diffuse through oral biofilm. furthermore, an improved model for large molecule is proposed by considering the exchange time at the upper boundary of the dental biofilm.

TI  == effect of nanoporous tio2 coating and anodized ca2+ modification of titanium surfaces on early microbial biofilm formation.
AB  == background: the soft tissue around dental implants forms a barrier between the oral environment and the peri-implant bone and a crucial factor for long-term success of therapy is development of a good abutment/soft-tissue seal. sol-gel derived nanoporous tio2 coatings have been shown to enhance soft-tissue attachment but their effect on adhesion and biofilm formation by oral bacteria is unknown. methods: we have investigated how the properties of surfaces that may be used on abutments: turned titanium, sol-gel nanoporous tio2 coated surfaces and anodized ca2+ modified surfaces, affect biofilm formation by two early colonizers of the oral cavity: streptococcus sanguinis and actinomyces naeslundii. the bacteria were detected using 16s rrna fluorescence in situ hybridization together with confocal laser scanning microscopy. results: interferometry and atomic force microscopy revealed all the surfaces to be smooth (sa</=0.22 mum). incubation with a consortium of s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii showed no differences in adhesion between the surfaces over 2 hours. after 14 hours, the level of biofilm  growth was low and again, no differences between the surfaces were seen. the presence of saliva increased the biofilm biovolume of s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii ten-fold compared to when saliva was absent and this was due to increased adhesion rather than biofilm growth. conclusions: nano-topographical modification of smooth titanium surfaces had no effect on adhesion or early biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and a. naeslundii as compared to turned surfaces or those treated with anodic oxidation in the presence of ca2+. the presence of saliva led to a significantly greater biofilm biovolume but no significant differences were seen between the test surfaces. these data thus suggest that modification with sol-gel derived nanoporous tio2, which has been shown to improve osseointegration and soft-tissue healing in vivo, does not cause greater biofilm formation by the two oral commensal species tested than the other surfaces.

TI  == rna-oligonucleotide quantification technique (roqt) for the enumeration of uncultivated bacterial species in subgingival biofilms.
AB  == approximately 35% of the species present in subgingival biofilms are as yet uncultivated, so their role in periodontal pathogenesis is unknown. the aim of the present study was to develop a high throughput method to quantify a wide range of cultivated and uncultivated taxa in subgingival biofilm samples associated with periodontal disease or health. oligonucleotides targeting the 16s ribosomal dna gene were designed, synthesized and labeled with digoxigenin. these probes were hybridized with the total nucleic acids of pure cultures or subgingival biofilm samples. target species included cultivated taxa associated with periodontal health and disease, as well as uncultivated species, such as tm7 sp. ot 346, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041. sensitivity and  specificity of the probes were determined. a universal probe was used to assess total bacterial load. sequences complementary to the probes were used as standards for quantification. chemiluminescent signals were visualized after film exposure or using a ccd camera. in a pilot clinical study, 266 subgingival plaque samples from eight periodontally healthy people and 11 patients with periodontitis were examined. probes were specific and sensitivity reached 10(4) cells. fusobacterium nucleatum ss. polymorphum and actinomyces gerencseriae were  the most abundant cultivated taxa in clinical samples. among uncultivated/unrecognized species, mitsuokella sp. ot 131 and prevotella sp. ot 306 were the most numerous. porphyromonas gingivalis and desulfobulbus sp. ot 041 were only detected in patients with periodontitis. direct hybridization of total  nucleic acids using oligonucleotide probes permitted the quantification of multiple cultivated and uncultivated taxa in mixed species biofilm samples.

TI  == systems-level analysis of microbial community organization through combinatorial  labeling and spectral imaging.
AB  == microbes in nature frequently function as members of complex multitaxon communities, but the structural organization of these communities at the micrometer level is poorly understood because of limitations in labeling and imaging technology. we report here a combinatorial labeling strategy coupled with spectral image acquisition and analysis that greatly expands the number of fluorescent signatures distinguishable in a single image. as an imaging proof of  principle, we first demonstrated visualization of escherichia coli labeled by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) with 28 different binary combinations of eight fluorophores. as a biological proof of principle, we then applied this combinatorial labeling and spectral imaging fish (clasi-fish) strategy using genus- and family-specific probes to visualize simultaneously and differentiate 15 different phylotypes in an artificial mixture of laboratory-grown microbes. we then illustrated the utility of our method for the structural analysis of a natural microbial community, namely, human dental plaque, a microbial biofilm. we demonstrate that 15 taxa in the plaque community can be imaged simultaneously and analyzed and that this community was dominated by early colonizers, including species of streptococcus, prevotella, actinomyces, and veillonella. proximity analysis was used to determine the frequency of inter- and intrataxon cell-to-cell associations which revealed statistically significant intertaxon pairings. cells of the genera prevotella and actinomyces showed the most interspecies associations, suggesting a central role for these genera in establishing and maintaining biofilm complexity. the results provide an initial systems-level structural analysis of biofilm organization.

TI  == the effect of xylitol on the composition of the oral flora: a pilot study.
AB  == objectives: our aim was to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the microbial composition of plaque and saliva. methods: twelve volunteers (22-38 yrs) harboring mutans streptococci (ms) participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum contained 65% xylitol while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol and 2% maltitol w/w. the polyol dose was approximately 6 g/day. stimulated saliva and plaque samples were collected before and after the two four-week test periods. the samples were cultured for ms, total streptococci, lactobacilli, and total facultatives. a part of the samples were subjected to dna-dna hybridizations of 14 microbial plaque species: actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, l. fermentum, l. paracasei, l. rhamnose, l. plantarum, streptococcus gordonii, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, veillonella parvula. results: the ms counts of the plaque samples collected from "caries-prone" tooth sites decreased significantly (p<.01) in the  xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. also the plaque ms percentage decreased significantly in the xylitol gum group (p<.01). the salivary ms counts did not decrease either in the xylitol or in the sorbitol gum groups. nor were changes detected in the salivary levels of total streptococci or lactobacilli. the dna-dna hybridization assay revealed no study-induced changes in the microbial composition of the dental plaque. conclusions: within the limitations of this pilot study, xylitol consumption reduced ms counts in plaque  but appeared not to affect the microbial composition of plaque or saliva in general.

TI  == influence of salvadora persica (miswak) extract on physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement.
AB  == aim: to investigate physical and antimicrobial properties of glass ionomer cement (gic) combined with salvadora persica extract (spe). methods: spe was added to gic (fuji ix) in concentrations of 1%, 2% and 4% w/w. the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength were measured at 1 h, 24 h and 7 days. the antimicrobial effect was tested in agar dilution assay in blood agar plates with  candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii as test organisms. gic containing 5% chlorhexidine served as positive control. results: significant differences were found for the compressive strength and diametral tensile strength as a result of adding spe to gic (p<0.05). gic with 2 or 4 % spe was significantly weaker than the gic control, while gic with 1% spe was not different from the control. the mean values for the 4% spe-containing specimens and the gic control group ranged from 108.7mpa to 141.1mpa for cs and from 8.2mpa to 12.5mpa for dts. the 1% spe-containing specimens were not different in physical properties compared to the control gic specimens; the 2% spe-containing  specimens were statistically slightly less strong (p<0.05), but within an acceptable range. as compared with pure gic the antimicrobial properties of the spe-containing specimens were increased significantly (p<0.01). it has been found up to a 2-fold increased inhibition compared to the gic with increasing concentrations of spe. for most microorganisms tested the spe group inhibited less than chlorhexidine, but significantly better than pure gic (p<0.01). conclusion: spe could be a promising natural material as an additive to gics. further studies should include in vivo tests and other antimicrobial and physical properties of this combination.

TI  == an in vitro comparative study determining bactericidal activity of stabilized chlorine dioxide and other oral rinses.
AB  == objective: the study was conducted to determine the bactericidal activity of a stabilized chlorine dioxide oral rinse (closys oral rinse) compared to products currently available on the market. methods: oral bacteria associated with gingivitis and periodontitis were exposed to rinses for one minute and five minutes. the numbers of colony forming units per milliliter (cfu/ml) were measured prior to and following exposure to determine the bactericidal activity.  results: as expected, listerine and crest pro-health demonstrated complete kill on all bacteria exposed within one minute. breath rx exhibited the weakest levels of bactericidal effects overall. closys and chlorhexidine rinses proved identical 100% kills against the periodontal pathogens at five minutes; in some cases, closys oral rinse achieved a higher kill at the one-minute mark over the chlorhexidine rinse. conclusion: the results demonstrated that closys oral rinse  has potential for providing a therapeutic benefit, making it an attractive option to induce compliance in patients concerned about taste and tooth discoloration during oral health therapy.

TI  == cultivable anaerobic microbiota of severe early childhood caries.
AB  == severe early childhood caries (ecc), while strongly associated with streptococcus mutans using selective detection (culture, pcr), has also been associated with a  widely diverse microbiota using molecular cloning approaches. the aim of this study was to evaluate the microbiota of severe ecc using anaerobic culture. the microbial composition of dental plaque from 42 severe ecc children was compared with that of 40 caries-free children. bacterial samples were cultured anaerobically on blood and acid (ph 5) agars. isolates were purified, and partial sequences for the 16s rrna gene were obtained from 5,608 isolates. sequence-based analysis of the 16s rrna isolate libraries from blood and acid agars of severe ecc and caries-free children had >90% population coverage, with greater diversity occurring in the blood isolate library. isolate sequences were compared with taxon sequences in the human oral microbiome database (homd), and 198 homd taxa were identified, including 45 previously uncultivated taxa, 29 extended homd taxa, and 45 potential novel groups. the major species associated with severe ecc included streptococcus mutans, scardovia wiggsiae, veillonella parvula, streptococcus cristatus, and actinomyces gerensceriae. s. wiggsiae was significantly associated with severe ecc children in the presence and absence of  s. mutans detection. we conclude that anaerobic culture detected as wide a diversity of species in ecc as that observed using cloning approaches. culture coupled with 16s rrna identification identified over 74 isolates for human oral taxa without previously cultivated representatives. the major caries-associated species were s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, the latter of which is a candidate as a newly recognized caries pathogen.

TI  == microbial communities of the upper respiratory tract and otitis media in children.
AB  == streptococcus pneumoniae asymptomatically colonizes the upper respiratory tract of children and is a frequent cause of otitis media. patterns of microbial colonization likely influence s. pneumoniae colonization and otitis media susceptibility. this study compared microbial communities in children with and without otitis media. nasal swabs and clinical and demographic data were collected in a cross-sectional study of philadelphia, pa, children (6 to 78 months) (n=108) during the 2008-2009 winter respiratory virus season. swabs were  cultured for s. pneumoniae. dna was extracted from the swabs; 16s rrna gene hypervariable regions (v1 and v2) were pcr amplified and sequenced by roche/454 life sciences pyrosequencing. microbial communities were described using the shannon diversity and evenness indices. principal component analysis (pca) was used to group microbial community taxa into four factors representing correlated  taxa. of 108 children, 47 (44%) were colonized by s. pneumoniae, and 25 (23%) were diagnosed with otitis media. microbial communities with s. pneumoniae were significantly less diverse and less even. two pca factors were associated with a  decreased risk of pneumococcal colonization and otitis media, as follows: one factor included potentially protective flora (corynebacterium and dolosigranulum), and the other factor included propionibacterium, lactococcus, and staphylococcus. the remaining two pca factors were associated with an increased risk of otitis media. one factor included haemophilus, and the final factor included actinomyces, rothia, neisseria, and veillonella. generally, these taxa are not considered otitis media pathogens but may be important in the causal pathway. increased understanding of upper respiratory tract microbial communities will contribute to the development of otitis media treatment and prevention strategies.

TI  == structure, viability and bacterial kinetics of an in vitro biofilm model using six bacteria from the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == background and objective: there are few in vitro models available in the scientific literature for study of the structure, formation and development of the subgingival biofilm. the purpose of this study was to develop and validate an in vitro biofilm model, using representative selected bacteria from the subgingival microbiota. material and methods: six standard reference strains were used to develop biofilms over sterile ceramic calcium hydroxyapatite discs coated with saliva within the wells of presterilized polystyrene tissue culture plates.  the selected species represent initial (streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii), early (veillonella parvula), secondary (fusobacterium nucleatum) and late colonizers (porphyromonas gingivalis and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans). the structure of the biofilm obtained was studied using a vital fluorescence technique in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy. the biofilm bacterial kinetics were studied by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. results: after 12 h, initial and early colonizers were the first microorganisms detected adhering to the calcium hydroxyapatite discs. the intermediate colonizer f. nucleatum was not detected in the model until 24 h of incubation. late colonizers a. actinomycetemcomitans and  p. gingivalis could be measured inside the biofilm after 48 h. the biofilm reached its steady state between 72 and 96 h after inoculation, with bacterial vitality increasing from the hydroxyapatite surface to the central part of the biofilm. conclusion: an in vitro biofilm model was developed and validated, demonstrating a pattern of bacterial colonization and maturation similar to the in vivo development of the subgingival biofilm.

TI  == an antimicrobial effect from silver-coated toothbrush heads.
AB  == purpose: to examine the antimicrobial effect of silver-coated toothbrush heads in vitro. methods: comparisons were made between 62 silver-coated and 62 non-coated  toothbrush heads which were contaminated by different standardized microbial suspensions. the following microorganisms were investigated: streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, lactobacillus casei and candida albicans. for cultivation of the microorganisms as well as for the subsequent determination of the colony forming units (cfus), columbia blood agar plates or sabouraud agar were used. the cycle of daily toothbrushing was imitated by rinsing the brushes with 200 ml sterile tap water to reduce the number of microorganisms and the brushes were then placed upright to allow drying overnight. colony counts were done initially (time 0) and again at 20 hours. the rinsing fluid was also examined in order to determine the decrease of microorganisms due to this step. all experiments were done twice and  the means were calculated and statistically evaluated. results: there was no significant reduction in cfus by silver-coated toothbrushes (p > 0.05) for all of the microorganisms tested. on the contrary, the colony counts for s. sanguis (p = 0.02) and c. albicans (p = 0.01) were significantly higher on silver-coated toothbrushes compared to the controls. silver-coating in the current form did not improve any antimicrobial effects against residual bacteria present on the toothbrush head.

TI  == efficacy of natural antimicrobials in toothpaste formulations against oral biofilms in vitro.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the antimicrobial efficacies of two toothpaste formulations containing natural antimicrobials (herbal extracts and chitosan) against oral biofilms of different composition and maturational status. methods:  bacteria from a buffer suspension or fresh saliva were adhered for 2h to a salivary conditioning film and subsequently grown for 16h. dual-species biofilms  were prepared from actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, whilst multi-species biofilms were grown from freshly collected human saliva. biofilms were exposed to 25wt% toothpaste supernatants. a chlorhexidine-containing mouthrinse and a buffer were used as positive- and negative-controls, respectively. antibacterial efficacy was concluded from acute  killing, bacterial removal, prevention of bacterial re-deposition and continued killing during re-deposition. results: the herbal- and chitosan-based supernatants showed immediate killing of oral biofilm bacteria, comparable with chlorhexidine. moreover, exposure of a biofilm to these supernatants or chlorhexidine, yielded ongoing killing of biofilm bacteria after exposure during  re-deposition of bacteria to a matured 16h biofilm, but not to a much thinner initial biofilm formed by 2h adhesion only. this suggests that thicker, more matured biofilms can absorb and release oral antimicrobials. conclusions: supernatants based on herbal- and chitosan-based toothpastes have comparable immediate and ongoing antibacterial efficacies as chlorhexidine. natural antimicrobials and chlorhexidine absorb in oral biofilms which contributes to their substantive action.

TI  == development of a novel multi-triplex qpcr method for the assessment of bacterial  community structure in oral populations.
AB  == gingivitis and dental caries are two of the most predominant diseases in humans.  both conditions are easily treated with the removal of the plaque biofilm by brushing or the use of oral hygiene products. in both cases, pathogenic taxa found within the plaque biofilm are the causal agents of the disease. actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum and prevotalla intermedia have all been implicated in the development of gingivitis, while streptococcus mutans is the main organism associated with dental caries. many studies have so far focused on  the use of culture methods to detect and enumerate the pathogenic taxa within plaque samples. however, these methods are both labour intensive and biased towards culturable taxa. in the present study, a novel high-throughput multi-triplex quantitative pcr method was developed with the aim to investigate the community dynamics associated with oral communities. three triplex assays were designed targeting taxa associated with gingivitis and dental caries as well as oral health. saliva samples collected from healthy individuals were used in order to validate the newly developed method.

TI  == proteases of an early colonizer can hinder streptococcus mutans colonization in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is the primary cariogen that produces several virulence factors that are modulated by a competence-stimulating peptide (csp) signaling system. in this study, we sought to determine if proteases produced by early dental plaque colonizers such as streptococcus gordonii interfere with the subsequent colonization of s. mutans bm71 on the existing streptococcal biofilms. we demonstrated that s. mutans bm71 colonized much less efficiently in vitro on streptococcal biofilms than on actinomyces naeslundii biofilms. several oral streptococci, relative to a. naeslundii, produced proteases that inactivated the  s. mutans csp. we further demonstrated that cell protein extracts from s. gordonii, but not from a. naeslundii, interfered with s. mutans bm71 colonization. in addition, s. mutans bm71 colonized more efficiently on the sgc protease knockout mutant of s. gordonii than on the parent biofilms. in conclusion, proteases of early colonizers can interfere with subsequent colonization by s. mutans in vitro.

TI  == oxygen tension modulates the cytokine response of oral epithelium to periodontal  bacteria.
AB  == background: there is an inverse relationship between pocket depth and pocket oxygen tension with deep pockets being associated with anaerobic bacteria. however, little is known about how the host tissues respond to bacteria under differing oxygen tensions within the periodontal pocket. aim: to investigate the  effect of different oxygen tensions upon nuclear factor-kappa b (nf-kappab) activation and the inflammatory cytokine response of oral epithelial cells when exposed to nine species of oral bacteria. materials and methods: h400 oral epithelial cells were equilibrated at 2%, 10% or 21% oxygen. cells were stimulated with heat-killed oral bacteria at multiplicity of infection 10:1, escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (15 mug/ml) or vehicle control. interleukin-8 (il-8) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and nf-kappab activation was measured by reporter vector or by immunohistochemical analysis. results: tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia elicited the greatest epithelial nf-kappab activation and cytokine responses. an oxygen-tension-dependent trend in cytokine production was observed with the highest il-8 and tnf-alpha production observed at 2% oxygen and lowest at 21% oxygen. conclusions: these data demonstrate a greater pro-inflammatory host response and cell signalling response to bacteria present in more anaerobic conditions, and hypersensitivity of epithelial cells to pro-inflammatory stimuli  at 2% oxygen, which may have implications for disease pathogenesis and/or therapy.

AB  == introduction: the purpose of this study was to determine bactericidal efficacy of 0.04% stabilized chlorine dioxide, 3% sodium hypochlorite, 2% chlorhexidine gluconate, and sterile distilled water in a polymicrobial biofilm model. methods: roots of 35 permanent bovine incisors had pulps extirpated, and their apical size and root length were standardized. teeth were coated with mucin, inoculated with  standardized suspensions of streptococcus sanguinis, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and prevotella nigrescens and incubated anaerobically. teeth were randomly divided into four groups and rinsed  for 3 minutes with 15 ml of irrigant. biofilms were harvested and spiral-plated on selective media. numbers of bacteria in the harvested biofilms was determined  via the standard spiral-plating methodology. treatment groups were evaluated using the nonparametric kruskal-wallis procedure. pair-wise comparisons among the four groups and five organisms were made using the wilcoxon-mann-whitney procedure. adjustments for multiple comparisons were made using the holm method with p < 0.05. results: results provide strong evidence of a significant difference in levels of bactericidal activity associated with the type of irrigant for all five bacterial species tested. levels of bactericidal activity were significantly higher for the naocl group than for the stabilized chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) group for s. sanguinis, a. viscosus, and p. nigrescens. results  for f. nucleatum and p. micros were not significant after the adjustment for multiple comparisons. conclusions: the triple-inoculation bovine tooth model system is a robust, consistent, and reproducible model system to study polymicrobial biofilms. it should be used with the knowledge expansion of biofilm structure and function as well as the development of antimicrobial protocols.

TI  == effect of biofilm on the repair bond strengths of composites.
AB  == composite restorations degrade during wear, but it is unknown how wear affects the composite surface and influences composite-to-composite bonding in minimally  invasive repair. here, it is hypothesized that in vitro exposure of composites to oral biofilm yields clinically relevant degradation of composite surfaces, and its influence on composite-to-composite bonding is determined. biofilms on composite surfaces in vitro increased their roughness and decreased filler particle exposure, except for a microhybrid composite, similar to effects of clinical wear in palatal appliances. failure shear stresses after intermediate-adhesive-resin application were significantly lower after aging by in vitro exposure to biofilms, while silica-coating maintained the same failure stress levels as in non-aged composites. failure modes were predominantly cohesive after silica-coating, while intermediate-adhesive-resin application yielded more adhesive failure. it is concluded that in vitro exposure to oral biofilm is a clinically relevant aging condition, and that silica-coating is to be preferred for the repair of aged composites.

AB  == this study aimed to detect differences in the richness of total supragingival plaque microbiota as well as the species composition of oral streptococci involved in the different stages of dental caries. forty-five plaque samples were collected from caries-moderate (cm, 4 </= dmfs </= 6), caries-susceptible (cs, dmfs >/= 10), and age-matched caries-free children separately. total dna was isolated directly from each sample, and polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) analyses using universal and primers specific for oral streptococci were carried out. using 16s rdna pcr-dgge, 34 different species of bacteria were identified in a culture-independent manner and classified into 11 genera according to phylogenetic analysis. among them, mitis group streptococci and campylobacter, which were present in health status, no longer appeared in caries-susceptible samples. in addition, capnocytophaga, burkholderia, and prevotella were found significantly less frequently in the cs group samples (p < 0.05), while there were no significant differences among the prevalence of neisseria, leptotrichia, haemophilus, mutans group streptococci, corynebacterium, and actinomyces in the three groups. further dgge analysis of rnpb gene amplicons obtained with oral streptococci species-specific primers showed that a total of 23 species of oral streptococci were identified. streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus oralis showed a significantly higher prevalence in healthy children (p < 0.05), while that of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus did not vary among the three groups. overall, these results suggest that supragingival plaque microbiota as a  whole undergoes a more complicated shift in the caries process.

TI  == metabolomics of supragingival plaque and oral bacteria.
AB  == dental caries is initiated by demineralization of the tooth surface through acid  production by sugar metabolism of supragingival plaque microflora. to elucidate the sugar metabolic system, we used ce-ms to perform metabolomics of the central  carbon metabolism, the emp pathway, the pentose-phosphate pathway, and the tca cycle in supra- gingival plaque and representative oral bacteria, streptococcus and actinomyces. supragingival plaque contained all the targeted metabolites in the central carbon metabolism, except erythrose 4-phosphate in the pentose-phosphate pathway. after glucose rinse, glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and pyruvate  in the emp pathway and 6-phosphogluconate, ribulose 5-phosphate, and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate in the pentose-phosphate pathway, and acetyl coa were increased. meanwhile, 3-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate in the emp pathway and succinate, fumarate, and malate in the tca cycle were decreased. these pathways and changes in metabolites observed in supragingival plaque were similar to the integration of metabolite profiles in streptococcus and actinomyces.

TI  == the role of bacteria in the caries process: ecological perspectives.
AB  == dental biofilms produce acids from carbohydrates that result in caries. according to the extended caries ecological hypothesis, the caries process consists of 3 reversible stages. the microflora on clinically sound enamel surfaces contains mainly non-mutans streptococci and actinomyces, in which acidification is mild and infrequent. this is compatible with equilibrium of the demineralization/remineralization balance or shifts the mineral balance toward net mineral gain (dynamic stability stage). when sugar is supplied frequently, acidification becomes moderate and frequent. this may enhance the acidogenicity and acidurance of the non-mutans bacteria adaptively. in addition, more aciduric  strains, such as 'low-ph' non-mutans streptococci, may increase selectively. these microbial acid-induced adaptation and selection processes may, over time, shift the demineralization/remineralization balance toward net mineral loss, leading to initiation/progression of dental caries (acidogenic stage). under severe and prolonged acidic conditions, more aciduric bacteria become dominant through acid-induced selection by temporary acid-impairment and acid-inhibition of growth (aciduric stage). at this stage, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli as well as aciduric strains of non-mutans streptococci, actinomyces, bifidobacteria, and yeasts may become dominant. many acidogenic and aciduric bacteria are involved in caries. environmental acidification is the main determinant of the phenotypic and genotypic changes that occur in the microflora  during caries.

TI  == aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as an early colonizer of oral tissues: epithelium as a reservoir?
AB  == this study examined in vivo and in vitro colonization by aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, an organism highly associated with aggressive periodontitis. thirteen volunteers (5 were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive for  buccal epithelial cells [becs] and teeth, 5 were a. actinomycetemcomitans positive for teeth only, and 3 were a. actinomycetemcomitans-negative controls) had two mandibular stents fabricated. each stent contained 3 removable hydroxyapatite (ha) tooth surrogates. one ha square was removed from a stent at 5 time points over 7 h to assess the transfer of a. actinomycetemcomitans from teeth or becs to ha. streptococcus, actinomyces, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and total anaerobic counts were evaluated on each square over time. in vitro experiments evaluated binding, desorption, transfer, and reattachment of a. actinomycetemcomitans wild-type and mutant strains to becs and saliva-coated ha (sha). streptococcus and actinomyces formed 80% of the cultivable flora on ha in  all subjects. transfer of a. actinomycetemcomitans to ha was not seen in subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans on teeth only. all 5 subjects with a. actinomycetemcomitans on becs showed transfer of a. actinomycetemcomitans to ha.  in vitro, a. actinomycetemcomitans desorbed from becs and transferred to sha. a.  actinomycetemcomitans binding to sha was irreversible and did not transfer to becs. the adhesin aae showed specificity for becs. fimbrial mutants showed the greatest reduction in binding to sha. a. actinomycetemcomitans migrated from becs to ha in vivo and to sha in vitro; however, a. actinomycetemcomitans movement from teeth and sha to becs did not occur. in vivo, a. actinomycetemcomitans colonized ha within 6 h and thus can be considered an early colonizer. becs are a likely reservoir for a. actinomycetemcomitans tooth colonization.

TI  == identification of cultivable microorganisms from primary teeth with necrotic pulps.
AB  == the objective of this study was to identify cultivable microorganisms from primary teeth with necrotic pulps. this experimental study included 21 patients of both sexes between 4 and 7 years of age with necrotic pulps in primary teeth.  twenty-one maxillary and mandibular molars containing at least 1 necrotic canal,  an abscess or sinus tract, one or more radiolucent areas in the furcation or periapical region, teeth having at least two thirds of root length, and carious lesions directly exposed to the oral environment were included. after antisepsis  of the oral cavity, anesthesia of the affected tooth, and isolation and disinfection of the operative field, 3 sterile absorbent paper points were sequentially placed for 30 seconds for the collection of samples. the samples were immediately processed in an anaerobic chamber, and all isolated microorganisms were identified. anaerobic species (anaerobic facultative and moderate anaerobes) were isolated in all root canals; 68.4% of root canal samples studied showed a polymicrobial nature. most of the isolate consisted of bifidobacterium spp2 and streptococcus intermedius. other less frequently encountered species were actinomyces israelii, bifidobacterium spp 1, clostridium spp, and candida albicans. results indicate the existence of combinations of bacterial species in root canal infections of the primary dentition with necrotic pulps, anaerobic bacteria predominating.

TI  == potential of shock waves to remove calculus and biofilm.
AB  == effective calculus and biofilm removal is essential to treat periodontitis. sonic and ultrasonic technologies are used in several scaler applications. this was the first feasibility study to assess the potential of a shock wave device to remove  calculus and biofilms and to kill bacteria. ten extracted teeth with visible subgingival calculus were treated with either shock waves for 1 min at an energy  output of 0.4 mj/mm(2) at 3 hz or a magnetostrictive ultrasonic scaler at medium  power setting for 1 min, which served as a control. calculus was determined before and after treatment planimetrically using a custom-made software using a grey scale threshold. in a second experiment, multispecies biofilms were formed on saliva-preconditioned bovine enamel discs during 64.5 h. they were subsequently treated with shock waves or the ultrasonic scaler (n = 6/group) using identical settings. biofilm detachment and bactericidal effects were then assessed. limited efficiency of the shock wave therapy in terms of calculus removal was observed: only 5% of the calculus was removed as compared to 100% when ultrasound was used (p </= 0.0001). however, shock waves were able to significantly reduce adherent bacteria by three orders of magnitude (p </= 0.0001). the extent of biofilm removal by the ultrasonic device was statistically similar. only limited bactericidal effects were observed using both methods. within the limitations of this preliminary study, the shock wave device was not able to reliably remove calculus but had the potential to remove biofilms by three log steps. to increase the efficacy, technical improvements are still required. this novel noninvasive intervention, however, merits further investigation.

TI  == biofilm formation and composition on different implant materials in vivo.
AB  == biofilm formation was evaluated on the following titanium and zirconia implants in vivo: machined titanium (ti-m), modified titanium (tiunite), modified zirconia (ziunite), machined alumina-toughened zirconia (atz-m), sandblasted alumina-toughened zirconia (atz-s), and machined zirconia (tzp-a-m). bovine enamel slabs were used as controls. surface morphologies were examined by atomic  force (afm) and scanning electron microscopy (sem). the surface wettability was also determined. twelve healthy volunteers wore a splint system with the tested materials. after 3 and 5 days the materials were examined by fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm). the levels of streptococcus spp., veillonella spp., fusobacteriaum nucleatum, and actinomyces naeslundii were quantitatively determined. the biofilm thickness was found to be  between 19.78 and 36.73 mum after 3 days and between 26.11 and 32.43 mum after 5  days. with the exception of ti-m the biofilm thickness after 3 days was correlated with surface roughness. in addition to streptococcus spp. as the main  component of the biofilm (11.23-25.30%), f. nucleatum, a. naeslundii, and veillonella spp. were also detected. no significant differences in biofilm composition on the implant surfaces could be observed. in total, the influence of roughness and material on biofilm formation was compensated by biofilm maturation.

TI  == antibacterial activity of a triclosan-containing resin composite matrix against three common oral bacteria.
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial effect of a resin composite matrix with or without incorporated triclosan (0.3 wt%) on streptococcus mutans, actinomyces  viscosus and lactobacillus casei. in the quantitative assay, bacterial suspensions were filled into 20-mul cavities within temporary restorative resins. after 0, 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48 h of incubation, the suspensions were removed from the restoratives and the numbers of viable bacteria were determined. bacterial suspensions incubated without restoratives served as the controls. ten replicates were carried out for each experiment. the resin composite containing triclosan demonstrated variable degrees of antibacterial activity against the microorganisms, revealing a significant inhibitory effect on s. mutans within 12  h compared to the control. the viable counts of a. viscosus significantly decreased after 24 h. a significant reduction of l. casei was observed after 48 h. the unloaded resin composite did not reveal a marked antibacterial effect. the resin composite loaded with triclosan might be beneficial in preventing cavity contamination and minimizing the risk of pulpal irritation in the short-term.

TI  == antiaggregation potential of berry fractions against pairs of streptococcus mutans with fusobacterium nucleatum or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation is an interspecies adhesion process, which is essential to the development of dental plaque. this is an in vitro study of the composition of the soluble solids in the berry juice molecular size fractions (<10 kda, fi; 10-100 kda, fii; >100 kda, fiii) derived from apple, bilberry, blackcurrant, cloudberry, crowberry and lingonberry and their ability to inhibit and reverse coaggregation  of the pairs of common species in dental plaque: streptococcus mutans with fusobacterium nucleatum or actinomyces naeslundii. inhibitory and reversal activity was found in the molecular size fractions fii and fiii of bilberry, blackcurrant, crowberry and lingonberry. the active fractions contained higher amounts of polyphenols (5-12% of soluble solids) than those without activity (<2% of soluble solids). proanthocyanidins dominated in the active lingonberry juice fractions fii and fiii and also small amounts of anthocyanins were detected. anthocyanins, proanthocyanidins and flavonol glycosides were prevalent in fii and fiii fractions of bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices. comparable amounts of sugars and titratable acids were present in the latter three berry juice fractions of different size. the results indicate that the high molecular size fractions of lingonberry, bilberry, blackcurrant and crowberry juices have antiaggregation potential on common oral bacteria, the potential being associated with their polyphenolic content.

TI  == analysis of oral microbiota in children with dental caries by pcr-dgge and barcoded pyrosequencing.
AB  == oral microbiota plays a vital role in maintaining the homeostasis of oral cavity. dental caries are among the most common oral diseases in children and pathogenic  bacteria contribute to the development of the disease. however, the overall structure of bacterial communities in the oral cavity from children with dental caries has not been explored deeply heretofore. we used high-throughput barcoded  pyrosequencing and pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) to examine  bacterial diversity of oral microbiota in saliva and supragingival plaques from 60 children aged 3 to 6 years old with and without dental caries from china. the  multiplex barcoded pyrosequencing was performed in a single run, with multiple samples tagged uniquely by multiplex identifiers. as pcr-dgge analysis is a conventional molecular ecological approach, this analysis was also performed on the same samples and the results of both approaches were compared. a total of 186,787 high-quality sequences were obtained for evaluating bacterial diversity and 41,905 unique sequences represented all phylotypes. we found that the oral microbiota in children was far more diverse than previous studies reported, and more than 200 genera belonging to ten phyla were found in the oral cavity. the phylotypes in saliva and supragingival plaques were significantly different and could be divided into two distinct clusters (p < 0.05). the bacterial diversity in oral microbiome analyzed by pcr-dgge and barcoded pyrosequencing was employed  to cross validate the data sets. the genera of streptococcus, veillonella, actinomyces, granulicatella, leptotrichia, and thiomonas in plaques were significantly associated with dental caries (p < 0.05). the results showed that there was no one specific pathogen but rather pathogenic populations in plaque that significantly correlated with dental caries. the enormous diversity of oral  microbiota allowed for a better understanding of oral microecosystem, and these pathogenic populations in plaque provide new insights into the etiology of dental caries and suggest new targets for interventions of the disease.

TI  == structure and molecular characterization of streptococcus pneumoniae capsular polysaccharide 10f by carbohydrate engineering in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == although closely related at the molecular level, the capsular polysaccharide (cps) of serotype 10f streptococcus pneumoniae and coaggregation receptor polysaccharide (rps) of streptococcus oralis c104 have distinct ecological roles. cps prevents phagocytosis of pathogenic s. pneumoniae, whereas rps of commensal s. oralis functions as a receptor for lectin-like adhesins on other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. results from high resolution nmr identified  the recognition region of s. oralis rps (i.e. galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha) in the hexasaccharide repeat of s. pneumoniae cps10f. the failure of this polysaccharide to support fimbriae-mediated adhesion of actinomyces naeslundii was explained by the position of galf, which occurred as a branch in cps10f rather than within the linear polysaccharide chain, as in rps. carbohydrate engineering of s. oralis rps with wzy from s. pneumoniae attributed formation of  the galf branch in cps10f to the linkage of adjacent repeating units through sub  terminal galnac in galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha rather than through terminal  galf, as in rps. a gene (wcrd) from serotype 10a s. pneumoniae was then used to engineer a linear surface polysaccharide in s. oralis that was identical to rps except for the presence of a beta1-3 linkage between galf and galnacbeta1-3galalpha. this polysaccharide also failed to support adhesion of a.  naeslundii, thereby establishing the essential role of beta1-6-linked galf in recognition of adjacent galnacbeta1-3galalpha in wild-type rps. these findings, which illustrate a molecular approach for relating bacterial polysaccharide structure to function, provide insight into the possible evolution of s. oralis rps from s. pneumoniae cps.

TI  == energy transfer, volumetric expansion, and removal of oral biofilms by non-contact brushing.
AB  == non-contact removal of oral biofilms offers advantages beyond the reach of bristles, but it is unknown how energy transfer for removal from brush-to-biofilm occurs. in the present study we evaluated non-contact, oral biofilm removal by oscillating-rotating and sonic toothbrushes, and their acoustic output up to 6 mm distance. whereas some brushes removed biofilm when used at a distance of up to 6 mm, others lost efficacy at a distance of 2-4 mm from the biofilm. loss of efficacy was accompanied with high standard deviations and volumetric biofilm expansion. both sonic and oscillating-rotating brushes caused fluid flows and the inclusion of air-bubbles, while non-contact acoustic energy-transfer was demonstrated to decay with distance for both types of brushes. we put forward the following mechanism for non-contact removal: (i) brush energy is absorbed by biofilm, resulting in the visco-elastic expansion of the biofilm; (ii) if the energy absorbed is sufficient and deformation is beyond the yield point, biofilm  removal occurs; and (iii) if deformation is in the plastic range but below the yield point (i.e. at the limiting distance for non-contact removal), biofilm is expanded but not removed.

TI  == etiology and outcome of community-acquired lung abscess.
AB  == background: anaerobes are the first and streptococcus species the second most common cause of community-acquired lung abscess (cala) in the west. the etiologic pathogens of this disease have changed in taiwan, with klebsiella pneumoniae being reported as the most common cause of cala. objective: to determine the etiologies of community-acquired lung abscess. methods: we retrospectively reviewed the records of 205 japanese adult patients with cala to evaluate etiologies and outcomes. we used not only traditional microbiological investigations but also percutaneous ultrasonography-guided transthoracic needle  aspiration and protected specimen brushes. results: of these 205 patients, 122 had documented bacteriological results, with 189 bacterial species isolated. pure aerobic, mixed aerobic and anaerobic, and pure anaerobic bacteria were isolated in 90 (73.8%), 17 (13.9%), and 15 (12.3%) patients, respectively. the four most common etiologic pathogens were streptococcus species (59.8%), anaerobes (26.2%), gemella species (9.8%), and k. pneumoniae (8.2%). streptococcus mitis was the most common among the streptococcus species. mean duration of antibiotic administration was 26 days. six patients (2.9%, 3 with actinomycosis and 3 with nocardiosis) were treated with antibiotics for 76-189 days. two patients with anaerobic lung abscess died. conclusions: the first and second most common etiologic pathogens of cala in our hospital were streptococcus species and anaerobes, respectively. the etiologies in our study differ from those in taiwan  and are similar to those in the west with the exception that streptococcus species were the most common etiologic pathogens in our study whereas anaerobes are the most frequent etiologic pathogens in western countries. s. mitis and gemella species are important etiologic pathogens as well. the identification of  actinomyces and nocardia is important in order to define the adequate duration of antibiotic administration.

AB  == background and purpose: infections including those of the central nervous system  (cns) are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in systemic lupus erythematosus (sle). this case series describes the etiology, contributing factors and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle.  design: retrospective case series. methods: we reviewed the medical records of sle patients diagnosed and confined for a cns infection at the university of santo tomas hospital in manila, philippines, from 1997 to 2007. results: a total  of 23 sle patients (22 females) diagnosed with cns infection were included in this study. the mean age was 25.8 years (range 12-51) at sle diagnosis, and 30.9  years (range 14-58) at cns infection, with a mean disease duration of 55 months (range 7-125). nineteen cases (82.6%) were meningitis, and four (17.4%) were diagnoses of brain abscess. the etiologic agents were identified as cryptococcus  neoformans in seven (30.4%), mycobacterium tuberculosis in seven (30.4%), streptococcus pneumoniae in two (8.7%), salmonella sp. in one (4.4%), corynebacterium bovis with actinomyces sp. in one (4.4%), and no isolate in five  (21.7%). the average daily prednisone dose was 28.9 mg (range 0-60 mg); 10 patients had recently received pulse cyclophosphamide, and two were on mycophenolate mofetil at the time of infection. most cases had active sle; the lone patient in disease remission had s. pneumoniae meningitis post-splenectomy.  the most common presentation was headache (100%) and fever (87%). the infection resolved completely in nine patients (39.1%), and resolved with sequelae in two patients (8.7%); 12 patients (52.2%) died. conclusion: we described the etiology  and outcomes of cns infections in a group of filipino patients with sle. risk factors included active sle in the majority of cases requiring moderate- to high-dose steroids and other immunosuppressants like cyclophosphamide. although c. neoformans and m. tuberculosis were the most common etiologic agents, it is just as important to search for less common organisms which can produce disease in highly susceptible hosts. a high index of suspicion and early appropriate management are crucial to favorable outcome among these patients.

AB  == purpose: to establish a dynamic model which could simulate the ecologic environment of oral cavity and study the cariogenicity of oral biofilm, continuously observe the formation of oral biofilm. methods: the fermental vessel and chemostat were designed according to the purpose of the study. four strains of oral bacteria, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii, were inoculated in the fermenter. the hydroxyapatite (ha) discs and glass slides were put in the chemostat. the temperature, oxide pressure, ph, dilution rate, circulation rate and substrate of the chemostat were carefully modulated. distilled water and 25mm sucrose solution were used to test the stability of the system. at the beginning  of the model establishment, the anabiosis bacteria were inoculated in fermenter full of fresh artificial saliva with a dilution rate of 10%. after the growth of  bacteria in the fermenter was stable, the four-organism bacterial consortium was  inoculated in the chemotat for 24 hours together with fresh artificial saliva (v/v=1:9). the organisms in planktonic phase were examined everyday. when the populations of consortium got stable(about 72 hours), the test solution was pulsed in the chemostat every 12 hours for 5 days. the ha discs and glass slides  were observed every 24 hours for five times. the data was analyzed using spss 10.0 software package. dunnet t test was used to compare the difference between the two groups at the level of alpha=0.05. results: the dynamic model was successfully established on oral biofilm study. with the pulse of sucrose solution, the environment in the chemostat simulated the cariogenic environment in nature, and all data namely the bacteria population, the biofilm microstructure changed with solution pulse. conclsuions: the model established is proved to be stable and the parameters in the model could be successfully controlled. the model fulfills the dynamic observation of formation of biofilm and caries lesion in vitro.

TI  == exopolysaccharides produced by streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferases modulate the establishment of microcolonies within multispecies biofilms.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is a key contributor to the formation of the extracellular polysaccharide (eps) matrix in dental biofilms. the exopolysaccharides, which are mostly glucans synthesized by streptococcal glucosyltransferases (gtfs), provide  binding sites that promote accumulation of microorganisms on the tooth surface and further establishment of pathogenic biofilms. this study explored (i) the role of s. mutans gtfs in the development of the eps matrix and microcolonies in  biofilms, (ii) the influence of exopolysaccharides on formation of microcolonies, and (iii) establishment of s. mutans in a multispecies biofilm in vitro using a novel fluorescence labeling technique. our data show that the ability of s. mutans strains defective in the gtfb gene or the gtfb and gtfc genes to form microcolonies on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite surfaces was markedly disrupted. however, deletion of both gtfb (associated with insoluble glucan synthesis) and gtfc (associated with insoluble and soluble glucan synthesis) is required for the maximum reduction in eps matrix and biofilm formation. s. mutans grown with sucrose in the presence of streptococcus oralis and actinomyces naeslundii steadily formed exopolysaccharides, which allowed the initial clustering of bacterial cells and further development into highly structured microcolonies. concomitantly, s. mutans became the major species in the mature biofilm. neither  the eps matrix nor microcolonies were formed in the presence of glucose in the multispecies biofilm. our data show that gtfb and gtfc are essential for establishment of the eps matrix, but gtfb appears to be responsible for formation of microcolonies by s. mutans; these gtf-mediated processes may enhance the competitiveness of s. mutans in the multispecies environment in biofilms on tooth surfaces.

AB  == the aim of the research described in 'chemotherapy against streptococcus mutans'  was to increase colonization resistance against mutans streptococci by inoculating actinomyces naeslundii on the dentition. actinomyces naeslundii established better after chlorhexidine application than after dental cleansing only but did not exceed the 1% level of the total actinomyces population. this was insufficient to increase the colonization resistance against mutans streptococci. a 33% chlorhexidine varnish was developed. after a single short-term application of the varnish all plaque bacteria were erased. after several hours streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis  and streptococcus gordonii re-established on the surface. actinomyces naeslundii  recovered later, but often with higher numbers. mutans streptococci remained suppressed for months. this led to less acid production in dental plaque and caries reduction. the combination of mechanical cleansing and varnish application resulted in additional pocket reduction. recently, attention is also established  for research on the application ofprobiotics in periodotology.

TI  == oral biofilm architecture on natural teeth.
AB  == periodontitis and caries are infectious diseases of the oral cavity in which oral biofilms play a causative role. moreover, oral biofilms are widely studied as model systems for bacterial adhesion, biofilm development, and biofilm resistance to antibiotics, due to their widespread presence and accessibility. despite descriptions of initial plaque formation on the tooth surface, studies on mature  plaque and plaque structure below the gum are limited to landmark studies from the 1970s, without appreciating the breadth of microbial diversity in the plaque. we used fluorescent in situ hybridization to localize in vivo the most abundant species from different phyla and species associated with periodontitis on seven embedded teeth obtained from four different subjects. the data showed convincingly the dominance of actinomyces sp., tannerella forsythia, fusobacterium nucleatum, spirochaetes, and synergistetes in subgingival plaque. the latter proved to be new with a possibly important role in host-pathogen interaction due to its localization in close proximity to immune cells. the present study identified for the first time in vivo that lactobacillus sp. are the central cells of bacterial aggregates in subgingival plaque, and that streptococcus sp. and the yeast candida albicans form corncob structures in supragingival plaque. finally, periodontal pathogens colonize already formed biofilms and form microcolonies therein. these in vivo observations on oral biofilms provide a clear vision on biofilm architecture and the spatial distribution of predominant species.

AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == central role of the early colonizer veillonella sp. in establishing multispecies  biofilm communities with initial, middle, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == human dental biofilm communities comprise several species, which can interact cooperatively or competitively. bacterial interactions influence biofilm formation, metabolic changes, and physiological function of the community. lactic acid, a common metabolite of oral bacteria, was measured in the flow cell effluent of one-, two- and three-species communities growing on saliva as the sole nutritional source. we investigated single-species and multispecies colonization by using known initial, early, middle, and late colonizers of enamel. fluorescent-antibody staining and image analysis were used to quantify the biomass in saliva-fed flow cells. of six species tested, only the initial colonizer actinomyces oris exhibited significant growth. the initial colonizer streptococcus oralis produced lactic acid but showed no significant growth. the early colonizer veillonella sp. utilized lactic acid in two- and three-species biofilm communities. the biovolumes of all two-species biofilms increased when veillonella sp. was present as one of the partners, indicating that this early colonizer promotes mutualistic community development. all three-species combinations exhibited enhanced growth except one, i.e., a. oris, veillonella sp., and the middle colonizer porphyromonas gingivalis, indicating specificity among three-species communities. further specificity was seen when fusobacterium  nucleatum (a middle colonizer), aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (a late colonizer), and p. gingivalis did not grow with s. oralis in two-species biofilms, but inclusion of veillonella sp. resulted in growth of all three-species combinations. we propose that commensal veillonellae use lactic acid for growth in saliva and that they communicate metabolically with initial, early, middle, and late colonizers to establish multispecies communities on enamel.

TI  == effect of herbal, essential oil, and chlorhexidine mouthrinses on the composition of the subgingival microbiota and clinical periodontal parameters.
AB  == objective: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine if antimicrobial mouthrinses with different formulations could affect the composition of the subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters of adjacent tissues in periodontal maintenance subjects. methods: one-hundred and sixteen subjects, who had been treated for chronic periodontitis and were in a maintenance program, were randomly assigned one of four mouthrinses, to be used twice daily for three months. the mouthrinses were herbal 1, herbal 2, essential  oil, and chlorhexidine. clinical measurements and subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and at three months. plaque samples were individually evaluated for 18 test species/taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences between baseline and three months for both microbiological and clinical parameters were determined using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. significance of difference among groups for change in clinical and microbiological parameters was determined using analysis of covariance (ancova),  adjusting for baseline values. results: shifts in species proportions differed significantly for 9/18 test species/taxa among the four mouthrinse groups. streptococcus and capnocytophaga species were reduced most in the herbal rinse groups, while veillonella parvula was reduced most in the essential oil and chlorhexidine groups. actinomyces were also markedly reduced in the chlorhexidine group. mean plaque (pi) and gingival indices (gi) were reduced between baseline and three months in each group. results emphasize that chlorhexidine (p < 0.001)  and herbal (p < 0.05) rinses significantly reduced pi. some subjects in each group responded better than others. conclusion: all four mouthrinses tested produced shifts in the composition of subgingival microbiota, although the results differed among the groups. the observed microbial changes were accompanied by improvements in clinical parameters in the periodontal maintenance subjects.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == clinical characteristics and factors associated the outcome of lacrimal canaliculitis.
AB  == purpose: to analyze the clinical and microbiological characteristics and factors  associated with the outcome of lacrimal canaliculitis. methods: thirty four patients (34 eyes) treated for lacrimal canaliculitis between january 2001 and december 2006 in a tertiary medical centre were retrospectively reviewed. clinical and microbiological profiles, treatment outcome, and risk factors related to recurrence and concretions formation were evaluated. results: there were 10 males and 24 females with a mean age of 64 years. the average time lapse  to diagnosis was 18 months. lower canaliculus (91%) was most commonly involved. six patients (18%) had both upper and lower canaliculitis. culture positive specimens were 21 of 25 (84%), with a mixed infection of 7 (28%). streptococcus species (28%), staphylococcus species (20%), and actinomyces (16%) were the most  commonly cultured organisms. concretions were noted in nine patients (26%). all cultures of concretions were positive. no specific factor was found to be related to concretions formation. canaliculotomy was performed in 25 patients (74%). recurrence developed in seven patients (21%), with a mean time to recurrence of 24 months. multivariate analysis demonstrated that male patients (p=0.038) and presence of concretions (p=0.001) were associated with higher recurrent rate. both patients with haemophilus influenzae isolate developed recurrence (100%). conclusion: canaliculitis are often delayed diagnosed and prone to recur or persist. male gender and concretions are important risk factors for recurrence. surgical removal of all possible concretions is essential for cure.

TI  == effect of various rinsing protocols after use of amine fluoride/stannous fluoride toothpaste on the bacterial composition of dental plaque.
AB  == this clinical study evaluated the effect of different oral hygiene protocols on the bacterial composition of dental plaque. after a 2-week period of using fluoride-free toothpaste, 30 participants followed three 1-week experimental protocols, each followed by 2-week fluoride-free washout periods in a randomized  crossover examiner-blind controlled trial. the 1-week experimental protocols comprised the use of amf/snf(2) toothpaste twice daily, after which participants  either (1) rinsed with tap water, (2) did not rinse but only spat out the toothpaste, or (3) rinsed with an amf/snf(2) mouthwash. in the fluoride-free washout periods, the participants brushed their teeth with fluoride-free toothpaste without further instructions. six hours after the last brushing (+/- rinsing) of each period, buccal plaque samples in the upper molar region were taken. the microbiota composition of the plaque samples was analyzed by checkerboard dna:dna hybridization. a statistically significant reduction was found in the total amount of dna of the 39 major plaque species measured, and in  the proportions of some acid-producing bacterial strains after the period having  used the amf/snf(2) toothpaste + amf/snf(2) mouthrinsing. the results indicate that using the amf/snf(2) toothpaste and rinse combination could result in plaque of lower cariogenicity.

TI  == defining the healthy "core microbiome" of oral microbial communities.
AB  == background: most studies examining the commensal human oral microbiome are focused on disease or are limited in methodology. in order to diagnose and treat  diseases at an early and reversible stage an in-depth definition of health is indispensible. the aim of this study therefore was to define the healthy oral microbiome using recent advances in sequencing technology (454 pyrosequencing). results: we sampled and sequenced microbiomes from several intraoral niches (dental surfaces, cheek, hard palate, tongue and saliva) in three healthy individuals. within an individual oral cavity, we found over 3600 unique sequences, over 500 different otus or "species-level" phylotypes (sequences that  clustered at 3% genetic difference) and 88 - 104 higher taxa (genus or more inclusive taxon). the predominant taxa belonged to firmicutes (genus streptococcus, family veillonellaceae, genus granulicatella), proteobacteria (genus neisseria, haemophilus), actinobacteria (genus corynebacterium, rothia, actinomyces), bacteroidetes (genus prevotella, capnocytophaga, porphyromonas) and fusobacteria (genus fusobacterium).each individual sample harboured on average 266 "species-level" phylotypes (sd 67; range 123 - 326) with cheek samples being  the least diverse and the dental samples from approximal surfaces showing the highest diversity. principal component analysis discriminated the profiles of the samples originating from shedding surfaces (mucosa of tongue, cheek and palate) from the samples that were obtained from solid surfaces (teeth).there was a large overlap in the higher taxa, "species-level" phylotypes and unique sequences among the three microbiomes: 84% of the higher taxa, 75% of the otus and 65% of the unique sequences were present in at least two of the three microbiomes. the three individuals shared 1660 of 6315 unique sequences. these 1660 sequences (the "core microbiome") contributed 66% of the reads. the overlapping otus contributed to 94% of the reads, while nearly all reads (99.8%) belonged to the shared higher taxa. conclusions: we obtained the first insight into the diversity and uniqueness of individual oral microbiomes at a resolution of next-generation sequencing. we showed that a major proportion of bacterial sequences of unrelated healthy individuals is identical, supporting the concept of a core microbiome at  health.

TI  == primary canaliculitis.
AB  == purpose: to review the clinical findings, treatment outcomes, and microbiology of primary canaliculitis. methods: a medical record database was queried to identify cases of primary canaliculitis. the 23 cases identified were reviewed for clinical presentation, treatment, microbiology, pathology, and patient outcome at the time of most recent follow-up. participants were also surveyed to determine long-term treatment outcomes. results: twenty-three patients met the criteria for primary canaliculitis. the median duration of symptoms was 135 days. the most common symptoms were mattering and epiphora. punctal regurgitation was the most common clinical finding. seven patients had multiple canalicular involvement. treatment included either medical therapy or surgical intervention. cultures were obtained from 16 participants. sixty-two percent of identified organisms were gram positive, and most organisms were anaerobes or facultative anaerobes. the most common organisms identified were streptococcus and staphylococcus species. actinomyces and propionibacterium species followed. actinomyces israelii was not  cultured. eighteen patients responded to a mailed survey (response rate, 67%). most respondents (83%) denied having either epiphora or mattering at median 90 months follow-up. three of the respondents reported having had an additional episode of canaliculitis since last clinical follow-up. two of these occurred in  a previously uninvolved punctum. conclusion: although involvement of multiple canaliculi over time is more common than previously recognized, most patients do  not have lingering problems with epiphora or mattering. the microbiology of primary canaliculitis does not appear to be evolving, with actinomyces, and other anaerobes or facultative anaerobes being common pathogens.

TI  == impact of hydrodynamics on oral biofilm strength.
AB  == mechanical removal of oral biofilms is ubiquitously accepted as the best way to prevent caries and periodontal diseases. removal effectiveness strongly depends on biofilm strength. to investigate the influence of hydrodynamics on oral biofilm strength, we grew single- and multi-species biofilms of streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii tv14-j1, and full dental plaque at shear rates ranging from 0.1 to 50 1/sec and measured their compressive strength. subsequently, biofilm architecture was evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. multi-species biofilms were stronger than single-species biofilms, with strength values ranging from 6 to 51 pa and from 5 to 17 pa, respectively. in response to increased hydrodynamic shear, biofilm strength decreased, and architecture changed from uniform carpet-like to more "fluffy" with higher thickness. s. oralis biofilms grown under variable shear of 7 and 50 1/sec possessed properties intermediate of those measured at the respective single shears.

AB  == using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (mta), new endodontic cement (nec) and portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. a base layer was made using muller-hinton agar for escherichia coli (atcc 10538) and candida (atcc 10231). for actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 10541) and streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175)  blood agar medium was used. wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees c for 72 h. the inhibition zones were then measured. the data were analyzed using anova and the tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. the positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. all materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for enterococcus  faecalis. nec created larger inhibition zones than mta and portland cement. this  difference was significant for portland cement (p < 0.05), but not for mta (p > 0.05). among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for actinomyces group (p < 0.05). the antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (p < 0.05). it was concluded that nec is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.

TI  == proximal small intestinal microbiota and identification of rod-shaped bacteria associated with childhood celiac disease.
AB  == objectives: alterations in the composition of the microbiota in the intestine may promote development of celiac disease (cd). using scanning electron microscopy (sem) we previously demonstrated that rod-shaped bacteria were present on the epithelium of proximal small intestine in children with cd but not in controls. in this study we characterize the microbiota of proximal small intestine in children with cd and controls and identify cd-associated rod-shaped bacteria. methods: proximal small intestine biopsies from 45 children with cd and 18 clinical controls were studied. bacteria were identified by 16s rdna sequencing in dna extracted from biopsies washed with buffer containing dithiothreitol to enrich bacteria adhering to the epithelial lining, by culture-based methods and by sem and transmission electron microscopy. results: the normal, mucosa-associated microbiota of proximal small intestine was limited. it was dominated by the genera streptococcus and neisseria, and also contained veillonella, gemella, actinomyces, rothia, and haemophilus. the proximal small intestine microbiota in biopsies from cd patients collected during 2004-2007 differed only marginally from that of controls, and only one biopsy (4%) had rod-shaped bacteria by sem (sem+). in nine frozen sem+ cd biopsies from the previous study, microbiotas were significantly enriched in clostridium, prevotella, and actinomyces compared with sem- biopsies. bacteria of all three genera were isolated from children born during the swedish cd epidemic. new clostridium and prevotella species and actinomyces graevenitzii were tentatively  identified. conclusions: rod-shaped bacteria, probably of the indicated species,  constituted a significant fraction of the proximal small intestine microbiota in  children born during the swedish cd epidemic and may have been an important risk  factor for cd contributing to the fourfold increase in disease incidence in children below 2 years of age during that time.

TI  == mutualistic biofilm communities develop with porphyromonas gingivalis and initial, early, and late colonizers of enamel.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is present in dental plaque as early as 4 h after tooth  cleaning, but it is also associated with periodontal disease, a late-developing event in the microbial successions that characterize daily plaque development. we report here that p. gingivalis atcc 33277 is remarkable in its ability to interact with a variety of initial, early, middle, and late colonizers growing solely on saliva. integration of p. gingivalis into multispecies communities was  investigated by using two in vitro biofilm models. in flow cells, bacterial growth was quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilm growth on saliva-submerged polystyrene pegs was analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr using species-specific primers. p. gingivalis could not grow as a single species or together with initial colonizer  streptococcus oralis but showed mutualistic growth when paired with two other initial colonizers, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces oris, as well as with  veillonella sp. (early colonizer), fusobacterium nucleatum (middle colonizer), and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans (late colonizer). in three-species flow cells, p. gingivalis grew with veillonella sp. and a. actinomycetemcomitans but not with s. oralis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. also, it grew with veillonella sp. and f. nucleatum but not with s. oralis and f. nucleatum, indicating that p.  gingivalis and s. oralis are not compatible. however, p. gingivalis grew in combination with s. gordonii and s. oralis, demonstrating its ability to overcome the incompatibility when cultured with a second initially colonizing species. collectively, these data help explain the observed presence of p. gingivalis at all stages of dental plaque development.

TI  == oral bacteria induce a differential activation of human immunodeficiency virus-1  promoter in t cells, macrophages and dendritic cells.
AB  == introduction: the human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) can integrate into t cells,  macrophages and dendritic cells resulting in a latent infection. reports have also demonstrated that various microbial and host cell factors can trigger hiv reactivation leading to hiv recrudescence, potentially undermining highly active  antiretroviral therapies. methods: this study evaluated the capacity of oral bacteria associated with chronic periodontal infections to stimulate hiv promoter activation in various cell models of hiv latency. results: t cells (1g5) challenged with oral bacteria demonstrated a dose-response of hiv promoter activation with a subset of the bacteria, as well as kinetics that were generally similar irrespective of the stimuli. direct bacterial challenge of the t cells resulted in increased activation of approximately 1.5- to 7-fold over controls. challenge of macrophages (bf24) indicated different kinetics for individual bacteria and resulted in consistent increases in promoter activation of five fold to six fold over basal levels for all bacteria except streptococcus mutans. dendritic cells showed increases in hiv reactivation of 7- to 34-fold specific for individual species of bacteria. conclusion: these results suggested that oral bacteria have the capability to reactivate hiv from latently infected cells, showing a relationship of mature dendritic cells > immature dendritic cells > macrophages > or = t cells. expression of various pattern recognition receptors on these various cell types may provide insight into the primary receptors/signaling pathways used for reactivation by the bacteria.

TI  == oral bacterial adhesion forces to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction in orthodontic treatment.
AB  == bacterial adhesion to biomaterial surfaces constituting the bracket-adhesive-enamel junction represents a growing problem in orthodontics, because bacteria can adversely affect treatment by causing demineralization of the enamel surface around the brackets. it is important to know the forces with which bacteria adhere to the surfaces of these junction materials, as the strength of these forces will determine how easy it will be to remove the bacteria. we compared the adhesion forces of five initially colonizing and four cariogenic strains of bacteria to an orthodontic adhesive, stainless steel, and enamel, with and without a salivary conditioning film. adhesion forces were determined using atomic force microscopy and a bacterial probe. in the absence of a salivary conditioning film, the strongest bacterial adhesion forces occurred to the adhesive surface (-2.9 to -6.9 nn), while adhesion forces to the enamel surfaces were lowest (-0.8 to -2.7 nn). in the presence of a salivary conditioning film, adhesion forces were reduced strongly, to less than 1 nn, and  the differences between the various materials were reduced. generally, however, initial colonizers of dental hard surfaces presented stronger adhesion forces to  the different materials (-4.7 and -0.6 nn in the absence and presence of a salivary conditioning film, respectively) than cariogenic strains (-1.8 and -0.5  nn).

AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor changes in oral health and oral biofilm composition in vivo during an experiment simulating prehistoric lifestyle and diet and poor oral hygiene. thirteen subjects lived for a period of 8 weeks under neolithic conditions. the following clinical parameters were recorded before and  after the project: gingival and plaque index (loe and silness, acta odontol scand 21:533, 1963; silness and loe, acta odontol scand 22:121-135, 1964), probing pocket depth, and bleeding upon probing. in addition, supragingival plaque samples were collected both before and after the project and were analysed quantitatively using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization and confocal laser scanning microscopy. the following plaque bacteria were evaluated: streptococcus spp., veillonella spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces naeslundii. the plaque index increased significantly from 1.12 up to 1.55 over the 8-week period (gingival index before, 0.46; after, 0.93; p < 0.05). a strong  correlation of both indices was recorded before (r = 0.77) and after (r = 0.83) participation in the study. each of the children in the study showed a progression of carious lesions and/or new areas of demineralisation. the probing  pocket depth and bleeding upon probing were not affected. all subjects yielded an intra-individual shift in biofilm composition. the proportion of f. nucleatum decreased across all subjects. the proportion of veillonella spp. increased among the children. poor oral hygiene and change of diet lead to an increase in oral plaque and gingival inflammation. the inter-individual comparison indicated a shift in bacterial composition.

AB  == in this study, the bacteriostatic effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on selected early dental plaque bacteria was investigated based on changes in the doubling time (g) and specific growth rates (micro). streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces sp. were cultured in brain heart infusion (bhi) in the presence and absence of the extracts. the growth of bacteria was monitored periodically every 15 min over a period of 9 h to allow for a complete growth cycle. growth profiles of the bacteria in the presence of the extracts were compared to those in the absence and deviation in the g and micro were determined and analyzed. it was found that the g and mu were affected  by both extracts. at 4 mg ml(-1) of p. betle the g-values for s. sanguinis and s. mitis were increased by 12.0- and 10.4-fold, respectively (p < 0.05). at similar  concentration p. guajava increased the g-value by 1.8- and 2.6 -fold, respectively (p < 0.05). the effect on actinomyces sp. was observed at a much lower magnitude. it appears that p. betle and p. guajava extracts have bacteriostatic effect on the plaque bacteria by creating a stressed environment that had suppressed the growth and propagation of the cells. within the context of the dental plaque, this would ensure the attainment of thin and healthy plaque. thus, decoctions of these plants would be suitable if used in the control of dental plaque.

TI  == transient acid-impairment of growth ability of oral streptococcus, actinomyces, and lactobacillus: a possible ecological determinant in dental plaque.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque ph decreases to about 4 through bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates and this low ph is maintained for from several minutes to about an hour. repeated acidification causes demineralization of the tooth surface, resulting in caries formation. the acidification also influences plaque bacteria. severe acidification kills bacteria efficiently, while physiological acidification, the condition occurring in plaque, kills bacteria partially and may impair growth ability. we, therefore, investigated the effects  of physiological acidification on representative caries-related bacteria. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, lactobacillus paracasei, and actinomyces naeslundii were used. effects of physiological acidification at ph 4.0 on cell viability and growth ability, as well as the growth rate of these bacteria at ph 4.0-7.0, were  investigated. results: mutans streptococci and lactobacillus grew at ph 4.0 but the growth of s. sanguinis and s. oralis ceased below ph 4.2 and ph 4.2-4.4, respectively. acidification at ph 4.0 for 1 h killed 43-89%, 45% and 35-76% of s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and actinomyces, respectively. furthermore, assessment of bacterial growth curves revealed that the growth ability of the surviving cells of s. sanguinis, s. oralis and actinomyces was impaired, but it was recovered within 2-5 h after the environmental ph had returned to 7.0. the acidification neither killed nor impaired the growth of mutans streptococci and lactobacillus.  conclusions: these results indicate that physiological and transient acidification is not sufficient to kill bacteria, but it causes a temporary acid-impairment of their growth ability, which may function as an ecological determinant for microbial composition in dental plaque.

TI  == oral biofilm models for mechanical plaque removal.
AB  == in vitro plaque removal studies require biofilm models that resemble in vivo dental plaque. here, we compare contact and non-contact removal of single and dual-species biofilms as well as of biofilms grown from human whole saliva in vitro using different biofilm models. bacteria were adhered to a salivary pellicle for 2 h or grown after adhesion for 16 h, after which, their removal was evaluated. in a contact mode, no differences were observed between the manual, rotating, or sonic brushing; and removal was on average 39%, 84%, and 95% for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and actinomyces naeslundii, respectively, and 90% and 54% for the dual- and multi-species biofilms, respectively. however, in a non-contact mode, rotating and sonic brushes still removed considerable numbers of bacteria (24-40%), while the manual brush as a control (5-11%) did not. single a. naeslundii and dual-species (a. naeslundii and s. oralis) biofilms were more difficult to remove after 16 h growth than after 2  h adhesion (on average, 62% and 93% for 16- and 2-h-old biofilms, respectively),  while in contrast, biofilms grown from whole saliva were easier to remove (97% after 16 h and 54% after 2 h of growth). considering the strong adhesion of dual-species biofilms and their easier more reproducible growth compared with biofilms grown from whole saliva, dual-species biofilms of a. naeslundii and s. oralis are suggested to be preferred for use in mechanical plaque removal studies in vitro.

TI  == bacterial colonization of enamel in situ investigated using fluorescence in situ  hybridization.
AB  == oral biofilms are one of the greatest challenges in dental research. the present  study aimed to investigate initial bacterial colonization of enamel surfaces in situ using fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) over a 12 h period. for this purpose, bovine enamel slabs were fixed on buccal sites of individual splints worn by six subjects for 2, 6 and 12 h to allow biofilm formation. specimens were processed for fish and evaluated with confocal laser-scanning microscopy, using probes for eubacteria, streptococcus species, veillonella species, fusobacterium  nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii. the number of adherent bacteria increased with time and all tested bacterial species were detected in the biofilm formed in situ. the general percentage composition of the eubacteria did not change over the investigated period, but the number of streptococci, the most frequently detected species, increased significantly with time (2 h: 17.7+/-13.8 %; 6 h: 20.0+/-16.6 %; 12 h: 24.7+/-16.1 %). however, < or =1 % of the surface was covered with bacteria after 12 h of biofilm formation in situ. in conclusion, fish is an appropriate method for quantifying initial biofilm formation in situ,  and the proportion of streptococci increases during the first 12 h of bacterial adherence.

TI  == bacterial and host interactions of oral streptococci.
AB  == the oral microbial flora comprises one of the most diverse human-associated biofilms. its development is heavily influenced by oral streptococci, which are considered the main group of early colonizers. their initial attachment determines the composition of later colonizers in the oral biofilm and impacts the health or disease status of the host. thus, the role of streptococci in the development of oral diseases is best described in the context of bacterial ecology, which itself is further influenced by interactions with host epithelial  cells, the immune system, and salivary components. the tractability of the oral biofilm makes it an excellent model system for studies of complex, biofilm-associated polymicrobial diseases. using this system, numerous cooperative and antagonistic bacterial interactions have been demonstrated to occur within the community and with the host. in this review, several recent identified interactions are presented.

TI  == the microbiota on different oral surfaces in healthy children.
AB  == introduction: knowledge of the early oral colonization patterns could provide a better understanding of oral biofilm development and disease initiation that in turn could be the basis for early preventive programmes. methods: microbial samples were collected from five different oral habitats from a total of 93 children (age 3-12 years), attending the dental school of the university of athens, who were split into three age groups. a total of 38 microbial species were sought out by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: all of the test species, except parvimonas micra and porphyromonas gingivalis, differed significantly among sample locations providing quite distinct microbial  profiles for the different oral surfaces. supragingival and subgingival plaque had similar profiles and exhibited higher proportions of actinomyces species and  green complex while soft tissue samples were dominated by streptococci of the yellow complex. the profiles of the tongue dorsum and saliva were also similar. many of the species were in similar proportions in all three age groups for a given location. periodontal pathogens showed increases in proportions with increasing age. specifically, the red complex species (tannerella forsythia, p. gingivalis, treponema denticola) showed a significant increase in proportion with age (p < 0.05) in all sample locations. conclusions: the results showed a pattern of colonization in children similar to that previously found in adults. differences in the profile between age groups suggest a gradual maturation of the oral microbiota, with it being made up of an increasing number of orange and red  complex species.

TI  == does strontium play a role in the cariostatic activity of glass ionomer? strontium diffusion and antibacterial activity.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of strontium ions on the main pathogens of the oral flora. the leaching of strontium from resin modified glass ionomer cements (rmgic) was evaluated together with its uptake by  superficial dental enamel. methods: the antibacterial activity was measured by the growth inhibition method following exposure of supra- and sub-gingival bacteria to a range of strontium concentrations (0.19 moll(-1), 0.37 moll(-1), 0.74 moll(-1) and 1.11 moll(-1)). strontium concentrations were analyzed chemically and migration at 5 microm and 15 microm depths was quantified by microprobe following fuji ortho lc application on the vestibular enamel of extracted teeth. results: strontium was found in appreciable amounts (0.8 wt.%) in superficial enamel, but in insignificant concentrations deeper in. at the same time, 8% fluoroapatite was formed in the enamel. under our experimental conditions, strontium had no significant antibacterial activity; only one log reduction of activity was observed at the highest concentrations tested. conclusions: rmgic releases strontium ions which are rapidly exchanged for calcium ions in the superficial enamel. no significant antibacterial activity was observed for strontium ions alone at the concentrations considered. however synergistic effects with fluoride could promote antibacterial activity.

TI  == multi-species biofilm formation on dental materials and an adhesive patch.
AB  == purpose: this laboratory study assessed the influence of surface roughness and contact time on the formation of a multi-species biofilm on dental materials (adhesive patch, composite, amalgam and enamel). materials and methods: rough and smooth specimens of each material were prepared and the mean surface roughness was assessed profilometrically. the biofilms were then allowed to grow either for 15 min or 15 h respectively on saliva-preconditioned specimens of each material,  and colony-forming units on blood agar were counted (n = 9/group) surface morphology was assessed using a scanning electron microscope. results: no difference was found in the biofilm formation rate among all the materials that were tested. after a short incubation period, a statistical significant difference between smooth and rough samples could be detected on amalgam and on the resin composite material (p < or = 0.001). conclusions: surface roughness may influence the initial biofilm adherence, but differences vanish following growth  and maturation. the multi-species biofilm offers a reliable laboratory model for  studying plaque formation.

AB  == the combined use of confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) and fluorescent in  situ hybridization (fish) offers new opportunities for analysis of the spatial relationships and temporal changes of specific members of the microbiota of intact dental biofilms. the purpose of this study was to analyse the patterns of  colonization and population dynamics of actinomyces naeslundii compared to streptococci and other bacteria during the initial 48 h of biofilm formation in the oral cavity. biofilms developed on standardized glass slabs mounted in intra-oral appliances worn by ten individuals for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h. the biofilms were subsequently labelled with probes against a. naeslundii (act476), streptococci (str405) or all bacteria (eub338), and were analysed by clsm. labelled bacteria were quantified by stereological tools. the results showed a notable increase in the number of streptococci and a. naeslundii over time, with  a tendency towards a slower growth rate for a. naeslundii compared with streptococci. a. naeslundii was located mainly in the inner part of the multilayered biofilm, indicating that it is one of the species that attaches directly to the acquired pellicle. the participation of a. naeslundii in the initial stages of dental biofilm formation may have important ecological consequences.

TI  == antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species.
AB  == objective: the aim was to evaluate the antibacterial effect of ozone on cariogenic bacterial species with and without the presence of saliva and a possible effect on the salivary proteins. methods: suspensions of actinomyces naeslundii (actcc 12104(t)), lactobacilli casei (n ctc 151) and streptococcus mutans (nctc 10449), in salt buffer or in saliva, were exposed to ozone gas delivered by the ozone generator healozone 2130c. aliquots of the suspensions were taken after 10, 30 and 60s ozone exposures and cultivated on agar plates. initial number of bacteria per ml was 8.0 x 10(7) (sd 2.2 x 10(7)) (a. naeslundii), 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 3.1 x 10(6)) (l. casei) and 1.0 x 10(8) (sd 7.0 x 10(5)) (s. mutans), respectively. the proteins were separated by sds electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. results: in salt buffer 92%, 73% and 64% of the initial numbers of a. naeslundii, s. mutans and l. casei, respectively, were killed already after 10s ozone exposure, while approximately 99.9% of the bacteria were dead after a 60s exposure. after 10 and 30s, but not after 60s exposure to ozone, s. mutans and l. casei were less efficiently killed  in saliva compared to the salt buffer. various saliva proteins were degraded by ozone after a 60s exposure. conclusions: the cariogenic species s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii were almost eliminated following 60s of ozone treatment.  this killing was reduced in the presence of saliva although increasing the ozone  application time to 60s overcame these reductants in saliva. detection of altered salivary proteins indicates that saliva components constitute additional targets  for ozone.

TI  == dental caries vaccine.
AB  == dental caries is one of the most common diseases in humans. in modern times, it has reached epidemic proportions. dental caries is an infectious microbiologic disease of the teeth that results in localized dissolution and destruction of the calcified tissue. dental caries is a mulitifactorial disease, which is caused by  host, agent, and environmental factors. the time factor is important for the development and progression of dental caries. a wide group of microorganisms are  identified from carious lesions of which s. mutans , lactobacillus acidophilus ,  and actinomyces viscosus are the main pathogenic species involved in the initiation and development of dental caries. in india, surveys done on school children showed caries prevalence of approximately 58%. surveys among the u.s. population showed an incidence of 45.3% in children and 93.8% in adults with either past or present coronal caries. huge amounts of money and time are spent in treating dental caries. hence, the prevention and control of dental caries is  the main aim of public health, eventually the ultimate objective of public health is the elimination of the disease itself. recently, dental caries vaccines have been developed for the prevention of dental caries. these dental caries vaccines  are still in the early stages.

AB  == the formation of dental biofilm caused by oral bacteria on tooth surfaces is the  primary step leading to oral diseases. this study was performed to investigate the preventive and reducing effects of panduratin a, isolated from kaempferia pandurata roxb., against multi-species oral biofilms consisting of streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of panduratin a was determined by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) broth microdilution assay. prevention of biofilm formation was performed on 96-well microtiter plates by coating panduratin a in mucin at 0.5-40 microg/ml, followed by biofilm formation at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the reducing effect on the preformed biofilm was tested by forming the biofilm at 37 degrees c for 24 h, followed by treatment with panduratin a at 0.2-10 microg/ml for up to 60 min. panduratin a showed a mic of 1 microg/ml for multi-species strains. panduratin a at 2 x mic for 8 h exhibited bactericidal activity against multi-species planktonic cells for 8 h. at 8 x mic, panduratin a was able to prevent biofilm formation by > 50%. biofilm mass was reduced by > 50% after exposure to panduratin a at 10 microg/ml for 15 min. panduratin a showed a  dose-dependent effect in preventing and reducing the biofilm. these results suggest that panduratin a is applicable as a natural anti-biofilm agent to eliminate oral bacterial colonization during early dental plaque formation.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 requires actinomyces naeslundii atcc 43146 for growth on saliva in a three-species community that includes streptococcus oralis  34.
AB  == formation of dental plaque is a developmental process involving initial and late  colonizing species that form polymicrobial communities. fusobacteria are the most numerous gram-negative bacteria in dental plaque, but they become prevalent after the initial commensal colonizers, such as streptococci and actinomyces, have established communities. the unusual ability of these bacteria to coaggregate with commensals, as well as pathogenic late colonizers, has been proposed to facilitate colonization by the latter organisms. we investigated the integration  of fusobacterium nucleatum into multispecies communities by employing two in vitro models with saliva as the sole nutritional source. in flow cell biofilms, numbers of cells were quantified using fluorescently conjugated antibodies against each species, and static biofilms were analyzed by quantitative real-time pcr (q-pcr) using species-specific primers. unable to grow as single-species biofilms, f. nucleatum grew in two-species biofilms with actinomyces naeslundii but not with streptococcus oralis. however, enhanced growth of fusobacteria was observed in three-species biofilms, indicating that there was multispecies cooperation. importantly, these community dynamics yielded an 18-fold increase in the f. nucleatum biomass between 4 h and 18 h in the flow cell inoculated with three species. q-pcr analysis of static biofilms revealed that maximum growth of  the three species occurred at 24 h to 36 h. lower numbers of cells were observed  at 48 h, suggesting that saliva could not support higher cell densities as the sole nutrient. integration of f. nucleatum into multispecies commensal communities was evident from the interdigitation of fusobacteria in coaggregates  with a. naeslundii and s. oralis and from the improved growth of fusobacteria, which was dependent on the presence of a. naeslundii.

TI  == an in vitro evaluation of hydrolytic enzymes as dental plaque control agents.
AB  == the plaque-control potential of commercially available amylase, lipase and protease was evaluated by observing their effects on coaggregation and on bacterial viability within various plaque microcosms. a quantitative coaggregation assay indicated that protease significantly inhibited the extent of coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis (p <0.05) and of porphyromonas gingivalis and s. oralis. amylase significantly (p <0.05) increased the coaggregation of a. naeslundii versus fusobacterium nucleatum and a. naeslundii versus p. gingivalis. concomitant challenge of constant-depth film fermenter-grown plaques with the enzymes did not result in detectable ecological  perturbations (assessed by differential culture and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis). similar dosing and analysis of multiple sorbarod devices did not reveal increases in bacterial dispersion which could result from disaggregation of extant plaques. a short-term hydroxyapatite colonization model  was therefore used to investigate possible enzyme effects on early-stage plaque development. whilst culture did not indicate significant reductions in adhesion or plaque accumulation, a vital visual assay revealed significantly increased aggregation frequency following enzyme exposure. in summary, although hydrolytic  enzymes negatively influenced binary coaggregation, they did not cause statistically significant changes in bacterial viability within plaque microcosms. in contrast, enzyme exposure increased aggregation within extant plaques.

TI  == correlations of oral bacterial arginine and urea catabolism with caries experience.
AB  == background/aim: alkali generation by oral bacteria plays a key role in plaque ph  homeostasis and may be a major impediment to the development of dental caries. to determine if the capacity of oral samples to produce ammonia from arginine or urea was related to caries experience, the arginine deiminase system (ads) and urease activity in saliva and dental plaque samples were measured in 45 adult subjects. methods: the subjects were divided into three groups according to caries status; 13 caries-free (cf) individuals (decayed, missing, and filled teeth = 0); 21 caries-active (ca) individuals (decayed teeth >or= 4); and 11 caries-experienced (ce) individuals (decayed teeth = 0; missing and filled teeth  > 0). real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the proportion of  certain acid- or alkali-producing organisms in the samples. results: the amount of ammonia generated from the test substrates by plaque samples was generally higher than that produced by salivary samples in all groups. significantly higher levels of salivary ads activity and plaque urease activity were observed in cf subjects compared to ca subjects (p = 0.0004 and p = 0.014, respectively). the proportions of streptococcus mutans from saliva and dental plaque of ca subjects  were significantly higher than those from the cf group (p = 0.0153 and p = 0.0009, respectively). in the ca group, there was an inverse relationship between urease activity and the levels of s. mutans (p < 0.0001). conclusion: this study  supports the theory that increased caries risk is associated with reduced alkali-generating capacity of the bacteria colonizing the oral cavity; providing  compelling evidence to further our understanding of oral alkali-generation in health and disease.

AB  == background/aim: we investigated the mechanisms of adherence of salivary and serum proteins, which mimic gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), to porphyromonas gingivalis, and the effects of these adhered proteins on coaggregation and hemagglutination properties. methods: the amounts of salivary and serum proteins  adhering to p. gingivalis were determined using (3)h-labeled and non-labeled proteins. the coaggregation between p. gingivalis and streptococcus oralis or streptococcus gordonii was observed. hemagglutination was evaluated using sheep erythrocytes. proteins that interacted with zinc or copper in saliva and serum and on p. gingivalis were examined using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. results: the amount of salivary or serum proteins that adhered to the surface of p. gingivalis strains was increased by cations, especially zinc and copper ions. the pretreatment of bacterial cells with salivary or serum proteins before the assay inhibited coaggregation with gram-positive bacteria and hemagglutination. these phenomena were enhanced by the presence of zinc or copper ions during the pretreatment of p. gingivalis with proteins. we detected protein bands that were related to these cations in saliva  and serum and on p. gingivalis. conclusions: our findings suggest that zinc and copper ions markedly enhanced the adhesion and accumulation of salivary and serum proteins on cells of p. gingivalis and inhibited the coaggregation and hemagglutination of p. gingivalis. these cations might be useful for limiting the settlement of p. gingivalis in the gingival sulcus with the goal of preventing periodontal disease.

AB  == aims: we evaluated the ability of a dual-species community of oral bacteria to produce the universal signalling molecule, autoinducer-2 (ai-2), in saliva-fed biofilms. methods and results: streptococcus oralis 34, s. oralis 34 luxs mutant  and actinomyces naeslundii t14v were grown as single- and dual-species biofilms within sorbarods fed with 25% human saliva. ai-2 concentration in biofilm effluents was determined by the vibrio harveyi bb170 bioluminescence assay. after homogenizing the sorbarods to release biofilm cells, cell numbers were determined by fluorometric analysis of fluorescent antibody-labelled cells. after 48 h, dual-species biofilm communities of interdigitated s. oralis 34 and a. naeslundii t14v contained 3.2 x 10(9) cells: fivefold more than single-species biofilms. however, these 48-h dual-species biofilms exhibited the lowest concentration ratio of ai-2 to cell density. conclusions: oral bacteria produce ai-2 in saliva-fed biofilms. the decrease of more than 10-fold in concentration ratio seen between 1 and 48 h in s. oralis 34-a. naeslundii t14v biofilms suggests that peak production of ai-2 occurs early and is followed by a very low steady-state level. significance and impact of the study: high oral bacterial biofilm densities may be achieved by inter-species ai-2 signalling. we propose that low concentrations of ai-2 contribute to the establishment of oral commensal biofilm  communities.

TI  == antibacterial properties of five bonding agents.
AB  == purpose: this study compared antibacterial properties of five bonding agents with that of a control, chlorhexidine (2.5%). products evaluated were the self-etch primers (-p) and adhesives (-a) of clearfil se bond (se-p; se-a) [kuraray dental], clearfil protect bond (pb-p; pb-a) [kuraray dental], optibond solo self-etch (os-p; os-a) [kerr] and the one-bottle products, self-etch clearfil tri-s bond (3s) [kuraray dental] and total-etch adper scotchbond 1 xt (xt) [3m espe]. methods: spread plates of three different bacteria (streptococcus mutans,  lactobacillus paracasei and actinomyces naeslundii) were prepared on casein-peptone-soymeal-peptone agar (caso-agar). controls, primers, adhesives, and primer & adhesive combinations were placed on standardized, sterilized filtration paper or composite disks and then placed on the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. inhibition zones were measured and data was statistically analyzed using the student t-test. an additional test was performed by which growth inhibiting of 1/10 and 1/100 dilutions of the test suspensions were measured spectrophotometrically as turbidity at 600 nm and expressed as percentage growth (%). results: compared to the controls, the only cured product which produced significant inhibition was scotchbond 1 xt (xt), and that for actinomyces naeslundii only. the primer of clearfil protect bond (pb-p)  showed statistically significant growth inhibition for all three test bacteria, the primer of se bond (se-p) had significant inhibitive properties against streptoccocus mutans and actinomyces naeslundii and the primer of optibond solo self-etch (os-p) inhibited growth of actinomyces naeslundii significantly. conclusions: the primers of clearfil protect bond, clearfil se bond, optibond solo self-etch and the product adper scotchbond 1 xt may be beneficial in eliminating remaining bacteria after cavity preparation, but further research on  a possible long-term antibacterial benefit of these products needs to be undertaken.

TI  == oral bacteria modulate invasion and induction of apoptosis in hep-2 cells by pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important opportunistic bacterial pathogen, causing  infections of the respiratory and other organ systems in susceptible hosts. p. aeruginosa infection is initiated by adhesion to and invasion of mucosal epithelial cells. the failure of host defenses to eliminate p. aeruginosa from mucosal surfaces results in p. aeruginosa proliferation, sometimes followed by overt infection and tissue destruction. there is growing evidence that associates poor oral health and respiratory infection. an in vitro model system for bacterial invasion of respiratory epithelial cells was used to investigate the influence of oral bacteria on p. aeruginosa epithelial cell invasion. oral pathogens including porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum and aggregatibacter (actinobacillus) actinomycetemcomitans increased invasion of p. aeruginosa into hep-2 cells from one- to threefold. in contrast, non-pathogenic oral bacteria such as actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus gordonii showed no significant influence on p. aeruginosa invasion. p. aeruginosa together with oral bacteria stimulated greater cytokine production from hep-2 cells than did p. aeruginosa alone. p. aeruginosa in combination with periodontal pathogens also increased apoptosis of hep-2 cells and induced elevated caspase-3 activity. these results suggest that oral bacteria, especially periodontal pathogens, may foster  p. aeruginosa invasion into respiratory epithelial cells to enhance host cell cytokine release and apoptosis.

TI  == microarray analysis of the microflora of root caries in elderly.
AB  == the present study used a new 16s rrna-based microarray with probes for over 300 bacterial species to better define the bacterial profiles of healthy root surfaces and root caries (rc) in the elderly. supragingival plaque was collected  from 20 healthy subjects (controls) and from healthy and carious roots and carious dentin from 21 rc subjects (patients). collectively, 179 bacterial species and species groups were detected. a higher bacterial diversity was observed in controls than in patients. lactobacillus casei/paracasei/rhamnosus and pseudoramibacter alactolyticus were notably associated with most rc samples.  streptococcus mutans was detected more frequently in the infected dentin than in  the other samples, but the difference was not significant. actinomyces was found  more frequently in controls. thus, species other than actinomyces and s. mutans may play a role as pathogens of rc. the results from this study were in general agreement with those of our previous study based on 16s rrna gene sequencing.

TI  == factors affecting human supragingival biofilm composition. ii. tooth position.
AB  == background and objective: little is known regarding the factors that affect the microbial composition of supragingival biofilms. this study was designed to test  the hypothesis that tooth location affects the microbial composition of supragingival plaque beyond the effect due to plaque mass as reflected by total dna probe count. material and methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from the mesiobuccal aspect of each tooth in 187 subjects (n = 4745 samples). all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences in mean species counts and proportions were determined among tooth surfaces and six tooth type categories: molars, bicuspids, incisors/canines in the mandible and maxilla  separately using the kruskal-wallis test. stepwise multiple linear regression was employed to examine the relationship between species proportions and total dna probe count, tooth location, periodontal and smoking status, age and sex. results: all species differed significantly among tooth types and among the six tooth categories. higher plaque levels were seen on molars and lower incisors. some differences observed between tooth types could be partly explained by the level of plaque. teeth with high plaque mass exhibited high levels of capnocytophaga gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, campylobacter rectus and campylobacter showae. however, certain species, such as veillonella parvula and streptococcus sanguinis, differed significantly at different tooth locations despite similarities in plaque mass. twenty of the test species exhibited a significant association with tooth location after adjusting for total dna probe count and subject level factors. conclusion: while plaque mass was associated with differences in proportions of many species in supragingival biofilms, tooth location also was strongly associated with species proportions in both univariate and multivariate analyses.

TI  == anticaries effect of compounds extracted from galla chinensis in a multispecies biofilm model.
AB  == introduction: galla chinensis is a leaf gall known to have some antibacterial effects. using an in vitro biofilm model of dental plaque, the present study aimed to evaluate the anticaries effects of galla chinensis and its chemical fractions. methods: a four-organism bacterial consortium (streptococcus sanguis,  streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus rhamnosus) was grown  on hydroxyapatite (ha) discs, bovine enamel blocks, and glass surfaces in a continuous culture system and exposed to repeated solution pulses. galla chinensis extracts, sucrose solutions, and sodium fluoride solutions were pulsed  into different flow cells. the ph value of the planktonic phase in each flow cell was recorded and the bacteria colonizing the biofilm on the ha discs were counted. enamel blocks were observed using a polarized microscope and lesion depth was evaluated. the biofilm morphology was examined with a fluorescence microscope and the images captured were analyzed on an image analysis system. results: when galla chinensis extract, its chemical fraction, or fluoride was added to the sucrose solution, the planktonic phase ph remained higher than that  in the sucrose alone. a lower level of colonization on the ha surface was also observed in the groups to which galla chinensis and fluoride were added compared  with the control sucrose group, and this was reflected in both the total viable count and the biofilm imaging, which showed fewer cariogenic bacteria and a less  compact biofilm, respectively. enamel demineralization in both the fluoride group and the galla chinensis group was significantly less than that in the sucrose group. conclusions: galla chinensis and fluoride may inhibit the cariogenicity of the oral biofilm. galla chinensis appears to be a promising source of new agents  that may prevent dental caries.

TI  == mlpa diagnostics of complex microbial communities: relative quantification of bacterial species in oral biofilms.
AB  == a multitude of molecular methods are currently used for identification and characterization of oral biofilms or for community profiling. however, multiplex  pcr techniques that are able to routinely identify several species in a single assay are not available. multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (mlpa)  identifies up to 45 unique fragments in a single tube pcr. here we report a novel use of mlpa in the relative quantification of targeted microorganisms in a community of oral microbiota. we designed 9 species specific probes for: actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces odontolyticus, candida albicans, lactobacillus acidophilus, rothia dentocariosa, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis and veillonella parvula; and genus specific probes for selected oral streptococci and lactobacilli based on their 16s rdna sequences. mlpa analysis of dna pooled from the strains showed the expected specific mlpa products. relative quantification of a serial dilution of equimolar dna showed that as little as 10 pg templates can be detected with clearly discernible signals. moreover, a 2 to 7% divergence in relative signal ratio of amplified probes observed from normalized peak area values suggests mlpa can be a cheaper alternative to using qpcr for quantification. we observed 2 to 6 fold fluctuations in signal intensities of mlpa products in dnas isolated from multispecies biofilms grown in various media for various culture times. furthermore, mlpa analyses of dna isolated from saliva obtained from different donors gave a varying number and intensity of signals. this clearly shows the usefulness of mlpa in a quantitative description of microbial shifts.

TI  == influence of a chitosan on oral bacterial adhesion and growth in vitro.
AB  == generally, mechanical plaque control without chemical support is insufficient to  prevent oral diseases, and an ongoing quest exists for new antimicrobials for use in oral healthcare. chitosans are polycationic, naturally occurring antimicrobials that are rapidly finding their way into oral healthcare. in this study we determined the effects of pellicle treatment with chitosan on bacterial  adhesion and growth. chitosan caused a reduction in bacterial adhesion and was responsible for bacterial death upon contact compared with a buffer control. exposure of adhering bacteria to a chitosan solution or a buffer control did not  cause detachment, but the chitosan solution left a small proportion of the adhering bacteria alive. growth after exposure to chitosan was similar to (streptococcus mutans atcc700610, streptococcus oralis hm1, streptococcus sobrinus hg1025) or less than (s. mutans ns, actinomyces naeslundii hm1) that of  the control, while biofilm viability after chitosan treatment was lower than that of the control, except for s. oralis hm1. therefore, chitosan is a promising antimicrobial for use in oral healthcare.

TI  == antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt (qas) monomers on bacteria associated with oral infections.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test the antibacterial effects of three experimental quaternary ammonium salt monomers in order to evaluate their potential applications as dental materials. in vitro susceptibility testing of the monomers was performed by the broth dilution method on bacteria associated with oral infections: streptococcus mutans atcc 25175, actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987, staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and lactobacillus casei atcc 393. the time-kill  kinetics of the monomer with relatively higher antibacterial activity against s.  mutans were also investigated. it was found that all the tested bacteria strains  were susceptible to the three monomers, among which methacryloxylethyl cetyl ammonium chloride (dmae-cb) exhibited the lowest minimal inhibitory concentrations, ranging from 1.2 to 4.8 microg/ml. the time-kill curve showed that dmae-cb achieved 99.44% killing at 19.2 microg/ml (4 times the minimal bactericidal concentration) against s. mutans after 1 min and 100% killing within 10 min of contact. this result indicates that the quaternary ammonium salt monomer dmae-cb may be a candidate antibacterial agent for incorporation into dental restorative materials.

TI  == effects of low-energy shock waves on oral bacteria.
AB  == we have recently demonstrated that extracorporeal shock-wave therapy (eswt) is effective in promoting the healing of dermal wounds and in regenerating alveolar  bone lost through periodontal disease. the objective of the present study was to  determine any antibacterial effect of eswt on oral bacteria. monoculture suspensions of 6 bacterial species were treated with 100 to 500 pulses of eswt at energy flux densities (efd) of 0.12 mj/mm(2), 0.22 mj/mm(2), and 0.3 mj/mm(2). following treatment, aliquots were plated for viability determination and compared with untreated controls. eswt showed a significant microbicidal effect for streptococcus mutans and an unencapsulated strain of porphyromonas gingivalis following as few as 100 pulses at 0.3 mj/mm(2) (p <or= 0.001). in addition, a significant disruption of bacterial aggregates was observed at lower efds. no significant reduction in viability was observed for all other bacteria at efds and pulses tested (p > 0.05). these findings suggest that low-energy eswt may be  bactericidal for selected oral bacteria.

TI  == role of hydrogen peroxide in competition and cooperation between streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == in dental plaque alpha-haemolytic streptococci, including streptococcus gordonii, are considered beneficial for oral health. these organisms produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) at concentrations sufficient to kill many oral bacteria. streptococci do not produce catalase yet tolerate h(2)o(2). we recently demonstrated that coaggregation with actinomyces naeslundii stabilizes arginine biosynthesis in s. gordonii. protein arginine residues are sensitive to oxidation by h(2)o(2). here, the ability of a. naeslundii to protect s. gordonii against self-produced h(2)o(2) was investigated. coaggregation with a. naeslundii enabled s. gordonii to grow in the absence of arginine, and promoted survival of s. gordonii following growth with or without added arginine. arginine-replete s. gordonii monocultures contained 20-30 microm h(2)o(2) throughout exponential growth. actinomyces naeslundii did not produce h(2)o(2) but synthesized catalase, removed h(2)o(2) from coaggregate cultures and decreased protein oxidation in s.  gordonii. on solid medium, s. gordonii inhibited growth of a. naeslundii; exogenous catalase overcame this inhibition. in coaggregate cultures, a. naeslundii cell numbers were >90% lower than in monocultures after 24 h. these results indicate that coaggregation with a. naeslundii protects s. gordonii from  oxidative damage. however, high cell densities of s. gordonii inhibit a. naeslundii. therefore, h(2)o(2) may drive these organisms towards an ecologically balanced community in natural dental plaque.

TI  == effect of starch and sucrose on dental biofilm formation and on root dentine demineralization.
AB  == the cariogenicity of starch alone or in combination with sucrose is controversial and the effect on dentine demineralization and on the dental biofilm formed has not been explored under controlled conditions. a crossover, single-blind study was conducted in four steps of 14 days each, during which 11 volunteers wore palatal appliance containing 10 slabs of root dentine to which the following treatments were applied extraorally: 2% starch gel-like solution (starch group);  10% sucrose solution (sucrose group); a solution containing 2% starch and 10% sucrose (starch + sucrose group), or 2% starch solution followed by 10% sucrose solution (starch --> sucrose group). on the 14th day of each phase the biofilms were collected for biochemical and microbiological analyses, and dentine demineralization was assessed by hardness. a higher demineralization was found in dentine exposed to sucrose and starch sucrose combinations than to starch alone (p < 0.01), but the sucrose-containing groups did not differ significantly from each other (p > 0.05). the concentrations of soluble and insoluble extracellular  polysaccharides (eps), and the proportion of insoluble eps, were lower in the biofilm formed in presence of starch (p < 0.01) than in those formed in the presence of sucrose or sucrose/starch combinations; however, no significant difference was observed among the groups containing sucrose (p > 0.05). rna was successfully isolated and purified from in situ biofilms and only biofilms formed in response to sucrose and starch/sucrose combinations showed detectable levels of gtfb and gtfc mrna. the findings suggest that the combination of starch with sucrose may not be more cariogenic to dentine than sucrose alone.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  == human beta-defensin-3 (hbd3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. this study aimed to obtain recombinant hbd3 (rhbd3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of hbd3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. genetic engineering was used to obtain active rhbd3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only staphylococcus aureus and escherichia  coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals,  including fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella melaninogenica, peptostreptococcus  anaerobius, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. in an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rhbd3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. the ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. we conclude that hbd3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.

AB  == empyema necessitatis is a rare complication of empyema in which the pleural infection spreads outside of the pleural space to involve the soft tissues of the chest wall. most cases of empyema necessitatis are related to mycobacterium tuberculosis and, less commonly, to actinomyces spp. and streptococcus spp. staphylococcus aureus has rarely been reported as the causative agent of empyema  necessitatis, with the majority of s. aureus isolates being methicillin sensitive. only two cases of empyema necessitatis due to methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) have been reported in the medical literature. we report the case of a 59-year-old caucasian male who presented to our institution with complaints of  pain in and swelling of his left upper chest of 2-months duration. a computed tomography scan of the chest showed an 8.1- by 6.5-cm lesion which extended from  the left upper lobe of the lung into the extrathoracic soft tissues beneath the left upper pectoralis muscle. a wedge resection of the left upper lung lobe revealed lung tissue with an organized pneumonia-like pattern associated with marked acute pleuritis. blood and urine cultures and cultures of the left chest soft tissue mass grew mrsa. the patient was successfully treated with vancomycin  followed by a 10-day outpatient course of ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. this case represents an extremely rare manifestation of an increasingly dangerous bacterial pathogen.

TI  == bond strengthening in oral bacterial adhesion to salivary conditioning films.
AB  == transition from reversible to irreversible bacterial adhesion is a highly relevant but poorly understood step in initial biofilm formation. we hypothesize  that in oral biofilm formation, irreversible adhesion is caused by bond strengthening due to specific bacterial interactions with salivary conditioning films. here, we compared the initial adhesion of six oral bacterial strains to salivary conditioning films with their adhesion to a bovine serum albumin (bsa) coating and related their adhesion to the strengthening of the binding forces measured with bacteria-coated atomic force microscopy cantilevers. all strains adhered in higher numbers to salivary conditioning films than to bsa coatings, and specific bacterial interactions with salivary conditioning films were accompanied by stronger initial adhesion forces. bond strengthening occurred on a time scale of several tens of seconds and was slower for actinomyces than for streptococci. nonspecific interactions between bacteria and bsa coatings strengthened twofold faster than their specific interactions with salivary conditioning films, likely because specific interactions require a closer approach of interacting surfaces with the removal of interfacial water and a more extensive rearrangement of surface structures. after bond strengthening, bacterial adhesion forces with a salivary conditioning film remained stronger than those with bsa coatings.

TI  == evaluation of the antimicrobial, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory activities of hydroxychavicol for its potential use as an oral care agent.
AB  == hydroxychavicol isolated from the chloroform extraction of aqueous extract of piper betle leaves showed inhibitory activity against oral cavity pathogens. it exhibited an inhibitory effect on all of the oral cavity pathogens tested (mics of 62.5 to 500 microg/ml) with a minimal bactericidal concentration that was twofold greater than the inhibitory concentration. hydroxychavicol exhibited concentration-dependent killing of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 up to 4x mic and also prevented the formation of water-insoluble glucan. interestingly, hydroxychavicol exhibited an extended postantibiotic effect of 6 to 7 h and prevented the emergence of mutants of s. mutans atcc 25175 and actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987 at 2x mic. furthermore, it also inhibited the growth of biofilms generated by s. mutans and a. viscosus and reduced the preformed biofilms by these bacteria. increased uptake of propidium iodide by hydroxychavicol-treated cells of s. mutans and a. viscosus indicated that hydroxychavicol probably works through the disruption of the permeability barrier of microbial membrane structures. hydroxychavicol also exhibited potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. this was evident from its concentration-dependent inhibition of lipid peroxidation and significant suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha expression in human neutrophils. its efficacy against adherent cells of s. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose suggests that hydroxychavicol would be a useful compound for  the development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and that it has great potential for use in mouthwash for preventing and treating oral infections.

TI  == removal and prevention of dental plaque with d-tagatose.
AB  == dental plaque develops when early bacterial colonizers adhere to the acquired pellicle (saliva-derived proteinous coating on the tooth surface) followed by adhesion of late interspecies colonizers to form this type of biofilm (coaggregation). in developing a d-tagatose-based toothpaste, we examined 15 oral isolates, including both early colonizers (streptococcus and actinomyces) and late colonizers (fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, veillonella, capnocytophaga, and actinobacillus), and tested them for their ability to coaggregate with each other. we then tested the ability of d-tagatose to reverse  any such coaggregations. coaggregation was examined visually and scored by using  a system ranging from 0, for no visible coaggregation to 4, for maximum coaggregation. d-tagatose, at a concentration of less than 750 mm, completely reversed the coaggregation of 17 (60%) of 28 strongly coaggregating pairs (coaggregation score = 2 or higher) tested. in contrast, d-sorbitol had little reversal effect. d-tagatose-sensitive coaggregations were d-galactose-reversible  as well. d-tagatose acted on both early and late colonizers; both groups, especially the late colonizers, were frequently involved in periodontal diseases. thus, d-tagatose has the potential for preventing and removing plaque development and for altering the subgingival microbiota. these effective qualities offer conservative control of gingival and periodontal disease.

TI  == predominant bacteria recovered from a periodontitis site in a hamster model raised by silk-ligature with porphyromonas gingivalis infection.
AB  == we isolated oral bacteria that coexisted with porphyromonas gingivalis in a hamster periodontitis model. as predominant bacteria in the periodontitis site, collinsella-reltaed strains, eubacterium-reltaed strains, streptococcus suis-related strains, and veillonella parvula-reltaed strains were detected. in addition, actinomyces, bacteroides, and p. gingivalis were also isolated predominantly. the results suggest that the bacterial composition of the periodontitis site in hamsters is complex, as in human periodontitis.

TI  == antimicrobial effectiveness of an herbal mouthrinse compared with an essential oil and a chlorhexidine mouthrinse.
AB  == background: the authors investigated mouthrinses' antimicrobial effectiveness against predominant oral bacteria, as determined by the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic). specifically, they evaluated an herbal mouthrinse, an essential oil rinse and a 0.12 percent chlorhexidine gluconate rinse. methods: the authors assessed the inhibitory effects of the three test agents against 40 oral bacteria at concentrations of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 micrograms per millliter. they inoculated plates containing basal medium and the  test agents with suspensions of the test species and incubated them anaerobically at 35 degrees c. the authors interpreted the mic as the lowest concentration of the agent that completely inhibited the growth of the test species. results: the  herbal mouthrinse inhibited the growth of most of the 40 test species. compared with the essential oil mouthrinse, the herbal mouthrinse exhibited significantly  lower mics for actinomyces species, periodontal pathogens eubacterium nodatum, tannerella forsythia and prevotella species, as well as the cariogenic pathogen streptococcus mutans. the chlorhexidine gluconate rinse had the lowest mics compared with the essential oil rinse and the herbal rinse for all test species examined. conclusions: although less potent than the chlorhexidine gluconate rinse, the herbal rinse was more effective than the essential oil rinse in inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria in vitro. clinical implications: the data  suggest that the herbal mouthrinse may provide oral health benefits by inhibiting the growth of periodontal and cariogenic pathogens. in vivo clinical testing is essential to confirm in vitro results.

TI  == prevalence, intensity and nature of bacteraemia after toothbrushing.
AB  == objective: to estimate the prevalence, intensity and microbial identity of bacteraemia associated with toothbrushing. methods: a total of 141 children and adolescents, aged between 3 and 17 years, having dental treatment under general anaesthesia at the eastman dental hospital were recruited. six millilitre of blood was taken before toothbrushing (baseline) with (1) oral b 30 toothbrush or  (2) braun or (3) sonicare electric toothbrush or (4) dental handpiece and rubber  cup. a second 6-ml sample was taken 30s after toothbrushing. all blood samples were processed using lysis filtration and bacteria were identified to species level. results: there was a significantly greater prevalence of bacteraemia following the dental handpiece only (p=0.02). there was a significantly greater aerobic and anaerobic intensity of bacteraemia following brushing with both the sonicare (p=0.03 and p=0.05) and the dental handpiece (p=0.001 and p=0.005). conclusions: toothbrushing causes a bacteraemia that is often statistically significantly greater than baseline. toothbrushing is an important contributory factor in cumulative dental bacteraemia.

TI  == impact of growth conditions on susceptibility of five microbial species to alkaline stress.
AB  == the effects of different growth conditions on the susceptibility of five taxa to  alkaline stress were investigated. enterococcus faecalis atcc 29212, streptococcus sobrinus omz 176, candida albicans atcc 90028, actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104, and fusobacterium nucleatum atcc 10953 were grown as planktonic cells, allowed to adhere to dentin for 24 hours, grown as monospecies  or multispecies biofilms on dentin under anaerobic conditions with a serum-enriched nutrient supply at 37 degrees c for 5 days. in addition, suspended biofilm microorganisms and 5-day old planktonic multispecies cultures were used.  microbial recovery upon direct exposure to saturated calcium hydroxide solution (ph 12.5) for 10 and 100 minutes was compared with control exposure to physiologic saline. planktonic microorganisms were most susceptible; only e. faecalis and c. albicans survived in saturated solution for 10 minutes, the latter also for 100 minutes. dentin adhesion was the major factor in improving the resistance of e. faecalis and a. naeslundii to calcium hydroxide, whereas the multispecies context in a biofilm was the major factor in promoting resistance of s. sobrinus to the disinfectant. in contrast, the c. albicans response to calcium hydroxide was not influenced by the growth condition. adherence to dentin and interspecies interactions in a biofilm appear to differentially affect the sensitivity of microbial species to calcium hydroxide.

TI  == microbial complexes in supragingival plaque.
AB  == background/aims: to examine microbial communities in supragingival biofilm samples. methods: supragingival plaque samples were taken from 187 subjects at baseline (n = 4745). fifty-five subjects provided supragingival plaque samples at 1-7 days after professional tooth cleaning (n = 1456); 93 subjects provided 8044  samples between 3 and 24 months post-therapy. all samples were individually analyzed for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. microbial associations among species were sought using cluster analysis and community ordination techniques for the three groups separately. results: six complexes were formed for the baseline samples. similar complexes were formed for the samples taken 3-24 months post-therapy. however, distinct changes were observed in microbial communities in samples taken during the 7 days of plaque redevelopment. the complexes related to clinical parameters of periodontal disease. conclusion: there were specific microbial complexes in supragingival plaque that were similar to those found in subgingival plaque samples with a few minor differences. the relation of previously unclustered taxa to the complexes was also described.

TI  == salivary gel-forming mucin muc5b--a nutrient for dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == introduction: model systems with oral bacteria from dental plaque have demonstrated that the utilization of complex glycoproteins as a food source cannot be undertaken by single species but requires concerted degradation by a multi-species consortium, with each member contributing one or a few hydrolytic enzymes. unlike previous studies, the aim of the present investigation was to explore the ability of fresh dental plaque to degrade salivary mucin, muc5b, isolated by methods designed to retain intact the natural polymeric structure and physiological conformation, in an attempt to mimic the naturally occurring interaction between the oral microbiota and salivary mucins. methods: human salivary muc5b was isolated from whole saliva by density-gradient centrifugation  and incubated with freshly isolated supragingival dental plaque with samples subjected to fluorescent staining for viability and metabolic activity. in addition, the degradation of muc5b oligosaccharide side chains was studied using  a lectin assay, recognizing three different carbohydrate epitopes commonly found  on mucin oligosaccharide side chains. results: the addition of purified salivary  muc5b elicited a strong metabolic response from the biofilm cells, whereas individual strains of streptococcus oralis and streptococcus gordonii isolated from the same plaque were not able to utilize the muc5b. the degradation of terminal saccharide moieties on the muc5b was demonstrated by a marked decrease in both sialic acid and fucose reactivity. conclusion: these results have shown that dental plaque is capable of utilizing human salivary muc5b as a nutrient source, a process possibly requiring the synergistic degradation of the molecule  by a consortium of oral bacteria in the plaque community.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == bacterial profiles of root caries in elderly patients.
AB  == culture-based studies have shown that streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli are associated with root caries (rc). the purpose of the present study was to assess  the bacterial diversity of rc in elderly patients by use of culture-independent molecular techniques and to determine the associations of specific bacterial species or bacterial communities with healthy and carious roots. plaque was collected from root surfaces of 10 control subjects with no rc and from 11 subjects with rc. the bacterial 16s rrna genes from extracted dna were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identity. from a total of 3,544 clones, 245 predominant species or phylotypes were observed, representing eight bacterial phyla. the majority (54%) of the species detected have not yet been cultivated. species of selenomonas and veillonella were common in all samples. the healthy microbiota included fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. polymorphum, leptotrichia spp., selenomonas noxia, streptococcus cristatus, and kingella oralis. lactobacilli were absent, s. mutans was present in one, and actinomyces spp. were present in 50% of the controls. in contrast, the microbiota of the rc subjects was dominated by actinomyces spp., lactobacilli, s. mutans, enterococcus faecalis, selenomonas sp. clone cs002, atopobium and olsenella spp., prevotella multisaccharivorax, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and propionibacterium sp. strain fma5. the bacterial profiles of rc showed considerable subject-to-subject variation, indicating that the microbial communities are more complex than previously presumed. the data suggest that putative etiological agents of rc include not only s. mutans, lactobacilli, and actinomyces but also species of atopobium, olsenella, pseudoramibacter, propionibacterium, and selenomonas.

TI  == regulation of gene expression in a mixed-genus community: stabilized arginine biosynthesis in streptococcus gordonii by coaggregation with actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == interactions involving genetically distinct bacteria, for example, between oral streptococci and actinomyces, are central to dental plaque development. a dna microarray identified streptococcus gordonii genes regulated in response to coaggregation with actinomyces naeslundii. the expression of 23 genes changed >3-fold in coaggregates, including that of 9 genes involved in arginine biosynthesis and transport. the capacity of s. gordonii to synthesize arginine was assessed using a chemically defined growth medium. in monoculture, streptococcal arginine biosynthesis was inefficient and streptococci could not grow aerobically at low arginine concentrations. in dual-species cultures containing coaggregates, however, s. gordonii grew to high cell density at low arginine concentrations. equivalent cocultures without coaggregates showed no growth until coaggregation was evident (9 h). an argh mutant was unable to grow at low arginine concentrations with or without a. naeslundii, indicating that arginine biosynthesis was essential for coaggregation-induced streptococcal growth. using quantitative reverse transcriptase pcr, the expression of argc, argg, and pyra(b) was strongly (10- to 100-fold) up-regulated in s. gordonii monocultures after 3 h of growth when exogenous arginine was depleted. cocultures without induced coaggregation showed similar regulation. however, within 1 h after coaggregation with a. naeslundii, the expression of argc, argg, and pyra(b) in s. gordonii was partially up-regulated although arginine was plentiful, and mrna levels did not increase further when arginine was diminished. thus, a. naeslundii stabilizes s. gordonii expression of arginine biosynthesis genes in coaggregates but not cocultures and enables aerobic growth when exogenous arginine is limited.

TI  == molecular identification of bacteria on the tongue dorsum of subjects with and without halitosis.
AB  == aim: compare the microbial profiles on the tongue dorsum in patients with halitosis and control subjects in a uk population using culture-independent techniques. materials and methods: halitosis patients were screened according to  our recently developed recruitment protocol. scrapings from the tongue dorsum were obtained for 12 control subjects and 20 halitosis patients. bacteria were identified by pcr amplification, cloning and sequencing of 16s rrna genes. results: the predominant species found in the control samples were lysobacter-type species, streptococcus salivarius, veillonella dispar, unidentified oral bacterium, actinomyces odontolyticus, atopobium parvulum and veillonella atypica. in the halitosis samples, lysobacter-type species, s. salivarius, prevotella melaninogenica, unidentified oral bacterium, prevotella veroralis and prevotella pallens were the most commonly found species. for the control samples, 13-16 (4.7-5.8%) of 276 clones represented uncultured species, whereas in the halitosis samples, this proportion increased to 6.5-9.6% (36-53 of 553 clones). in the control samples, 22 (8.0%) of 276 clones represented potentially novel phylotypes, and in the halitosis samples, this figure was 39 (7.1%) of 553 clones. conclusions: the microflora associated with the tongue dorsum is complex in both the control and halitosis groups, but several key species predominate in both groups.

TI  == interactions between salivary bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacteria: in vitro coaggregation and coadhesion assays.
AB  == coaggregation assays were performed to investigate interactions between oral bifidobacterium adolescentis and other oral bacterial species. bifidobacterium adolescentis olb6410 isolated from the saliva of healthy humans did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii jcm8350, streptococcus mitis ols3293, streptococcus sanguinis jcm5708, veillonella parvula atcc17745 or porphyromonas gingivalis ob7124, but it did coaggregate with fusobacterium nucleatum jcm8532. subsequent examination of biofilm formation on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite discs using fish revealed that b. adolescentis olb6410 could not directly adhere to the coated discs. it did, however, adhere to biofilms of a. naeslundii, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum, although it did not coaggregate with a. naeslundii nor with v.  parvula. these results suggest that the adhesion of b. adolescentis to tooth surfaces is mediated by other oral bacteria. heat- or proteinase k-treated f. nucleatum could not coaggregate with b. adolescentis. similarly, the coaggregation and coadhesion of proteinase k-treated b. adolescentis were strongly inhibited. it is therefore probable that proteinaceous factors on the cellular surface of b. adolescentis and f. nucleatum are involved in their interaction. the data presented in this study add to our understanding of bifidobacterial colonization in the human oral cavity.

TI  == smap29 congeners demonstrate activity against oral bacteria and reduced toxicity  against oral keratinocytes.
AB  == introduction: cathelicidins are antimicrobial peptides found in epithelial and mucosal tissues as well as the secondary granules of neutrophils. smap29, a sheep cathelicidin, has differential antimicrobial properties against various pathogens, including periodontal organisms. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial properties and cytotoxicity of smap29, smap28, and three congeners (smap18a, smap18d, and smap14a). methods: the peptides at concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 250 microg/ml were tested for their activity  against multiple strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, and porphyromonas gingivalis using a radial diffusion assay. cytotoxicity of keratinocytes was evaluated by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release after incubation with the individual peptides. results: smap28, thought to be the biologically active peptide, was the most potent antimicrobial (range of minimum  inhibitory concentrations 0.06-7.03 microg/ml, p < 0.05); however, the activity of smap28 and smap29 was strongly associated (r = 0.933). the congeners also demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested (range of minimum inhibitory concnetrations 0.21-79 microg/ml). overall, f. nucleatum was the most  susceptible organism, while p. gingivalis was the least susceptible. keratinocyte cytotoxicity was dependent on peptide length and dose. smap28 was the most cytotoxic, while smap14a was the least cytotoxic. conclusion: the antimicrobial activities against oral microorganisms and the minimal toxicity seen in this study suggest that the congeners of smap29 may serve as an alternative to traditional antibiotics in the prevention and treatment of periodontal and other  oral diseases.

TI  == direct visualization of spatial and temporal patterns of antimicrobial action within model oral biofilms.
AB  == a microscopic method for noninvasively visualizing the action of an antimicrobial agent inside a biofilm was developed and applied to describe spatial and temporal patterns of mouthrinse activity on model oral biofilms. three species biofilms of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and actinomyces naeslundii were grown in glass capillary flow cells. bacterial cells were stained with the fluorogenic esterase substrate calcien am (cam). loss of green fluorescence upon  exposure to an antimicrobial formulation was subsequently imaged by time-lapse confocal laser scanning microscopy. when an antimicrobial mouthrinse containing chlorhexidine digluconate was administered, a gradual loss of green fluorescence  was observed that began at the periphery of cell clusters where they adjoined the flowing bulk fluid and progressed inward over a time period of several minutes. image analysis was performed to quantify a penetration velocity of 4 mum/min. an  enzyme-based antimicrobial formulation led to a gradual, continually slowing loss of fluorescence in a pattern that was qualitatively different from the behavior observed with chlorhexidine. ethanol at 11.6% had little effect on the biofilm. none of these treatments resulted in the removal of biomass from the biofilm. most methods to measure or visualize antimicrobial action in biofilms are destructive. spatial information is important because biofilms are known for their structural and physiological heterogeneity. the cam staining technique has  the potential to provide information about the rate of antimicrobial penetration, the presence of tolerant subpopulations, and the extent of biomass removal effected by a treatment.

TI  == bacteria of dental caries in primary and permanent teeth in children and young adults.
AB  == although streptococcus mutans has been implicated as a major etiological agent of dental caries, our cross-sectional preliminary study indicated that 10% of subjects with rampant caries in permanent teeth do not have detectable levels of  s. mutans. our aims were to use molecular methods to detect all bacterial species associated with caries in primary and permanent teeth and to determine the bacterial profiles associated with different disease states. plaque was collected from 39 healthy controls and from intact enamel and white-spot lesions, dentin lesions, and deep-dentin lesions in each of 51 subjects with severe caries. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, and sequenced to determine species identities. in a reverse-capture checkerboard assay, 243 samples were analyzed for 110 prevalent bacterial species. a sequencing analysis of 1,285 16s rrna clones detected 197 bacterial species/phylotypes, of which 50% were not cultivable. twenty-two new phylotypes were identified. proc mixed tests revealed  health- and disease-associated species. in subjects with s. mutans, additional species, e.g., species of the genera atopobium, propionibacterium, and lactobacillus, were present at significantly higher levels than those of s. mutans. lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium dentium, and low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in subjects with no detectable s. mutans. actinomyces spp. and non-s. mutans streptococci were predominant in white-spot lesions, while known acid producers were found at their highest levels later in disease. bacterial profiles change with disease states and differ between primary and secondary dentitions. bacterial species other than s. mutans, e.g., species of the genera veillonella, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, and propionibacterium, low-ph non-s. mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp., and atopobium spp., likely play important roles in caries progression.

TI  == reduction of periodontal pathogens adhesion by antagonistic strains.
AB  == introduction: periodontitis results from a shift in the subgingival microflora into a more pathogenic direction with porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans considered as periodontopathogens. in many cases, treatment procures only a temporary shift towards a less pathogenic microflora. an alternative treatment could be the deliberate colonization of pockets with antagonistic microorganisms to control the adhesion of periodontopathogens. the aim of this study was to identify bacterial strains that reduce adhesion of periodontopathogens to surfaces. methods: streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus crista, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, and haemophilus parainfluenzae were  evaluated as potential antagonists against p. gingivalis atcc 33277, p. intermedia atcc 49046, and a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718 as periodontopathogens. adhesion of periodontopathogens to the bottom plate of a parallel plate flow chamber was studied in the absence (control) and the presence of pre-adhering antagonistic strains up to a surface coverage of 5%. results: the largest reduction caused by antagonistic strains was observed for p. gingivalis.  all antagonistic strains except s. crista atcc 49999 inhibited the adhesion of p. gingivalis by at least 1.6 cells per adhering antagonist, with the largest significant reduction observed for a. naeslundii atcc 51655 (3.8 cells per adhering antagonist). adhering antagonists had a minimal effect on the adhesion of a. actinomycetemcomitans atcc 43718. intermediate but significant reductions were perceived for p. intermedia, most notably caused by s. mitis bms. conclusion: the adhesion of p. gingivalis was inhibited best by antagonistic strains, while s. mitis bms appeared to be the most successful antagonist.

TI  == bacterial composition and red fluorescence of plaque in relation to primary and secondary caries next to composite: an in situ study.
AB  == background/hypothesis: secondary caries has been suggested as the main reason for restoration replacement. we hypothesized that more caries-associated bacteria are found on composite resin restoration material, compared to sound tooth tissue. methods: both restored and unrestored dentin and enamel samples were placed in a  full denture of eight subjects for 20 weeks. the microbiological composition of approximal plaque and the association between caries-associated bacteria and red  autofluorescence of dental plaque was studied. every 4 weeks the specimens were microradiographed using transversal wavelength independent microradiography (t-wim). after 1 and 20 weeks red fluorescence pictures and plaque samples were taken. samples were cultured for total anaerobic counts, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, candida and actinomyces odontolyticus. results: lesion depth in the dentin and enamel was positively associated with lactobacilli, and lesion depth in dentin was positively associated with a. odontolyticus, whereas no association was found between mutans streptococci and lesion depth. the red-fluorescent bacteria a. odontolyticus and lactobacilli did not correlate with red-fluorescent plaque, indicating that red fluorescence is probably not caused by a single species of these bacteria. after 20 weeks, a higher proportion of combined mutans streptococci and lactobacilli was found on restored tissue compared to non-restored tissue (p = 0.04). conclusion: the higher proportion of caries-associated bacteria on restored tissue indicates that the ecology on the surface of primary lesions differs from that on lesions next to composite, and that secondary caries next to composite may differ from the primary caries process.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of mahonia aquifolium and two of its alkaloids against oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts or alkaloids isolated from mahonia aquifolium exhibit antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, fungi, and protozoa. in this study the bacteriostatic and bacteriocidal activities of a m. aquifolium  extract and two of its major alkaloids, berberine chloride and oxyacanthine sulphate, were tested in vitro against nine different oral bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentrations were in the range from < or = 0.0031% to 0.1993% for the m. aquifolium extract, from 0.002% to > 0.125% for berberine chloride, and from 0.0156% to > 0.0625% for oxyacanthine sulphate. the values for the minimum bactericidal concentrations were in the same range, indicating that the test substances most probably acted in a bactericidal manner. the most susceptible bacterium against all three test substances was porphyromonas gingivalis.

TI  == effects of amine fluoride on biofilm growth and salivary pellicles.
AB  == the amine fluoride (amf) n'-octadecyl-trimethylene-diamine-n,n,n'-tris(2-ethanol)-dihydro-fluoride is a cationic antimicrobial which can have beneficial effects on plaque formation. here, we determine changes in pellicle and bacterial cell surface properties of the strains actinomyces naeslundii hm1, streptococcus mutans ns, s.mutans atcc 700610, s. sobrinus hg1025 and s. oralis hm1 upon adsorption of this amf and accompanying effects on bacterial adhesion and biofilm growth. in vitro pellicles had a zeta potential of -12 mv that became less negative upon adsorption of amf.  the chemical functionalities in which carbon and oxygen were involved changed after amf adsorption and amf-treated pellicles had a greater surface roughness than untreated pellicles. water contact angles in vitro decreased from 56 to 45 degrees upon amf treatment, which corresponded with water contact angles (44 degrees ) measured intraorally on the front incisors of volunteers immediately after using an amf-containing toothpaste. all bacterial strains were negatively charged and their isoelectric points (iep) increased upon amf adsorption. minimal inhibitory concentrations were smallest for strains exhibiting the largest increase in iep. adhesion to salivary pellicles and biofilm growth of the mutans  streptococcal strains were significantly reduced after amf treatment, but not of  a. naeslundii or s. oralis. however, regardless of the strain involved, biofilm viability decreased significantly after amf treatment. the electrostatic interaction between cationic amf and negatively charged bacterial cell surfaces is pivotal in establishing reduced biofilm formation by amf through a combination of effects on initial adhesion and killing. the major effect of amf treatment, however, was a reduction brought about in biofilm viability.

TI  == in vitro anti-biofilm activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans houtt. against oral primary colonizer bacteria.
AB  == in early dental plaque formation, oral primary colonizers such as streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus are initially attached to  the pellicle-coated tooth surface to form a biofilm. the study aimed to determine the efficacy of macelignan, isolated from nutmeg (myristica fragrans houtt.), in  removing each single oral primary biofilm in vitro on a polystyrene 96-well microtiter plate. four biofilm growth phases (4, 12, 20 and 24 h) were evaluated  in this study after treatment with macelignan at various concentrations (0.2, 2 and 10 microg/ml) and exposure times (5, 10 and 30 min). anti-biofilm activity of macelignan was measured as the percentage of the remaining biofilm absorbance after macelignan treatment in comparison with the untreated control. at 24 h of biofilm growth, s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. sanguis biofilms were reduced by up to 30%, 30% and 38%, respectively, after treatment with 10 microg/ml macelignan for 5 min. increasing the treatment time to 30 min resulted in a reduction of more than 50% of each of the single primary biofilms. the results indicate that macelignan is a potent natural anti-biofilm agent against oral primary colonizers.

TI  == surface antibacterial properties of glass ionomer cements used in atraumatic restorative treatment.
AB  == background: atraumatic restorative treatment (art) is recommended for use worldwide, not only in developing countries where resources are not readily available, but also in more industrialized countries. the antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials may improve the restorative treatment  outcome. glass ionomer cement (gic) has been advocated as the preferred restoration material for art. the authors evaluated the antibacterial properties  of restorative materials-three gics and a zinc oxide eugenol (zoe)-in vitro. methods: streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and enterococcus faecalis were the test microorganisms. the authors used a quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assay to evaluate the antibacterial effect of the restorative  materials using the direct contact test (dct) of freshly prepared and one-week-aged materials. results: the freshly prepared gics and zoe showed no bacterial growth in all tested bacteria compared with a control. this effect lasted for at least one week for s. mutans and a. viscosus but not for e. faecalis. conclusions: conventional gics used in art showed antibacterial surface properties against cariogenic bacteria for at least one week. further study on the long-term antimicrobial effects of gics is needed. clinical implications: the antimicrobial properties of freshly prepared restorative materials and aged restorative materials used in art have a potent effect against cariogenic bacteria. these properties have crucial importance in preventing secondary caries.

TI  == activity of an antimicrobial peptide mimetic against planktonic and biofilm cultures of oral pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial peptides (amps) are naturally occurring, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have recently been examined for their utility as therapeutic antibiotics. unfortunately, they are expensive to produce and are often sensitive to protease digestion. to address this problem, we have examined  the activity of a peptide mimetic whose design was based on the structure of magainin, exhibiting its amphiphilic structure. we demonstrate that this compound, meta-phenylene ethynylene (mpe), exhibits antimicrobial activity at nanomolar concentrations against a variety of bacterial and candida species found in oral infections. since streptococcus mutans, an etiological agent of dental caries, colonizes the tooth surface and forms a biofilm, we quantified the activity of this compound against s. mutans growing under conditions that favor biofilm formation. our results indicate that mpe can prevent the formation of a biofilm at nanomolar concentrations. incubation with 5 nm mpe prevents further growth of the biofilm, and 100 nm mpe reduces viable bacteria in the biofilm by 3 logs. structure-function analyses suggest that mpe inhibits the bioactivity of lipopolysaccharide and binds dna at equimolar ratios, suggesting that it may act  both as a membrane-active molecule, similar to magainin, and as an intracellular  antibiotic, similar to other amps. we conclude that mpe and similar molecules display great potential for development as therapeutic antimicrobials.

TI  == susceptibility of various oral bacteria to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis by neutrophils.
AB  == background and objective: the aim of this study was to compare the susceptibility of nonperiodontopathic and periodontopathic bacteria to major defense mechanisms  for bacterial clearance in gingival sulcus. material and methods: twenty strains  of 13 oral bacterial species were studied for their susceptibility to phagocytosis by human neutrophils and to the antimicrobial peptides ll-37 and human beta defensin-3. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 were determined by a liquid dilution assay, and susceptibility to phagocytosis was examined by a flow cytometric phagocytosis assay. results: the minimum inhibitory concentrations of ll-37 and human beta defensin-3 varied greatly, depending on the strain and species. although a significant difference between the non- and periodontopathic groups was not observed, the red-complex bacteria were more resistant to ll-37 than the others (p=0.004). the susceptibility of oral bacteria to phagocytosis was quite variable, depending on  the species but not on the strains. the periodontopathic bacteria, especially actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and the red-complex triad, were more resistant to phagocytosis than were the nonperiodontopathic bacteria (p=0.0003).  in addition, bacteria resistant both to antimicrobial peptides and to phagocytosis were more common in the periodontopathic group. conclusion: our results indicate that immune evasion may contribute to the pathogenicity of some  periodontopathic bacteria.

TI  == a novel tem contrasting technique for extracellular polysaccharides in in vitro biofilms.
AB  == in the past, the visualization of the extracellular matrix of biofilms on an ultrastructural level was hampered by shrinkage artifacts. in addition, the reproducible contrasting of extracellular polysaccharides (eps) has not satisfactorily been solved. here we describe a method overcoming these difficulties, which produces artifact-free transmission electron microscopic (tem) images using multispecies biofilms grown in vitro. sufficient contrast was  achieved by replacing schiff's reagent with the osmiophilic amino acid methionine. in addition, shrinkage was avoided by replacing the classical dehydration agents with ethylene glycol and 1,2-pentanediol. applying this method provided images of biofilms with an intact matrix in which differentially contrasted bacteria were embedded. all six members of the biofilm consortium (streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus oralis, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium  nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and candida albicans) could be distinguished.  within the matrix, structural differences of eps, probably due to different proportions of alpha-1,3 and alpha-1,6 linkages, were apparent. fibrilar polysaccharides were evident around microcolonies of s. sobrinus, and fluffy polysaccharides were detected in the vicinity of s. oralis microcolonies. the ultrastructure of biofilms prepared for tem using this method allows the imaging  of undistorted eps as well as the differentiated contrasting of the six microbial species of the in vitro biofilm model. this is a major step forward in determining the spatial arrangement of microorganisms in biofilms on an ultrastructural level.

TI  == protection offered by root-surface restorative materials against biofilm challenge.
AB  == the prevalence of root-surface caries is increasing. we hypothesized that some restorative materials are protective against cariogenic challenge on root surfaces. our goal was to study the effects of different restorative materials on root surfaces incubated with an oral biofilm generated in an artificial mouth. a  biofilm of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and actinomyces naeslundii was co-cultured for 21 days on 24 glass-ionomer cement, resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, or resin-composite-restored root surfaces. these surfaces were then examined with fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and scanning electron energy-dispersive spectroscopy. only glass-ionomer restorations showed a significant increase in log calcium-to-phosphorus ratio (p < 0.01), and a significantly lower log amide i-to-hydrogen phosphate ratio on the root surface after incubation in the artificial mouth. glass-ionomer restoratives conferred a preventive effect on the root surfaces against initial cariogenic challenge with a mixed-species oral biofilm without therapeutic intervention.

TI  == sequence of oral bacterial co-adhesion and non-contact brushing.
AB  == non-contact plaque removal offers advantages in interproximal spaces, fissures, and pockets. it requires the generation of strong fluid flows and the inclusion of air bubbles to become effective. a pair of co-adhering streptococci and actinomyces has been used previously to demonstrate non-contact removal by sonic  brushing. here we determined the influence of the sequence of co-adhesion of streptococci and actinomyces on non-contact removal from a salivary pellicle by rotary and sonic brushing. after bacterial adhesion, pellicles were brushed in a  wet and immersed state, with a distance up to 4 mm to the bristle tips. bacteria  adhering to pellicles from the sequence streptococci followed by actinomyces appeared more difficult to remove and left more large co-aggregates than from the sequence actinomyces followed by streptococci. at contact, rotary and sonic brushing performed equally well in bacterial removal, while at 4 mm, both had lost some efficacy.

AB  == the formation and composition of dental plaque biofilm in vivo are important factors which influence the development of gingivitis, caries and periodontitis.  studying dental plaque biofilm in in vitro models can cause an oversimplification of the real conditions in the oral cavity. in this study, bovine enamel slabs were fixed in an individual acrylic appliance in situ to quantify dental plaque formation and composition using multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) and confocal laser scanning microscopy. each of the five oligonucleotide probes used for fish was specific for either eubacteria or one of four frequently isolated bacterial constituents belonging to early and late colonizers of tooth surfaces. the thickness of formed biofilm increased from 14.9+/-5.0 microm after  1 day to 49.3+/-11.6 microm after 7 days. streptococcus spp. were predominant in  1-day-old dental plaque and decreased significantly after 7 days (p=0.0061). compared to the first day, fusobacterium nucleatum decreased after 2 days and increased significantly after 7 days (p=0.0006). the decreases of actinomyces naeslundii content on day 2 and day 7 were significant (p=0.0028). changes in veillonella spp. were not significant during the study period (p >0.05). the results showed that an in vivo observation period of 7 days was required to detect significant changes in streptococcus spp. and f. nucleatum. the multiplex  fish used is suitable for analysing the dynamics of four important bacterial constituents in the oral biofilm in epidemiological studies.

AB  == previous reports of pubic osteomyelitis associated with bone anchors describe symptoms presenting 10 days to 12 months postoperatively with typical pathogens including streptococcus, staphylococcus, citrobacter, and pseudomonas (fitzgerald et al., int urogynecol j 10:346-348, 1999 enzler et al., j bone jt surg am 81-a(12):1736-1740, 1999; graham and dmochowski, j urol 168:2055-2058, 2004; fialkow et al., urology 64(6):1127-1132, 2004; matkov et al., j urol 160(4):1427, 1998). this case illustrates the potential for protracted symptoms and delayed diagnosis of pubic osteomyelitis with the fastidious pathogen of actinomyces meyeri.

TI  == the effects of polishing methods on surface morphology, roughness and bacterial colonisation of titanium abutments.
AB  == bacterial colonisation of exposed implant and abutment surfaces can lead to peri-implantitis, a common cause of oral implant failure. when an abutment becomes exposed in the oral environment the typical recommendation is to debride  it, to obtain a smoother surface which might be expected to reduce bacterial colonisation. the aim of this study was to evaluate, in vitro, a conventional polishing protocol (pp1) and a simplified polishing protocol (pp2), suggested to  have advantages over pp1. the surface morphology and roughness of titanium abutments were characterised at each stage of polishing, and adhesion of oral bacteria was evaluated, using atomic force microscopy, environmental scanning electron microscopy and optical profilometry. pp1 and pp2 methodologies resulted  in indistinguishable surface finishes, with fewer scratches than the unmodified surface, and equal roughness values. pp2 resulted in less disruption and less removal of surface material. early biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans was  reduced on surfaces polished using pp2, but not pp1. biofilms of actinomyces naeslundii were more extensive on polished abutment surfaces. simplified protocol pp2 may be preferable to conventional protocol pp1, since less material is removed, and there is less chance of rough areas remaining. polishing, however, does not necessarily reduce oral bacterial colonisation.

TI  == effect of 308-nm excimer laser light on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria: an  in vitro investigation.
AB  == dental implants are becoming increasingly important in prosthodontic rehabilitation. bacterial infections, however, can induce bone loss and jeopardize clinical success. recent literature has demonstrated that infrared co(2) laser light is suitable for the decontamination of exposed implant surfaces. the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of 308-nm excimer laser irradiation on peri-implantitis-associated bacteria in vitro. in this study, a xecl excimer laser (308 nm) was used (summit technology, boston, usa). both aerobe (streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii) and  anaerobe microorganisms (a. odontolyticus, prevotella melaninogenica) were tested. according to previous studies, a constant energy of 0.8 j/cm(2) and a constant frequency of 20 hz were used for all irradiations. colony-forming units  after laser irradiation were counted. excimer laser irradiation showed significant influence on the growth of all microorganisms. as compared to s. mutans and s. sanguis, a. naeslundii demonstrated higher sensitivity to laser irradiation. anaerobe microorganisms, in contrast, demonstrated that a total of 200 pulses were sufficient to reduce the replication of these germs for more than 99.9%. excimer laser irradiation (lambda = 308 nm) can significantly reduce both  aerobe and anaerobe microorganisms. depending on the parameters chosen, 200 pulses are sufficient for sterilization. new studies are necessary to evaluate if this wavelength is more of value in the treatment of peri-implantitis than other  wavelengths or conventional therapies.

TI  == caries-related plaque microcosm biofilms developed in microplates.
AB  == in vivo dental plaque biofilms consist of complex communities of oral bacteria that are a challenge to replicate in vitro. the aim of this investigation was to  establish human dental plaque microcosms in microplates to reflect conditions that are relevant to dental caries. microcosm plaque biofilms were initiated from the saliva of two different donors, grown for up to 10 days in 24-welled microplates on thermanox coverslips in various types of artificial saliva with and without sucrose, which were replaced daily. microbiota composition of 40 species associated with oral health and dental caries was monitored in the plaques using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization analysis. ph was measured as an  indicator of cariogenic potential. the composition of the saliva inocula was different, and yielded plaque microcosms with different composition and growth responses to sucrose. artificial saliva type and presence of sucrose, and the resulting growth and ph conditions, modified the growth of individual species and hence the ecological profile of the microplate plaques during development. complex population shifts were observed during development, and older plaques comprised predominantly facultative anaerobic species. sucrose supplementation limited the decline of streptococci over time but did not increase the abundance  of mutans streptococci. sucrose at 0.15% increased levels of caries-associated species including lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus acidophilus and actinomyces gerensceriae; these were further increased with sucrose at 0.5%, in addition to actinomyces israelii, rothia dentocariosa and capnocytophaga gingivalis. the microplate plaques demonstrated complex community dynamics that appeared to reflect the maturation of natural plaques, and sucrose induced a cariogenic plaque composition and ph.

TI  == efficacy of gasiform ozone and photodynamic therapy on a multispecies oral biofilm in vitro.
AB  == ozone gas and photodynamic therapy (pdt) have been claimed to be antimicrobially  effective. this study assessed their antimicrobial potential in vitro. mature six-species oral biofilms were treated as follows (n = 9 per group): (i) a 60-s application of gasiform vacuum-ozone or vacuum alone (on wet or air-dried biofilm samples); (ii) pdt (i.e. methylene blue in combination with or without a diode soft laser, and a soft laser alone); or (iii) antimicrobial solutions: immersion  of biofilms for 60 s in 0.2 and 2% chlorhexidine or in 0.5 and 5% hypochlorite solution. treatment with chlorhexidine or hypochlorite served as a positive control, whereas untreated samples served as negative controls. colony-forming units on blood agar were counted. only the 5% hypochlorite solution was able to totally eliminate the microorganisms in the biofilm. the observed reduction of viable counts by vacuum-ozone application and pdt was less than one log(10) step. under the conditions of the current study, gasiform ozone and pdt had a minimal effect on the viability of microorganisms organized in a cariogenic biofilm.

AB  == objectives: the aims of this study were to characterize the microflora in crevices around titanium orthodontic anchor plates using anaerobic culture and molecular biological techniques for bacterial identification, and to compare the  microbial composition between crevices around anchor plates and gingival crevices. material and methods: samples from crevices around titanium anchor plates and healthy gingival crevices of 17 subjects (aged 20-29) were cultured anaerobically, and isolated bacteria were identified by 16s rrna sequencing. results: the average logarithm colony-forming units/ml were 6.84, 7.51 and 8.88 in healthy anchor plate crevices, inflamed anchor plate crevices and healthy gingival crevices, respectively, indicating that the bacterial density of anchor  plate crevices was lower than that of healthy gingival crevices. of 184 strains isolated from healthy anchor plate crevices of seven subjects, 108 (59%) were anaerobic bacteria, while 73 (40%) were facultative bacteria. predominant isolates were gram-negative rods, such as campylobacter (12%), fusobacterium (10%) and selenomonas (10%), and gram-positive facultative bacteria, such as actinomyces (17%) and streptococcus (8.2%). of 133 strains isolated from inflamed anchor plate crevices of three subjects, 110 (83%) were anaerobic bacteria, while predominant isolates were gram-negative rods, such as prevotella (47%), fusobacterium (33%) and campylobacter (16%). on the other hand, of 146 strains isolated from healthy gingival crevices of seven subjects, 98 (67%) were facultative bacteria, while 45 (31%) were anaerobic bacteria. predominant isolates were gram-positive facultative bacteria, such as actinomyces (37%) and streptococcus (20%). conclusions: these results suggest that the environment in crevices around titanium orthodontic anchor plates is anaerobic and supportive of anaerobic growth of bacteria, which may trigger inflammation in the tissue around the plates.

TI  == incipient caries lesions on cementum by mono- and co-culture oral bacteria.
AB  == objectives: there is increasing prevalence of root caries. we hypothesized different biofilms will cause varying demineralization in cementum. this study investigated the extent of demineralization of cementum by oral biofilm formed from three major cariogenic microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces israelii. sound cementum tooth blocks were incubated with mono-, bi-, and tri-species combinations of the bacteria under investigation. materials and methods: the matrix (amide i) and phosphate content  of the lesions was analyzed by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir), and calcium and phosphorus levels were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (sem-edx). results: the log[amide i:hpo(4)(2-) absorbance] values showed that a. israelii mono-culture caused significantly more demineralization than the other bacterial cultures. log[ca:p] showed that all carious lesions were confined to the cementum. conclusions: oral biofilm arising  from bacterial species a. israelii alone was the most cariogenic of those tested  and produced the most demineralization in incipient carious lesions in cementum.

TI  == efficacy and mechanisms of non-antibacterial, chemical plaque control by dentifrices--an in vitro study.
AB  == objectives: the provision of antiplaque benefits to dentifrices assists patients  in improving hygiene and reducing susceptibility to gingivitis and caries. chemical plaque control involves different mechanisms and is mostly associated with antibacterial effects, but also includes effects on pellicle surface chemistry to improve cleansing or discourage renewed plaque formation. it is the  aim of this paper to analyze in vitro detachment of co-aggregating oral actinomyces and streptococci from pellicle surfaces by dentifrice supernates and  to study subsequent de novo streptococcal deposition. methods: detachment by dentifrices of a co-adhering bacterial pair was studied in the parallel plate flow chamber on a 16 h pellicle coated surface. after detachment by perfusing the chamber with a dentifrice, re-deposition was initiated by flowing with a fresh streptococcal suspension. the dentifrices included both a regular, sls-fluoride based formulation as well a pyrophosphate, anticalculus and antimicrobial formulations. results: all dentifrice supernates containing sls were effective in detaching co-adhering bacteria from pellicles surfaces, except in combination with snf(2). when hexametaphosphate was added immediate detachment was relatively low, but continued even during re-deposition. the re-deposition of streptococci after detachment by other, naf containing dentifrices involved relatively few large aggregates, presumably because fluoride was able to block bi-dentate calcium binding sites on the bacterial cell surfaces, mediating co-adhesion. when pyrophosphate was present in addition to naf, re-deposition involved significantly more large aggregates, likely because pyrophosphate served as a bi-dentate bridge between calcium bound on the bacterial cell surfaces. conclusion: commercially available dentifrice formulations differ in their ability to stimulate bacterial detachment from pellicles and dependent on their composition yield the formation of large co-adhering aggregates of actinomyces and streptococci in de novo deposition.

TI  == multiparameter assessments to determine the effects of sugars and antimicrobials  on a polymicrobial oral biofilm.
AB  == clinical studies indicate relationships between dental plaque, a naturally formed biofilm, and oral diseases. the crucial role of nonmicrobial biofilm constituents in maintaining biofilm structure and biofilm-specific attributes, such as resistance to shear and viscoelasticity, is increasingly recognized. concurrent analyses of the diverse nonmicrobial biofilm components for multiparameter assessments formed the focus of this investigation. comparable numbers of actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, neisseria subflava, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans cells were seeded into multiple wells of 96-well polystyrene plates for biofilm formation. quantitative  fluorescence and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm) examined the influences of dietary sugars, incubation conditions, ingredients in oral hygiene  formulations, and antibiotics on biofilm components. biofilm extracellular polymeric substances (eps) were examined with an optimized mixture of fluorescent lectins, with biofilm proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids detected with specific  fluorescent stains. anaerobic incubation of biofilms resulted in significantly more biofilm eps and extractable carbohydrates than those formed under aerobic conditions (p < 0.05). sucrose significantly enhanced biofilm eps in comparison to fructose, galactose, glucose, and lactose (p < 0.05). clsm demonstrated thicker biofilms under sucrose-replete conditions, along with significant increases in biofilm eps, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, than under conditions of sucrose deficiency (p < 0.05). agents in oral hygiene formulations  (chlorhexidine, ethanol, and sodium lauryl sulfate), a mucolytic agent (n-acetyl-l-cysteine), and antibiotics with different modes of action (amoxicillin, doxycycline, erythromycin, metronidazole, and vancomycin) inhibited biofilm components (p < 0.05). multiparameter analysis indicated a dose-dependent inhibition of biofilm eps and protein by chlorhexidine and sodium lauryl sulfate, along with distinctive inhibitory patterns for subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics. collectively, these results highlight multiparameter assessments as  a broad platform for simultaneous assessment of diverse biofilm components.

(3 patients), actinomyces sp. (2), streptococcus mutans  (1), corynebacterium sp. (2), nocardioides sp. (1), rhodococcus sp. (1) veillonella sp. (2). in p. acnes positive samples 62% exhibited severe histological inflammation versus 50% in the bacteria-negative group (p = 0.602).  the presence of p. acnes in the prostate was associated with prostate cancer development (or 2.17, 95% ci 0.77-6.95). conclusions: this study has revealed p.  acnes as the most common bacteria in the prostate in bph. further studies are needed to clarify its role in contributing to the development of prostatic inflammation and prostate cancer.

TI  == an in vitro quantitative antibacterial analysis of amalgam and composite resins.
AB  == objectives: antibacterial properties of restorative dental materials such as amalgam and composite resins may improve the restorative treatment outcome. this  study evaluates the antibacterial properties of three composite resins: z250, tetric ceram, p60 and a dental amalgam in vitro. methods: streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus served as test microorganisms. three quantitative microtiter spectrophotometric assays were used to evaluate the effect of the restorative materials on: (i) early-stage biofilm using a direct contact test (dct); (ii) planktonic bacterial growth; (iii) bacterial growth in the materials' elute. for comparison purposes, agar diffusion test (adt) was also performed. results: the effect of the composite resins on bacterial growth was minimal and limited to a few days only. one-week-aged composites promoted growth of s. mutans and a. viscosus. the antibacterial properties in direct contact were more potent  than in planktonic bacterial growth. amalgam showed complete inhibition of both bacteria in all phases, and the effect lasted for at least 1 week. the materials' elute had no effect on both bacterial growth with the exception of complete inhibition of s. mutans in amalgam. the later results correlated with the adt. conclusions: the present findings demonstrate potent and lasting antibacterial properties of amalgam, which are lacking in composite resins. this may explain the clinical observation of biofilm accumulated more on composites compared to amalgams. it follows that the assessment of antibacterial properties of poorly-soluble materials has to employ more than one assay.

TI  == microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue after plaque accumulation: an experimental study in humans.
AB  == background: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect  of the absence of tongue hygiene on the microbiota of the dorsum of the tongue. methods: ten volunteers (aged 19 to 22 years) entered the study at baseline and were instructed to abstain from tongue cleaning for 7 days, followed by a period  of 3 days without any kind of oral hygiene. subsequently, a period of 21 days of  washout was employed, and this protocol was repeated three times. microbiological samples were obtained from the dorsum of the tongue at baseline and at the end of the period of coating accumulation and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the species found in highest mean counts at baseline and day 10 were prevotella melaninogenica and veillonella parvula. the mean bacterial total counts enhanced significantly during the study (from 17.1x10(6) to 33.7x10(6)). proportions of red and blue complexes and levels of 18 species also increased after the period of coating accumulation, including several periodontal pathogens, such as prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus constellatus, tannerella forsythensis, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola, and p. melaninogenica. conclusion: the tongue surface could be an important reservoir for periodontal pathogens and may play a  role in the recolonization of tooth surfaces and in the etiology of oral halitosis.

TI  == host-derived pentapeptide affecting adhesion, proliferation, and local ph in biofilm communities composed of streptococcus and actinomyces species.
AB  == salivary proline-rich proteins (prps) attach commensal actinomyces and streptococcus species to teeth. here, gel filtration, mass spectrometry and edman degradation were applied to show the release of a pentapeptide, rgrpq, from prp-1 upon proteolysis by streptococcus gordonii. moreover, synthetic rgrpq and derivatives were used to investigate associated innate properties and responsible motifs. the rgrpq peptide increased 2.5-fold the growth rate of s. gordonii via a q-dependent sequence motif and selectively stimulated oral colonization of this organism in a rat model in vivo. in contrast, the growth of streptococcus mutans, implicated in caries, was not affected. while the entire rgrpq sequence was required to block sucrose-induced ph-decrease by s. gordonii and s. mutans, the n-terminal arg residue mediated the ph increase (i.e., ammonia production) by s.  gordonii alone (which exhibits arg catabolism to ammonia). strains of commensal viridans streptococci exhibited prp degradation and arg catabolism, whereas cariogenic species did not. the rgrpq peptide mediated via a differential q-dependent sequence motif, adhesion inhibition, and desorption of prp-1-binding  strains of a. naeslundii genospecies 2 (5 of 10 strains) but not of s. gordonii (n=5). the inhibitable a. naeslundii strains alone displayed the same binding profile as s. gordonii to hybrid peptides terminating in rgrpq or gqspq, derived  from the middle or c-terminal segments of prp-1. the present findings indicate the presence of a host-bacterium interaction in which a host peptide released by  bacterial proteolysis affects key properties in biofilm formation.

TI  == the effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on the cell-surface hydrophobicity of selected early settlers of dental plaque.
AB  == the adhesion of early settlers of dental plaque to the tooth surface has a role in the initiation of the development of dental plaque. the hydrophobic surface properties of the bacteria cell wall are indirectly responsible for the adhesion  of the bacteria cell to the acquired pellicle on the tooth surfaces. in this study, the effect of aqueous extract of two plants (psidium guajava and piper betle) on the cell-surface hydro-phobicity of early settlers of dental plaque was determined in vitro. hexadecane, a hydrocarbon was used to represent the hydrophobic surface of the teeth in the oral cavity. it was found that treatment  of the early plaque settlers with 1 mg/ml extract of psidium guajava reduced the  cell-surface hydrophobicity of strep. sanguinis, strep. mitis and actinomyces sp. by 54.1%, 49.9% and 40.6%, respectively. treatment of these bacteria with the same concentration of piper betle however, showed a comparatively lesser effect (< 10%). it was also observed that the anti-adhesive effect of the two extracts on the binding of the early plaque settlers to hexadecane is concentration dependent.

AB  == opportunistic infections in the oral cavity of the elderly may increase the incidence of systemic disease. the objective of this study was to investigate the differences in the oral bacterial flora between dependent elderly (inpatients) and independent elderly (community-dwelling residents). after multiple variables  were taken into account, inpatients had significantly lower detection rates than  community-dwelling residents for alpha-streptococci (p < 0.001) and neisseria (p  0.004), and higher detection rates for pseudomonas aeruginosa (p 0.024), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (p 0.011) and actinomyces spp. (p 0.005). among inpatients, the requirement for a high degree of care was related negatively to detection of alpha-streptococci, but was related significantly to detection of p. aeruginosa (p 0.018) or mrsa (p 0.004). tube-fed inpatients had a significantly lower detection rate for alpha-streptococci (p 0.041) and a higher detection rate for p. aeruginosa (p 0.004) than those who did not require tube feeding. inpatients with a history of antibiotic use had a significantly lower detection rate for alpha-streptococci (p 0.049) and a higher  detection rate for mrsa (p 0.007) than those without a history of antibiotic use. the detection rates for p. aeruginosa or mrsa in inpatients without alpha-streptococci were higher than in inpatients with alpha-streptococci after controlling for age and gender (p. aeruginosa, p 0.006; mrsa, p 0.001). overall,  detection of alpha-streptococci had an inverse correlation with the detection of  p. aeruginosa and mrsa in the oral cavity and is likely to be an indicator of pathogenic bacterial infection.

AB  == aims: the isolation of bovine vaginal lactic acid bacteria (lab) and the screening of their beneficial properties to select those that could be used as probiotics in the prevention of bovine metritis were performed. methods and results: out of 76 lactobacillus sp. and seven streptococcus sp. strains, a small number showed high- and medium hydrophobicity when the microbial adhesion to hydrocarbons method (math) was applied. in the agar plate diffusion test, a large number of strains inhibited vaginal bovine escherichia coli 99/14 and human e. coli. this inhibition was due to acid. only a few strains inhibited actinomyces pyogenes 96/393, a pathogen isolated from bovine metritis. this inhibition remained after neutralization. the taxonomic identification of the selected strains was carried out by an amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). most of the strains were identified as lactobacillus fermentum, a few as lactobacillus gasseri and one as lactobacillus rhamnosus. conclusions: bovine vaginal lactobacilli strains have differential surface properties. the strains selected are capable of inhibiting specific metritis pathogens. significance and  impact of the study: our results can be applied for future studies to design a probiotic product to prevent metritis in dairy postpartum cows.

TI  == potentiation of the bactericidal activity of harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) leaf extract against oral bacteria using poly (d, l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles: in vitro study.
AB  == harungana madagascariensis lam. ex poir. (hypericaceae) is known to have biological properties with mainly antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral effects. the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of the ethyl acetate h. madagascariensis leaf extract (hle) on the main  oral bacterial strains largely implicated in dental caries and gingivitis infections, and the possibility of potentialization of hle antibacterial effects  using the poly (d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles (plg-np). the microdilution technique and the interfacial polymer deposition following the solvent diffusion method were used to investigate the in vitro bactericidal activity of ethyl acetate hle and to prepare nanoparticles, respectively. hle showed significant bactericidal effects against the bacterial strains tested, with minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) to 5 x 10(2) mg/l or less, except for lactobacillus casei with 7.5 x 10(2) mg/l. with the hle incorporated into plg nanoparticles (hle-plg-np), we observed diminution of the bactericidal concentration compared to hle, the upper mbc being of 1.875 x 10(2) mg/l. incorporation of the hle into a colloidal carrier optimized its antibacterial performance.

TI  == autoinducer 2: a concentration-dependent signal for mutualistic bacterial biofilm growth.
AB  == 4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione (dpd), a product of the luxs enzyme in the catabolism of s-ribosylhomocysteine, spontaneously cyclizes to form autoinducer 2 (ai-2). ai-2 is proposed to be a universal signal molecule mediating interspecies communication among bacteria. we show that mutualistic and abundant biofilm growth in flowing saliva of two human oral commensal bacteria, actinomyces naeslundii t14v and streptococcus oralis 34, is dependent upon production of ai-2 by s. oralis 34. a luxs mutant of s. oralis 34 was constructed which did not produce ai-2. unlike wild-type dual-species biofilms, a. naeslundii t14v and an s. oralis 34 luxs mutant did not exhibit mutualism and generated only sparse biofilms which contained a 10-fold lower biomass of each species. restoration of  ai-2 levels by genetic or chemical (synthetic ai-2 in the form of dpd) complementation re-established the mutualistic growth and high biomass characteristic for the wild-type dual-species biofilm. furthermore, an optimal concentration of dpd was determined, above and below which biofilm formation was  suppressed. the optimal concentration was 100-fold lower than the detection limit of the currently accepted ai-2 assay. thus, ai-2 acts as an interspecies signal and its concentration is critical for mutualism between two species of oral bacteria grown under conditions that are representative of the human oral cavity.

TI  == bactericidal effect of nd:yag laser irradiation on some endodontic pathogens ex vivo.
AB  == aim: to define the role of neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (nd:yag) lasers in root canal disinfection along with a minimally invasive treatment concept. methodology: the hypothesis was tested ex vivo that nd:yag laser irradiation has  a bactericidal effect on endodontic pathogens inoculated in root canals. resultant colony-forming unit counts were associated with observations of bacterial cell structural changes using conventional scanning electron microscopy (csem) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (esem) on inoculated dentine surfaces, following indirect and direct nd:yag laser irradiation, respectively. results: the nd:yag laser irradiation (1.5 w, 15 hz, four times for 5 s) of enterococcus faecalis inoculated canals resulted in a significant reduction (p < 0.05, wilcoxon signed rank test) of the bacterial load, meaning a  99.7% kill, but no sterilization. the csem procedure verified that the extent of  radiation damage was in line with the total amount of laser energy applied. after 2 h of incubation and three cycles of indirect laser treatment (i.e. through a 1-mm-thick dentine disc), no morphologically intact bacteria of actinomyces naeslundii or streptococcus anginosus were discernible. however, when micro-colonies of s. anginosus and specially biofilms of e. faecalis were present after 2 days, the in situ experiment using esem and direct laser treatment showed that bacterial eradication was reduced in deep layers. conclusions: the nd:yag laser irradiation is not an alternative but a possible supplement to existing protocols for canal disinfection as the properties of laser light may allow a bactericidal effect beyond 1 mm of dentine. endodontic pathogens that grow as biofilms, however, are difficult to eradicate even upon direct laser exposure.

TI  == effects of nidus vespae extract and chemical fractions on the growth and acidogenicity of oral microorganisms.
AB  == nidus vespae is the honeycomb of polistes olivaceous (de geer), p. japonicus saussure, and parapolybiavaria fabricius. it is known to have a number of pharmacological effects, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, anti-virus,  anti-tumor and anesthetic properties. the present study evaluated the antimicrobial activity and acid inhibition properties of extracts and chemical fractions of nidus vespae. the raw material was first extracted using 95% ethanol/water. subsequent fractions were prepared from this extract using cyclohexane/ethyl acetate, petroleum ether/ethyl acetate, and chloroform/methanol. for the antimicrobial activity assays, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbc) were determined using the microdilution method. the chloroform/methanol (chl/meoh) fraction showed the highest antibacterial activities with a mic of 8-16mg/ml and  an mbc of 16-32mg/ml. in addition, the extract and chemical fractions of nidus vespae showed a remarkable capacity for inhibiting the acid production of common  oral bacteria at sub-mic concentrations. sub-mic levels of the petroleum ether/ethyl acetate fraction significantly inhibited acid production by streptococcus mutans atcc 25175. the significant antiacidogenic activity demonstrated by nidus vespae shows it to be a promising source of novel anticariogenic agents.

AB  == aims: aetiological investigations of pericardial effusion are often negative. we  evaluate the interest of systematic analysis of fluid in order to diminish the number of pericarditis classified as idiopathic. methods and results: we performed a systematic analysis of pericardial fluid and biopsy specimens, using  cultures and molecular analyses for the identification of bacteriological, fungal, and viral agents, as well as histopathological examination of 106 pericardial fluid samples. the aetiological diagnosis was determined clinically and by non-invasive procedures in 40 and nine patients, respectively. in the remaining 57 patients, 14 neoplasias and 17 infections were diagnosed. molecular  procedures identified seven viral (enterovirus, herpes simplex virus, and epstein-barr virus in four, two, and one of the cases, respectively), one fungal  (cryptococcus neoformans), and nine bacterial infections. four of these bacteria  were not diagnosed by culture because of prior antibiotics treatment (mycobacterium tuberculosis in two cases, streptococcus pneumoniae in one case, and actinomyces neuii in one case). the aetiology remained undetermined in 26 patients. conclusion: the systematic use of molecular techniques permitted a significant increase in aetiological diagnoses of punctured pericardial effusions when compared with cultures (39.5 vs. 13.9%, respectively; p<0.01). it is particularly beneficial for patients with a previous antibiotic regimen or suspicion of tuberculosis.

TI  == antibacterial activities of inorganic agents on six bacteria associated with oral infections by two susceptibility tests.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of six inorganic antibacterial agents were assessed using broth dilution and agar dilution tests on six pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious diseases: streptococcus mutans (atcc 25175), s. mutans (ingbritt), actinomyces viscosus (atcc 15987), lactobacillus casei (atcc 393), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 29213) and candida albicans (atcc 90028). the results of the broth dilution test were significantly lower than those of the agar dilution test (f=38.290; p<0.01). the six inorganic agents notably inhibited the growth of tested common oral bacteria in vitro. among them, longbei inorganic antibiotic powder was the strongest antibacterial agent, followed by zno whisker  antibacterial complex (znow) at-83, ionpure-h, basic magnesium hypochlorite, znow at-88 and antim-ams2. the broth dilution test appears to be more suitable for testing insoluble inorganic agents.

TI  == modeling shifts in microbial populations associated with health or disease.
AB  == stable microbial communities associated with health can be disrupted by altered environmental conditions. periodontal diseases are associated with changes in the resident oral microflora. for example, as gingivitis develops, a key change in the microbial composition of dental plaque is the ascendancy of actinomyces spp.  and gram-negative rods at the expense of streptococcus spp. we describe the use of an in vitro model to replicate this population shift, first with a dual-species model (actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus sobrinus) and then using a microcosm model of dental plaque. the population shift was induced by environmental changes associated with gingivitis, first by the addition of artificial gingival crevicular fluid and then by a switch to a microaerophilic atmosphere. in addition to the observed population shifts, confocal laser scanning microscopy also revealed structural changes and differences in the distribution of viable and nonviable bacteria associated with the change in environmental conditions. this model provides an appropriate system for the further understanding of microbial population shifts associated with gingivitis and for the testing of, for example, antimicrobial agents.

TI  == effect of oral bacteria on growth and survival of candida albicans biofilms.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of eight aerobic and anaerobic oral commensal bacterial species on in vitro candida albicans biofilm development. a single isolate of c. albicans 2560 g, and eight different species  of oral bacteria comprising, actinomyces israelii, lactobacillus acidophilus, prevotella nigrescens, porphyromonas gingivalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus intermedius were studied using an in vitro biofilm assay. biofilm formation was quantified in terms of the ability of candida to grow on polystyrene plastic surfaces co-cultured with the foregoing bacteria. a viable cell count was used to quantify the sessile yeast growth and scanning electron microscopy was employed to confirm and visualize biofilm formation. co-culture with differing concentrations of bacteria had variable effects on candida biofilm formation. co-culture with the highest concentrations of each of the foregoing bacteria resulted in a consistent reduction in the yeast counts in the candidal biofilm (p<0.05), except for l. acidophilus, s. mutans, and, s. intermedius co-cultures. further, on regression analysis a significant negative correlation between the co-culture concentration  of either p. gingivalis or e. coli and viable yeast counts in the biofilm was noted (p<0.05) although this was not evident for the other bacterial species. taken together, our data indicate that, quantitative and qualitative nature of the bacteria modulate c. albicans biofilm formation in mixed species environments such as the oral cavity.

TI  == molecular characterization of subject-specific oral microflora during initial colonization of enamel.
AB  == the initial microbial colonization of tooth surfaces is a repeatable and selective process, with certain bacterial species predominating in the nascent biofilm. characterization of the initial microflora is the first step in understanding interactions among community members that shape ensuing biofilm development. using molecular methods and a retrievable enamel chip model, we characterized the microbial diversity of early dental biofilms in three subjects. a total of 531 16s rrna gene sequences were analyzed, and 97 distinct phylotypes  were identified. microbial community composition was shown to be statistically different among subjects. in all subjects, however, 4-h and 8-h communities were  dominated by streptococcus spp. belonging to the streptococcus oralis/streptococcus mitis group. other frequently observed genera (comprising at least 5% of clone sequences in at least one of the six clone libraries) were actinomyces, gemella, granulicatella, neisseria, prevotella, rothia, and veillonella. fluorescence in situ hybridization (fish) confirmed that the proportion of streptococcus sp. sequences in the clone libraries coincided with the proportion of streptococcus probe-positive organisms on the chip. fish also revealed that, in the undisturbed plaque, not only streptococcus spp. but also the rarer prevotella spp. were usually seen in small multigeneric clusters of cells. this study shows that the initial dental plaque community of each subject  is unique in terms of diversity and composition. repetitive and distinctive community composition within subjects suggests that the spatiotemporal interactions and ecological shifts that accompany biofilm maturation also occur in a subject-dependent manner.

TI  == multivariate design and evaluation of a set of rgrpq-derived innate immunity peptides.
AB  == oral commensal streptococcus gordonii proteolytically cleave the salivary prp-1 polypeptide into an rgrpq innate peptide. the arg and gln termini are crucial for rgrpq-mediated ammonia production and proliferation by s. gordonii sk12 and adhesion inhibition and desorption by actinomyces naeslundii t14v, respectively.  here we have applied (i) a multivariate approach using rgrpq-related peptides varied at amino acids 2, 3, and 4 simultaneously and (ii) size and n- and c-terminal modifications of rgrpq to generate structure activity information. while the n-terminal arginine motif mediated ammonia production independent of peptide size, other responses required more or less full-length peptide motifs. the motifs for adhesion inhibition and desorption were the same. the adhesion and proliferation motifs required similarly a hydrophobic/low polarity amino acid 4 but differentially a hydrophilic or hydrophobic character of amino acids 2/3, respectively; polar peptides with small/hydrophilic and hydrophilic amino acids 2 and 3, respectively, had high adhesion inhibition/desorption activity, and lipophilic peptides with large/hydrophobic amino acids 2 and 3 had high proliferation activity. accordingly, while riwwq had increased proliferation but  abolished adhesion/desorption activity, peptides designed with hydrophilic amino  acids 2 and 3 were predicted to behave in the opposite way. moreover, a rgrpq mimetic for all three responses should mimic small hydrophilic, large nitrogen-containing, and hydrophobic/low polarity amino acids 2, 3, and 4, respectively. peptides fulfilling these criteria were 1-1.6-fold improved in all  three responses. thus, both mimetics and peptides with differential proliferation and adhesion activities may be generated for evaluation in biofilm models.

TI  == identification of oral bacteria associated with crevicular epithelial cells from  chronic periodontitis lesions.
AB  == bacterial invasion of host epithelial cells plays an important role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases; however, the interactions between subgingival species and the gingival crevice cells are not fully understood. this study determined the prevalence of a group of oral bacterial species on or in epithelial cells derived from periodontal pockets and the gingival crevice of subjects with periodontitis. samples of epithelial cells were obtained from 120 sites with periodontal pockets > or =4 mm and 92 periodontally healthy sites from 49 patients (mean age 46.3+/-1.4 years; 43% males) with chronic periodontitis. bacteria in or on epithelial cells were separated from unattached bacteria by percoll density-gradient centrifugation. the presence and levels of 33 oral species were determined in epithelial cell samples by whole genomic dna probes and the checkerboard method. the most frequently detected species were porphyromonas gingivalis (42%), treponema denticola (38%), prevotella intermedia  (37%), streptococcus intermedius (36%), campylobacter rectus (35%), streptococcus sanguinis (35%) and streptococcus oralis (34%). species of actinomyces were found in low prevalence and levels. the data indicated that there were more micro-organisms on or in epithelial cells obtained from periodontal pockets than  from healthy sulci; however, no significant differences regarding the percentage  and level of any specific species were found between these sites. veillonella parvula, s. oralis, streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mitis tended to be more prevalent in sites without disease. these findings demonstrated that a wide  range of oral species may be detected on or in crevicular epithelial cells from sites with periodontitis and from periodontally healthy sulci.

AB  == the temporo-spatial development of plaque is governed by adhesive interactions between different co-aggregating bacterial strains and species. physico-chemically, these interactions are due to attractive lifshitz-van der waals and acid-base forces, and occur despite electrostatic repulsion and with a  critical influence of temperature. the forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs have never been measured, however. the aim here, thus, is to investigate, by atomic force microscopy, whether there is a difference in interactive forces between co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating bacterial pairs  at 10 degrees c, 22 degrees c, and 40 degrees c. actinomyces naeslundii 147 was immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated tipless afm cantilevers, while streptococci were immobilized on poly-l-lysine-coated glass surfaces. upon approach, a repulsive force was measured, regardless of whether a co-aggregating or non-co-aggregating pair was involved. however, upon retraction, the co-aggregating pair exhibited larger adhesive forces and energies than did the non-co-aggregating pair. adhesive interactions between the co-aggregating pair were smallest at 40 degrees c.

TI  == [study of antibacterial effect of galla chinensis on the bacteria biofilm in chemostat].
AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect of galla chinensis with that of chlorhexidine by means of chemostat and provide experimental foundation for caries prevention with chinese medicine instead of chemicals in future. method: a multispecies consortium biofilm (bf) model was construted in the chemostat. the growth-inhibition on bacterial biofilm coated on ha was investigated by means of  the colony-forming units (cfu). acid-inhibition was inspected by continual ph-recording in the flow cells. and the profile on the biofilm treated by both experimental medicines was observed with the scanning electromicroscopy (sem). result: both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the growth of the bf bacteria. and galla chinensis had no obvious influence on the ecological composing of the bf bacteria. both of the experimental medicines could inhibit the acid producion of experimental bacteria. but the final ph of galla chinensis  was lower than that of chlorhexidine. a typical biofilm formed on ha was observed by sem. both of galla chinensis and chlorhexidine could inhibit the production of extracellular matrix and make the bf profile on the surface of the ha clearer and simpler. conclusion: galla chinensis had definite antibacterial effect. no obvious difference is found between galla chinensis (4 g x l(-1)) and chlorhexidine (0.5 g x l(-1)). therefore, it is possible for chinese medicine to  gradually replace the chemical medicine in clinic and it will give a new choice for caries prevention.

TI  == fusobacterium nucleatum transports noninvasive streptococcus cristatus into human epithelial cells.
AB  == analysis of human buccal epithelial cells frequently reveals an intracellular polymicrobial consortium of bacteria. although several oral bacteria have been demonstrated to invade cultured epithelial cells, several others appear unable to internalize. we hypothesized that normally noninvasive bacteria may gain entry into epithelial cells via adhesion to invasive bacteria. fusobacterium nucleatum  is capable of binding to and invading oral epithelial cells. by contrast, streptococcus cristatus binds weakly to host cells and is not internalized. f. nucleatum and s. cristatus coaggregate strongly via an arginine-sensitive interaction. coincubation of kb or tert-2 epithelial cells with equal numbers of  f. nucleatum and s. cristatus bacteria led to significantly increased numbers of  adherent and internalized streptococci. f. nucleatum also promoted invasion of kb cells by other oral streptococci and actinomyces naeslundii. dissection of fusobacterial or streptococcal adhesive interactions by using sugars, amino acids, or antibodies demonstrated that this phenomenon is due to direct attachment of s. cristatus to adherent and invading f. nucleatum. inhibition of f. nucleatum host cell attachment and invasion with galactose, or fusobacterial-streptococcal coaggregation by the arginine homologue l-canavanine, abrogated the increased s. cristatus adhesion to, and invasion of, host cells. in addition, polyclonal antibodies to f. nucleatum, which inhibited fusobacterial attachment to both kb cells and s. cristatus, significantly decreased invasion by both species. similar decreases were obtained when epithelial cells were pretreated with cytochalasin d, staurosporine, or cycloheximide. these studies indicate that f. nucleatum may facilitate the colonization of epithelial cells by bacteria unable to adhere or invade directly.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and galla  chinesis in bioflim model. to evaluate the feasibility of application of gala chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. in the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. after a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the ha disc was  examed, the planktonic ph in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the ha disc was observed by sem. results: (1) galla chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) galla chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic ph in the flow cell, but galla chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) the biofilms formed after application of galla chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. conclusion: galla chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.

TI  == microbial risk indicators of early childhood caries.
AB  == the aim of this study was to use molecular identification methods, such as 16s rna gene sequence and reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization, for identification of the bacteria associated with dental caries and with dental health in a subset of 204 twins aged 1.5 to 7 years old. a total of 448 plaque samples (118 collected from caries-free subjects and 330 from caries-active subjects) were used for analysis. we compared the bacteria found in biofilms of children exhibiting severe dental caries, with different degrees of lesion severity, with those found in biofilms of caries-free children. a panel of 82 bacterial species was selected, and a pcr-based reverse-capture checkerboard method was used for detection. a simple univariate test was used to determine the overabundance and underabundance of bacterial species in the diseased and in the  healthy groups. features identified with this univariate test were used to construct a probabilistic disease prediction model. furthermore, a method for the analysis of global patterns of gene expression was performed to permit simultaneous analysis of the abundance of significant species by allowing cross-bacterial comparisons of abundance profiles between caries-active and caries-free subjects. our results suggested that global patterns of microbial abundance in this population are very distinctive. the top bacterial species found to be overabundant in the caries-active group were actinomyces sp. strain b19sc, streptococcus mutans, and lactobacillus spp., which exhibited an inverse relationship to beneficial bacterial species, such as streptococcus parasanguinis, abiotrophia defectiva, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis,  and streptococcus sanguinis.

TI  == cultivable oral microbiota of domestic dogs.
AB  == bacteria were isolated from the dental plaques of nine dogs and a sample of pooled saliva from five other dogs and were then identified by comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing. among 339 isolates, 84 different phylotypes belonging to 37 genera were identified. approximately half of the phylotypes were identified to the species level, and 28% of these were considered members of the indigenous oral microbiota of humans. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the remaining 44 phylotypes were not represented in genbank, and most of these phylotypes were tentatively identified as candidate new species. the genera most frequently isolated from saliva were actinomyces (26%), streptococcus (18%), and granulicatella (17%). the genera most frequently isolated from plaque were porphyromonas (20%), actinomyces (12%), and neisseria (10%). a comparison of the  dna sequences from this study with sequences of the human microbiota available in genbank showed that, on average, canine and human microbiotas differed by almost  7% in the 16s rrna gene. in conclusion, this study has shown that the cultivable  oral microbiotas of dogs and humans show significant differences.

TI  == [bacterial spectra and antibiotics in odontogenic infections. renaissance of the  penicillins?].
AB  == background: the role played by odontogenic infection in dental, oral, and maxillofacial surgery is not to be underestimated even at the present time. an extensive, standardized, prospective study was performed with the intention of verifying the bacterial spectrum of odontogenic infections to evaluate antibiotic sensitivity. material and methods: bacterial spectra and resistograms of 65 patients with an odontogenic infection were analyzed in a prospective study under standardized conditions for specimen collection and transport. results: a total of 226 bacterial strains were analyzed. the ratio between anaerobes and aerobes was approximately 2:1. the most frequent aerobes were members of the genera streptococcus (46 isolates), staphylococcus (10 isolates), and neisseria (9 isolates), respectively. the anaerobic gram-positive spectrum was dominated by members of the genera eubacterium (19 isolates), peptostreptococcus (16 isolates), and actinomyces (12 isolates). the most frequently isolated gram-negative anaerobes were prevotella (46 isolates), and fusobacterium (21 isolates). the overall resistance to antibiotics was very low: only 7.3% of all bacteria were resistant to penicillin g/v, and 8.8% showed resistance to ampicillin. the resistance rates to other beta-lactam antibiotics were 4.4% to piperacillin and 0.6% to imipenem, respectively. penicillin g presented the highest antimicrobial activity among aerobes: only 4.5% of anaerobic strains were resistant of penicillin g. the other resistance rates of anaerobic bacteria to antibiotics were as follows: ampicillin 24%, doxycycline 34%, erythromycin 18%, and clindamycin 9.3%. penicillin g was also highly antimicrobially active to anaerobes. the resistance rates were: penicillin g 8.1%, ampicillin 2.6%, doxycycline 9.2%, erythromycin 10.2%, and clindamycin 1.4%, respectively.

AB  == objectives: to assess antimicrobial activities of aqueous crude khat (catha edulis) extracts against a panel of oral microorganisms and to test their ability to modify bacterial resistance to tetracycline and penicillin in vitro. design: lyophilized aqueous extracts were prepared from three khat cultivars. the agar dilution method of the nccls was used to test the extracts, at concentrations of  20-1.25 mg/ml, against 33 oral strains. mic was defined as the lowest concentration at which there was no visible growth. slight growth was defined as  marked growth reduction (mgr). the e-test was used to determine the mics of tetracycline and penicillin-g for three resistant strains in absence and presence of a sub-mic of the khat extracts (5mg/ml). results: eighteen strains (55%) were  sensitive to the extracts (mics 5-20 mg/ml). most of these were periodontal pathogens with porphyromonas gingivalis and tannerella forsythensis being the most susceptible (mic 5-10mg/ml). veillonella parvula, actinomyces israelii and some streptococci were not sensitive. except for lactobacillus acidophilus that showed mgr at 1mg/ml, cariogenic species were neither sensitive. the extracts were active against streptococcus pyogenes (mic 10-20 mg/ml) but not against candida albicans and staphylococcus aureus. the presence of the khat extracts at  a sub-mic resulted in a 2-4-fold potentiation of the tested antibiotics against the resistant strains. conclusions: khat has water-soluble constituents possessing selective antibacterial activity against oral bacteria. there is preliminary evidence for presence of an antibiotic resistance-modifying component. further investigation is needed to identify the active components and  assess their clinical relevance.

TI  == mechanisms of inhibition by fluoride of urease activities of cell suspensions and biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii and of dental plaque.
AB  == background/aims: fluoride is known to be a potent inhibitor of bacterial ureases  and can also act in the form of hydrofluoric acid as a transmembrane proton conductor to acidify the cytoplasm of intact cells with possible indirect, acid inhibition of urease. our research objectives were to assess the inhibitory potencies of fluoride for three urease-positive bacteria commonly found in the mouth and to determine the relative importance of direct and indirect inhibition  of ureases for overall inhibition of intact cells or biofilms. methods: the experimental design involved intact bacteria in suspensions, mono-organism biofilms, cell extracts, and dental plaque. standard enzymatic assays for ammonia production from urea were used. results: we found that ureolysis by cells in suspensions or mono-organism biofilms of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus salivarius or actinomyces naeslundii was inhibited by fluoride at plaque levels of 0.1-0.5 mm in a ph-dependent manner. the results of experiments  with the organic weak acids indomethacin and capric acid, which do not directly inhibit urease enzyme, indicated that weak-acid effects leading to cytoplasmic acidification are also involved in fluoride inhibition. however, direct fluoride  inhibition of urease appeared to be the major mechanism for reduction in ureolytic activity in acid environments. results of experiments with freshly harvested supragingival dental plaque indicated responses to fluoride similar to  those of s. salivarius with ph-dependent fluoride inhibition and both direct and  indirect inhibition of urease. conclusion: fluoride can act to diminish alkali production from urea by oral bacteria through direct and indirect mechanisms.

AB  == objectives: since atraumatic restorative treatment (art) involves removal of carious lesions with manual instruments, improvement of filling materials to guarantee greater success should be considered. this study aimed to evaluate antibacterial, physical, and bonding properties of glass-ionomer cements (gic) containing chlorhexidine (chx), and to determine optimal concentrations for incorporation of agents to obtain antibacterial gics for use with the art approach. methods: chx diacetate combined with chx dihydrochloride was added to control gic powder to obtain concentration ratios of 1/0, 2/0, 3/0, 1/1, or 2/2%  w/w. antibacterial activity of each cement against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei or actinomyces naeslundii was examined using agar-diffusion methods, and release of chx was analyzed by hplc. compressive strength, bond strength to dentin, and setting time were measured, and compared with those of control samples. results: all experimental gics exhibited inhibition of three bacteria, but sizes of inhibition zones and concentrations of chx released were not dependent upon chx content. incorporation of chx diacetate at 2% or greater,  significantly decreased compressive strength, and bond strength to dentin was adversely affected by addition of chx diacetate at 2% or more (p<0.05, anova, fisher's plsd test), although setting time was extended a little by addition of any concentrations of chx. significance: the present results demonstrate that experimental gics containing chx are effective in inhibiting bacteria associated  with caries, and incorporation of 1% chx diacetate is optimal to give appropriate physical and bonding properties.

AB  == the shell-vial culture assay is performed routinely in our laboratory. recently we revisited our experience of using the shell-vial culture assay for the isolation of microorganisms from various clinical samples. over a 13-year period, we have isolated 580 bacterial strains (5%) from 11,083 clinical samples tested.  over the same period, 285 isolates of rickettsiae, bartonellae, or coxiella burnetii were cultured from a total of 7,102 samples tested. these isolates include 55 rickettsia sp. isolates, 95 coxiella burnetii isolates, and 135 bartonella sp. isolates. based on our experience with the growth of fastidious microorganisms, we have used a centrifugation shell-vial technique called jnsp, for "je ne sais pas" ("i don't know [what i am growing]") for the isolation of other microorganisms. a total of 173 isolates were cultured from the 3,861 clinical samples tested using the jnsp method. of these, 40 isolates had not been grown before on usual axenic medium. these include 2 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 7 isolates of streptococcus sp. and related genera, 6 mycobacterium sp. isolates, 1 nocardia asteroides isolate, 1 actinomyces sp. isolate, 1 brucella melitensis isolate, 2 francisella tularensis isolates, 1 mycoplasma pneumoniae isolate, and 1 legionella pneumophila isolate. using this protocol, we have also  cultured intracellular bacteria such as chlamydia trachomatis and we have performed the first culture and establishment of trophyrema whipplei. applied in  our laboratory, the shell-vial culture generally exhibits a low rate of success.  however, in some cases, this technique allowed microbial diagnosis when classical agar procedure and pcr were negative.

AB  == objectives: this study aimed to investigate the antibacterial effects of the dentin primer of a commercially available self-etching adhesive system, clearfil  protect bond, which contains antibacterial monomer 12-methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb). methods: inhibitory effects against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, or actinomyces naeslundii were examined by an agar-disc diffusion method using the clearfil protect bond primer  containing 5% mdpb and an acidic adhesion-promoting monomer mdp, the primer only  with mdp, and the primer with 1% cetylpyridinium chloride. the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentrations (mic/mbc) of each primer for the three bacterial species were determined by serial microdilution assays. for testing the bactericidal effects seen in dentin, the primer was applied to demineralized dentin blocks in which s. mutans had been impregnated, and numbers of viable bacteria were counted. results: for all three bacteria, the sizes of the inhibition zones produced by clearfil protect bond primer were significantly greater than for the other primers (p<0.05, anova and scheffe's f-test). the mic/mbc values of clearfil protect bond primer were less than those of the primer without mdpb, and comparable to those of the primer containing cetylpyridinium chloride. no bacterial recovery was obtained after application of clearfil protect bond primer to the bacteria-impregnated dentin, although the primer without mdpb showed some bactericidal effect. significance: clearfil protect bond primer has strong antibacterial activity based upon mdpb against s. mutans, l. casei and a. naeslundii, and the capability to disinfect cavities containing residual bacteria.

TI  == in vivo evaluation of the effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on salivary bacteria using the checkerboard method.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial effect of essential oil-containing oral strips on different species of the oral microbiota. methodology: saliva samples were collected from 20 subjects with good oral health, diluted and plated onto blood agar medium. the subjects were asked to place the strip (listerine pocketpaks) on the tongue allowing it to dissolve. after 30 minutes, new saliva samples were collected again and the plates with the samples were incubated under anaerobic conditions at 37 degrees c for seven days. colony counts (cfu/ml) were determined for each sample. the colonies on the plates were washed with 1 ml of te buffer, and the bacterial suspensions were processed for the identification of 24 species by dna probes and the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method. differences in total counts, prevalence, and levels of the species evaluated before and after placement of the strips were determined by wilcoxon sign rank and chi-square tests. results: a modest increase in the total bacterial number in saliva from 1.4 x 10(8) to 1.7 x 10(8) bacterial cells  was observed 30 minutes after the strip placement, although this change was not significant (p = 0.632). most of the species reduced in frequency and/or levels,  including the pathogens a. actinomycetemcomitans, c. rectus, e. corrodens, fusobacterium spp., p. intermedia, and s. noxia, as well as the beneficial species a. meyeri, a. georgia, a. gerencseriae, a. odontolyticus, and p. acnes after strip placement. in contrast, a. viscosus, p. melaninogenica, p. gingivalis, p. micros, streptococcus spp., t. forsythensis, and v. parvula presented an increase in prevalence and/or levels. these changes were not statistically significant after adjusting for multiple comparisons (p > 0.0022).  conclusion: the use of the essential oil-containing oral strips resulted in a short-term small increase in the total number of salivary microorganisms. in addition, a not significant decrease of certain periodontopathogens, and an increase in species compatible with oral health were observed.

TI  == microbubble-induced detachment of coadhering oral bacteria from salivary pellicles.
AB  == the presence and maturity of the salivary pellicle influences microbial adhesion  and its tenacity in the oral cavity, posing a challenge to different plaque-control systems. some plaque-control systems rely on surface-tension forces arising from passing microbubbles sprayed over the pellicle. passage of such bubbles is accompanied by a high fluid flow, but systematic studies are lacking on the contribution of fluid flow vs. microbubbles towards plaque removal. therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the detachment efficacy of laminar fluid flow (wall shear rates 11,000-16,000 s(-1)), with and without microbubbles, towards the detachment of actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, and their coadhering aggregates, from salivary pellicles formed over 2 h or 16 h from reconstituted human whole saliva. microbubbles in a fluid flow were more efficient at inducing single bacterial detachment, resulting in almost complete (97%) removal for s. oralis j22 and a 15-fold increase in a. naeslundii t14v-j1 removal as compared to the detachment caused by fluid flow alone. a. naeslundii was more difficult to remove and apparently formed the strongest bonds with high-molecular-weight proteins in 16-h pellicles. the detachment of coaggregates after 2 min left a substantial amount of adhered bacterial mass, including more than 60% of singly attached a. naeslundii on the pellicle surface, providing nucleation sites for the de novo adhesion of coadhering streptococci.

TI  == the complex oral microflora of high-risk individuals and groups and its role in the caries process.
AB  == the involvement of the oral biofilm in the caries process requires re-evaluation. the essential role of mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) in the caries process is not proven. acid production by dental plaque is not dependent upon the presence of mutans streptococci; caries occurs in the absence of these species and their presence does not necessarily indicate caries  activity. other oral bacteria, non-mutans streptococci, actinomyces spp. and bifidobacterium spp., are acidogenic and aciduric. they outnumber mutans streptococci in dental plaque, and there are data which support a role for these  bacteria in the initiation and progression of caries. molecular studies demonstrate the great diversity and complexity of the flora associated with caries. many taxa identified have not been cultured and the role of these taxa is not known. we have, in mutans streptococci, good markers of disease but not necessarily the aetiological agents of the disease. considerably more research is required to investigate the transition of tooth surfaces from being intact and sound to the white spot lesion stage. a combination of conventional and molecular approaches are required to elucidate the involvement of an individual taxon and of microbial populations with particular traits in the caries process.

TI  == influence of fluid shear and microbubbles on bacterial detachment from a surface.
AB  == prevention of microbial adhesion and detachment of adhering microorganisms from surfaces is important in many environmental, industrial, and medical applications. fluid shear is an obvious parameter for stimulating microbial detachment from surfaces, but recently it has been pointed out that a passing air-liquid interface also has potential in stimulating microbial detachment. in the present study, the ability of microbubbles to stimulate detachment of bacterial strains from a glass surface is compared with the effects of fluid flow. adhesion and detachment of actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, streptococcus oralis j22, and their coadhering aggregates were studied on glass, mounted in a parallel plate flow chamber. high fluid wall shear rates (11,000 to 16,000 s(-1)) were established in a laminar flow regime in the absence and presence of microbubbles. wall shear rates stimulated detachment ranging from 70% to 30% for  s. oralis and a. naeslundii, respectively. coadhering aggregates were detached up to 54%. the presence of microbubbles in the flow increased the detachment of a. naeslundii within 2 min of flow from 40% in the absence of microbubbles to 98%, while detachment of neither s. oralis nor coadhering aggregates was affected by the presence of microbubbles. in summary, extremely high fluid flows can be effective in stimulating microbial detachment, depending on the strain involved.  the addition of microbubbles to the flow allows the detachment of tenaciously adhering bacteria not detached by flow alone, but not of adhering coaggregates.

TI  == salivary actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacillus casei levels predict pregnancy outcomes.
AB  == background: gravida's poor periodontal health is emerging as a modifiable independent risk factor for preterm delivery and low birth weight. methods: to test the hypothesis that oral bacteria other than periodontal pathogens are also  associated with pregnancy outcomes, specific oral bacterial levels measured during pregnancy were evaluated in relation to gestational age and birth weight while controlling for demographic, medical, and dental variables. the study population consisted of 297 predominantly african- american women who were pregnant for the first time. the salivary bacterial levels evaluated were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguinus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies (gsp) 1 and 2, total streptococci, and total cultivable organisms. results: for 1 unit increase in log(10) a. naeslundii gsp 2 levels, there was a 60 gm decrease in birth weight (beta = -59.7 g; se = 29.1; p = 0.04), and a 0.17  week decrease in gestational age (beta = -0.17 wk; se = 0.09; p = 0.05). in contrast, per 1 unit increase in log(10) l. casei levels, there was a 42 gm increase in birth weight (beta = 42.2 g; se = 19.3; p = 0.03), and a 0.13 week increase in gestational age (beta = 0.13 week; se = 0.06; p = 0.04). conclusions: we conclude that other oral bacterial species can also be related to pregnancy outcomes in addition to previously reported periodontal pathogens. these organism levels may not only predict poor pregnancy outcomes, but also be used as modifiable risk factors in reducing prematurity and low birth weight.

AB  == fluoridated dentifrices reduce dental caries in subjects who perform effective oral hygiene. actinomyces naeslundii increases in teeth-adherent microbial biofilms (plaques) in these subjects, and a well-characterized serum immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody response (actinomyces antibody [a-ab]) is also increased. other studies suggest that a serum igg antibody response to streptococcal d-alanyl poly(glycerophosphate) (s-ab) may indicate caries experience associated strongly with gingival health and exposure to fluoridated water. the aim of this study was to investigate relationships between a-ab response, oral hygiene, s-ab response, and caries experience. measurements were made of a-ab and s-ab concentrations, caries experience (number of decayed, missing, and filled teeth [dmft], number of teeth surfaces [dmfs], and number of  decayed teeth needing treated [dt]), exposure to fluoridated water (flu), mean clinical pocket depth (pd; in millimeters), and extent of plaque (pl) and gingival bleeding on probing (bop). a-ab concentration, the dependent variable in a multiple regression analysis, increased with s-ab concentration and decreased with pl and dmft adjusted for flu (r(2) = 0.51, p < 0.002). residual associations with age, dmfs, dt, and bop were not significant. in addition, an elevated a-ab response, defined from immunoprecipitation and immunoassay measurements, indicated a significant, 30% reduction in dmft after adjustment for significant age and flu covariance (analysis of variance with covariance f statistic = 10.6,  p < 0.003; s-ab response and interactions not significant). thus, an elevated a-ab response indicates less caries in subjects performing effective oral hygiene using fluoridated dentifrices. conversely, a low a-ab response is suggestive of decreased a. naeslundii binding to saliva-coated apatite and greater caries experience, as reported by others.

TI  == in situ and non-invasive detection of specific bacterial species in oral biofilms using fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == noninvasive in situ detection of suspected cariogenic bacterial species within dental biofilms could facilitate monitoring of the dynamic change of oral microbial flora and assist in the assessment of the treatment efficacy of therapeutic agents. in this study, we explore the possibility to use three well-characterized monoclonal antibodies (mabs) against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces naeslundii, and lactobacillus casei to identify these three important members of the oral microbial community in the complex environment of oral biofilms. these mabs, which were conjugated to different fluorescent labels and visualized with confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), proved to be an useful tool to identify the three species of interest (s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l.  casei) under various experimental conditions including in vitro and in vivo derived oral biofilms. manifold addition of the mabs on consecutive days did not  alter the biofilm structure thus allowing monitoring of the same biofilm over extended time periods. using this mab-based method the effect of sucrose challenge on the biofilm composition and the distribution of s. mutans, a. naeslundii, and l. casei were examined. s. mutans was found to be the predominant species under the various biofilm conditions tested. these studies indicate that  mabs based bacterial detection with clsm is a versatile tool which permits new insights into the ecology of oral biofilm development.

TI  == microcalorimetric study on the influence of temperature on bacterial coaggregation.
AB  == binding isotherms and heats of interaction have been determined at 15, 25, and 40 degrees c for a coaggregating and a non-coaggregating oral bacterial pair. heats  of interaction were measured upon three consecutive injections of streptococci into an actinomyces suspension using isothermal titration calorimetry. after each injection, the number of streptococci injected remaining free in suspension was quantified microscopically and the degree of binding between the two bacterial strains was established. the coaggregating pair shows positive cooperative binding. the highest cooperativity, at 25 degrees c, correlates with a strong, macroscopically visible coaggregation. the non-coaggregating pair shows low cooperativity and lacks macroscopically visible coaggregation. interactions between the coaggregating partners seem to be mainly due to specific, enthalpically saturable and favorable binding sites. even though the enthalpic part of the interaction is saturated, cooperativity increases with consecutive injections, implying that the coaggregation phenomenon is driven by entropy gain. the change in heat capacity (deltac(p)) is positive for the non-coaggregating pair from 15-40 degrees c as well as for the coaggregating pair beyond 25 degrees c. at lower temperatures the coaggregating pair causes a negative deltac(p). the  decrease in heat capacity together with an increase in entropy is considered to be indicative of hydrophobic interactions playing an important role in the formation of large coaggregates as observed for the coaggregating pair at 25 degrees c.

TI  == effect of withdrawal of fluoride-containing toothpaste on the interproximal plaque microflora.
AB  == to compare the effects of fluoride-containing and fluoride-free toothpaste on plaque microflora, 15 subjects were enrolled in a double-blind crossover trial. all subjects used a fluoride toothpaste for 7 days before the trial started. then, 4 interproximal sites per subject were professionally cleaned and subjects  used one of the toothpastes for 5 days. on the 5th day plaque was collected from  2 sites, 12 and 6 h after toothpaste use. there was no difference between the groups in the numbers or proportions of aciduric bacteria (recovered at ph 4.8 or 5.2), or of yeasts, neisseriae, lactobacilli or streptococci (total or individual species, including streptococcus mutans). however, the numbers and proportions of gram-positive pleomorphic rods, primarily actinomyces naeslundii, increased in 6-hour samples from subjects using fluoride toothpaste. the data suggest that the anti-caries effect of fluoride toothpaste is not mediated primarily through effects on the plaque microflora, although effects on plaque physiology could be  important.

TI  == survey of oral microbial diversity using pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == polymicrobial biofilms in the human oral cavity exhibit marked diversity. pcr-based denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) surveys microbial diversity by displaying pcr-generated 16s rdna fragments that migrate at different distances, reflecting the differences in the base-pair (i.e., % g+c) composition of the fragment. this study examined dgge-generated diversity profiles of cultivable bacteria from individuals with different caries status. initially, we developed a set of pcr-dgge running conditions appropriate to oral  bacteria. next, we assessed migration standards from known oral bacterial reference strains. to test the methods, we profiled 20 bacterial saliva samples cultivated from young adults. the study produced a battery of species-specific 16s rdna amplicons that could be used as a migration distance standard necessary  for computer-assisted profile analysis. from the clinical samples, we found a significantly greater diversity of oral microbes in caries-free individuals compared with caries-active individuals (p = 0.01). these findings suggest thtat  a portion of oral microbiota of caries-active individuals may be absent, suppressed, or replaced.

TI  == a triclosan-containing compomer reduces lactobacillus spp. predominant in advanced carious lesions.
AB  == objectives: to assess the antimicrobial effect of acid etching or a triclosan-containing compomer on the cultivable microflora of incompletely excavated dentinal carious lesions. methods: thirty detinal lesions were opened with a diamond burr. subsequent to removal of the softened biomass a sample of dentin was taken from the cavity floor with a round bur. ten cavities each were treated with 36% phosphoric acid (ph) for 15s, covered with a triclosan-containing compomer (tc) or received no treatment as control (co). all  lesions were restored with a compomer composite. sampling was performed directly  after etching in the ph group and at re-entry after 6 weeks in all groups. aliquots were plated on blood agar and selective media for lactobacilli (rogosa)  and mutans streptococci (msb). cultures were incubated anaerobically for 7 days at 37 degrees c prior to quantitative assessment and biotyping of the isolates. results: application of phosphoric acid resulted in initial reduction of the totally cultivable microflora (p=0.006). evaluation of the total number of cultivable microflora after 6 weeks revealed no differences between the groups (p>0.05). lactobacilli counts were significantly lower in the tc group compared to the ph and co groups (p<0.05). no difference was detected between the ph and co groups after 6 weeks. significance: phosphoric acid initially reduces the number of microorganisms in carious dentin but not in the longer term. the experimental triclosan composite suppresses lactobacilli species over a period of 6 weeks.

TI  == phenotypic and genotypic selection of microbiota surviving under dental restorations.
AB  == the effects of sealing infected carious dentine below dental restorations on the  phenotypic and genotypic diversity of the surviving microbiota was investigated.  it was hypothesized that the microbiota would be subject to nutrient limitation or nutrient simplification, as it would no longer have access to dietary components or salivary secretion for growth. the available nutrients would be limited primarily to serum proteins passing from the pulp through the patent dentinal tubules to the infected dentine. ten lesions were treated, and infected  dentine was sealed below dental restorations for approximately 5 months. duplicate standardized samples of infected dentine were taken at baseline and after the removal of the restorations. the baseline microbiota were composed primarily of lactobacillus spp., streptococcus mutans, streptococcus parasanguinis, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. none of these  taxa were isolated among the microbiota of the dentine samples taken after 5 months, which consisted of only actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, and streptococcus mitis. the microbiota of the final sample exhibited a significantly (p < 0.001) increased ability to produce glycosidic enzymes (sialidase, beta-n-acetylglucosaminidase, and beta-galactosidase), which liberate sugars from glycoproteins. the genotypic diversity of s. oralis and a. naeslundii was significantly (p = 0.002 and p = 0.001, respectively) reduced in the final samples. there was significantly (p < 0.001) greater genotypic diversity within these taxa between the pairs of dentine samples taken at baseline than was found in the 5-month samples, indicating that  the dentine was more homogenous than it was at baseline. we propose that during the interval between placement of the restorations and their removal, the available nutrient, primarily serum proteins, or the relative simplicity and homogeneity of the nutrient supply significantly affected the surviving microbiota. the surviving microbiota was less complex, based on compositional, phenotypic, and genotypic analyses, than that isolated from carious lesions which were also exposed to salivary secretions and ph perturbations.

AB  == the influence of streptococcus mitis bms biosurfactants on the adhesion of eight  pioneer and four cariogenic oral bacterial strains was, for a first screening, examined in a microtiter plate assay. the adhesion to pellicle-coated wells of three cariogenic strains was inhibited >70% by the biosurfactants, while only one pioneer strain showed >70% reduction. the reduction for the other strains did not exceed 50%. subsequently, adhesion of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 and streptococcus sobrinus hg 1025, both cariogenic strains, and actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 and streptococcus oralis j22, two pioneer strains, to biosurfactants-coated enamel with and without a salivary pellicle was studied in  a parallel plate flow chamber. a biosurfactants coating to enamel with or without a pellicle caused a reduction in the number of adhering cariogenic organisms, although no such reduction was observed for the pioneer strains. consequently, it is concluded that s. mitis bms biosurfactants may play a protective role against  adhesion of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == fluid- or surface-phase human salivary scavenger protein gp340 exposes different  bacterial recognition properties.
AB  == salivary scavenger receptor cysteine-rich protein gp340 aggregates streptococci and other bacteria as part of the host innate defense system at mucosal surfaces. in this article, we have investigated the properties of fluid-phase gp340 and hydroxylapatite surface-adsorbed gp340 in aggregation and adherence, respectively, of viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus gordonii and streptococcus mutans), non-viridans group streptococci (e.g., streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus suis), and oral actinomyces. fluid-phase gp340 and surface-phase gp340 bioforms were differentially recognized by streptococci, which formed three phenotypic groupings according to their modes of interaction with gp340. group i streptococci were aggregated by and adhered to gp340, and group ii streptococci preferentially adhered to surface-bound gp340, while group  iii streptococci were preferentially aggregated by gp340. each species of streptococcus tested was found to contain strains representative of at least two  of these gp340 interaction groupings. the gp340 interaction modes i to iii and sugar specificities of gp340 binding strains coincided for several species. many  gp340 interactions were sialidase sensitive, and each of the interaction modes (i to iii) for s. gordonii was correlated with a variant of sialic acid specificity. adherence of s. gordonii dl1 (challis) to surface-bound gp340 was dependent upon  expression of the sialic acid binding adhesin hsa. however, aggregation of cells  by fluid-phase gp340 was independent of hsa and involved sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family) polypeptides. conversely, both gp340-mediated aggregation and adherence of s. mutans ng8 involved antigen i/ii polypeptide. deletion of the mga virulence regulator gene in s. pyogenes resulted in increased cell aggregation by gp340. these results suggest that salivary gp340 recognizes different bacterial receptors according to whether gp340 is present in the fluid phase or surface bound. this phase-associated differential recognition by gp340 of streptococcal species of different levels of virulence and diverse origins may mediate alternative host responses to commensal or pathogenic bacterial phenotypes.

TI  == the antimicrobial activity of a dentin conditioner combined with antibacterial agents.
AB  == dental hand instruments are not efficient in removing all infected dentin when performing carious removal for minimal intervention techniques. the use of an antibacterial dentin conditioner may therefore be useful when restoring cavities  that have residual carious dentin. antibacterial agents--chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide, benzaikonium chloride and sodium hypochlorite, were added either to a dentin conditioner used for glass ionomer cements or distilled water at 1% concentration. dentin conditioning solutions at ph 2.5, 4.9 and 7.7 were also prepared, along with 1% aqueous thymol. using an agar diffusion test, 25 microl aliquots were examined for their  inhibitory effects on three cariogenic bacteria. after 24 hours, an agar pellet was extracted adjacent to the agar well and placed on a second inoculated agar plate to observe sustained inhibitory effects, after which this procedure was repeated one more time. antibacterial dentin conditioners showed significant inhibitory effect compared to the control over the three test periods (p<0.016).  the combination of dentin conditioners with antibacterial agents significantly reduced the inhibitory effect compared to the antibacterial aqueous solutions (p<0.016). one-percent aqueous thymol showed no inhibitory effect against the test bacteria. the cetrimide-dentin conditioner showed the greatest inhibitory effect against all three test bacteria over the three experimental periods (p<0.016). the inhibitory effect of antibacterial agents was significantly reduced when combined with a dentin conditioner. only the cetrimide-dentin conditioner combination produced significant inhibitory effects against all three test organisms.

TI  == differential binding specificities of oral streptococcal antigen i/ii family adhesins for human or bacterial ligands.
AB  == the antigen i/ii (agi/ii) family polypeptides, ranging from 1310 to 1653 amino acid (aa) residues, are cell wall anchored adhesins expressed by most indigenous  species of oral streptococci. the polypeptides interact with a wide range of host molecules, in particular salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag or gp340), and with ligands on other oral bacteria. to determine the receptor recognition properties of six different agi/ii family polypeptides from strains of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus intermedius and streptococcus mutans, the genes were cloned and expressed on the surface of the surrogate host lactococcus  lactis. the s. gordonii sspa and sspb polypeptides mediated higher binding levels of l. lactis cells to surface immobilized gp340 than did s. intermedius pas protein, or s. mutans spap or pac proteins. however, the agi/ii proteins were all similar in their abilities to mediate aggregation of lactococci by fluid phase gp340. the spap(i) polypeptide from s. mutans ingbritt, which was c-terminally truncated by approximately 400 aa residues, did not bind gp340. lactococci expressing agi/ii proteins, including spap(i), were aggregated by a synthetic 16  aa residue peptide srcrp2 derived from the aa repeat block sequences within gp340. in coaggregation assays, sspb from s. gordonii was unique in mediating coaggregation with only group a and group e strains of actinomyces naeslundii. all the other agi/ii polypeptides mediated coaggregation with group c and group d strains of a. naeslundii. analysis of chimeric protein constructs revealed that coaggregation specificity was determined by sequences within the n-terminal half  of agi/ii protein. a synthetic peptide (20 aa residues), which defines a putative adhesion epitope within the c-terminal region of polypeptide, inhibited agi/ii-mediated aggregation by gp340 but did not affect coaggregation with a. naeslundii. these results suggest that different mechanisms operate in interactions of agi/ii family polypeptides with native gp340, gp340 srcr domain peptide, and a. naeslundii. specificity of these interactions appears to be determined by discontinuous but interacting regions of the polypeptides, thus providing flexibility in receptor recognition for streptococcal colonization of the human host.

AB  == background: cecropin-xj belongs to cecropin-b, which is the most potent antibacterial peptide found naturally. the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of cecropin-xj on growth and adherence of oral cariogenic bacteria. methods: four oral cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii) were chosen for this experiment. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) and reductive percent of bacterial growth were used to assay the antibacterial activity of cecropin-xj. mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj was tested with human periodontal membrane fibroblasts by tetrazolium (mtt) colorimetric assay. the bacterial morphological changes induced by cecropin-xj were examined on scanning  electron microscope (sem). the influence of cecropin-xj on bacterial adhesion to  saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) was measured by scintillation counting. results: the mics of cecropin-xj for inhibition of the growth of four bacteria ranged from 4.0 to 42.8 micromol/l with the highest susceptible to a. naeslundii  and the lowest susceptible to l. acidophilus. at ph 6.8, 5.5 and 8.2, 1/2 mic of  cecropin-xj reduced the number of viable bacteria by 40.9%, 67.8% and 32.8% for s. mutans and by 28.1%, 57.2% and 37.9% for l. acidophilus. the activities against s. mutans and l. acidophilus increased at ph 5.5 compared with ph 6.8 (p  < 0.01, respectively). in present of 50% saliva, 1/2 mic of the peptide decreased the direct count of viable cells by 29.2% and 14.4% for s. mutans and l. acidophilus, respectively (p < 0.01 and p > 0.05, respectively), whereas almost no reduction counts were detected in the presence of 20% serum for both bacteria  (p > 0.05, respectively). mammalian cytotoxicity of cecropin-xj from 1.0 to 100 micromol/l exhibited no cytotoxicity against human periodontal membrane fibroblasts (p > 0.05). bacterial morphological changes induced by mic of cecropin-xj examined on sem showed cell surface disruption. furthermore, the ability of a. naeslundii adhesion to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 10 and 20 minutes (p = 0.001 and 0.000, respectively), and s. mutans, a. viscosus to s-ha decreased significantly with mic of cecropin-xj for 20 minutes (p = 0.000, respectively). conclusions: cecropin-xj exhibited bactericidal action against cariogenic pathogens, and the antibacterial activity  enhanced in the acid environment. the results also demonstrate that cecropin-xj prevents s. mutans and actinomyces adsorption to s-ha. these findings suggest that cecropin-xj may have potential to prevent caries.

TI  == effectiveness of a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice on microbiological and inflammatory parameters.
AB  == according to the us surgeon general's report, "oral health in america," published in 2000, most adults in the united states show some degree of periodontal pathology, with severe periodontal diseases affecting about 14% of middle-aged adults. periodontal diseases are polymicrobial-induced inflammatory diseases, and they vary from mild gingival inflammation to severe deterioration of the periodontium, ie, loss of periodontal supportive tissues and, ultimately, tooth loss. new evidence shows that periodontal diseases may impact systemic health. for this reason, the maintenance of a healthy mouth is becoming increasingly important for the overall health of the body. this article summarizes laboratory  research conducted during the development of a novel, multibenefit, oral-care technology based on triclosan--a broad-spectrum antibacterial agent--and a polyvinylmethylether/maleic acid copolymer. this unique combination of agents is  found in colgate total, a clinically proven efficacious dentifrice for control of dental plaque and gingivitis. data are presented that demonstrate the unique antibacterial properties of this dentifrice: (1) a broad-spectrum antimicrobial profile; (2) the long-lasting retention of triclosan on hydroxyapatite and epithelial cells; and (3) molecular evidence of antibacterial activity against specific pathogens in clinical dental plaque. in addition, data are presented that demonstrate the anti-inflammatory effects of triclosan on specific cytokines, the interruption of inflammatory pathways, and the inhibition of bone  resorption. overall, these data support the multibenefit clinical effects of colgate total and suggest a plurality of mechanisms of action.

TI  == differences in the subgingival microbiota of swedish and usa subjects who were periodontally healthy or exhibited minimal periodontal disease.
AB  == background: previous studies have shown differences in the mean proportions of subgingival species in samples from periodontitis subjects in different countries, which may relate to differences in diet, genetics, disease susceptibility and manifestation. the purpose of the present investigation was to determine whether there were differences in the subgingival microbiotas of swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal periodontal disease. method: one hundred and fifty eight periodontally healthy or minimally diseased subjects (n sweden=79; usa=79) were recruited. subjects were measured at baseline for plaque, gingivitis, bop, suppuration, pocket depth and attachment level at 6 sites per tooth. subgingival plaque samples taken from the  mesial aspect of each tooth at baseline were individually analyzed, in one laboratory, for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna  hybridization (total samples=4345). % dna probe counts comprised by each species  was determined for each site and averaged across sites in each subject. significance of differences in proportions of each species between countries was  determined using ancova adjusting for age, mean pocket depth, gender and smoking  status. p values were adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed to group subjects based on their subgingival microbial profiles using a chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. results: on average, all species were detected in samples from subjects in both countries. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 5 species were in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in swedish than american subjects: actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 (9.7, 3.3); streptococcus sanguis (2.5, 1.2); eikenella  corrodens (1.7, 1.0); tannerella forsythensis (3.5, 2.3) and prevotella melaninogenica (6.3, 1.8). leptotrichia buccalis was in significantly higher adjusted mean percentages in american (5.5) than swedish subjects (3.0). cluster  analysis grouped 121 subjects into 8 microbial profiles. twenty four of the 40 test species examined differed significantly among cluster groups. five clusters  were dominated by american subjects and 2 clusters by swedish subjects. fifty eight of 79 (73%) of the swedish subjects fell into 1 cluster group dominated by  high proportions of a. naeslundii genospecies 1, prevotella nigrescens, t. forsythensis and p. melaninogenica. other clusters were characterized by high proportions of actinomyces gerencseriae, veillonella parvula, capnocytophaga gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, eubacterium saburreum, l. buccalis and neisseria mucosa. conclusions: the microbial profiles of subgingival plaque samples from swedish and american subjects who exhibited periodontal health or minimal disease differed. the heterogeneity in subgingival microbial profiles was more pronounced in the american subjects, possibly because of greater genetic and microbiologic diversity in the american subjects sampled.

AB  == bacterial coaggregation reactions between different species and the auto aggregation of the same species are associated with the initiation and development of dental plaque and biofilms. as no such data is available on isolates from root caries lesions, we evaluated, by a visual, semi-quantitative scoring system and a spectrophotometric, quantitative assay, the coaggregation of 22 different wild-type microbial species comprising ten bacterial genera and a single candida spp. the quantitative coaggregation assay we used proved to be a more sensitive method than the semi-quantitative, visual evaluation as the results yielded the percent coaggregation. fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus bovis ii/2 and gemella morbillorum were observed having higher degrees of autoaggregation than the other examined strains. significant levels of inter-species coaggregation was seen between: (1) actinomyces spp. and veillonella spp.; (2) actinomyces israelii and peptostreptococcus prevotii; (3) campylobacter gracilis and actinomyces spp.; (4) prevotella intermedia and nine different species; and (5) fusobacterium nucleatum and six other species. the single candida albicans isolate did not coaggregate to a significant extent with any of the 21 bacterial isolates studied. scanning electron microscopy observation of the coaggregation interactions between bacterial pairs having strong coaggregation reactions revealed varying adhesive patterns. our findings on coaggregation amongst these isolates imply existence of multiple interactions between the coaggregation-inducing bacterial species in root caries. in particular, actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., prevotella spp. and fusobacterium spp. appear to play a significant role in this context.

TI  == the microflora of the erupting first permanent molar.
AB  == the relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. a significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified  as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased  numbers of streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. significantly greater numbers and proportions of s. oralis and s. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. this study suggests that  organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.

TI  == microbiological basis of oral infections and sensitivity to antibiotics.
AB  == because oral infections are common, the physician must understand the underlying  etiology, pathogeny, and other variables that determine how these processes evolve in order to choose the most appropriate antibiotic drug. the special characteristics of the oral cavity determine the make-up of the microflora that lives there. different anaerobic species belonging to the peptostreptococcus, prevotella, fusobacterium, gemella, and porphyromonas genera are of particular interest, as are the aerobic species streptococcus, staphylococcus, and corynebacterium. each of these microorganisms occupies a different microniche within the oral cavity, and the prevailing balance is upset when conditions become modified as a result of illness or due to dental interventions such as tooth extraction or tooth scaling and polishing. pathogenic or opportunistic bacteria (actinomyces, prevotella intermedia species, etc.) can develop in these  conditions, as can yeasts (candida sp., histoplasma capsulatum), virus (herpes simplex, papilomavirus), and parasites (entamoeba gingivalis, trichomonas tenax). when infection occurs, the patients s immune system reacts by means of inborn immunity (non-specific) and acquired immunity (specific). empirical treatment is  administered that should be based on etiological data and on the antimicrobial sensitivity of the pathogen that is causing the infection. however, oral microflora sensitivity to different antibiotics is currently declining and there  is a noticeable trend towards resistances. as a consequence of all this, the treatment of oral infections must also aim to restore the ecological balance of the oral cavity and to minimize the emergence of resistance in the microorganisms present in the mouth. hence, epidemiological oral pathogen sensitivity studies must be conducted, fostering the administration of appropriate antibiotics at proper doses and keeping specialists abreast of the latest trends. in recent decades, oral infections comprise one of the most common pathologies in the general population, due in large part to infectious complications associated with poor oral hygiene. this in turn, translates into an increased need and demand for dental care, while at the same time, it requires that the professional accurately understand the etiological factors involved, as well as the pathogeny and different variables that determine the specificity of these kinds of infections,  so as to be able to choose the appropriate antimicrobial drugs for proper treatment.

TI  == identification of early microbial colonizers in human dental biofilm.
AB  == aims: to elucidate the first colonizers within in vivo dental biofilm and to establish potential population shifts that occur during the early phases of biofilm formation. methods and results: a 'checkerboard' dna-dna hybridization assay was employed to identify 40 different bacterial strains. dental biofilm samples were collected from 15 healthy subjects, 0, 2, 4 and 6 h after tooth cleaning and the composition of these samples was compared with that of whole saliva collected from the same individuals. the bacterial distribution in biofilm samples was distinct from that in saliva, confirming the selectivity of the adhesion process. in the very early stages, the predominant tooth colonizers were found to be actinomyces species. the relative proportion of streptococci, in particular streptococcus mitis and s. oralis, increased at the expense of actinomyces species between 2 and 6 h while the absolute level of actinomyces remained unaltered. periodontal pathogens such as tannerella forsythensis(bacteroides forsythus), porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola as well as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were present in extremely low levels at all the examined time intervals in this healthy group of  subjects. conclusion: the data provide a detailed insight into the bacterial population shifts occurring within the first few hours of biofilm formation and show that the early colonizers of the tooth surface predominantly consist of beneficial micro-organisms. significance and impact of the study: the early colonizers of dental plaque are of great importance in the succession stages of biofilm formation and its overall effect on the oral health of the host.

TI  == anti-bacterial efficacy of new self-etching dentine bonding agent.
AB  == since a perfect seal is not easily achieved during bonding procedures, any product which will limit or delay bacterial proliferation in the resulting micro-leakage spaces should extend the life span of bonded restorations. this study compared the antibacterial properties of an experimental, self-etching, fluoride-releasing, antibacterial bonding system (abf) with two standard bonding  systems (se bond and scotchbond mp). spread plates of three different bacteria (streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus paracasei and actinomyces naeslundii) were prepared on brain-heart infusion agar. standardised, sterilised filtration paper  disks were infiltrated with 20 microl of primer and then placed on the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c for 48 hours. the extent of the inhibition zones were measured at different positions and data were analysed using the student t-test to determine significant differences. all three primers showed zones of inhibition for all three bacteria tested. inhibition zones for abf primer against s. mutans were significantly larger (p<0.05) compared to that of scotchbond mp and se bond. in general the antibacterial activity of the three primers against the three bacteria tested varied, and the inhibitory effect for the experimental primer was significantly superior against s. mutans only.

TI  == in vitro growth, acidogenicity and cariogenicity of predominant human root caries flora.
AB  == streptococcus mutans (sm), lactobacillus acidophilus (la) and actinomyces israelii (ai) have been associated with root surface caries, which is an increasing problem in elderly chinese. the aim of this study therefore, was to evaluate in vitro, the growth, acidogenicity and cariogenicity of these organisms, both in mono- and co-cultures using an in vitro model. forty-eight root specimens were prepared using intact extracted human molars. fresh, wild-type bacteria obtained from root caries lesions were assembled into seven experimental groups as either mono- or co-cultures and incubated with the root specimens. appropriate controls were included. growth curve of each experimental  group was monitored for 24h, aerobically, at 37 degrees c using a microplate reader. the ph of the medium was recorded after 24-h incubation using a ph meter. mean depths of artificial root lesions produced in each cultural group were measured using polarized light microscopy in specimens cut into thin sections (100+/-20 microm). compared with mono-cultures, synergistic growth was observed in co-cultures of 'la+sm', 'ai+la' and 'ai+la+sm'. mean lesion depth produced in  la group was significantly shallower than other mono- or co-culture groups (p<0.01). the ph values of all culture media were similar after 24-h incubation.  the current data elucidate the complex interactions of three predominant bacterial species considered prime agents of human root surface caries.

TI  == path-dependency of the interaction between coaggregating and between non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a thermodynamic approach.
AB  == coaggregation, i.e. specific recognition between bacteria from different species, is a well-described phenomenon in the human oral cavity but remains physically poorly understood. with our study we aimed at elucidating some aspects of the mechanism of the coaggregation between the oral bacteria streptococcus oralis j22 and actinomyces naeslundii 147, in particular with respect to the driving force for coaggregation and its pathway-dependency. to that end, the macroscopic turbidity of the bacterial suspension, the morphology of the coaggregates, binding isotherms and heats of interaction were compared between the above-mentioned coaggregating bacterial pair and a non-coaggregating pair, streptococcus sanguis pk1889 and a. naeslundii 147. the coaggregating pair forms  large aggregates, which rapidly sediment from the suspension while the non-coaggregating pair forms only very small coaggregates that remain homogeneously suspended. coaggregation is further characterized by a high affinity between the partner cells that bind to each other in a strong cooperative mode. the interactions between both pairs occur under the release of  heat and are thus enthalpically favorable. more heat is released for the coaggregating than for the non-coaggregating pair. adding the coaggregating bacteria in steps to each other leads to saturation of enthalpically favorable binding sites. this is observed when the streptococcus is added to the actinomyces as well as when the addition is done the other way around. it is concluded that the cooperativity of the coaggregation process is based on an increase of entropy. it is furthermore shown that the density of the coaggregates as well as the heat effect of formation of these coaggregates depend on the number of steps in which the partner cells are added to each other. adding s. oralis j22 in three steps to a. naeslundii 147 results in the formation of denser coaggregates under the release of less heat, as compared to that of addition in one step. these differences point to a larger entropy increase when in a step-wise mixing the coaggregating bacteria are allowed to form more densely-packed coaggregates.

TI  == the antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices: results of an in vitro diffusion method study.
AB  == background: increasing numbers of americans are using natural herbal products for general and oral health care. few of these products, however, have undergone rigorous testing, as evidenced by the limited amount of information on their safety and efficacy in the literature. the authors conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of 14 natural herbal dentifrices. methods: the authors used a diffusion method to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of 14 natural herbal dentifrices against four microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus and candida albicans. colgate total (colgate-palmolive, new york city) and sterile pyrogen-free water served as the positive and negative controls, respectively. the authors tested the natural  herbal dentifrices at full strength and at 1:1 dilution. they measured the zones  of inhibition at 24 and 48 hours to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of the dentifrices. results: six herbal dentifrices were effective in inhibiting the growth of all four microorganisms. the positive control produced significantly sized inhibition zones with all four microorganisms, while the negative control produced no observable zones. six herbal dentifrices produced larger inhibition zones with a. viscosus than did the positive control. six herbal dentifrices were inhibitory against c. albicans at full strength, but at 1:1 dilution, only three  had such inhibitory effect. one herbal dentifrice produced microbial growth around and over the samples, indicating possible microbial contamination of the toothpaste. only one herbal dentifrice showed consistent antimicrobial activity against all four microorganisms. conclusions: the variation in antimicrobial inhibition among the herbal dentifrices indicates that more research is needed to validate their effectiveness claims. clinical implications: this study provides practitioners with insight into the claims of natural herbal dentifrices' antimicrobial effects.

TI  == clinical and microbiological changes associated with the use of combined antimicrobial therapies to treat "refractory" periodontitis.
AB  == background: the present investigation examined clinical and microbial changes after a combined aggressive antimicrobial therapy in subjects identified as "refractory" to conventional periodontal therapy. method: fourteen subjects were  identified as "refractory" based on full-mouth mean attachment loss and/or >3 sites with attachment loss > or =3 mm following scaling and root planing (srp), periodontal surgery and systemic antibiotics. after baseline monitoring, subjects received srp, locally delivered tetracycline at pockets > or =4 mm, systemically  administered amoxicillin (500 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days)+metronidazole (250 mg, t.i.d. for 14 days) and professional removal of supragingival plaque weekly for 3 months. subjects were monitored clinically every 3 months post-therapy for 2 years. subgingival plaque samples were taken at the same time points from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. mean levels of each species were averaged within a subject at each visit. significance of changes in clinical and  microbiological parameters over time were evaluated using the friedman or wilcoxon signed ranks test. results: on average, subjects showed significant improvements in all clinical parameters after therapy. mean (+/-sem) full-mouth pocket depth reduction was 0.83+/-0.13 mm and mean attachment level "gain" was 0.44+/-0.12 at 24 months. clinical improvement was accompanied by major reductions in multiple subgingival species during the first 3 months of active therapy that were maintained for most species to the last monitoring visit. reductions occurred for three actinomyces species, "orange complex" species including campylobacter showae, eubacterium nodatum, three fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, peptostreptococcus micros, prevotella intermedia as well as the "streptococcus milleri" group, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus and streptococcus intermedus. subjects differed in their response to therapy; six modest response subjects exhibited less attachment level gain and were characterized by reductions in the microbiota from baseline to 3 months, but re-growth of many species thereafter. conclusions: the combined antibacterial therapy was successful in controlling disease progression in 14 "refractory" periodontitis subjects for 2 years.

TI  == biofilm growth of lactobacillus species is promoted by actinomyces species and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to integrate within a biofilm is pivotal to their survival. a dependence on the amount of biofilm growth by noncoaggregating lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus plantarum on coculture with actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus mutans and veillonella parvula was investigated using an artificial-mouth culture system. biofilm formation by the lactobacilli in mono-culture was poor. in coculture with actinomyces species the amount of l. rhamnosus increased 7-20 times and l. plantarum 4-7 times compared to its mono-culture biofilm. s. mutans also promoted substantial biofilm growth of lactobacilli but v. parvula had no effect. we conclude that these actinomyces species promoted growth of key lactobacillus species in a biofilm, as did s. mutans to a smaller extent, and that the ability  of individual bacteria to form mono-culture biofilms is not necessarily an indicator of their survival and pathogenic potential in a complex multispecies biofilm community.

TI  == a simple approach to examine early oral microbial biofilm formation and the effects of treatments.
AB  == background/aims: a simple in vivo approach to examine early dental plaque formation in the human mouth and to determine the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures on biofilm formation is reported. methods: a custom designed device that fits securely behind the teeth of the mandibular arch provides a surface for microbial colonization. this device is prepared with denture acrylic and can be repeatedly used by the subject, exposing a large and constant surface area for microbial accumulation. results: large numbers of oral  bacteria colonized the device by 2 h; these increased significantly by 4 h (p < 0.05). bacterial colonization increased significantly after rinsing with a sucrose solution (p < 0.05) but remained unaffected after rinsing with water, a commercially available fluoride mouthrinse without antimicrobial agents, or brushing with a fluoride dentifrice (p > 0.05). rinsing with mouthrinses formulated with chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride or triclosan/copolymer significantly inhibited colonization (p < 0.05). a dose-dependent inhibition was  noted with chlorhexidine rinses (p < 0.05). brushing with a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice significantly inhibited microbial colonization compared with a control (p < 0.05). conclusion: this simple approach was useful for examining the effects of common dietary and oral hygiene procedures. significant biofilm inhibitory effects were noted with formulations that demonstrated efficacy in previous clinical studies.

AB  == this study investigated the efficiency of a chlorhexidine varnish and an antibiotic paste in suppressing the cultivable microflora of deep dentine cavities in a stepwise excavation procedure. subsequent to enamel preparation and removal of the central biomass, infected dentine was sampled from the cavity floor. ten cavities each were either covered with the 1% chlorhexidine- and 1% thymol-containing varnish cervitec (ce), the demeclocycline hydrocortisone-containing ointment ledermix (le) or received no treatment as control (co). a compomer composite was used as intermediate restorative. cavities were reassessed after 6 weeks and again dentine samples were microbiologically investigated for total viable counts, mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. after 6 weeks a significant reduction of the total viable counts was observed in the le group (p = 0.011) compared to the control, whereas no differences were found in the ce group (p > 0.05). mutans streptococci were rarely recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks. compared to the co group counts of lactobacilli were significantly reduced in the ce and le groups (p < 0.05). lactobacillus species were frequently recovered at baseline and after 6 weeks of observation. lactobacillus rhamnosus was the predominant species in all samples investigated.  application of ce or le resulted in reduced counts of lactobacilli after a period of 6 weeks. although none of the materials completely eliminated the viable microorganisms, the use of le was more effective than ce in reducing the total anaerobic microorganisms associated with carious dentine.

TI  == development of a multispecies oral bacterial community in a saliva-conditioned flow cell.
AB  == microbial communities within the human oral cavity are dynamic associations of more than 500 bacterial species that form biofilms on the soft and hard tissues of the mouth. understanding the development and spatial organization of oral biofilms has been facilitated by the use of in vitro models. we used a saliva-conditioned flow cell, with saliva as the sole nutritional source, as a model to examine the development of multispecies biofilm communities from an inoculum containing the coaggregation partners streptococcus gordonii, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella atypica, and fusobacterium nucleatum. biofilms inoculated with individual species in a sequential order were compared with biofilms inoculated with coaggregates of the four species. our results indicated that flow cells inoculated sequentially produced biofilms with larger biovolumes compared to those biofilms inoculated with coaggregates. individual-species biovolumes within the four-species communities also differed between the two modes of inoculation. fluorescence in situ hybridization with genus- and species-specific probes revealed that the majority of cells in both sequentially and coaggregate-inoculated biofilms were s. gordonii, regardless of  the inoculation order. however, the representation of a. naeslundii and v. atypica was significantly higher in biofilms inoculated with coaggregates compared to sequentially inoculated biofilms. thus, these results indicate that the development of multispecies biofilm communities is influenced by coaggregations preformed in planktonic phase. coaggregating bacteria such as certain streptococci are especially adapted to primary colonization of saliva-conditioned surfaces independent of the mode of inoculation and order of addition in the multispecies inoculum. preformed coaggregations favor other bacterial strains and may facilitate symbiotic relationships.

TI  == the rational design of an anti-caries peptide against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the cariogenic bacterium streptococcus mutans attaches to tooth surfaces via a cell surface adhesin termed streptococcal antigen i/ii (sa i/ii). mapping studies identified an adhesion epitope within residues 1025-1044. a synthetic peptide (p1025) spanning these residues inhibited adhesion of s. mutans in vitro and was  tested in an in vivo human streptococcal adhesion model. direct application of p1025 to the teeth prevented recolonisation of the oral cavity by s. mutans but not actinomyces naeslundii. this review also describes various other adhesion-inhibiting peptides have been identified in vitro. we suggest that adhesion-blocking synthetic peptides may provide novel anti-infective agents. topical application of such peptides at mucosal surfaces does not provide sustained selective pressure and in contrast to antibiotics, may not induce resistance.

TI  == salivary receptors for the proline-rich protein-binding and lectin-like adhesins  of oral actinomyces and streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the tooth surface by actinomyces and viridans group streptococci  involves the attachment of these bacteria to adsorbed salivary components of the  acquired enamel pellicle. the hypothesis that this attachment depends on specific adhesins has now been assessed from the binding of bacteria with well-defined adhesive properties to blots of sds-page-separated parotid and submandibular-sublingual (sm-sl) saliva. streptococcus sanguis and type 2 fimbriated actinomyces naeslundii, which bound terminal sialic acid and galbeta1-3galnac, respectively, recognized only a few sm-sl salivary components,  primarily mg2. in contrast, type 1 fimbriated a. naeslundii and s. gordonii, which bound purified proline-rich proteins (prps), recognized several other components from both sm-sl and parotid saliva. significantly, bacteria that lacked prp-binding and the lectin-like activities detected by binding to mg2 failed to bind any immobilized salivary component. these findings suggest the involvement of specific adhesins in bacterial recognition of many adsorbed salivary proteins and glycoproteins.

AB  == objectives: to investigate the effect of triclosan exposure on the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of numerically important dental bacteria. methods: a gradient plate technique was used to expose fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, neisseria subflava, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii,  prevotella nigrescens, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and veillonella dispar repeatedly to escalating, sublethal concentrations  of triclosan. escherichia coli atcc 8739 was included as an organism showing the  triclosan resistance development trait. mic values towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were determined before and after biocide exposure. results: n. subflava, pr. nigrescens po. gingivalis and e. coli were highly susceptible to triclosan (mic range 0.1-3.9 mg/l), whereas the lactobacillus and  s. mutans were less susceptible (mic range 15.6-20.8 mg/l). triclosan exposure resulted in a highly significant ( approximately 400-fold) reduction in triclosan susceptibility (p < 0.01) for the positive control e. coli, although its mics towards chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline were not significantly altered. minor ( approximately two-fold) decreases in triclosan susceptibility (mic) occurred for pr. nigrescens and in s. sanguis and s. oralis (mbc). mean changes in susceptibilities (mic and mbc) of the oral species to chlorhexidine, metronidazole and tetracycline did not exceed two-fold, although chlorhexidine mbcs for s. sanguis were markedly, but transiently, increased. conclusions: these data fail to demonstrate biologically significant drug resistance in triclosan-exposed bacteria and suggest that markedly decreased triclosan susceptibility, although confirmed for e. coli, is not a universal phenomenon. other bacteria possibly possess more susceptible targets than fabi that are highly conserved, which may govern triclosan activity.

TI  == comparison of type 1 and type 2 cytokine production by mononuclear cells cultured with streptococcus mutans and selected other caries bacteria.
AB  == a feature of pulpal immune responses is the predominance of type 1 cytokine mrna  under shallow caries and a mixed (type 1/type 2) profile under deep caries. these results prompted an examination of the cytokine profiles induced by bacteria in shallow caries (streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus) and deep caries (lactobacillus casei, pseudoramibacter alactolyticus, and prevotella intermedia). all isolates induced interferon-gamma and interleukin-10, whereas interleukin-4 and interleukin-2 titers were low to undetectable. s. mutans was the most potent  and persistent interferon-gamma inducer. differences in interleukin-10 were apparent at low doses but were less dramatic, with l. casei the dominant producer. s. mutans induced substantially more interferon-gamma than interleukin-10 over all doses and time points, suggesting strong type 1 polarization. p. alactolyticus induced significantly more interleukin-10 than interferon-gamma at higher concentrations, suggesting polarization toward type 2. a similar amount of interferon-gamma and interleukin-10 induced by l. casei, a. viscosus, and p. intermedia reflected a mixed profile. a better understanding of  pulpal immune response to caries bacteria may enable us to develop an immune system-based pulp therapy in the future.

TI  == antibacterial activity of silver inorganic agent yda filler.
AB  == yda filler is an antibacterial agent that is currently in commercial dental use.  in this study, we attempted to determine whether it exerts an antibacterial effect on human saliva bacteria, and to determine whether it can be used in dental materials. cfus in 1 ml stimulated human saliva were examined using blood  agar and mitis salivarius agar after immersion, with or without yda filler. the antibacterial effect was compared with that of ketac-silver. dental materials containing 5% wt yda filler were prepared for in vitro testing on s. mutans and a. viscosus. furthermore, we examined the in vitro cytotoxicity of experimental mma resin containing yda filler on hela cells. human saliva bacteria and mutans streptococci showed reduced viability following exposure to yda filler after 12 h. the concentration of silver ions released by yda filler was below 1 ppm after  12 h. two tested strains showed reduced viability following exposure to dental materials containing yda filler. in another experiment, mma resin containing yda  filler did not show cytotoxicity on hela cells after 24- and 48-h exposure. thus, yda filler may help in the development of antibacterial dental materials, such as composite resin, glass-ionomer or temporary cement.

TI  == lactoferrampin: a novel antimicrobial peptide in the n1-domain of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of bovine lactoferrin is attributed to lactoferricin,  situated in the n1-domain. based on common features of antimicrobial peptides, a  second putative antimicrobial domain was identified in the n1-domain of lactoferrin, designated lactoferrampin. this novel peptide exhibited candidacidal activity, which was substantially higher than the activity of lactoferrin. furthermore, lactoferrampin was active against bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but not against the fermenting bacteria actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis. notably, lactoferrampin is located in the n1-domain in close proximity to lactoferricin, which plays a crucial role in membrane-mediated activities of lactoferrin.

TI  == [dynamic observation of periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria in modified chemostat using confocal laser scanning microscopy].
AB  == objective: to study dynamic relation between periodontal pathogens and cariogenic bacteria under analogous oral environment. methods: eight periodontopathic and cariogenic bacteria of porphyromonas gingivalis (pg), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (aa), fusobacterium nucleatum (fn), provotella intermedium  (pi), streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguis (ss), actinomyces viscosus (av) and lactobacillus acidophilus (la) were used. these eight strains were cultured in modified chemostat under analogous oral environment which contained 600 ml modified bm medium supplemented with 2.5 g/l porcine gastric mucin, respectively. after 1, 24, 48 and 96 h, optical sectioning of plaque biofilms on  removable and replaceable hydroxyapatite disks was analyzed by the combination of live bacterial gram fluorescence staining and confocal laser scanning microscopy. biofilm thickness and reconstruction of the three-dimensional architecture of plaque biofilms were made. results: biofilm thickness increased significantly with time (p < 0.001). biofilms of aa were thinner than those of ss and eight-specie biofilms were thicker than those formed by ss and aa per time point. three-dimensional images showed periodontal pathogens mainly occurred in cariogenic bacterial complex or on the biofilm surface. conclusions: gram-positive cariogenic species initially predominated in artificial plaque, followed by the increasing proportions of gram-negative periodontal pathogens. the relation between microecological balance among bacteria and diseases is worthy of further studies.

TI  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 demonstrate strain-selective activity against oral microorganisms.
AB  == human beta-defensins 2 and 3 (hbd-2 and hbd-3) are inducible peptides present at  sites of infection in the oral cavity. a few studies have reported broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity for both peptides. however, no comprehensive study has thoroughly investigated their potential against oral pathogens. the purpose of this study was to test the effectiveness of hbd-2 and hbd-3 against a collection  of oral organisms (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, peptostreptococcus micros, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, candida tropicalis, candida parapsilosis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, and candida albicans). radial diffusion assays were used to test hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities against at least three strains of each species. there was significant variability in mics, which was strain specific rather than species specific. mics ranged from 3.9 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-2 and from 1.4 to >250 micro g/ml for hbd-3. hbd-3 demonstrated greater antimicrobial activity and was effective against a broader array of organisms. overall, aerobes were 100% susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, whereas only 21.4 and 50% of the anaerobes were susceptible to hbd-2 and hbd-3, respectively. hbd-2 and hbd-3 also demonstrated strain-specific activity against  the candida species evaluated. interestingly, an association between hbd-2 and hbd-3 activities was noted. this suggests that the two peptides may have similar  mechanisms yet utilize distinct pathways. the lack of activity against specific anaerobic strains and candida warrants further investigation of the potential resistance mechanisms of these organisms. finally, the significant variability between strains underlies the importance of testing multiple strains when evaluating activities of antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == influence of weight on removal of co-adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compared removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci from salivary pellicles by manual, rotating/oscillating electric and sonic toothbrushes, applying weights up to 240  g. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through  the chamber at 33 degrees c. on average, 34-39% of the adhering bacteria were adhering as single organisms. for co-adhering and non-co-adhering pairs, 33 and 10% of the adhering bacteria were involved, respectively, in aggregates comprising more than 10 organisms. brushing by hand removed 82% at low weight (40 g), which was less than by electric (93%) or sonic (92%) brushing, while for all  modes of brushing bacterial removal increased with increasing weight to 95-99%. for a non-co-adhering pair, subsequent exposure of brushed pellicles to a streptococcal suspension yielded only 2-16% of bacteria involved in large aggregates, regardless of the mode of brushing. for the co-adhering pair, however, de novo streptococcal adhesion to hand-brushed pellicles yielded 34-57%  of bacteria involved in large aggregates, while electric and sonic brushing left  22-35% of the bacteria involved in large aggregates. de novo streptococcal adhesion for the co-adhering pair increased with increasing weight for the electric and sonic brush in contrast to the manual brush. since a strong influence of co-adhesion is evident in de novo streptococcal adhesion, despite nearly complete removal of all actinomyces, these observations suggest that the three modes of brushing leave footprints to which streptococci preferentially adhere.

TI  == the anti-adherence effect of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts on the adhesion of early settlers in dental plaque to saliva-coated glass surfaces.
AB  == the aqueous extracts of piper betle and psidium guajava were prepared and tested  for their anti-adherence effect on the adhesion of early plaque settlers (strep.  mitis, strep. sanguinis and actinomyces sp.). the saliva-coated glass surfaces were used to simulate the pellicle-coated enamel surface in the oral cavity. our  results showed that the anti-adherence activities of piper betle and psidium guajava extracts towards the bacteria were different between the bacterial species. psidium guajava was shown to have a slightly greater anti-adherence effect on strep. sanguinis by 5.5% and actinomyces sp. by 10% and a significantly higher effect on strep. mitis (70%) compared to piper betle. the three bacterial  species are known to be highly hydrophobic, and that hydrophobic bonding seemed to be an important factor in their adherence activities. it is therefore suggested that the plant extracts, in expressing their anti-adherence activities, could have altered the hydrophobic nature of the bonding between the bacteria and the saliva-coated glass surfaces.

AB  == objective: to determine microbial changes that occur during plaque formation in a dentition free of gingival inflammation. material and methods: ten subjects were  recruited. the study included one preparatory period (2 weeks) and a plaque accumulation period (4 days). the volunteers exercised proper tooth cleaning methods, were scaled and received repeated professional mechanical tooth cleaning during the preparatory period. during the plaque accumulation period, the participants abstained from plaque control measures. plaque was scored on the approximal surfaces of maxillary and mandibular premolars on days 0, 1, 2 and 4 using a scale from 0 to 5 and according to the criteria of the quigley and hein plaque index (qhi). supragingival plaque samples were obtained from the same intervals and surfaces and evaluated using a checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique. results: the mean qhi increased from 0 to 1.6 (day 4). the total number of organisms on day 0 averaged 140 x 10(5) and increased to about 210 x 10(5) after 4 days without oral hygiene. the most dominant species on day 0 were  members of the genus actinomyces. these organisms comprised almost 50% of the microbiota evaluated. none of the actinomyces species increased significantly during the 4 days. some streptococcus species increased significantly over time as well as species of the genera capnocytophaga, campylobacter, fusobacteria and  actinomyces actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: in the present investigation, the  preparatory phase established a situation with minimal gingival inflammation and  close to zero amounts of dental plaque. the day 0 plaque samples exhibited high proportions of actinomyces species. during the 4 days of no oral hygiene, there was a small increase in total numbers of organisms as well as a modest increase in the proportion of "disease-associated" taxa such as species of the "orange complex" species.

TI  == effect of porphyromonas gingivalis vesicles on coaggregation of staphylococcus aureus to oral microorganisms.
AB  == vesicles from the outer membrane of porphyromonas gingivalis have the ability to  aggregate a wide range of streptococcus spp., fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces naeslundii, and actinomyces viscosus. we found that in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles, staphylococcus aureus coaggregated with streptococcus  spp., and the mycelium-type candida albicans, but not the yeast type. autoaggregation of s. aureus in the presence of p. gingivalis vesicles is inhibited by l-arginine, l-lysine, and l-cysteine. both the methicillin-sensitive (mssa) and -resistant (mrsa) strains of s. aureus were able to coaggregate with streptococcus spp., a. naeslundii, and a. viscosus when they were treated with p. gingivalis vesicles. p. gingivalis vesicle-treated mycelium-type c. albicans coaggregated with s. aureus, but the yeast-type did not. these results indicate that strains of s. aureus, including mrsa, could adhere to oral biofilms in dental plaque on the tooth surface or in the gingival crevice when p. gingivalis  is present.

AB  == established procedures use different and seemingly incompatible experimental protocols for fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) with gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. the aim of this study was to develop a procedure, based on fish and confocal laser scanning microscopy (clsm), for the analysis of the spatial organization of in vitro biofilms containing both gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. biofilms composed of the six oral species actinomyces naeslundii, candida albicans, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus  oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, and veillonella dispar were grown anaerobically for 64.5 h at 37 degrees c on hydroxyapatite disks preconditioned with saliva. conditions for the simultaneous in situ hybridization of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were sought by systematic variation of fixation and exposure to lysozyme. after fixation and permeabilization biofilms were labeled by fish with 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes ana103 (for the detection of a. naeslundii), euk116 (c. albicans), fus664 (f. nucleatum), mit447 and mit588 (s. oralis), sob174 (s. sobrinus), and vei217 (v. dispar). probes were used as 6-fam, cy3 or cy5 conjugates, resulting in green, orange-red or deep-red fluorescence of target cells, respectively. thus, with two independent triple-hybridizations with three probes carrying different fluorescence-tags, all six species could be visualized. results show that the simultaneous investigation by fish of complex biofilms composed of multiple bacterial species with differential gram-staining properties is possible. in combination with the optical sectioning properties of clsm the technique holds great promise for the analysis of spatial alterations in biofilm composition in response to environmental challenges.

TI  == an in vitro study into the corrosion of intra-oral magnets in the presence of dental amalgam.
AB  == the aim of this investigation was to study the corrosion behaviour and products of uncoated neodymium-iron-boron magnets in the presence of dental amalgam. microcosm plaques were grown on discs of neodymium-iron-boron magnets or amalgam  in a constant depth film fermentor. the biofilms were supplied with artificial saliva and growth was determined by viable counting. the results showed that the  neodymium-iron-boron magnets corroded with an average daily weight loss of 0.115  +/- 0.032 per cent. however, when the magnets were in close proximity to the amalgam the amount of corrosion was reduced to a daily loss of 0.066 +/- 0.023 per cent. the highest loss of constituent elements from the corrosion products of the magnets was observed for iron. the composition of the microcosm plaques altered markedly between the two materials with less streptococci and more veillonella spp. present in the biofilms grown on magnets in the presence of amalgam. the corrosion of neodymium-iron-boron magnets is limited and in the presence of amalgam is reduced further. this suggests that amalgam present in the mouth will not cause an increased clinical risk in terms of biocompatibility with neodymium-iron-boron magnets.

AB  == the role of primary amino acid sequences in protein pharmacokinetics, an issue of relevance in both basic knowledge and biotechnology, was addressed here using as  a starting point two repetitive antigens from the hemoflagellate trypanosoma cruzi that are known to stabilize their associated proteins in the bloodstream. a major drawback to their pharmacological application is that these repetitive sequences are highly immunogenic, being therefore the deletion of this characteristic desirable. based on sequence homology and epitope mapping analyses, an artificial repetitive sequence (pstad) was engineered. this motif was tested by genetic fusion to the c terminus of both the trypanosomal trans-sialidase and the rat tyrosine aminotransferase and found to produce a 4.5-6-fold increase in the half-life of the associated proteins in blood while displaying significantly lower immunogenicity. residues involved in the stabilizing properties of the novel peptide were mapped by a site-directed mutagenesis approach, allowing us to successfully identify another two motifs. searching databases for sequences displaying some homology, embedded in proline frameworks and associated to shed virulence factors from unrelated microorganisms, resulted in the identification of four other protein extensions.  remarkably, three of them (from streptococcus pneumoniae, actinomyces viscosus, and escherichia coli) revealed similar pharmacokinetic features, suggesting therefore an analogous evolutionarily acquired mechanism to ensure the biodistribution of their corresponding proteins. our findings indicate that the insertion of defined motifs into a proline-rich framework constitutes a suitable  alternative to construct a chimeric protein with extended half-life in blood.

TI  == bacteriologic findings in patients with chronic sinusitis.
AB  == we studied the bacteriology of maxillary sinus aspirates obtained from patients diagnosed with chronic sinusitis. we recovered 659 strains from 510 aspirates; of these, 572 (86.8%) were aerobes and 87 (13.2%) were anaerobes. aerobes only were  recovered from 310 of the 510 specimens (60.8%) and anaerobes only from 31 (6.1%). among the 572 aerobic bacteria, the most prevalent organisms were streptococcus viridans (158 strains [27.6%]), streptococcus pneumoniae (67 [11.7%]), corynebacterium species (66 [11.5%]), staphylococcus aureus (54 [9.4%]), moraxella catarrhalis (38 [6.6%]), hemophilus parainfluenzae (33 [5.8%]), and group c beta-hemolytic streptococci (26 [4.5%]). among the 87 recovered anaerobes were species of peptostreptococcus (32 strains [36.8%]), prevotella (22 [25.3%]), actinomyces (13 [14.9%]), propionibacterium (11 [12.6%]), fusobacterium (8 [9.2%]), and veillonella (1 [1.1%]). beta-lactamase production was detected in 115 of the 572 aerobic strains (20.1%) and in 10 of the 87 anaerobic strains (11.5%). we found that the prevalence and type of organisms we identified in chronic sinusitis did not differ substantially from those reported in previous studies. our study is one of the more extensive reports on the type and prevalence of pathogens in chronic sinusitis that has been published to date.

TI  == microbiology and management of endodontic infections in children.
AB  == the first step in the origination of caries is the formation of a dental plaque.  dental caries can lead to destruction of enamel and dentin resulting in bacterial invasion of the pulp. invasion of the pulp and the periapical areas can promote the development of dento-alveolar abscess and spread of the infection to other anatomical areas. several oral acid producing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, are capable of initiating the carious lesion. the organisms that predominate in pulpitis and dento-alveolar abscess are prevotella, porphyromonas, fusobacterium, and peptostreptococcus spp. treatment of caries involves removal of all affected tooth structure and proper replacement with a restorative material. once pulpitis has developed the infected tissue should be removed and root canal therapy instituted, or the tooth should be extracted. extraction, root canal therapy and/or drainage of pus usually are indicated for an abscess. antimicrobial therapy supplementing the dental care should be considered, especially when local or systemic spread of the infection is suspected. penicillin or amoxicillin are generally effective against most of the aerobic and anaerobic bacteria recovered. the patient whose oral cavity may harbor penicillin-resistant organisms should be considered for treatment with drugs effective against these organisms. these agents include amoxicillin-clavulanate,  clindamycin or the combination of metronidazole plus amoxicillin or a macrolide.

TI  == effect of the environment on genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis in the oral biofilm.
AB  == the genotypic diversity of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (424 isolates) and streptococcus oralis (446 isolates) strains isolated from two sound approximal sites in all subjects who were either caries active (seven subjects) or caries free (seven subjects) was investigated by using the repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. the plaque from the caries-active subjects harbored significantly greater proportions of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli and a smaller proportion of a. naeslundii organisms than the plaque sampled from the caries-free subjects. these data confirmed that the sites of the two groups of subjects were subjected to different environmental stresses, probably determined  by the prevailing or fluctuating acidic ph values. we tested the hypothesis that  the microfloras of the sites subjected to greater stresses (the plaque samples from the caries-active subjects) would exhibit reduced genotypic diversity since  the sites would be less favorable. we found that the diversity of a. naeslundii strains did not change (chi2 = 0.68; p = 0.41) although the proportional representation of a. naeslundii was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). conversely, the diversity of the s. oralis strains increased (chi2 = 11.71; p = 0.0006) and the proportional representation of s. oralis did not change. we propose that under these environmental conditions the diversity and number of niches within the oral biofilm that could be exploited by s. oralis increased, resulting in the increased genotypic diversity of this species. apparently, a. naeslundii was not  able to exploit the new niches since the prevailing conditions within the niches  may have been deleterious and not supportive of its proliferation. these results  suggest that environmental stress may modify a biofilm such that the diversity of the niches is increased and that these niches may be successfully exploited by some, but not necessarily all, members of the microbial community.

TI  == anticaries efficacy of a new dentifrice for hypersensitivity.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the expected anticaries efficacy of a new dentifrice containing stannous fluoride as the anticaries agent and potassium nitrate as the antihypersensitivity agent using a series of laboratory and animal studies. methods: four surrogate studies were performed in this assessment including fluoride uptake in sound enamel, enamel solubility reduction, fluoride bioavailability and animal caries. results: each of these studies indicated the new dentifrice for hypersensitivity (colgate sensitive maximum strength) was effective in inhibiting the caries process. the data demonstrate that this new dentifrice is predicted to be highly effective against caries and equivalent to a positive control dentifrice.

TI  == fermentation of five sucrose isomers by human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == sucrose has five structural isomers: palatinose, trehalulose, turanose, maltulose and leucrose. although these isomers have been reported to be noncariogenic disaccharides, which cannot be utilized by mutans streptococci, there is no information about their fermentability by other bacteria in dental plaque. the purpose of the present study was to examine whether these isomers were fermented  by predominant bacteria in human dental plaque. clinical bacterial isolates obtained from dental plaque from 3 children aged 22 months to 50 months (146 strains) were inoculated into 3 ml of peptone-yeast extract (py medium) containing glucose for 1 day, then an aliquot of 20 microl of culture medium was  inoculated into 1 ml of py medium containing 1% (w/v) of the respective test carbohydrates. after incubation for 1 day, the ph values and the optical density  at 660 nm of the cultures were measured. fermentation ability was measured by ph  <or=5.5, growth by an od(660) of >or=0.5. of the clinical isolates, 33% fermented palatinose, and 69% of these were actinomyces species. all of the palatinose-fermenting bacterial strains fermented trehalulose, 25% fermented turanose, 70% fermented maltulose and 23% fermented leucrose. we therefore conclude that, in human dental plaque, there are significant numbers of bacteria  that are able to ferment sucrose isomers.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == enthalpy of interaction between coaggregating and non-coaggregating oral bacterial pairs--a microcalorimetric study.
AB  == bacterial adhesion and coaggregation are involved in the development of oral biofilms, called dental plaque. although various techniques have already been used to study different aspects of these bacterial interactions, microcalorimetry has not yet been applied. this paper describes how isothermal reaction calorimetry can be employed to determine the enthalpy of coaggregation between two oral bacterial pairs. for most biological processes, the enthalpy tends to reach a minimum value, reflecting the most stable state, which is directly related to the heat content of the system. the calorimeter consists of four measuring units where reaction ampoules are filled with 1.5 ml of an actinomyces  naeslundii 147 suspension, while reference ampoules are filled with buffer only.  after equilibration at 25 degrees c, 80 microl of a streptococcal suspension was  titrated into the reaction ampoules. to study possible saturation of the binding  sites on the actinomyces surface, three consecutive injections with streptococcal suspensions were done. following each injection, a 20-microl aliquot was taken from the ampoule kept outside the calorimeter and the number of free (s(f)) and bound (s(b)) streptococci was determined microscopically. experiments were carried out with a coaggregating streptococcal strain (streptococcus oralis j22)  and a non-coaggregating strain (streptococcus sanguis pk1889), serving as a control. the coaggregation enthalpy was exothermic, that is, heat was released in the reaction ampoule upon coaggregation and the heat released by the coaggregating pair minus the heat released by the non-coaggregating pair yielded  a coaggregation enthalpy of -0.015 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus for the first  injection. upon consecutive injections, the coaggregation enthalpy decreased to -0.0004 x 10(-6) mj/bound streptococcus. comparison with enthalpy changes reported for lectin-carbohydrate binding suggests that a huge number of binding sites are involved in the formation of one bacterial coaggregate.

TI  == macrolide and lincosamide resistance in the gram-positive nasal and tonsillar flora of pigs.
AB  == macrolide and lincosamide resistance phenotypes and the presence of the erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), and mef(a) genes were determined in 344 bacterial strains belonging to 34 species and nine genera, isolated from the tonsils and nasal cavities of 2-week- and 6-week-old piglets, derived from four different farms. these piglets had never before been treated with macrolides or lincosamides. macrolide and lincosamide resistance was most frequently present in streptococcus and enterococcus strains, of which over two-thirds were resistant. these genera were followed in decreasing order of resistance frequency by lactobacillus, rothia, staphylococcus, arcanobacterium, actinomyces, pediococcus strains. only five infrequently occurring species did not show resistance. this high frequency  of resistance in nontreated piglets indicates that resistant strains circulate in the herds. in streptococci, enterococci, and lactobacillus strains, resistance was most often encoded by the erm(b) gene and in staphylococci by erm(a) or erm(c). the erm(b) gene was sporadically detected in other bacterial genera (actinomyces, rothia, aerococcus, pediococcus). the sequence of the erm(b) gene of 29 strains of 11 pigs originating from the four different farms was determined. this sequence was identical in 12 strains and only differed by 1-6 nucleotides in the other strains, indicating that exchanges of resistance genes might occur between bacterial species and genera belonging to the nasal or tonsillar flora of piglets.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibody inhibiting dipeptidylaminopeptidase iv activity of porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterial species implicated as an important pathogen in the development of adult periodontitis. we previously cloned a gene encoding dipeptydilaminopeptidase iv (dapiv) from p. gingivalis. in the present study, for immunological diagnosis and development of  passive immunization, we produced a mouse monoclonal antibody (mab) capable of inhibiting the dapiv activity of p. gingivalis using highly purified recombinant  dapiv as an immunogen. the constructed mab, designated as mab-pg-dap-1, significantly inhibited dapiv activity in p. gingivalis, as well as slightly inhibited that in other gram-negative bacteria such as porphyromonas endodontalis and prevotella loesheii, whereas no inhibition was seen in the gram-positive bacteria streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus. furthermore, the mab did  not inhibit dapiv enzyme activity in human serum. this novel mab may be useful for the development of immunological diagnosis capability and in passive immunization.

AB  == aim: to determine whether 'mgp' gutta-percha (westport, ct, usa), a commercially  available gutta-percha containing iodoform, inhibits the growth of potential endodontic pathogens. methodology: inocula of enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus sanguis, fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces odontolyticus were spread onto the surface of agar plates. 'mgp' gutta-percha cones presoaked in sterile water were transferred to the inoculated agar and incubated at 37 degrees c aerobically or anaerobically as required for optimal growth. identical studies were performed using iodoform-free gutta-percha and sterile paper disks saturated with 10% povidone-iodine. following incubation, zones of inhibition around the 'mgp' gutta-percha, iodoform-free gutta-percha and disks were evaluated. results: povidone-iodine inhibited all the strains. iodoform-free gutta-percha inhibited s. sanguis and a. odontolyticus. 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited s. aureus, s. sanguis, a. odontolyticus and f. nucleatum. neither iodoform-free gutta-percha nor 'mgp' gutta-percha inhibited growth of e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa. conclusions: compared to iodoform-free gutta-percha, iodoform-containing 'mgp' gutta-percha had an inhibitory effect in vitro on s. aureus and f. nucleatum, but not on e. faecalis, e. coli or p. aeruginosa.

AB  == background/aim: to examine the proportions of 40 bacterial species in samples from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces and saliva in systemically healthy adult subjects and to compare these microbiotas with those of supra- and subgingival plaque. methods: microbial samples were taken from 8 oral soft tissue surfaces of 225 systemically healthy subjects using a "buccal brush". saliva was taken by expectoration. forty-four of these subjects provided additional supra- and subgingival plaque samples. samples were individually evaluated for their content of 40 bacterial species using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the percentage  of total dna probe count was determined for each species, at each sample location and averaged across subjects. the significance of differences among the proportions of the 40 test species at different sample locations was sought in the 225 and 44 subjects separately using the quade test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. cluster analysis was performed using the proportions of the 40 species at the different sample locations using the minimum similarity coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. the proportions of each species were averaged across subjects in the resulting cluster groups and the significance of differences was tested using the t-test and anova. results: microbial profiles differed markedly among sample locations in the 225 subjects,  with 34 of 40 species differing significantly. proportions of veillonella parvula and prevotella melaninogenica were higher in saliva and on the lateral and dorsal surfaces of the tongue, while streptococcus mitis and s. oralis were in significantly lower proportions in saliva and on the tongue dorsum. cluster analysis resulted in the formation of 2 clusters with >85% similarity. cluster 1  comprised saliva, lateral and dorsal tongue surfaces, while cluster 2 comprised the remaining soft tissue locations. v. parvula, p. melaninogenica, eikenella corrodens, neisseria mucosa, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium periodonticum, f. nucleatum ss vincentii and porphyromonas gingivalis were in significantly higher proportions in cluster 1 and s. mitis, s. oralis and s. noxia were significantly higher in cluster 2. these findings were confirmed using data from the 44 subjects providing plaque samples. the microbial profiles of supra- and subgingival plaque differed from the other sample locations, particularly in the increased proportions of the actinomyces species. species of  different genera exhibited different proportions on the various intraoral surfaces, but even within the genus streptococcus, there were differences in colonization patterns. s. oralis, s. mitis and s. constellatus colonized the soft tissues and saliva in higher proportions than the samples from the teeth, while the other 4 streptococcal species examined colonized the dental surfaces in proportions comparable to the soft tissue locations and saliva. conclusions: proportions of bacterial species differed markedly on different intraoral surfaces. the microbiota of saliva was most similar to that of the dorsal and lateral surfaces of the tongue. the microbiotas of the soft tissues resembled each other more than the microbiotas that colonized the teeth both above and below the gingival margin.

AB  == the antibacterial property of 7 compounds, isolated from erythrina variegata (leguminosae) by repeated silica gel column chromatography, against cariogenic oral bacteria was investigated. extensive spectroscopic study revealed that all were isoflavonoids. among them, 3,9-dihydroxy-2,10-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)-6a,11a-dehydropterocarpan (erycristagallin) showed the highest antibacterial activity against mutans streptococci, other oral streptococci, actinomyces and lactobacillus species with a minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) range of 1.56-6.25 microg/ml, followed by 3,6a-dihydroxy-9-methoxy-2,10-di(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)pterocarpan (erystagallina) and 9-hydroxy-3-methoxy-2-gamma,gamma-dimethylallylpterocarpan (orientanol b) (mic range: 3.13-12.5 microg/ml). the antibacterial effect of erycristagallin to mutans streptococci was based on a bactericidal action. erycristagallin (6.25 microg/ml: mic) completely inhibited incorporation of radio-labelled thymidine into streptococcus mutans cells. incorporation of radio-labelled glucose into bacterial cells was also strongly inhibited at mic, and 1/2 mic of the compound reduced the incorporation approximately by half. the  findings indicate that erycristagallin has a potential as potent phytochemical agent for prevention of dental caries by inhibiting the growth of cariogenic bacteria and by interfering with incorporation of glucose responsible for production of organic acids.

TI  == coaggregation-mediated interactions of streptococci and actinomyces detected in initial human dental plaque.
AB  == streptococci and actinomyces that initiate colonization of the tooth surface frequently coaggregate with each other as well as with other oral bacteria. these observations have led to the hypothesis that interbacterial adhesion influences spatiotemporal development of plaque. to assess the role of such interactions in  oral biofilm formation in vivo, antibodies directed against bacterial surface components that mediate coaggregation interactions were used as direct immunofluorescent probes in conjunction with laser confocal microscopy to determine the distribution and spatial arrangement of bacteria within intact human plaque formed on retrievable enamel chips. in intrageneric coaggregation, streptococci such as streptococcus gordonii dl1 recognize receptor polysaccharides (rps) borne on other streptococci such as streptococcus oralis 34. to define potentially interactive subsets of streptococci in the developing plaque, an antibody against rps (anti-rps) was used together with an antibody against s. gordonii dl1 (anti-dl1). these antibodies reacted primarily with single cells in 4-h-old plaque and with mixed-species microcolonies in 8-h-old plaque. anti-rps-reactive bacteria frequently formed microcolonies with anti-dl1-reactive bacteria and with other bacteria distinguished by general nucleic acid stains. in intergeneric coaggregation between streptococci and actinomyces, type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces recognize rps on the streptococci. cells reactive with antibody against type 2 fimbriae of actinomyces naeslundii t14v (anti-type-2) were much less frequent than either subset of streptococci. however, bacteria reactive with anti-type-2 were seen in intimate association with anti-rps-reactive cells. these results are the first direct demonstration of coaggregation-mediated interactions during initial plaque accumulation in vivo. further, these results demonstrate the spatiotemporal development and prevalence  of mixed-species communities in early dental plaque.

AB  == data obtained from studies on the antimicrobial properties of bonding agents are  the subject of controversy, probably because of methodological differences. this  study compared two commonly used in vitro methods, the disc agar diffusion test and the well agar diffusion test. agar plates were seeded with streptococcus sobrinus, lactobacillus gasseri, or actinomyces naeslundii. for the well diffusion test, wells cut out of the agar were filled with the test material, and for the disc method, discs impregnated with the test material were applied to the agar; the discs and wells were both 9 mm in diameter. after incubation, measurements of the zones of inhibition showed little agreement between the two methods when bonding agents were tested; the mean differences (+/- sdiff) in the  zones of inhibition between the methods were 0.7 +/- 3.4 mm (p = 0.40, one sample t-test against zero), 4.9 +/- 4.4 mm (p = 0.97), and 0.8 +/- 4.3 mm (p = 0.47) for s. sobrinus, l. gasseri, and a. naeslundii, respectively. mean differences were less contrasting when chlorhexidine and pure components were tested (p < 0.05 for s. sobrinus and l. gasseri). these results indicate the need for a gold  standard method to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of bonding agents.

TI  == comparison of antibacterial activity of simplified adhesive systems.
AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the intrinsic antibacterial activity of commercially available simplified adhesive systems. materials and methods: the antibacterial activity of five self-etching/priming one-step adhesives and three  priming/bonding adhesives against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and  actinomyces viscosus was assessed by the agar disc-diffusion test and determination of the minimum inhibitory/bactericidal concentration (mic/mbc). twenty microl of each adhesive was impregnated into a paper disc and placed on an agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension, with or without light-irradiation. the size of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of incubation. the mic values were measured by serial microdilution assays, visually examining the growth of bacteria after incubation  with each adhesive for 24-48 hours. the subcultures were made on bhi agar plates  from the wells showing no visible growth of bacteria, and the mbc values were determined based on production of colonies. two primers in two-step self-etching  systems and an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine were tested for reference. the results of disc-diffusion tests were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test. results: the size of inhibition zones produced by adhesives varied among the brands. none of the available commercial adhesives showed significant inhibition against all three of the bacterial species tested. light-irradiation reduced the size of inhibition zones for a few materials, but a similar trend to the effectiveness of non-irradiated specimens was observed. the  antibacterial activity of commercial products determined in terms of mic/mbc values were different from the results by disc-diffusion tests. the self-etching  adhesives with low ph were not necessarily more effective than priming/bonding solutions, and no significant relationships between the acidity and antibacterial effects were found. compared with commercial products, an experimental primer containing chlorhexidine produced significantly larger inhibition zones against all species (p < 0.05) and exhibited greater bacteriostatic/bactericidal activity, demonstrating lower mic/mbc values.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  == self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. the antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers clearfil se bond, mac bond, imperva fl bond, one-up bondf and prompt l-pop were evaluated using the bacteria streptococcus mutans atcc25175, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptostreptococcus prevotii, peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus catenaforme, lactobacillus jensenii, actinomyces odontolyticus, porphyromonas endodontalis, clostridium ramosum, prevotella oris, prevotella denticola and fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. a single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. after  incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. one-up bondf, prompt l-pop and excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. the bonding agents of clearfil se bond, mac bond and imperva fl bond were unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus jensenii and actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.

TI  == periodontal microbiota and clinical periodontal status in a rural sample in southern thailand.
AB  == we sought to determine (i) the association of subgingival bacterial profiles to clinical periodontal status in a population with limited access to dental care in thailand, and (ii) the external validity of our earlier findings from a similar study in rural china. we examined 356 subjects, 30-39 yr old and 50-59 yr old, with respect to clinical periodontal status and subgingival plaque at maximally 14 sites per subject. checkerboard hybridizations were used to analyse a total of 4343 samples. the prevalence of the 27 species investigated ranged between 87.2%  and 100%. discriminant analysis based on microbial profiles classified correctly  67.5% of all deep (> or = 5 mm) and 64.2% of all shallow sites, and 67.4% of all  subjects with and 69.3% of all subjects without > or = 3 deep pockets. high colonization by 'red complex' bacteria was four times as likely (95% confidence limits (cl) 2.5-6.6) in subjects with > or = 10 sites with attachment loss of > or = 5 mm, and 4.3 times as likely (95% cl 2.6-7.1) in subjects with > or = 30 such sites. the data confirmed (i) the ubiquitous prevalence of the bacteria investigated in subjects with no regular access to dental care; and (ii) the high odds for periodontal pathology conferred by increased levels of specific periodontal bacteria.

TI  == microorganisms from canals of root-filled teeth with periapical lesions.
AB  == aim: the objective of the present study was to identify the microbial flora within root canals of teeth with failed root-canal treatment and to determine the association of the various species with clinical features. methodology: sixty root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions were selected for this study. during nonsurgical endodontic re-treatment, the root-filling material was  removed and the canals were sampled. microbial sampling, isolation and species determination were performed using advanced microbiological techniques for anaerobic species. the association of microbiological findings with clinical features was investigated. results: microorganisms were recovered from 51 teeth.  in most cases, one or two strains per canal were found. of the microbial species  isolated, 57.4% were facultative anaerobic species and 83.3% gram-positive microorganisms. enterococcus faecalis was the most frequently recovered bacterial species. obligate anaerobes accounted for 42.6% of the species and the most frequently isolated genera was peptostreptococcus. which was associated with clinical symptoms (p < 0.01). significant associations were also observed between: (a) pain or history of pain and polymicrobial infections or anaerobes (p < 0.05): (b) tenderness to percussion and prevotella intermedia/p. nigrescens (p  < 0.05); (c) sinus and streptococcus spp. (p < 0.001) or actinomyces spp. (p < 0.01); (d) coronally unsealed teeth and streptococcus spp. or candida spp. (both  with p < 0.01). conclusion: the microbial flora in canals after failure of root-canal treatment were limited to a small number of predominantly gram-positive microbial species. facultative anaerobes, especially e. faecalis, were the most commonly isolated microorganisms, however, polymicrobial infections and obligate anaerobes were frequently found in canals of symptomatic root-filled teeth.

TI  == evaluation of root canal microorganisms isolated from teeth with endodontic failure and their antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == studies of the microbiota from the canals of teeth with failure of endodontic therapy have revealed that it differs markedly from that of untreated necrotic dental pulps. this study aimed to evaluate the microbiota of 30 root-filled teeth with persisting periapical lesions and to test the antibiotic susceptibility of the most prevalent species. microbial samples, isolation and speciation were done using advanced microbiologic techniques for anaerobic species. a total of 55 bacterial species were isolated, 80% were gram-positives and 58% facultative anaerobic microorganisms. the bacterial genera most frequently recovered were enterococcus, streptococcus, peptostreptococcus and actinomyces. antibiotic sensitivity of enterococcus faecalis and peptostreptococcus spp. was accomplished with the e-test system. all species studied were susceptible to benzylpenicillin, amoxicillin, amoxicillin combined with clavulanate. however, 20% of the e.faecalis strains were resistant to erythromycin and 60% to azithromycin. it was concluded that microbial flora in canals after endodontic failure comprised predominantly facultative anaerobes and gram-positive species. e.faecalis was the species most frequently isolated and showed erythromycin and azithromycin resistance among the isolates.

TI  == inhibitory effects on selected oral bacteria of antibacterial agents incorporated in a glass ionomer cement.
AB  == the objectives of the study were to investigate the antimicrobial efficacy, over  time, of combining antibacterial agents with a glass ionomer cement (gic). this was assessed using an agar diffusion test. chlorhexidine hydrochloride, cetylpyridinium chloride, cetrimide and benzalkonium chloride were added to fuji  ix gic at 0, 1, 2 and 4% w/w. antibacterial-gic specimens were placed onto agar plates inoculated with one of six bacterial species (streptococcis, lactobacillus, and actinomyces, two each) and the area of inhibition calculated after 24 h incubation. the experiment was repeated weekly and at week 11 the surface of the specimen was abraded prior to replacing on inoculated agar plates. control specimens of the gic produced no bacterial inhibition. the antibacterial-gic combination specimens showed significant inhibition which decreased at different rates over the test period. resurfacing of the specimens showed a dramatic increase of antibacterial action similar to levels produced on  week 1. ct-gic showed the greatest (p < 0.005) inhibitory effect throughout the experimental period for 4 out of 6 test bacteria. the addition of antibacterial agents to fuji ix creates a gic material with significant antimicrobial action in vitro which is dependent on concentration and type of antibacterial agent, and appears to be associated primarily with a release of the antibacterial from the surface layer of the specimen.

TI  == effect of sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish on streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus in orthodontic patients.
AB  == this study evaluated the effect of sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish on orthodontic patients. ten children, ages 10 to 16 years, participated. bacterial  levels of streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus and total counts were evaluated in sputum samples. these counts were evaluated at 4 stages: before orthodontic treatment, at least 2 weeks after bonding of the brackets, 1 week after application of chlorhexidine varnish, and 3 weeks after application of chlorhexidine varnish. increases in bacterial levels of s mutans and in the total bacterial count were detected after the brackets were bonded. one week after the  sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish was applied, a significant decrease of total bacterial levels and s mutans was observed. this decrease persisted for 3 weeks after the first application. no significant change in a viscosus levels occurred during that period. the results provide additional evidence that sustained-release chlorhexidine varnish decreases s mutans levels in orthodontic  patients with fixed appliances and therefore might be useful in preventing caries lesions.

TI  == mass transport of macromolecules within an in vitro model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the diffusion of macromolecules through an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque. polyspecies biofilms containing actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sobrinus, veillonella dispar, and candida albicans were formed on sintered hydroxyapatite disks and then incubated at room temperature for defined  periods with fluorescent markers with molecular weights ranging from 3,000 to 900,000. subsequent examination by confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that the mean square penetration depths for all tested macromolecules except immunoglobulin m increased linearly with time, diffusion coefficients being linearly proportional to the cube roots of the molecular weights of the probes (range, 10,000 to 240,000). compared to diffusion in bulk water, diffusion in the biofilms was markedly slower. the rate of diffusion for each probe appeared to be constant and not a function of biofilm depth. analysis of diffusion phenomena through the biofilms suggested tortuosity as the most probable explanation for retarded diffusion. selective binding of probes to receptors present in the biofilms could not explain the observed extent of retardation of diffusion. these results are relevant to oral health, as selective attenuated diffusion of fermentable carbohydrates and acids produced within dental plaque is thought to be essential for the development of carious lesions.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces induce antibodies which cross react with epithelial  antigens in periodontitis.
AB  == perturbation of epithelial structure is a prominent but poorly understood feature of the immunopathological response to bacterial antigens which characterizes the  destructive lesion of periodontitis. western analysis of sera from 22 patients with periodontitis detected multiple antigens in extracts of epithelial cells whereas sera from 12 periodontally healthy subjects displayed only trace reaction with epithelial antigens. to investigate a possible relationship between the bacterial flora adjacent to diseased sites and the presence of antibodies reactive with epithelium, subgingival plaque samples were taken from deep periodontal pockets and cultured anaerobically. gram positive bacteria containing antigens cross-reactive with epithelial cells were reproducibly isolated by probing membrane colony-lifts with affinity-isolated (epithelium-specific) antibodies and identified by 16s rdna sequence homology as streptococci (s. mitis, s. constellatus and two s. intermedius strains) and actinomyces (a. georgiae, and a. sp. oral clone). conversely, when serum from patients with periodontitis was absorbed with the captured bacterial species the number of epithelial antigens recognized was specifically reduced. it was concluded that development of cross-reactive antibodies related to these organisms may contribute to perturbation of the epithelial attachment to the tooth and the progression of periodontitis. these autoreactive antibodies could also be a contributing factor in other diseases affecting epithelia.

TI  == effects of selected immunouppressive drugs on prostaglandin release, protein synthesis and cell proliferation in human gingival fibroblasts and on the growth  of plaque bacteria.
AB  == background: immunosuppressants play an essential role in transplantation therapy. in view of the side effects, e.g. gingival overgrowth, the present in vitro study was performed in order to investigate the effect of selected immunosuppressants on metabolic activities of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, the effect on the growth of six oral microorganisms was investigated. methods: human gingival fibroblasts were incubated in the presence of azathioprine (aza), cyclosporin a (csa), tacrolimus (tac) or mycophenolatmofetil (myc). pge subset 2 release was determined by means of a specific competitive enzyme immunoassay, using monoclonal antibodies specific for pge subset 2 (clone e2r1). the protein content was measured spectrophotometrically. a redox indicator system was employed to assess the proliferation activity. in an additional trial the growth of six strains of oral bacteria (a. viscosus t14v, s. oralis h1, s. mutans 10449, c. gingivalis dr2001, a. actinomycetemcomitans y4, and m. micros 33270) in the presence of the immunosuppressants was measured. results: in comparison with the  controls, the pge subset 2 release was increased by 39.3% following incubation with aza, and by 77.0% with csa. the protein concentrations (1 g immunosuppressant / ml medium) were reduced by 26.0% for aza and 17.0% for myc. furthermore, a drug-dependent inhibition in the cell proliferation rate was noted after an incubation period of 6 hours (aza 70.7%, csa 78.2%, myc 69.8%, tac 64.0%). the most pronounced growth-inhibiting effects were observed for csa at values ranging from 21.0% (s. mutans 10449) to 48.6% (a. viscosus t14v) growth inhibition. conclusions: the present study with common immunsuppresants demonstrated both a medication- and dose-dependent alteration in the metabolic activity of gingival fibroblasts. furthermore, growth-inhibitory effects on the selected bacterial strains could be observed.

TI  == effects of nitrite and nitrate on the growth and acidogenicity of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == it is hypothesised that exogenous nitrite acidified by metabolic products of acidogenic bacteria in the mouth will be converted to products which inhibit growth of the bacteria in question which contribute to dental caries. objectives: the aims of this study were (1) to test the activity of both sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite at differing concentrations on the ability of streptococcus mutans to lower the ph of its surroundings and hence (2) to determine whether either nitrate or nitrite might be bactericidal or bacteriostatic against s. mutans. methods: s. mutans nctc 10449(t) was cultured in a liquid medium to which either  sodium nitrate or sodium nitrite was added to a final concentration of 0.0, 0.2,  2.0, 20 or 200 mm, of which the first acted as a test substance negative control. after 24 h, the cultures were streaked onto agar to test for growth and the remaining culture used for ph measurement. the mann-whitney u-test was used for statistical comparison of ph values. results: nitrite at concentrations of 20 and 200 mm had a highly significant inhibitory effect (p < 0.001) on the ability of s. mutans nctc 10449(t) to lower ph. moreover, bacteria that had been subjected to these levels of nitrite were unable to recover on solid medium. nitrate had no such effect on either the growth of the bacteria or on their ability to lower ph. conclusions: it is concluded that nitrite, at final concentrations of either 20 or 200 mm, is both bactericidal and anti-acidogenic with respect to s. mutans, while lower concentrations of nitrite and all concentrations of nitrate are ineffective. nitrite might be worthy of consideration as a mouth-rinse constituent.

AB  == this study evaluated the similarity between the oral microbiota of young children and that of their adult caregivers. oral samples from children (174 dentate and 18 pre-dentate) aged 6-36 months and their caregivers in saipan were assayed using a dna probe assay. many species including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium  nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in dentate and pre-dentate children, whereas bacteroides forsythus was detected only in dentate children. a higher percentage of children were positive for the detection of an individual species if the caregiver was also positive. there were significant relative risks of species detection between dentate children and their caregivers. by logistic regression, there were significant positive associations between species detection in caregiver and in child, but not between species detection and child age or maternal education level. in conclusion, dental pathogens were detected in young, including pre-dentate, children. the microbial profiles of children were strongly associated with the microbiota of their caregivers.

TI  == microbial susceptibility to calcium hydroxide pastes and their vehicles.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the susceptibility of some microorganisms commonly isolated from root canals to calcium hydroxide in combination with several vehicles by the agar diffusion method. stainless-steel cylinders were placed on each inoculated agar medium. the test medications and their controls were placed inside the cylinders. the zones of growth inhibition were measured and recorded after the incubation period for each plate, and the results were analyzed statistically. enterococcus faecalis was most resistant, whereas the anaerobic porphyromonas endodontalis was more susceptible to all medications, followed by p. gingivalis and prevotella intermedial intermedia. ca(oh)2 + cmcp + glycerin showed significantly larger mean zones of inhibition when compared with the other medications. we conclude that anaerobic gram-negative bacteria are more susceptible to calcium hydroxide pastes than facultative gram-positive microorganisms.

TI  == antibody-based diagnostic for 'refractory' periodontitis.
AB  == objective: about 10-15% of us adults are 'refractory' to therapy for chronic periodontitis. recently, studies suggest that these patients have elevated lysine decarboxylase activity in the sulcular microbiota. the aim of this study was to determine whether an elevated igg antibody response to lysine decarboxylase, alone or with antibody to other bacterial antigens and baseline clinical measurements, would predict 'refractory' patients with high accuracy. methods: chronic periodontitis patients were treated using scaling and root planing (srp)  followed by maintenance srp and 3-monthly re-examinations. if there was a loss of mean full mouth attachment or more than three sites appeared with > 2.5 mm new loss within a year, the subjects were re-treated (modified widman flap surgery and systemically administered tetracycline). if attachment loss as above recurred, the subjects were 'refractory'. baseline clinical measurements and specific antibody responses were used in a logistic regression model to predict 'refractory' subjects. results: antibody to a peptide portion of lysine decarboxylase (hkl-ab) and baseline bleeding on probing (bop) prevalence measurements predicted attachment loss 3 months after initial therapy [pial = loss (0) or gain (1)]. igg antibody contents to a purified antigen from actinomyces spp. (a-ab) and streptococcal d-alanyl glycerol lipoteichoic acid (s-ab) were related in 'refractory' patients (r2 = 0.37, p < 0.01). from the regression equation, the relationship between the antibodies was defined as linear (pla/s-ab = 0) or non-linear pla/s-ab = 1). using pla/s-ab, pial and age,  a logistic regression equation was derived from 48 of the patients. of 59 subjects, 37 had 2-4 mm attachment loss and were assigned as 'refractory' or successfully treated with 86% accuracy. conclusion: hkl-ab facilitated an accurate prediction of therapeutic outcome in subjects with moderate periodontitis.

AB  == microorganisms possess the ability to recognize hormones within the host and utilize them to adapt to their surroundings. noradrenaline and adrenaline, which  are released during human stress responses, may act as environmental cues to alter the growth of individual organisms within subgingival biofilms. the aims of this study were to modify, for anaerobic culture, existing methodology used in determining microorganism catecholamine responses and to investigate the growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline of 43 microorganisms found within subgingival microbial complexes. we established initial inocula for each strain using anaerobic culture, re-inoculated into a minimal serum-based medium and grown anaerobically at 35 degrees c. we assessed organism growth by optical density (od(600nm)) readings, with test and control cultures performed in triplicate. test cultures were supplemented with 50 microm noradrenaline or 100 microm adrenaline. we observed significant growth effects for supplementation with noradrenaline (20 species responding positively) and adrenaline (27 species  responding positively), with differences in growth response observed within bacterial species and within and between microbial complexes. the most pronounced positive growth effects of noradrenaline were demonstrated in actinomyces naeslundii (+ 49.4%), actinomyces gerenscseriae (+ 57.2%), eikenella corrodens (+ 143.3%) and campylobacter gracilis (+ 79.9%). we also observed inhibitory effects of noradrenaline supplementation for porphyromonas gingivalis (- 11.9%) and bacteroides forsythus (- 22.2%). responses to adrenaline tended to mirror the responses seen with noradrenaline. individual organisms from different microbial  complexes vary in their in vitro growth responses to noradrenaline and adrenaline. such variation may influence the in vivo composition of the subgingival biofilm in response to stress-induced changes in local catecholamine  levels and play a significant role in the aetiology and pathogenesis of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == dental biofilms at healthy and inflamed gingival margins.
AB  == objectives: the increased plaque formation observed in gingival inflammation is not fully understood. receptor proteins in the dental pellicle might influence bacterial adhesion and subsequent plaque formation. the purpose of the present study was to examine proteins and microorganisms in dental biofilms, at healthy and inflamed gingival margins. material and methods: to see whether marginal inflammation affects the composition of the pellicle and the early dental plaque, samples were taken from the gingival and incisal parts of teeth in periodontally  healthy subjects, both in gingival health and during experimental gingivitis. pellicle proteins were analysed using gel-electrophoresis, immunoblotting and image analysis. bacteria were analysed by culturing and the pcr technique. results: during gingivitis, the rate of plaque formation increased significantly. the semiquantitative amounts of proteins and the numbers of bacteria varied considerably between individuals and surfaces. the amount of total and individual pellicle proteins and the total numbers of bacteria were, however, increased during gingivitis and the increase in proteins was statistically significant on the incisal parts of tooth surfaces. compared to a healthy gingiva, reduced numbers for actinomyces spp. (incisal parts only) and streptococci and increased  numbers of periodontopathogens in the 4 h dental biofilms were seen at the inflamed gingiva. conclusion: increased gingival crevicular fluid flow during gingivitis affects pellicle formation and increased plasma proteins in the pellicle may modify bacterial attachment and early dental plaque composition.

TI  == bacterial and yeast flora of root surface caries in elderly, ethnic chinese.
AB  == objectives: root caries is emerging as a significant problem in the middle aged and elderly. as little data is available on the microbiology of root caries in chinese cohorts, we evaluated 30 such lesions in elderly, institutionalized, ethnic chinese. methods: samples of carious dentine were aseptically taken from root caries lesions of 18 subjects (five males and 13 females, mean age 79.67 +/- 8.57). the cultivable bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, were isolated and identified using standard methods and commercial identification kits. the yeasts  were isolated on sabouraud's agar and identified using the api system. results: the main findings were: (1) of the total isolates, 91.09% were gram-positive and  8.91% were gram-negative microorganisms; (2) the proportions of cocci and rods were 36.68 and 63.31%, respectively; (3) the predominant groups of organisms isolated were streptococcus spp., lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus spp. and actinomyces spp. with isolation frequencies of 100, 90.00, 73.33 and 63.33%, respectively; (4) the isolation frequency of yeasts belonging to candida spp. (63.33%) was notably high although the proportion of yeasts within each sample was low (0.01%). candida dubliniensis, a newly identified yeast species particularly prevalent in hiv infection, comprised 14.29% of yeasts. conclusions: this study provides baseline information on the microbiologic features of root caries in the elderly, ethnic chinese. whilst our data on the most predominant bacteria isolated in root caries concur with those from other regions of the world the isolation of c. dubliniensis from these lesions has not been documented before.

TI  == influence of secondary colonizers and human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro.
AB  == the influence of secondary colonizers (fusobacterium nucleatum and actinomyces naeslundii) and the effect of human plasma on the adherence of porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. hydroxyapatite (hap) discs coated with streptococcus sanguis were immersed in a 3h-labeled bacterial cell suspension of  f. nucleatum or a. naeslundii and then in a 14c-labeled p. gingivalis cell suspension. bacterial cells on the discs were pyrolysed to quantify the radioisotopes released. the cell numbers of secondary colonizers on the discs increased with immersion time and this, in turn, resulted in significantly elevated adherence of p. gingivalis. these two secondary colonizers had very similar positive effects on the adherence of p. gingivalis. human plasma significantly inhibited the adherence of p. gingivalis and secondary colonizers to s. sanguis-coated hap discs. adherence of p. gingivalis and a. naeslundii was  strongly inhibited by plasma, while that of f. nucleatum was affected the least.  treatment with plasma, after immersion of streptococcal-coated discs in individual cell suspension of secondary colonizers, also reduced subsequent adherence of p. gingivalis. the rate of decrease was much smaller in f. nucleatum. these results indicate that both f. nucleatum and a. naeslundii enhance the adherence of p. gingivalis, and that the former may play a more important role in the establishment of p. gingivalis in dental plaque where plasma-derived components are present.

TI  == selection of dairy bacterial strains as probiotics for oral health.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to select bacterial strains with potential properties as oral probiotics, namely for the prevention of dental caries. we examined 23 dairy microorganisms, out of which we identified two streptococcus thermophilus and two lactcoccus lactis strains that were able to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads to the same extent as streptococcus sobrinus omz176. two of them, strep. thermophilus ncc1561 and lactoc. lactis ssp. lactis ncc2211, were further successfully incorporated into a biofilm mimicking the dental plaque. furthermore, they could grow in such a biofilm together with five  strains of oral bacterial species, representative of supragingival plaque. in this system, lactoc. lactis ncc2211 was able to modulate the growth of the oral bacteria, and in particular to diminish the colonization of streptococcus oralis  omz607, veillonella dispar omz493, actinomyces naeslundii omz745 and of the cariogenic strep. sobrinus omz176. these findings encourage further research with selected non-pathogenic dairy bacterial strains with the aim to decrease the cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == factors optimizing the use of subcutaneous vascular access ports in weaned pigs.
AB  == young, recently weaned pigs were implanted with subcutaneous vascular access ports in experiments designed to determine the relative bioavailability of lead from contaminated soils. in nine experiments, a total of 72 subcutaneous vascular access ports were implanted. complications were observed in 38.9% of the implanted pigs. changes in the protocol were implemented in an effort to reduce the rate of complications. the majority of complications were septic processes, including localized infections around the site of the catheter and injection port, hematogenous pulmonary abscessation, endocarditis, and septic arthritis. staphylococcus aureus, s. hyicus, b-hemolytic streptococcus species, and actinomyces pyogenes were cultured from septic processes in these pigs. our findings suggest that the health of the skin at the time of surgery, the experience of the surgeon, and the immunologic status of the animal influence the risk of septic complications in pigs implanted with subcutaneous vascular access  ports.

TI  == direct amplification of rrna gene sequences for identification of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections.
AB  == aim: the purpose of this study was to assess the prevalence of selected oral pathogens in root canal infections and their relationship with symptoms using a highly sensitive technique, the polymerase chain reaction. methodology: samples were obtained from 91 infected teeth associated with periradicular lesions, including cases of acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted from the samples and analysed for the presence of target microbial species using a pcr-based identification assay. results: all samples were positive for the presence of bacteria. streptococcus anginosus group was detected in 16.7%, fusobacterium nucleatum in 14.3%, and bacteroides forsythus in 7.1% of the abscess samples. no pus sample yielded actinomyces israelii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans or fungal species. in general, b. forsythus was found in 20% of the cases (16 of 80), s. anginosus in 12% (6 of 50), f. nucleatum in 10% (6 of 60) and a. israelii in 5% (two of 40). a. actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any case. fungi were present in only one of 50 cases (2%). there was  no correlation between the species and symptoms. conclusions: direct molecular approaches appear to be a valuable tool for the rapid and reliable diagnosis of infectious diseases, as well as for research purposes. there was no correlation between target microbial species and symptoms.

TI  == effects of glucose and fluoride on competition and metabolism within in vitro dental bacterial communities and biofilms.
AB  == antimicrobial effects of fluoride in vivo remain contentious. previous studies suggested that 1 mm naf reduced acid production from glucose, and prevented the enrichment of bacteria associated with caries in a chemostat model. the present study examines the effects of a lower fluoride concentration (0.53 mm, 10 ppm naf) in both biofilm and planktonic microbial communities. nine oral species were grown at ph 7.0 and pulsed on 10 successive days with glucose; bacterial metabolism was allowed to reduce the ph for 6 h before being returned to neutrality, either in the presence or absence of naf. in addition, 10-day-old mixed culture biofilms were overlaid with glucose, with or without naf, and the ph change followed by microelectrode. after 10 days, chemostat ph dropped to ca.  ph 4.5 following glucose pulses, and the community was dominated by streptococcus mutans (rising from 4 to 23% of total cfu) and veillonella dispar (16 to 73%). in comparison, after 10 days pulsing with glucose + fluoride, the final ph was significantly higher (ca. ph 4.9) (paired t test, p < 0.0001). the culture was predominated by v. dispar (70%) and actinomyces naeslundii (13%), whereas s. mutans proportions were significantly lower (t test, p = 0.04), remaining <3% of  the total flora, compared to the culture without fluoride. biofilm ph fell to only ph 5.55 1 h after glucose/fluoride overlay, compared to 4.55 with glucose alone (paired t test, p < 0.000001). analysis of the data suggests that fluoride  exerts dual antimicrobial modes of action. fluoride prevents enrichment of s. mutans by inhibiting critical metabolic processes (direct effect) and, in an inter-related way, by reducing environmental acidification (indirect effect) in biofilms.

TI  == actinomyces species, streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of actinomyces species,  streptococci, and enterococcus faecalis in primary root canal infections by using a molecular genetic method. samples were obtained from 53 infected teeth, of which 27 cases were diagnosed as acute periradicular abscesses. dna was extracted to evaluate the occurrence of 13 bacterial species by using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. polymerase chain reaction using an ubiquitous bacterial primer was undertaken to check the presence of bacterial dna in clinical samples. all root canal samples contained bacteria as demonstrated by polymerase chain reaction. the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization assay allowed the detection of streptococci in 22.6% of the samples, actinomyces species in 9.4%, and e. faecalis in 7.5%. the most prevalent species were members of the streptococcus anginosus group. with regard to the asymptomatic lesions, the most  prevalent species were s. intermedius (11.5% of the cases), e. faecalis (11.5%),  and s. anginosus (7.7%). s. constellatus was the most prevalent species in pus samples (25.9% of the cases). the other most prevalent species in abscessed teeth were a. gerencseriae (14.8%), s. gordonii (11.1%), s. intermedius (11.1%), a. israelii (7.4%), s. anginosus (7.4%), and s. sanguis (7.4%). s. constellatus was  the only species positively associated with acute periradicular abscess (p < 0.01).

TI  == the effects of an immediately pre-surgical chlorhexidine oral rinse on the bacterial contaminants of bone debris collected during dental implant surgery.
AB  == dental implant surgery produces bone debris that can be used in the "simultaneous augmentation" technique. although this debris is contaminated with oral bacteria, a stringent aspiration protocol has been shown to reduce the levels of contamination. chlorhexidine mouthrinse is a well-proven antibacterial rinse that has been shown to reduce infectious complications associated with dental implants. this study examined the effect of pre-operative rinsing with a 0.1% chlorhexidine digluconate mouthrinse on the bacterial contaminants present in collected bone debris bone (cbd). twenty partially edentate patients were randomly allocated into equal groups and underwent bone collection using the frios bone collector (fbc) during the insertion of two dental implants. in group  t a pre-operative chlorhexidine rinse was used, whilst in group c sterile water was used. for both groups, a stringent bone collection protocol was used. bone samples were immediately transported for microbial analysis. colonial and microscopic morphology, gaseous requirements and identification kits were utilised for identification of the isolated microbes. thirty-nine species were identified including a number associated with disease, in particular actinomyces  odontolyticus, clostridium bifermentans, prevotella intermedia, and propionibacterium propionicum. samples from group t (chlorhexidine mouthrinse) yielded significantly fewer organisms (p < 0.001) than in group c (sterile water  mouthrinse). gram-positive cocci dominated the isolates from both groups. it is concluded that if bone debris is to be used for the purpose of immediate simultaneous augmentation, a preoperative chlorhexidine mouthrinse should be utilised in conjunction with a stringent aspiration protocol to reduce further the bacterial contamination of cbd.

TI  == composition and antibiotic resistance profile of microcosm dental plaques before  and after exposure to tetracycline.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tetracycline administration on the viability and antibiotic resistance profiles of microcosm dental plaques. a constant depth film fermenter was used to generate multi-species biofilms, which were grown for 216 h before tetracycline was added. the composition of the microcosm plaques was determined by viable counting on selective and non-selective media. the prevalence of antibiotic-resistant organisms was determined on antibiotic-containing media. before administration of tetracycline, the biofilms had a total viable anaerobic count of 7 x 10(7) cfu per biofilm. they contained 7% lactobacilli, 19% streptococci and 2% actinomyces  spp. immediately after pulsing with tetracycline, the composition of the biofilms changed and they consisted of 30% lactobacilli, 1.5% streptococci and 3% actinomyces spp., with a total anaerobic count of 1 x 10(7) cfu per biofilm. the  pre-valence and composition of the antibiotic-resistant microflora changed dramatically after the addition of tetracycline, with the proportion of the microflora displaying resistance to tetracycline increasing from 6% to 45%. corresponding changes in the proportions of the microflora displaying resistance  to other antibiotics were as follows: 5-28% for erythromycin, 1-5% for vancomycin and 0.4-3% for ampicillin. the results of this study have shown that the addition of tetracycline to microcosm dental plaques alters their composition and enriches for bacteria resistant to tetracycline and other unrelated agents.

TI  == biofilm bacteria: formation and comparative susceptibility to antibiotics.
AB  == the calgary biofilm device (cbd) was used to form bacterial biofilms of selected  veterinary gram-negative and gram-positive pathogenic bacteria from cattle, sheep, pigs, chicken, and turkeys. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum biofilm eradication concentration (mbec) of ampicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, oxytetracycline, penicillin g, streptomycin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin, erythromycin, gentamicin, tilmicosin, and trimethoprim-sulfadoxine  for gram-positive and -negative bacteria were determined. bacterial biofilms were readily formed on the cbd under selected conditions. the biofilms consisted of micro-colonies encased in extracellular polysaccharide material. biofilms composed of arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus hyicus, streptococcus agalactiae, corynebacterium renale, or corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were not killed by the antibiotics tested but  as planktonic bacteria they were sensitive at low concentrations. biofilm and planktonic streptococcus dysgalactiae and streptococcus suis were sensitive to penicillin, ceftiofur, cloxacillin, ampicillin, and oxytetracycline. planktonic escherichia coli were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, oxytetracycline and  trimethoprim/ sulfadoxine. enrofloxacin and gentamicin were the most effective antibiotics against e. coli growing as a biofilm. salmonella spp. and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates growing as planktonic populations were sensitive to enrofloxacin, gentamicin, ampicillin, oxytetracycline, and trimethoprim/sulfadoxine, but as a biofilm, these bacteria were only sensitive to enrofloxacin. planktonic and biofilm pasteurella multocida and mannheimia haemolytica had similar antibiotic sensitivity profiles and were sensitive to most of the antibiotics tested. the cbd provides a valuable new technology that can be used to select antibiotics that are able to kill bacteria growing as biofilms.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to examine subgingival microbial profiles associated with refractory periodontitis and to seek such profiles in periodontally healthy, periodontally well-maintained elder  and untreated periodontitis subjects. methods: 36 subjects were defined as refractory on the basis of further attachment loss after scaling and root planing, surgery and systemically administered antibiotics. a total of 890 subgingival plaque samples (mean/subject=24.7) were taken from the mesial aspect  of each tooth in each subject at baseline and individually processed for their content of 40 subgingival taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. cluster  analysis was performed on mean within subject species counts using the chord coefficient and an average unweighted linkage sort. significant differences among clusters for individual and complexes of species were sought using the kruskal wallis test. the microbial profiles of the refractory subjects were compared with those of 27 periodontally healthy subjects (n plaque samples=708), 35 periodontally well-maintained elder subjects (n plaque samples=801) and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects (n plaque samples=2871). results: 28 of 36 refractory subjects fell into 4 clusters with >29% similarity. 10 of 40 species and 4 of 7 complexes differed significantly among clusters. profile (cluster) i (n=4) was characterized by high proportions of "yellow" and "green" complex species, profile ii (n=3) by low total counts and high proportions of "orange" and "purple" complex species, profile iii (n=9) by high total counts and counts of actinomyces and "purple" complex species, profile iv (n=12) by high proportions of "red" and "orange" complex species. the mean profiles of each cluster were subjected to cluster analysis with microbial data from 4380 (mean 24.7) baseline subgingival plaque samples from 27 periodontally healthy, 35 treated, well-maintained elders and 115 untreated adult periodontitis subjects. 12 clusters were formed with >41% similarity. 3 of the refractory profiles were detected in 3 cluster groups. profile ii in a cluster of 1 healthy, 1 elder and 4 untreated periodontitis subjects; profile iii in a cluster of 1 healthy, 2 elder  and 12 periodontitis subjects; profile iv, with 1 healthy and 5 untreated periodontitis subjects. the profile not detected in non refractory subjects was dominated by streptococcus species. 9 clusters did not harbor refractory profiles. 11.1% of healthy, 8.6% of elder and 18.3% of periodontitis subjects were in clusters exhibiting refractory microbial profiles. conclusions: 4 subgingival microbial profiles were detected among refractory subjects. "refractory microbial profiles" could be detected in subjects who had not yet exhibited refractory disease.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

AB  == aims: to investigate gram-positive nasal and tonsillar microbial flora of piglets before and after weaning. methods and results: the nasal and tonsillar gram-positive bacterial flora of 20 non-weaned piglets (2 weeks of age) and 20 weaned piglets (6 weeks of age), obtained from four different piggeries, was quantified by culture and identified by tdna-pcr. the most widely occurring species from nasal conchae before as well as after weaning in the different piglets investigated were streptococcus suis and rothia nasimurium. after weaning a wide variety of lactobacillus species appeared but in low numbers. in the tonsils, strep. suis, strep. dysgalactiae, s. hyicus, s. aureus, arcanobacterium  pyogenes and actinomyces hyovaginalis were the species isolated from the largest  number of pigs before and after weaning. s. aureus and most lactobacilli became more prevalent after weaning. bacteria not known to be associated with pigs found in the present study included r. nasimurium, strep. gallolyticus, pediococcus pentosaceus and some lactobacillus species. conclusions: over 30 different gram-positive bacterial species may occur in nasal conchae and tonsils of unweaned piglets at 2 weeks of age and of 6-week-old weaned piglets. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated that weaning is associated with  changes in prevalence of only a small minority of the highly diversified bacterial flora of the nares and tonsils of pigs.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == the predominant microflora of nursing caries lesions.
AB  == the predominant microflora recovered from infected dentine of 52 carious teeth from 14 children with nursing caries was determined using both selective and non-selective media for the isolation of specific genera and acidified media (ph  5.2) to isolate the predominant aciduric microorganisms, and compared with the microflora of sound enamel surfaces in caries-free children. streptococcus mutans formed a significantly greater proportion of the lesion flora while streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus gordonii formed a significantly greater proportion of the plaque flora from sound tooth surfaces. the proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces odontolyticus were significantly greater in the plaque samples than in the lesion samples. actinomyces israelii formed 18.2% of the flora from the lesions, but was not isolated from the plaque  samples. the proportions of candida albicans, lactobacillus spp. and veillonella  spp. were also significantly greater in the carious dentine than in the plaque samples. the most frequently isolated lactobacilli were lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus rhamnosus. the predominant aciduric flora was s. oralis, s. mutans and a. israelii and these taxa were also isolated  from a similar proportion of the lesions at ph 7.0. strains of s. mutans, l. casei, l. fermentum and l. rhamnosus isolated from individual carious teeth were  genotyped using pcr-based methods. each species was genotypically heterogeneous and different genotypes were recovered from different carious teeth in the same child. these data indicate that the microflora of lesions in the same child is microbiologically diverse and support a non-specific aetiology for nursing caries in which the physiological characteristics of the infecting flora, not its composition, is the major determinant underlying the disease process.

TI  == the association of bacterial adhesion with dental caries.
AB  == saliva adhesion of bacteria is a key event in oral biofilm formation. here, we used partial least-squares (pls) analysis to correlate adhesion of cariogenic (streptococcus mutans ingbritt) and commensal (actinomyces naeslundii ly7) model  bacteria, and their agglutinin and acidic proline-rich protein ligands, respectively, with high and low caries experiences in 38 children reflecting today's skewed caries distribution. adhesion of s. mutans was among the factors correlating strongest with high caries experience when pls modeled together with  traditional factors (e.g., sugar intake, lactobacilli counts). saliva phenotypes  with high agglutinin levels and db-s (an acidic prp variant) coincided with both  high caries experience and s. mutans adhesion. a. naeslundii adhesion correlated  with low caries experience. non-db phenotypes (i.e., acidic prp-1 and prp-2 variants) coincided with both low caries experience and s. mutans, but high a. naeslundii, adhesion. thus, bacterial adhesion may modulate susceptibility and resistance to dental caries.

TI  == electric field induced desorption of bacteria from a conditioning film covered substratum.
AB  == desorption of three oral bacterial strains from a salivary conditioning film on an indium tin oxide electrode during application of a positive (bacterial adhesion to the anode) or a negative electric current was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber. bacterial adhesion was from a flowing suspension of high ionic strength, after which the bacterial suspension was replaced by a low ionic  strength solution without bacteria and currents ranging from -800 to +800 microa  were applied. streptococcus oralis j22 desorbed during application of a positive  and negative electric current with a desorption probability that increased with increasing electric current. two actinomyces strains, however, could not be stimulated to desorb by the electric currents applied. the desorption forces acting on adhering bacteria are electroosmotic in origin and working parallel to  the electrode surface in case of a positive current, whereas they are electrophoretic and electrostatic in origin and working perpendicular to the surface in case of a negative current. by comparison of the effect of positive and negative electric currents, it can be concluded that parallel forces are more effective in stimulating bacterial desorption than perpendicular forces. the results of this study point to a new pathway of cleaning industrial and biomedical surfaces without the use of detergents or biocides.

TI  == association of early onset periodontitis microbiota with aspartate aminotransferase activity in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to determine the relationship between the activity of the enzyme aspartate aminotransferase (ast) in gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) using the colorimetric periogard (ptm) test and the subgingival microflora in early onset periodontitis lesions. material and methods: the study population consisted of 25 otherwise healthy individuals exhibiting early onset periodontitis (eop). in each patient four experimental sites were identified comprising one deep periodontal pocket (pd >5 mm) randomly  chosen in each quadrant. bacterial samples were obtained from the experimental sites, consecutively cultured anaerobically and in 10% co(2) using selective and  nonselective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional  biochemical tests and various identification kits. clinical measurements as well  as ast activity, assessed either as positive or negative using the ptm, were recorded at the same sites. results: sixty-two sites exhibited ast positive and 38 ast negative activity. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann whitney u-test) showed that streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, bacteroides forsythus, camplobacter gracilis, campylobacter rectus and selenomonas sputigena were significantly higher in sites with ast-positive activity. the odds ratio of having high prevalence of s. intermedius, p. micros, c. concisus, b. forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus and s.  sputigena in the presence of a positive ast site was very high (range: 3.5-17.0). streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces naeslundii, gemella morbillorum, capnocytophaga gingivalis, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium varium, eubacterium lentum and prevotella oralis were detected in significantly higher proportions in sites with ast negative activity and manifested a negative odds ratio in the presence of ast positive sites. the logistic regression analysis revealed that smoking and bleeding upon probing showed a significant association with ast activity, while plaque and suppuration were not found to be significant predictors of ast activity. the co-infection of porphyromonas gingivalis, b. forsythus and p. micros, or p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and c. rectus were found  to be significantly associated with the ast activity (p<0.001). ast positive sites revealed significantly higher occurrence of co-infections by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. sputigena or by p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, s. intermedius than ast negative sites (p<0.001). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. naeslundii co-infection was found significantly higher in the ast negative sites (p<0.001).  conclusions: the present study found a high level of agreement between the presence of putative periodontal pathogens and positive ast scores at periodontal sites that clinically were considered to be potentially disease active. prospective studies should be performed to confirm the findings.

TI  == identification of independent streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb functions in coaggregation with actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == the initial stages of dental plaque formation involve the adherence of early colonizing organisms such as streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces naeslundii to the saliva-coated tooth surface and to each other. the s. gordonii surface proteins sspa and sspb are known to play a role in adherence to salivary proteins and mediate coaggregation with other bacteria. coaggregation is the adhesin receptor-mediated interaction between genetically distinct cell types and appears to be ubiquitous among oral isolates. to define the function of sspa and sspb separately on the surface of their natural host, we constructed and analyzed the  coaggregation properties of an isogenic sspb mutant of s. gordonii dl1, an sspab  double mutant, and a previously described sspa mutant. a. naeslundii strains have been previously classified into six coaggregation groups based on the nature of their coaggregations with s. gordonii dl1 and other oral streptococci. coaggregation assays with the sspa and sspb mutants showed that sspa and sspb are the streptococcal proteins primarily responsible for defining these coaggregation groups and, thus, are highly significant in the establishment of early dental plaque. sspa exhibited two coaggregation-specific functions. it participated in lactose-inhibitable and -noninhibitable interactions, while sspb mediated only lactose-noninhibitable coaggregations. accordingly, the sspab double mutant lacked these functions and allowed us to detect a third coaggregation interaction with one of these organisms. these proteins may play an important role in development of s. gordonii-a. naeslundii communities in early dental plaque. understanding these adhesin proteins will aid investigations of complex microbial communities that characterize periodontal diseases.

TI  == co-adhesion and removal of adhering bacteria from salivary pellicles by three different modes of brushing.
AB  == this study compares removal of pairs of co-adhering and non-co-adhering oral actinomyces and streptococci by hand, electric and sonic brushing from salivary pellicles. in addition, re-deposition of a co-adhering and non-co-adhering streptococcal strain to brushed pellicles was studied. first, actinomyces were allowed to adhere to a pellicle in a flow chamber, after which streptococci suspended in saliva were perfused through the chamber at 33 c. pellicles with adhering bacterial pairs were brushed and the number of bacteria remaining determined. whereas sonic brushing removed nearly all adhering bacteria, greater  numbers of larger aggregates of the co-adhering pair, involving streptococcus oralis j22, were left behind after hand and electric brushing than of the non-co-adhering pair with streptococcus sanguis pk1889. re-deposition of streptococci to electrically and sonically brushed pellicles, however, was two-fold higher for the co-adhering pair than for the non-co-adhering pair. this  demonstrates a role for co-adhesion in de novo plaque formation. removal by the three different modes of brushing was not affected by the presence of fluoride, indicating that fluoride is not able to disrupt calcium bridges between co-adhering pairs. in contrast, in the presence of lactose only small aggregates  of co-adhering pair were left behind.

TI  == proteolytic degradation of oral biofilms in vitro and in vivo: potential of proteases originating from euphausia superba for plaque control.
AB  == this paper deals with enzymatic removal of dental plaque, in vitro as well as in  vivo, using proteases from the antarctic krill shrimp (euphausia superba), referred to as krillase. krillase exhibits both endo- and exopeptidase activity but has no microbicidal effect. in model systems with pure cultures of oral microorganisms. krillase demonstrated inhibition of microbial adhesion to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. furthermore, a protocol for the growth of reproducible in vitro plaque films has been developed, and effects of krillase on the plaque film were investigated by means of scanning electron microscopy (sem). the results showed that krillase efficiently released microorganisms from plaque  in vitro, the effect being dependent on the enzymatic activity. the surface energy of the substratum had a minor influence on the formation and removal of plaque in vitro. ellipsometric studies on the formation and enzymatic removal of  a salivary pellicle indicated that the enzymatic effect on plaque may partly depend on degradation of the salivary pellicle. krillase was also able to remove  plaque accumulated on dentures in vivo. our results demonstrate the potential of  krillase for plaque control, and that these enzymes are worthy of further investigations including clinical studies and work to find a suitable vehicle.

AB  == background/aim: the purpose of the present investigation was to determine the effect of self-performed supragingival plaque removal using either manual (crest  complete) or power (braun 3d plaque remover) toothbrushing on supra and subgingival plaque composition. methods: 47 periodontal maintenance subjects completed this single-blind 6 month longitudinal study. at baseline, samples of supra and separately subgingival plaque were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in each subject using sterile curettes and individually analyzed for their  content of 18 bacterial taxa using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. after random assignment to groups receiving either a manual (n=25) or power toothbrush  (n=22), subjects received instruction in oral hygiene and used their assigned toothbrush 2x daily for 6 months. clinical monitoring and microbiological sampling were repeated at 3 and 6 months. significant differences in microbiological measures over time were sought using the quade test and between brushing groups at each time point using the mann-whitney test. results: mean total counts were significantly reduced for supra- and subgingival plaque samples in the manual group and subgingival samples in the powered brushing group. actinomyces naeslundii and actinomyces israelii/gerencseriae were the most numerous organisms detected at baseline and showed the greatest reductions in counts in both brushing groups. streptococcus constellatus/intermedius was significantly reduced in both groups, while streptococcus mitis/oralis/sanguis was significantly reduced in the manual toothbrushing group. mean counts of species were more markedly altered in subgingival plaque. major reductions occurred in both groups for a. naeslundii, a. israelii/gerencseriae, peptostreptococcus micros, veillonella parvula, prevotella intermedia/nigrescens, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis and s. constellatus/intermedius. all taxa examined were reduced in prevalence (% of sites colonized) in the subgingival plaque samples for both brushing groups. the reductions in prevalence were greater for a. naeslundii, s. constellatus/intermedius, v. parvula, a. israelii/gerencseriae, s. mitis/oralis/sanguis, p. micros, streptococcus mutans and p. intermedia/nigrescens. mean prevalence was decreased more for porphyromonas gingivalis, campylobacter rectus/showae, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus in supragingival plaque than subgingival plaque. conclusions: the major finding was the effect of supragingival plaque removal on the composition of the  subgingival microbiota. counts and prevalence of most taxa examined were markedly decreased in both toothbrushing groups. this reduction should translate to a decreased risk of periodontal disease initiation or recurrence. further, the decreased prevalence of periodontal pathogens in supragingival plaque lowers potential reservoirs of these species.

TI  == phosphorylcholine-dependent cross-reactivity between dental plaque bacteria and oxidized low-density lipoproteins.
AB  == antibodies reactive with phosphorylcholine (pc) are ubiquitous in human sera, but the antigens stimulating their production and their function are not clear. previous studies have shown that a significant proportion of dental plaque bacteria contain pc as determined by reactivity with pc-specific mouse myeloma proteins and monoclonal antibodies. additionally, serum antibody concentrations of immunoglobulin (igg) g anti-pc are higher in sera of individuals who have experienced periodontal attachment loss than those who are periodontally healthy. these data implicate the oral microflora as a source of antigen-stimulating anti-pc responses. recent data also indicate that antibodies with specificity for pc are elevated in apoe-deficient mice, a model for studies of athersclerosis, and that such antibodies bound oxidized low-density lipoproteins (ldl) (oxldl) in atherosclerotic plaques. these data prompted the hypothesis that human anti-pc could bind to both oral bacteria and human oxldl, and that these antigens are cross-reactive. we therefore examined the ability of human anti-pc to bind to pc-bearing strains of oral bacteria using enzyme-linked immunosorbent inhibition  assays and by assessment of direct binding of affinity-purified human anti-pc to  pc-bearing actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. our results indicated that pc-bearing strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, haemophilus aphrophilus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, and a. actinomycetemcomitans, as well as a strain of streptococcus pneumoniae, absorbed  up to 80% of anti-pc igg antibody from human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc  bound to a pc-bearing strain of a. actinomycetemcomitans but only poorly to a pc-negative strain. oxldl also absorbed anti-pc from human sera, and oxldl but not ldl reacted with up to 80% of the anti-pc in human sera. furthermore, purified anti-pc bound directly to oxldl but not to ldl. the data indicate that pc-containing antigens on a variety of common oral bacteria are cross-reactive with neoantigens expressed in oxldl. we propose that pc-bearing dental plaque microorganisms may induce an antibody response to pc that could influence the inflammatory response associated with atherosclerosis.

AB  == six hundred and thirty clinically-normal milk samples from dairy goat flocks comprising a mixed population of german alpine, toggenburg, saanen and galla crosses were examined over a 3-month period to determine the prevalence of bacterial organisms. bacteria were isolated in 28.7% of the milk samples (181/630) either singly (92.8%) or in combination (7.2%). the most prevalent bacterial organisms were staphylococcus spp. (60.3%), followed by micrococcus spp. (17.7%), acinetobacter spp. (5%), actinomyces spp. (5%) and streptococcus spp. (1.1%). the staphylococcus spp. were mainly coagulase negative (64.3%). coagulase-negative staphylococci and coagulase-positive staphylococci accounted for 37.5% and 22.7% respectively of the total bacteria isolated. the isolation of bacteria, some of which are important in clinical and subclinical mastitis, in apparently normal caprine milk, indicates that particular attention should be given to the management of these dairy goat flocks in order to avoid the development of cases of clinical mastitis.

TI  == bacterial detachment from salivary conditioning films by dentifrice supernates.
AB  == this study compared the detachment by supernates of nine different dentifrices of four oral bacterial strains adhering to a salivary pellicle in a parallel plate flow chamber. ultra-thin bovine enamel slabs were coated for 1.5 h with human whole saliva. following buffer rinsing, a bacterial suspension of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans or actinomyces naeslundii was perfused through the flow chamber at a shear rate of 30 s-1 for four hours, and the number of adhering bacteria n4h was enumerated by image analysis after buffer rinsing at the same shear rate. then, a 25 wt%-dentifrice/water supernate was perfused through the flow chamber for four minutes, followed by eight minutes of  buffer rinsing and another enumeration of the number of bacteria that had remained adhering nad. finally, an air-bubble was passed through the flow chamber to mimic the occasionally high detachment forces occurring in the oral cavity, and the adhering bacteria nab were counted again. on average, s. sanguis was the  easiest to detach (73% averaged over all dentifrice supernates), while a. naeslundii was the most difficult (22% on average). the combined detachment of bacteria by dentifrice supernates and air-bubble ranged from a low of 16% to a high of 80%. dentifrices containing pyrophosphate and polymeric polyphosphate (hexametaphosphate) surface active ingredients appeared to produce the most consistent and strongest desorption effects on plaque bacteria. factors apparently important to bacterial detachment from pellicle-covered tooth surfaces by dentifrice formulations include the nature of adhesion of bacterial strains and chemical composition of the dentifrice formulations, including ph, surfactant system and the effect of added ingredients (dispersants, metal ions, peroxides, baking soda).

TI  == mutualism versus independence: strategies of mixed-species oral biofilms in vitro using saliva as the sole nutrient source.
AB  == during initial dental plaque formation, the ability of a species to grow when others cannot would be advantageous, and enhanced growth through interspecies and intergeneric cooperation could be critical. these characteristics were investigated in three coaggregating early colonizers of the tooth surface (streptococcus gordonii dl1, streptococcus oralis 34, and actinomyces naeslundii  t14v). area coverage and cell cluster size measurements showed that attachment of a. naeslundii and of s. gordonii to glass flowcells was enhanced by a salivary conditioning film, whereas attachment of s. oralis was hindered. growth experiments using saliva as the sole carbon and nitrogen source showed that a. naeslundii was unable to grow either in planktonic culture or as a biofilm, whereas s. gordonii grew under both conditions. s. oralis grew planktonically, but to a much lower maximum cell density than did s. gordonii; s. oralis did not  grow reproducibly as a biofilm. thus, only s. gordonii possessed all traits advantageous for growth as a solitary and independent resident of the tooth. two-species biofilm experiments analyzed by laser confocal microscopy showed that neither s. oralis nor a. naeslundii grew when coaggregated pairwise with s. gordonii. however, both s. oralis and a. naeslundii showed luxuriant, interdigitated growth when paired together in coaggregated microcolonies. thus, the s. oralis-a. naeslundii pair formed a mutualistic relationship, potentially contact dependent, that allows each to grow where neither could survive alone. s. gordonii, in contrast, neither was hindered by nor benefited from the presence of either of the other strains. the formation of mutually beneficial interactions within the developing biofilm may be essential for certain initial colonizers to  be retained during early plaque development, whereas other initial colonizers may be unaffected by neighboring cells on the substratum.

AB  == aim: the current investigation evaluated changes in levels and proportions of 40  bacterial species in subgingival plaque samples during, immediately after and up  to 1 year after metronidazole or amoxicillin therapy combined with srp. method: after baseline clinical and microbiological monitoring, 17 adult periodontitis subjects received full mouth srp and 14 days systemic administration of either metronidazole (250 mg, tid, n=8) or amoxicillin (500 mg, tid, n=9). clinical measurements including % of sites with plaque, gingival redness, bleeding on probing and suppuration, pocket depth (pd) and attachment level (al) were made at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of all teeth in each subject at baseline, 90, 180 and 360 days and from 2 randomly selected posterior teeth at 3, 7, and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. counts of 40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. significance of differences over time was determined using the quade test and between groups using ancova. results: mean pd was reduced from 3.22+/-0.12 at baseline to 2.81+/-0.16 (p<0.01) at 360 days and  from 3.38+/-0.23 mm to 2.80+/-0.14 mm (p<0.01) in the amoxicillin and metronidazole treated subjects respectively. corresponding values for mean al were 3.21+/-0.30 to 2.76+/-0.32 (p<0.05) and 3.23+/-0.28 mm to 2.94+/-0.23 mm (p<0.01). levels and proportions of bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola were markedly reduced during antibiotic administration and were lower than baseline levels at 360 days. counts (x10(5), +/-sem) of b. forsythus fell from baseline levels of 0.66+/-0.16 to 0.04+/-0.02,  0.13+/-0.04, 0.10+/-0.03 and 0.42+/-0.19 in the amoxicillin group at 14, 90, 180  and 360 days respectively (p<0.001). corresponding values for metronidazole treated subjects were: 1.69+/-0.28 to 0.02+/-0.01, 0.20+/-0.08, 0.22+/-0.06 and 0.22+/-0.08 (p<0.001). counts of campylobacter species, eubacterium nodatum, fusobacterium nucleatum subspecies, f. periodonticum and prevotella nigrescens were also detected at lower mean levels during and immediately after therapy, but gradually increased after withdrawal of the antibiotics. members of the genera actinomyces, streptococcus and capnocytophaga were minimally affected by metronidazole. however, amoxicillin decreased the counts and proportions of actinomyces species during and after therapy. conclusions: the data suggest that  metronidazole and amoxicillin are useful in rapidly lowering counts of putative periodontal pathogens, but must be accompanied by other procedures to bring about periodontal stability.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of subgingival microbiota in adult periodontitis, localized juvenile periodontitis and rapidly progressive periodontitis subjects.
AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of the cultivable subgingival microbiota in periodontal diseases and to draw attention to the polymicrobial nature of periodontic infections. methods: the study population consisted of 95 patients, 51 females and 44 males, aged 14-62 years. twenty-nine patients exhibited adult periodontitis (ap), six localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp), and 60 rapidly progressive periodontitis (rpp). two to four pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected with sterile paper points from the deepest periodontal pockets. the samples were cultured under anaerobic and microaerophilic conditions using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and by a commercial rapid test system. results: prevotella intermedia and capnocytophaga spp. were the most frequently detected microorganisms in all diagnostic groups. porphyromonas gingivalis and peptostreptococcus micros were found more frequently in ap and rpp patients, while actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and eikenella  corrodens were associated with ap, ljp and rpp patients. the other bacterial species, including actinomyces spp., streptococcus spp. and eubacterium spp., were detected at different levels in the three disease groups. conclusions: the data show the complexity of the subgingival microbiota associated with different  periodontal disease groups, indicating that the detection frequency and levels of recovery of some periodontal pathogens are different in teeth affected by different forms of periodontal disease.

TI  == analysis of bacterial detachment from substratum surfaces by the passage of air-liquid interfaces.
AB  == a theoretical analysis of the detachment of bacteria adhering to substratum surfaces upon the passage of an air-liquid interface is given, together with experimental results for bacterial detachment in the absence and presence of a conditioning film on different substratum surfaces. bacteria (streptococcus sobrinus hg1025, streptococcus oralis j22, actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, bacteroides fragilis 793e, and pseudomonas aeruginosa 974k) were first allowed to adhere to hydrophilic glass and hydrophobic dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber until a density of 4 x 10(6) cells cm(-2)  was reached. for s. sobrinus hg1025, s. oralis j22, and a. naeslundii t14v-j1, the conditioning film consisted of adsorbed salivary components, while for b. fragilis 793e and p. aeruginosa 974k, the film consisted of adsorbed human plasma components. subsequently, air bubbles were passed through the flow chamber and the bacterial detachment percentages were measured. for some experimental conditions, like with p. aeruginosa 974k adhering to dds-coated glass and an air  bubble moving at high velocity (i.e., 13.6 mm s(-1)), no bacteria detached upon passage of an air-liquid interface, while for others, detachment percentages between 80 and 90% were observed. the detachment percentage increased when the velocity of the passing air bubble decreased, regardless of the bacterial strain  and substratum surface hydrophobicity involved. however, the variation in percentages of detachment by a passing air bubble depended greatly upon the strain and substratum surface involved. at low air bubble velocities the hydrophobicity of the substratum had no influence on the detachment, but at high  air bubble velocities all bacterial strains were more efficiently detached from hydrophilic glass substrata. furthermore, the presence of a conditioning film could either inhibit or stimulate detachment. the shape of the bacterial cell played a major role in detachment at high air bubble velocities, and spherical strains (i.e., streptococci) detached more efficiently than rod-shaped organisms. the present results demonstrate that methodologies to study bacterial adhesion which include contact with a moving air-liquid interface (i.e., rinsing and dipping) yield detachment of an unpredictable number of adhering microorganisms.  hence, results of studies based on such methodologies should be referred as "bacterial retention" rather than "bacterial adhesion".

TI  == antibacterial activity of particulate bioglass against supra- and subgingival bacteria.
AB  == particulate bioglass is a bioactive material used in the repair of periodontal defects. this material undergoes a series of surface reactions in an aqueous environment which lead to osseointegration. the aim of this study was to determine whether these reactions exerted an antibacterial effect on a range of oral bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were suspended in nutrient broth (nb), artificial saliva (as) or dulbecco's modified eagle medium plus 10% foetal calf serum (dmem + 10%fcs), with or without particulate bioglass. all bacteria showed reduced viability following  exposure to bioglass in all the media after 1 h. this antibacterial effect increased after 3 h. porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were suspended in  either bm broth or 40% horse serum (hs) in rpmi. a considerable reduction in viability was observed with all bacteria tested, in both media, compared to inert glass controls. in further experiments it was found that the viability of s. sanguis was significantly reduced following exposure to nb pre-incubated with bioglass. additionally, it was found that neutralisation of this highly alkaline  solution eliminated the antibacterial effect. moreover, a solution of nb and naoh (of equivalent ph) exerted an antibacterial effect of similar magnitude to that of the solution pre-incubated with bioglass. thus, particulate bioglass exerts an antibacterial effect on certain oral bacteria, possibly by virtue of the alkaline nature of its surface reactions. this may reduce bacterial colonisation of its surface in vivo.

TI  == molecular strategies for fimbrial expression and assembly.
AB  == fimbriae or pili are long, filamentous, multimeric macromolecules found on the bacterial cell surface. bacteria express a diverse array of fimbriae or pili that are involved in bacterial adherence and invasion. fimbriae can be categorized based on their modes of expression and assembly. type i fimbriae and p pili are distributed peritrichously and translocated to the cell surface by a chaperone/usher pathway. type 4 pili are located at the pole of the cell and assembled via the type ii secretion system. curli fimbriae are coiled surface structures assembled by an extracellular nucleation/precipitation pathway. fimbriae of oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria have not been well-studied as compared with the fimbriae of enteric pathogens. oral pathogens,  such as eikenella corrodens, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and porphyromonas gingivalis, possess fimbriae that have been implicated in bacterial adhesion and invasion. these fimbriae are potential virulence factors in oral infectious processes. a. actinomycetemcomitans and e. corrodens have type 4-like  fimbriae, whereas p. gingivalis displays a unique type of fimbriae. to date, fimbriae of the oral primary colonizers, actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus parasanguis, represent the only fimbriae characterized for any gram-positive bacteria. the putative major fimbrial subunits, fima and fimp of a. naeslundii and fap1 of s. parasanguis, contain a signal sequence and cell-wall-sorting signal. the presence of extensive dipeptide repeats in fap1 makes it unique among fimbrial molecules. based on experimental data, a nucleation/precipitation pathway is proposed for fimbrial biogenesis of both s. parasanguis and a. naeslundii, although we cannot rule out an alternative covalent linkage model. the model systems described in this review served as a framework for hypotheses for how the known molecular factors of fimbriae on oral bacteria may be expressed and assembled.

TI  == effects of three different infant dentifrices on biofilms and oral microorganisms.
AB  == the purpose of this work was to evaluate the effects of infant dentifrices: a--with lactoperoxidase, glucose oxidase and lactoferrin; b--with 1100 ppm of naf and sodium lauryl sulfate; c--with extract of calendula. the dentifrices were test on biofilms formed in vitro from saliva and dental plaque of infants, using  reference strains a. viscosus (atcc 43146); c. albicans (atcc 51501); l. casei (atcc 4646); s. mitis (atcc 49456); s. mutans (atcc 25175); s. oralis (atcc 35037); s. sanguis (atcc 10586); s. sobrinus (atcc 27609) and isolated clinically microorganisms c. albicans, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus and lactobacillus sp. twenty infants were chosen, who were beginning treatment at the infants clinic of the pediatric dentistry department, federal university of rio de janeiro. a pool of unstimulated saliva and a pool of dental  plaque were collected from which biofilms were produced. supernatants from each dentifrice were prepared and concentrated and diluted solutions of the dentifrices and a control sterile diluent were tested against the biofilms produced, for 1 and 3 minutes, and against the microorganisms. the results were statistically analyzed by the anova and tukey test. after the exposure of the biofilms produced both from saliva and from dental plaque, to the dentifrice b concentrated and 1/2, for 1 and 3 minutes, the viable microorganisms count (cfu/ml), compared to the controls, was significantly reduced (p < 0.05). however, exposure to the dentifrices a and c concentrated and dentifrice b 1/4 and 1/8, for 1 and 3 minutes, was not significantly lethal to the biofilms. the dentifrices a and c, either concentrated or diluted (1/2 to 1/128) and the dentifrice b in the dilutions 1/16 to 1/128 did not have an antimicrobial effect  on any microorganism evaluated. for all the microorganisms evaluated, the dentifrice b concentrated and in the 1/2 dilution showed a significant antimicrobial effect, when compared with the control (p < 0.05).

AB  == immunostaining with polyclonal anti-mycobacterium bovis (bcg) was evaluated as a  single screening method for the histological identification of micro-organisms in skin biopsy specimens from various veterinary species. confirmed archival cases infected with mycobacteria, nocardia, actinobacillus, actinomyces, streptococcus/staphylococcus, dermatophilus, spirochetes, blastomyces, coccidioides, cryptococcus, histoplasma, dermatophytes, malassezia, sporothrix, leishmania, pythium, phaeohyphomycetes and prototheca organisms were selected. a  total of 70 skin biopsy specimens from the dog, cat, horse, ox and llama were evaluated. the anti-bcg immunostain labelled bacteria and fungi with high sensitivity and minimal background staining but did not label spirochetes and protozoa (leishmania). differences were not noted between veterinary species. the results indicate that immunostaining with polyclonal anti-bcg is a suitable screening technique for the rapid identification of most common bacterial and fungal organisms in paraffin-embedded specimens. also, mycobacterial and nocardial organisms were identified more readily with the anti-bcg immunostain in comparison to the histochemical stains.

TI  == antibacterial properties of dentin bonding systems, polyacid-modified composite resins and composite resins.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of the bonding systems syntac, ebs and scotchbond 1, the polyacid-modified composite resins hytac and compoglass, and the composite resins tetric, z100 and scalp-it. they were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus sorbinus and actinomyces viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. all adhesives of the dentin bonding systems and the polyacid-modified composite resins exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against all of the test bacteria. on the contrary, composite resins did not affect bacterial growth. the data suggest that the use of these adhesives and polyacid-modified composite resins may reduce the  consequences of microleakage owing to their antibacterial properties.

TI  == validation of an in vitro biofilm model of supragingival plaque.
AB  == the study of biofilm structure and function mandates the use of model systems for which a host of environmental variables can be rigorously controlled. we describe a model of supragingival plaque containing actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis wherein cells are cultivated anaerobically in a saliva-based medium on hydroxyapatite discs coated with a salivary pellicle, with material and pieces of apparatus common to all microbiology laboratories. after 0.5 hr, 16.5 hrs, 40.5 hrs, and 64.5 hrs, the composition of adherent biofilms was analyzed by culture techniques, live/dead fluorescence staining, and confocal laser scanning microscopy. repeated independent trials demonstrated the repeatability of biofilm formation after 40.5 hrs and 64.5 hrs. brief exposures of biofilms to chlorhexidine or triclosan produced losses in viability similar to those observed in vivo. this biofilm model should prove very useful for pre-clinical testing of  prospective anti-plaque agents at clinically relevant concentrations.

TI  == spatial arrangements and associative behavior of species in an in vitro oral biofilm model.
AB  == the spatial arrangements and associative behavior of actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella dispar, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus sobrinus, and streptococcus oralis strains in an in vitro model of supragingival plaque were determined. using species-specific fluorescence-labeled antibodies in conjunction with confocal laser scanning microscopy, the volumes and distribution of the five strains were assessed during biofilm formation. the volume-derived cell numbers of each strain correlated well with respective culture data. between 15 min and 64 h, populations of each strain increased in a manner reminiscent of batch growth. the microcolony morphologies of all members of the consortium and their distributions within the biofilm were characterized, as were interspecies associations. biofilms formed 15 min after inoculation consisted principally of single nonaggregated cells. all five strains adhered strongly to the saliva-conditioned substratum, and therefore, coadhesion played no role during the initial phase of biofilm formation. this observation does not reflect the results of in vitro coaggregation of the five strains, which depended upon the nature of the suspension medium. while the possibility cannot be excluded that some interspecies associations observed at later stages of biofilm formation were initiated by coadhesion, increase in bacterial numbers appeared to be largely a growth phenomenon regulated by the prevailing cultivation conditions.

TI  == addition of antibacterial agents to mma-tbb dentin bonding systems--influence on  tensile bond strength and antibacterial effect.
AB  == to produce a bonding system which has both high bond strength and antibacterial properties, an antibacterial agent (vancomycin: vcm or metronidazol: mn) was added to the pmma powder of 4-meta/mma-tbb resin (cb). the influence of the addition of an antibacterial agent on tensile bond strength to dentin and the antibacterial effect were investigated in this study. forty-seven freshly extracted bovine first or second incisors were used to measure the tensile bond strength to dentin. the bond strengths to bovine dentin were not significantly decreased by addition of vcm (1%, 2%, 5%), or mn (1%) to cb (p < 0.05). the antibacterial effect of cb containing antibacterial agent on six strains of bacteria was investigated by the agar plate diffusion method, analyzing the appearance of the inhibition zone around a resin disk following anaerobic culturing. the resin disks containing vcm showed antibacterial effects on all of  the strains examined; the widths of the inhibition zones were 4-15 mm. the resin  disks containing mn showed antibacterial effects on three strains; the widths of  the inhibition zones were 0-4 mm. it was thus possible to produce a bonding system with both antibacterial effect and high tensile bond strength by addition  of vcm to pmma powder.

TI  == surface characteristics and in vitro biofilm formation on glass ionomer and composite resin.
AB  == in the initial stages of dental plaque formation, early colonizing bacteria bind  to receptor structures in the pellicle, a proteinaceous film formed instantly after cleaning of the tooth surface. dental restorative materials with surface characteristics different from the tooth might affect pellicle formation and the  ability of bacteria to colonize the oral cavity. in this study (i) roughness and  chemical composition of glass ionomer and composite resin surfaces before and after polishing, and (ii) the adsorption of salivary proteins and bacterial adherence to the pellicle-coated surfaces were examined. compared with unpolished composite resin, unpolished glass ionomer had higher surface roughness, contained more inorganic, positively charged components, collected more proteins, and promoted better bacterial adherence. polishing had the most pronounced effect on  the composite resin, giving an enlarged and a rougher surface with a more inorganic character. polishing the composite resin also led to increased biofilm  formation.

TI  == assessment of periradicular microbiota by dna-dna hybridization.
AB  == in the present study the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization technique was used  to identify bacteria in periapical endodontic lesions of asymptomatic teeth. thirty-four patients with root-filled teeth and apical periodontitis were divided into two groups, each containing 17 patients. in group 1, a marginal incision was performed during surgery to expose the lesion, and in group 2, a submarginal incision was applied. the gingiva and mucosa were swabbed with an 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution prior to surgery. bacterial dna was identified in all samples from the two groups using 40 different whole genomic probes. the mean number (+/- sd) of species detected was 33.7 +/- 3.3 in group 1 and 21.3 +/- 6.3 in group 2 (p < 0.001). the majority of the probe-detected bacteria were present in more lesions from group 1 than from group 2. the differences were most notable for campylobacter gracilis, porphyromonas endodontalis, propionibacterium acnes, capnocytophaga gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. nucleatum, fusobacterium nucleatum ssp. polymorphum, prevotella intermedia, treponema denticola, streptococcus constellatus and actinomyces naeslundii i. bacterial species such as actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and bacteroides forsythus were detected in more than 60% of the lesions from both groups. also, p. endodontalis was abundant in periapical tissue. the data supported the idea that  following a marginal incision, bacteria from the periodontal pocket might reach the underlying tissues by surgeon-released bacteremia. the study provided solid evidence that bacteria invade the periapical tissue of asymptomatic teeth with apical periodontitis. the detection of much more bacteria with the "checkerboard" dna-dna hybridization method than has previously been recovered by anaerobic culture indicated that the endodontic (and periodontal) microfloras should be redefined using molecular methods.

TI  == the role of fructans on dental biofilm formation by streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == dental plaque biofilm plays a pivotal role in the progression of dental diseases. polysaccharides are of great importance in the ecology of the dental biofilm. we  studied the effect of fructans, glucans and a mixture of both fructans and glucans, synthesized in situ by immobilized fructosyltransferase or glucosyltransferase, on the adhesion of streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces viscosus to hydroxyapatite beads coated with human saliva (sha). the adhesion of a. viscosus to sha was found to be fructan-dependent. adhesion of both s. sobrinus and s. mutans was found to be  mediated mainly by glucans, while the adhesion of s. gordonii was found to be both glucan- and fructan-dependent. treatment with fructanase prior to a. viscosus adhesion resulted in a significant reduction in adhesion to sha, while adhesion of s. sobrinus, s. mutans and s. gordonii was slightly influenced by fructanase treatment. treatment with fructanase after adhesion of s. gordonii to  sha resulted in a significant reduction in their adhesion to sha. our results show that fructans may play a role in the adhesion and colonization of several cariogenic bacteria to sha, thus contributing to the formation of dental plaque biofilm.

TI  == humoral immunity host factors in subjects with failing or successful titanium dental implants.
AB  == background: treatment with titanium dental implants is in general successful. however, an unknown number of implants do not integrate and are removed either by exfoliation or at the time of second stage surgery. it would be of importance to  identify subjects at risk and predict early implant failure. methods: in a retrospective study serum igg antibody titers and avidity in sera from 40 subjects who had experienced titanium dental implant treatments with non-osseo-integration as the outcome (noti) and in sera from 40 age and gender matched control subjects who had received successful titanium dental implants (soti) were studied. serum igg titers to whole cell actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus intermedius sonicated antigen preparations were studied by elisa. results: serum igg antibody titers to s. aureus were significantly higher in subjects with soti than in noti (p<0.001) suggesting that higher titers indicate  protection against implant failure as a result of s. aureus infection. statistically significant higher serum igg antibody avidity to p. gingivalis and  b. forsythus were found in subjects with soti than in subjects with noti (p<0.01  and p<0.001, respectively). statistical analysis failed to demonstrate antibody titer or avidity differences to the other pathogens studied. the likelihood that  soti was associated with a high od reading for s. aureus was 13.1:1 (p<0.001). whether subjects were edentulous or not, or if they had lost teeth because of periodontitis or caries did not seem to matter. conclusion: serum igg antibodies  relative to b. forsythus, p. gingivalis and s. aureus may be associated with the  outcome of implant procedures and explain why early implant failures occur.

TI  == properties of streptococcus sanguinis glucans formed under various conditions.
AB  == the aim of our study was to determine whether the structure of glucans formed by  glucosyltransferase from streptococcus sanguinis (gtfss) on a surface differ from those formed in solution and to explore the effects of antiserum to gtfs, control normal rabbit serum, starch hydrolysates (sth) and dextran on s. sanguinis (gtfss) glucan. linkage analyses showed that solution-formed glucans are predominantly alpha-1,6-linked and have a small amount of alpha-1,3-linked glucose. surface-formed glucans have enhanced susceptibility to mutanase. solution- and surface-formed glucans made in the presence or absence of sera, sth, and dextran contain linkages which differ in both amount and type from control glucans. the gtfss enzyme in solution exposed to antiserum behaves as if  it is adsorbed to a surface. binding of streptococcus mutans gs-5 and actinomyces viscosus omz105e (ny1) to s. sanguinis glucan differs if the glucan is formed in  the presence of antiserum. the information could help to define the role of glucans in the formation of pellicle, colonization of tooth surfaces and the accumulation of dental plaque.

AB  == this study examined the cultivable microflora before and after stepwise excavation procedures in deep carious lesions in 9 permanent teeth, categorized according to degrees of proximal surface destruction. the final excavation was performed 4-6 months after the initial treatment, which included peripheral dentine excavation and removal of the central cariogenic biomass and the superficial necrotic dentine. dentine colour and consistency were assessed by means of standardized scales before the application of a ca(oh)(2) compound and temporary sealing. reassessments were performed before and after the final excavation. microbiological samples of the central demineralized dentine were obtained with a sterile bur before and after the first excavation, as well as before and after the final excavation. after anaerobic cultivation on enriched non-selective tryptic soy agar, 30 colonies from a representative area were identified by standardized biochemical and physiological tests. before temporary  restoration, a yellowish and light brown demineralized soft dentine was typically observed, and gram-positive rods accounted for 70% and lactobacilli for 50% of the total colony-forming units. lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus and actinomyces naeslundii dominated the lactobacilli and the other gram-positive rods, respectively. gram-negative rods were the next most frequent isolates, followed by streptococci, each group accounting for about 20% of the colony-forming units in positive samples. before the final excavation, which did  not cause exposure of the pulp in any of the cases, the retained demineralized dentine had changed into a darker and harder tissue, and the total colony-forming units, as well as the frequency and proportions of lactobacilli were substantially reduced. gram-negative rods also declined, and the flora was dominated by a. naeslundii and various streptococci. in conclusion, the cultivable flora detected following the treatment interval had declined substantially, and the distribution of bacterial species did not represent a typical cariogenic microbiota of deep lesions, confirming the clinical findings of arrested caries progression.

TI  == fractional inhibitory concentration index of combinations of antibacterial agents against cariogenic organisms.
AB  == objectives: to examine the inhibitory effects between paired combinations of four antibacterial agents that have been investigated in dentistry against six bacteria associated with dentinal caries. methods: the antibacterial agents tested were: chlorhexidine dihydrochloride, benzalkonium chloride, cetrimide and  cetylpyridinium chloride. two organisms each belonging to streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces species were evaluated against these agents. a checkerboard microtitration method was used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration and fractionary inhibitory concentration (fic) and summation operator fic index of the paired combinations of antibacterial agents against the six species of bacteria. appropriate controls were included. the summation operator fic index was then used to determine if synergy, antagonism, or indifference occurred as a result of interactions between the antibacterial agents and the test organisms. results: the data from a total of 295 test results were evaluated. using summation operator fic values for synergy as < or = 0.5 and antagonism as > 4.0 as recommended by the american society for microbiology, no significant synergistic or antagonistic interactions were observed between the paired antibacterial agents when tested against selected organisms. however, a tendency for an additive antibacterial effect was observed with approximately a third of the test results. nonetheless, no combination of antibacterial agents appeared to be superior to any other. conclusions: according to these in vitro results, there appears to be no beneficial effect of combining the antibacterial  agents against the individual cariogenic micro-organisms selected. however, it may be beneficial to use combined antibacterial agents that have a broader range  of activity against an ecosystem of bacteria than using individual agents.

TI  == sensitization of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis in biofilms and suspensions to acid damage by fluoride and other weak acids.
AB  == fluoride and other weak acids, such as benzoate, indomethacin, salicylate and sorbate, were found to be sensitizers for acid killing of cells of actinomyces naeslundii atcc 19246 and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 in suspensions or in mono-organism biofilms on glass slides. these bacteria are among the more acid-sensitive organisms from dental plaque and were killed when acidified to ph  values between 3.5 and 4.0. biofilm cells were more resistant than cells in suspensions, especially in terms of the fraction of the initial population surviving acidification. the mechanism for sensitization to acid killing by fluoride and the other weak acids involved enhanced transmembrane transport of protons, reflected by increases in measured proton permeabilities of the cells. thus, the weak acids thwarted the functions of f(h+)-atpases in extruding protons and protecting cells against acid damage. fluoride sensitization of biofilms or cells in suspensions to acid damage occurred rapidly. there was a delay in sensitization of biofilms by indomethacin and higher molecular weight acids which was interpreted in terms of diffusion limitation of sensitizer penetration. overall, it seemed that weak-acid sensitization to acid killing is a general phenomenon that occurs not just for oral bacteria but also for organisms in food, soil, and other acidified environments.

TI  == red light kills bacteria via photodynamic action.
AB  == with the increase in the number of antibiotic resistant strains of microorganism, the search for alternative treatments of microbial infections becomes all the more important. we report a novel method for bacterial inactivation based on the  optical excitation of the naturally occurring (endogenous) photosensitzing porphyrins by red light. in particular, the pathogenic gram-positive porphyrin producing atcc strains propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces odontolyticus and porphyromonas gingivalis were investigated. sensitive autofluorescence spectroscopy revealed that these bacteria naturally synthezise the fluorescent photosensitizer protoporphyrin ix. in addition, bacterial plaque samples of periodontitis patients were studied. non-labeled fluorescent bacterial colonies were exposed to red light at 632.8 nm, 100 mw/cm2 light intensity and 360 j/cm2 energy density using a helium-neon laser. the survival rate after a single phototreatment with red light was found to be 0.58 +/- 0.09 in the case of propionibacterium acnes, 0.30 +/- 0.04 in actinomyces odontolyticus and 0.59 +/-  0.10 in porphyrormonas gingivalis compared to non-exposed bacteria suspensions. no photoeffect was found for the bacterium streptococcus mutans which exhibited no detectable porphyrin autofluorescence. red-light exposed plaque samples of patients showed significant reduction of colony forming units by 50% as well as a pronounced photoeffect on the pigmented species prevotella intermedia. taken together, these results suggest the treatment with red light can be potentially employed as an therapeutic method to inactivate certain pathogenic strains of porphyrin producing bacteria without the use of external photosensitizers.

TI  == the formation of mixed culture biofilms of oral species along a gradient of shear stress.
AB  == a chemostat mixed culture system was used to produce two distinct ecological states, state-1 (caries-like microcosm) and state-2 (periodontal-like microcosm). eleven bacterial species (streptococcus gordonii, strep. mitis i, strep. mutans,  strep. oralis, actinomyces naeslundii, lactobacillus casei, neisseria subflava, fusobacterium nucleatum, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, veillonella dispar) were used to inoculate the planktonic system. a flow cell, designed to produce convergent flow with increasing shear stress, was attached to the chemostat system, and the resultant biofilms developed from the state-1 and state-2 microcosms along the shear stress gradient were examined and compared using image analysis and viable counts. the biofilm produced from state-1 showed  a lower shear stress tolerance (0.146 pa) than the state-2 biofilm (0.236 pa). the biofilm compositions did not vary along the gradient of shear stress and were dependent on the initial inoculum conditions. gram-positive species were predominant in the state-1 biofilm, while gram-negative species were predominant  in state-2.

TI  == automated immunofluorescence for enumeration of selected taxa in supragingival dental plaque.
AB  == the present study investigated a recently developed automated image analysis technique for its applicability to the enumeration of selected bacteria in supragingival dental plaque. following initial calibration, the system is capable to count fluorescence-labeled target cells in up to 48 samples without user interference. test samples contained a characteristic mixture of planktonic bacteria, small almost planar bacterial aggregates, and large, virtually indisruptable clumps with cells from multiple species. due to their complex composition, these samples provided a challenging validation step for the image analysis system. automated enumeration of target bacteria was compared with visual counting of the fluorescence-labeled bacteria. results are shown for six taxa (actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia/prev. nigrescens, streptococcus gordonii/strep. oralis/strep. sanguis, strep. sobrinus, and veillonella dispar/ v. parvula) with characteristic differences in abundance, cell morphology and aggregation behavior. results revealed good correspondence between the two enumeration techniques (correlation  coefficients ranging from 0.77 to 0.92) provided that the portion of target bacteria exceeded 0.05% of the total bacterial cell number. this work demonstrates the applicability and usefulness of fully automated immunofluorescence to analyze such complex ecosystems as supragingival dental plaque.

TI  == identification of polymorphonuclear leukocyte and hl-60 cell receptors for adhesins of streptococcus gordonii and actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == interactions of oral streptococci and actinomyces with polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns), mediated by sialic acid- and gal/galnac-reactive adhesins, respectively, result in activation of the pmns and thereby may contribute to the  initiation of oral inflammation. sialidase treatment of pmns or hl-60 cells abolished adhesion of streptococcus gordonii but was required for adhesion of actinomyces naeslundii. the same effects of sialidase were noted for adhesion of  these bacteria to a major 150-kda surface glycoprotein of either pmns or undifferentiated hl-60 cells and to a 130-kda surface glycoprotein of differentiated hl-60 cells. these glycoproteins were both identified as leukosialin (cd43) by immunoprecipitation with a specific monoclonal antibody (mab). adhesion of streptococci and actinomyces to a 200-kda minor pmn surface glycoprotein was also detected by bacterial overlay of untreated and sialidase-treated nitrocellulose transfers, respectively. this glycoprotein was identified as leukocyte common antigen (cd45) by immunoprecipitation with a specific mab. cd43 and cd45 both possess extracellular mucinlike domains in addition to intracellular domains that are implicated in signal transduction. consequently, the interactions of streptococci and actinomyces with the mucinlike domains of these mammalian cell surface glycoproteins result not only in adhesion but, in addition, may represent the initial step in pmn activation by these bacteria.

TI  == microbial composition of supra- and subgingival plaque in subjects with adult periodontitis.
AB  == background, aims: the purpose of the present study was to compare and relate the  microbial composition of supra and subgingival plaque in 23 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 51 +/- 14 years). methods: a total of 1,170 samples of supra and subgingival plaque were collected from the mesial aspect of every tooth (up to 28 supra and 28 subgingival samples) from each subject and evaluated for the presence and levels of 40 bacterial taxa using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level,  were made at 6 sites per tooth. the counts (levels), % dna probe count (proportion) and % of sites colonized (prevalence) of each species in supra and separately in subgingival plaque were computed for each subject. significance of  differences between supra and subgingival plaque for each species was sought using the wilcoxon signed ranks test and adjusted for multiple comparisons. results: all 40 taxa were detected in both supra and subgingival plaque. actinomyces species were the most prevalent taxa in both habitats. 75 to 100% of  supra and 62 to 100% of subgingival sites were colonized by at least one of the 5 actinomyces species. supragingival samples exhibited significantly higher counts  of actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces odontolyticus, neisseria mucosa, streptococcus gordonii, capnocytophaga ochracea  and capnocytophaga sputigena when compared with mean counts in subgingival samples taken from the same tooth surfaces. subgingival plaque samples presented  significantly higher counts of prevotella nigrescens, prevotella intermedia, bacteroides forsythus and porphykromonas gingivalis. subgingival samples exhibited a significantly higher proportion of "red" and "orange complex" species, while supragingival plaque exhibited higher proportions of "green" and "purple" complex species as well as actinomyces species. suspected periodontal pathogens could be detected in supragingival plaque from sites where subgingival  samples were negative for the same species. conclusions: the data indicate that supragingival plaque can harbor putative periodontal pathogens, suggesting a possible role of this environment as a reservoir of such species for the spread or reinfection of subgingival sites.

TI  == coptidis rhizoma inhibits growth and proteases of oral bacteria.
AB  == objective: the aim of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of coptidis rhizoma (cr), a traditional medicinal plant, on oral bacteria. materials and methods: cr extract was prepared by boiling cr in water for 2 h. alkaloids contained in cr extract were assayed by high performance liquid chromatography (hplc). antibacterial activity of cr extract was estimated from the lowest concentration that did not permit bacterial growth (minimum inhibitory concentration, mic) and the concentrations that inhibited 50% of bacterial proteolytic activity (ic50). results: cr extract inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans at mic of 0.031-0.25 mg ml(-1), whereas it had less inhibitory effect (mic: 0.5-2 mg ml(-1)) on the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus. the major active component of cr extract was berberine (ber), an alkaloid, and its inhibiting specificity to bacterial growth was similar to that of cr extract. cr extract and ber were bacteriostatic at the mics against most of the bacteria, and bacteriocidal at the concentrations higher than the mics. ber inhibited the activities of collagenase from p. gingivalis and a. actinomycetemcomitans. conclusion: cr extract and ber had an inhibitory effect on periodontopathogenic bacteria. these results suggest the possibility of their clinical application for the treatment of periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of acidified nitrite on cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent nitric oxide (no) is formed in the mouth and its concentration is directly related to salivary nitrite, which in turn is related to dietary nitrate intake. the aim of this study was to determine whether nitrite under acidic conditions will have an inhibitory effect, possibly occurring through no production, on streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces naeslundii. whereas the growth of s. mutans was inhibited by a more acid ph, the addition of nitrite caused a marked, further dose-dependent reduction in bacterial numbers after 24 h of exposure. similar effects were observed with a. naeslundii and l. casei. the ability of these bacteria to recover from nitrite exposure was also markedly affected by nitrite concentration. at acidity levels below ph 7, low concentrations of nitrite (0.2 mm) caused effective complete killing of s. mutans, with similar effects on the other organisms tested. these results demonstrate the possibility that nitrite in saliva has an effect on the growth and survival of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == studies concerning the glucosyltransferase of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == we have shown in previous studies that the glucosyltransferase (gtf) enzymes of streptococcus mutans have distinct properties when adsorbed to a surface. in the  present study, we compared the activity of gtf from streptococcus sanguis, designated gtfss, in solution and on the surface of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite  (sha) beads, and determined the ability of its product glucan to support the adherence of oral microorganisms. gtf from s. sanguis 804 nctc 10904 was purified from culture supernatant fluids by means of hydroxyapatite chromatography. enzyme and the substrate were prepared in buffers at ph values from 3.5 to 7.5. maximum  activity of gtfss occurred between ph 5.5 and ph 6.5, whether in solution or adsorbed onto a surface. the solubilized and insolubilized enzymes showed highest activity at 40 degrees c; activity was reduced by 50(+/-2)% at 20 and 30 degrees  c. the enzyme did not form glucans in either phase at 10 or 60 degrees c. the k(m), determined from lineweaver-burk plots, for the enzyme in solution was 4.3(+/-0.4) mmol/l sucrose, and the k(m) for the enzyme on sha beads was 5.0(+/-1.0) mmol/l sucrose. the ability of the gtfss glucan synthesized on the surface of sha beads to support the adherence of oral bacteria was investigated.  (3)h-thymidine-labeled bacteria (s. mutans gs-5, s. sobrinus 6715, s. sobrinus 6716, s. sanguis 10904, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, a. viscosus 2085, and a. viscosus 2086) were incubated with sha beads coated with gtfss glucan. s. mutans  gs-5 displayed the highest level of binding numerically. these results show that  the gtfss of s. sanguis is active on sha beads, that the ph optimum for activity  on a surface differs slightly from that in solution, and that its product glucan  can support the adherence of oral microorganisms.

TI  == the influence of oral bacteria on the surfaces of resin-based dental restorative  materials--an in vitro study.
AB  == three tooth-coloured, resin-based restorative materials (charisma, dyract, and pertac) were exposed to typical oral bacteria (s. mutans, s. oralis and a. naeslundii) over a period of up to 35 days. the three strains of bacteria all colonised the resin-based materials within a few hours and formed thick bacterial films. determination of the bacterial glucose consumption and lactate production  during the incubation period showed no difference from the controls which contained no resin samples. following the experimental exposure, the materials were examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem) for possible surface damage and roughness was measured in a perthometer. little damage to the resin-based composite material surfaces (charisma, pertac) could be observed, whereas the polyacid-modified composite material (dyract) showed greater damage. there was a  significant difference in the resin surface roughness after exposure to s. mutans and to a. naeslundii. the study clearly showed that the bacteria used strongly adhered to the resin-based restorative materials. as a consequence of bacterial colonisation and/or poor oral hygiene, damage to the restorative materials might  develop. this suggests the need for dentists to evaluate personal oral hygiene, along with general indications and economic factors, in selecting materials for restorations, since the known anti-bacterial properties of amalgam are considerable.

AB  == purpose: the purpose of the study was to identify the most frequently encountered pyogenic organisms involved in pericoronitis to permit more targeted antibiotic therapy. patients and methods: pericoronal pockets of mandibular third molars from 37 patients showing symptoms of acute, severe pericoronitis were sampled and subjected to microbiologic analysis, including primary evaluation by phase-contrast microscopy. to avoid overgrowth with faster-growing, less fastidious organisms, specimens were cultured on a wide variety of selective media (supporting growth of fastidious bacteria, protozoa, and fungi). results: microscopic examination indicated spirochetes in 55% and fusiform bacteria in 84% of the samples. a total of 441 microorganisms were isolated and identified from the 37 cultured samples. besides obligate anaerobic bacteria, including various actinomyces and prevotella species, a predominantly facultative anaerobic microflora was cultivated, that is, streptococcus milleri group (78% of samples), stomatococcus mucilaginosus (71%), and rothia dentocariosa (57%). conclusion: it  was concluded that the streptococci milleri group bacteria, well-known for their  ability to cause suppurative infections, are most likely involved in the pathogenesis of acute severe pericoronitis of the lower third molar.

TI  == induction of parturition with prostaglandin f2 alpha as a possible model to study impaired reproductive performance in the dairy cow.
AB  == parturitions were induced in five cows, 2 weeks before term using prostaglandin (pg) f(2alpha). two i.m. injections were performed with an interval of 24 h. all  cows calved within 5 days (average 2.7 days) after the first injection of pgf(2alpha). out of five cows, four had retained fetal membranes (rfm). each animal was sampled for bacteriological examination using uterine biopsies twice a week during 42 days postpartum (pp). jugular vein blood samples were withdrawn for pgf(2alpha)-metabolite and progesterone analyses five times per day during the first week pp and eight times per 24 h during the 2nd and 3rd weeks pp. from  the 4th week, the sampling interval was reduced back to five times per day. from  the 5th week pp, the sampling was reduced to two times per day and sampling was terminated after day 46 pp. only morning samples were used for progesterone analyses. from day 10 pp, ultrasonography (us) was performed every 3rd day until  day 39 pp for detection of ovarian activity and follicular dynamics. the highest  incidence of bacteriological species was found during the first 3 weeks pp. after the 5th week of collection, all animals were free from bacteria. the species of bacteria found were arcanobacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes, escherichia coli, alpha-hemolytic streptococcae and pasteurella multocida. immediately after parturition, very high levels of the pg-metabolite were seen in all animals, with a sharp decrease to line of significance around days 9-12 pp. small increases above the line of significance were detected up to day 27 pp in cows with rfm, and after that time the levels were considered to be at baseline. low levels of progesterone were seen in four animals during the whole experimental time. in one animal, an increase was seen on day 43 pp, which was maintained until the end of  the experimental period on day 46 pp. based on us, follicular waves were detected in all animals during the experimental period. in three animals, three non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected and in two animals, four non-ovulatory follicular waves were detected during 39 days of ultrasound sessions. based on progesterone levels, only one animal was considered to have ovulated around day 40 pp. results from the present study indicate that reproductive performance of cows after pg-induced parturitions differs from those of spontaneous cases of rfm. differences regarding the resumption of ovarian activity were also observed between previous studies of dexamethasone-induced parturitions and the present study.

TI  == dot assay for determining adhesive interactions between yeasts and bacteria under controlled hydrodynamic conditions.
AB  == candida belongs to the normal human microflora and are found adhering to a number of human body tissues as well as to a variety of biomaterials implants. often, yeasts adhere in association with bacteria, but to date there is no definitive assay to investigate adhesive interactions between yeasts and bacteria adhering on surfaces. although we recently described the use of a parallel plate flow chamber to this purpose [millsap, k.w., bos, r., van der mei, h. c., busscher, h.j., 1998. adhesive interactions between medically important yeasts and bacteria. fems microbiol. rev. 21, 321-336], the method was slow and evaluation of a large number of strains showed major biological variation between experiments. here, we describe a new assay for the simultaneous determination of  the adhesive interactions between yeasts and different bacterial strains on a surface under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. on an acrylic surface, the presence of adhering bacteria suppressed adhesion of candida albicans atcc 10261  to various degrees, depending on the bacterial strain involved. suppression of c. albicans atcc 10261 adhesion was strongest by actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1, while adhering streptococcus gordonii nctc 7869 caused the weakest suppression of yeast adhesion. when adhering yeasts and bacteria were challenged with the high detachment force of a passing liquid-air interface, the majority of the yeasts detached, while c. albicans adhering on the control, bare polymethylmethacrylate  surface formed aggregates. summarizing, this study presents a new method to determine suggested adhesive interactions between yeasts and adhering bacteria under controlled hydrodynamic conditions. however, the results seem to indicate that these adhesive interactions may well not exist, but that instead different bacterial strains have varying abilities to discourage yeast adhesion.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis and arnica montana against oral pathogens.
AB  == arnica and propolis have been used for thousands of years in folk medicine for several purposes. they possess several biological activities such as anti-inflammatory, antifungal, antiviral and tissue regenerative, among others. although the antibacterial activity of propolis has already been demonstrated, very few studies have been done on bacteria of clinical relevance in dentistry. also, the antimicrobial activity of arnica has not been extensively investigated. therefore the aim here was to evaluate in vitro the antimicrobial activity, inhibition of adherence of mutans streptococci and inhibition of formation of water-insoluble glucan by arnica and propolis extracts. arnica montana (10%, w/v) and propolis (10%, w/v) extracts from minas gerais state were compared with controls. fifteen microorganisms were used as follows: candida albicans--ntcc 3736, f72; staphylococcus aureus--atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis--atcc 29212;  streptococcus sobrinus 6715; strep. sanguis--atcc 10556; strep. cricetus--hs-6; strep. mutans--ingbritt 1600; strep. mutans--omz 175; actinomyces naeslundii--atcc 12104, w 1053; act. viscosus omz 105; porphyromonas gingivalis;  porph. endodontalis and prevotella denticola (the last three were clinical isolates). antimicrobial activity was determined by the agar diffusion method and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. to assess cell adherence to a glass surface, the organisms were grown for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30  degree angle. to assay water-insoluble glucan formation, a mixture of crude glucosyltransferase and 0.125 m sucrose was incubated for 18 h at 37 degrees c in test-tubes at a 30 degree angle. arnica and propolis extracts (20 microl) were added to these tubes to evaluate the % of inhibition of cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation. the propolis extract significantly inhibited all the microorganisms tested (p < 0.05), showing the largest inhibitory zone for actinomyces spp. the arnica extract did not demonstrate significant antimicrobial activity. cell adherence and water-insoluble glucan formation were almost completely inhibited by the propolis extract at a final concentration of 400 microg/ml and 500 microg/ml, respectively. the arnica extract showed slight inhibition of the adherence of the growing cells (19% for strep. mutans and 15% for strep. sobrinus) and of water-insoluble glucan formation (29%) at these same  concentrations. thus, the propolis extract showed in vitro antibacterial activity, inhibition of cell adherence and inhibition of water-insoluble glucan formation, while the arnica extract was only slightly active in those three conditions.

TI  == co-aggregation as a virulent factor of streptococcus sanguis isolated from infective endocarditis.
AB  == the pathogenicity of strains of the streptococcus sanguis group, isolated from infective endcarditis, was studied by measuring the development of subcutaneous abscesses in mice after infection with s. sanguis and actinomyces viscosus either singly or as co-aggregated pairs. the pathogenicity of the co-aggregates was also examined in various viable combinations of the two bacterial species. more abscesses were formed by a. viscosus than the s. sanguis group including clinical isolates. abscess formation by co-aggregates of combinations of each isolate and  a. viscosus produced a higher percentage of abscess formation than those caused by infection with a pure suspension of a. viscosus or tested streptococci. co-aggregated cells were more resistant to phagocytosis and killing by neutrophils in vivo. these results indicated that s. sanguis group streptococci isolated from infective endocarditis are able to co-aggregate and resist phagocytosis. the ability of co-aggregation of s. sanguis may serve as a survival mechanism in a host defense system and may be linked with virulence of this bacteria.

AB  == two sisters with diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis of the mandible and the humerus and the synovitis, acne, pustolosis, hyperostosis and osteitis syndrome (sapho syndrome) are presented. the diagnoses of diffuse chronic sclerosing osteomyelitis at the age of 12 years and 27 years, respectively, were based on typical medical history, clinical symptoms and radiographic, histologic and scintigraphic findings. because skin lesions and scintigraphic enhancement of the sternoclavicular joints with hyperostosis were present, a sapho syndrome was diagnosed in both sisters. microbiological cultures of biopsy specimens revealed  coagulase-negative staphylococcus aureus at the humerus and haemophilus parainfluenzae, streptococcus, actinomyces and veilonella species at the mandible. repeated operative procedures, including decortications, resection and  reconstruction, and multiple histologic and microbiologic studies were performed  over a period of up to 20 years. since hla typing yielded identical gene loci, we suggest that hereditary and autoimmune factors may play a role in the pathogenesis of these cases.

TI  == [the effect of removable partial denture on the composition of bacteria on the apt-to-decay site of abutment teeth].
AB  == this study was aimed at the composition of plaques which were on the base teeth's carious sensitive sites, just after the insertion of the removable partial denture (rpd). the results showed that the ratios of bacterial detection in different teeth at the same period and those on the different sites of same teeth at different periods were not significantly different. there was a tendency that  the detection ratio of the stomatococcus at the early period was higher than that of other bacteria, but at the middle period the ratios declined, and at the late  period it was higher again. the detection ratio of the bacillus was on the contrary in the study. at the same time, the composition of the plaques changed significantly after the dentures had been used for 7, 14, and 21 days and 3 months. after 3 months, the ratios of the stomatococcus and the bacillas returned to their normal levels. the 3 main cariogenic bacteria were all detected in this  study. the streptococcus mutant was the dominant bacterium in the plaques and its ratio went up with the time duration. the ratio for the lower second molar was higher than that for the mandibular second premolar (p < 0.05). the detection ratios of the actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus were lower. in conclusion, after the insertion of rpd, the oral microbial ecosystem would be changed and the cariogenic bacteria began to implant on the surface of the base teeth. so rpd is  a potential factor to cause the caries.

TI  == the effect of scaling and root planing on the clinical and microbiological parameters of periodontal diseases: 12-month results.
AB  == background/aims: previously, we reported that srp resulted in a decrease in mean  pocket depth and attachment level and reduced prevalence and levels of bacteroidesforsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and treponema denticola at 3 and  6 months post-srp in 57 subjects with adult periodontitis. 32 of the 57 subjects  were monitored at 9 and 12 months. thus, the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate the microbial and clinical effects of srp in 32 (mean age 48+/-11) subjects over a 12-month period. method: clinical assessments of plaque, gingival redness, suppuration, bleeding on probing, pocket depth and attachment level were made prior to srp and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post-therapy. subgingival plaque samples were taken at each visit and analyzed using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique for the presence and levels of 40 subgingival species. each subject also received maintenance scaling at each of the subsequent monitoring visits. differences in clinical parameters and prevalence and levels of bacterial species were analyzed pre- and post-therapy using the wilcoxon signed ranks test. the quade test for related samples was used for analysis of multiple visits. results: mean pocket depth (mm+/-sem) decreased  from 3.2+/-0.3 at baseline to 2.9+/-0.3 at 12 months (p<0.01). mean attachment level showed significant reduction at 6 months, but did not diminish further. bleeding on probing and plaque were significantly reduced at 12 months (p<0.001,  p<0.05, respectively). p. gingivalis, b. forsythus and t. denticola decreased in  prevalence and levels up to the 6-month visit and remained at these lower levels  at 9 and 12 months. significant increases in levels and prevalence were noted at  12 months for actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, actinomyces odontolyticus, fusobacterium nucleatum ss polymorphum, streptococcus mitis, capnocytophaga sp, and veillonella parvula. conclusions: the data suggest that the maintenance phase of therapy may be essential in consolidating clinical and microbiological improvements achieved as a result of initial therapy.

TI  == development of multi-species consortia biofilms of oral bacteria as an enamel and root caries model system.
AB  == the aim was to establish defined-species consortium plaque biofilms to investigate enamel and root caries in an artificial mouth. strains of the putative enamel and root caries pathogens, streptococcus mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus rhamnosus, were screened in batch culture for potential cariogenic properties: a low terminal ph, ability to aggregate, and catabolic diversity. the strains selected were grown as monoculture biofilms and as consortium plaque biofilms in a multiplaque artificial mouth. the biofilms were supplied with a constant flow of a simulated  oral fluid and were given periodic sucrose (and in some instances glucose) to simulate meals. all the bacteria except l. rhamnosus formed large, monospecies biofilms with resting ph in the range 5.3-5.8. the consortia biofilms were larger and had a resting ph of 4.9-5.3. the consortia biofilms supplied with 8-hourly carbohydrate comprised mainly 'mutans' streptococci (58, sd 5.5%) and l. rhamnosus (42, sd 5.7%). a. naeslundii characteristically was absent or present in a low percentage (up to 4% colony-forming units). all biofilms demineralized polished bovine enamel and dentine blocks, as assessed by microradiography and enamel-surface microhardness measurement. the consortia also demineralized intact enamel and tooth roots; they were more cariogenic to enamel than any of the monoculture biofilms, as measured by enamel-surface softening, but variation in lesion depth was proportional to biofilm wet weight irrespective of acidogen composition (r = 0.93, p < 0.05). enamel lesions had a well-mineralized intact surface and a zone of subsurface demineralization, typical of early natural lesions. dentine and root lesions showed extensive demineralization but lacked a  pronounced surface mineralized zone. substitution of glucose for sucrose had no effect on the cariogenicity of the consortium to bovine enamel or human roots and had no major effect on the plaque composition. continuously supplied fluoride (19 parts/10(6)) resulted in a substantially reduced enamel surface softening and subsurface demineralization of intact roots. it was concluded that consortia biofilms of selected caries pathogens generate realistic caries lesions in all tooth hard tissues under controlled growth conditions in the artificial mouth. this in vitro caries experimental model may prove useful for the study of interrelations between the plaque biofilm, tooth tissues and the oral environment, and for the development of procedures to modify the course of caries development.

TI  == periodontal findings and systemic antibody responses to oral microorganisms in behcet's disease.
AB  == background: behcet's disease is a multisystem disorder of unknown etiology, affecting predominantly the oral mucosa, skin, and eyes. recurrent and painful episodes of oral ulcerations interfere with regular oral hygiene leading to rapid bacterial plaque accumulation. the aims of this study were to evaluate the periodontal status of patients with behcet's disease and determine serum antibody responses to selected oral microorganisms, including major periodontopathogens in these patients. methods: thirty-three patients with behcet's disease and 15 healthy subjects were included in the study. plaque, sulcular bleeding, periodontal index scores, probing depths, and total number of teeth were recorded. serum igg antibody levels to a panel of 13 oral microorganisms were determined. results: significantly higher values for each of the clinical measures were observed in patients with behcet's disease compared to healthy subjects (p <0.0001). antibody levels to selected members of plaque, including actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus  oralis, eikenella corrodens, campylobacter rectus, and prevotella intermedia were significantly lower in patients with behcet's disease than in controls (p <0.001-0.05). in contrast, these patients exhibited significantly elevated antibody levels to actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 compared to controls (p <0.01). conclusions: our data indicate that the patients with behcet's disease generally exhibit clinical findings of established periodontal disease. decreased antibody responses to early colonizers of both supra- and subgingival plaque were observed along with the elevation in antibody levels to a. actinomycetemcomitans. these results suggest that the bacterial plaque ecology and/or immune responses to these microorganisms may be affected in behcet's disease which could lead to changes in the expression of periodontal disease.

AB  == methanol extracts from the bark and wood of ten plants used as chewing sticks in  morogoro region, in tanzania, were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans , actinomyces viscosus and a yeast candida albicans . screening for antimicrobial activity was done by the agar-hole diffusion method, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the agar dilution method. extracts from seven out of the ten plants showed varying degrees of growth inhibitory effect on the microorganisms, with acacia senegal var. senegal stem bark being the most active, followed by the stem bark of eriosema psoraleoides . their mics ranged from 0.63 mg/ml to 5 mg/ml. three plants ocimum suave , opilia celtidifolia and xerophyta suaveolens did not exhibit any antimicrobial effect. actinomyces viscosus was relatively more sensitive to the extracts than s. mutans and c. albicans . this study has also demonstrated that most bark extracts possessed antimicrobial activity, while many wood extracts were inactive. it is, therefore, advisable to use, for toothbrushing, unpeeled, rather than peeled chewing sticks, in order to exploit fully their antimicrobial effect. however, additional studies are needed to determine their antiplaque, anticaries and antimycotic effects.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine the proportion and prevalence  of doxycycline resistant species in subgingival plaque samples taken during and after doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) or control groups (n = 10). saliva samples as  well as subgingival plaque samples taken from the distal surface of 6 posterior teeth were collected at baseline. all subjects received full mouth srp and the test group systemic doxycycline at the dosage of 100 mg/day for 14 days. saliva samples and plaque samples from the distal surface of 2 randomly selected teeth were taken at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. samples were anaerobically dispersed and serially diluted in pras ringer's solution and plated on enriched trypticase soy blood agar plates with or without 4 microg/ml doxycycline. after 7 days of anaerobic incubation, colonies were counted on both sets of plates. microbial growth was washed from the doxycycline-containing media and the species identified using 40 dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. differences in proportions of resistant species between test and control groups were tested for significance at each time point using the mann whitney test and over time within each group using the quade test. the mean % (+/-sem) of isolates resistant to 4 microg/ml doxycycline in the plaque samples of the test subjects increased from 6+/-2 to 48+/-9% during doxycycline administration, decreasing to  25+/-6% 2 weeks later and 9+/-2% at 90 days. in saliva, the % of resistant isolates rose from 13+/-1% to 81+/-10% during doxycycline administration falling  to 46+/-8% 2 weeks later and 22+/-5% at 90 days. the % of resistant isolates did  not change significantly in plaque or saliva samples of the control subjects at the same time points. for all subject visits combined, the most prevalent resistant species were: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, veillonella parvula, actinomyces gerencseriae, streptococcus constellatus, actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus gordonii, eikenella corrodens and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1. doxycycline resistant strains of these  species were detected in both plaque and saliva samples prior to therapy and in the control group. despite the finding of increased resistance, approximately 50% of the organisms present at periodontal sites at the end of 14 days of doxycycline administration tested sensitive to the agent.

TI  == systemic doxycycline administration in the treatment of periodontal infections (i). effect on the subgingival microbiota.
AB  == systemic doxycycline is one of the more common antimicrobial agents used in the treatment of periodontal infections and yet little is known of its effect on subgingival plaque composition during and after its administration. the purpose of the present investigation was to evaluate changes in subgingival plaque composition during and after 14 days of doxycycline administration. 20 subjects with adult periodontitis were randomly assigned to test (n = 10) and control (n = 10) groups. the subjects received full mouth clinical assessment of pocket depth, attachment level, bop, gingival redness, suppuration and plaque accumulation at baseline and 90 days. all subjects received full mouth srp at baseline and, additionally, the test group received 100 mg doxycycline daily for 14 days. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial surface of up to 28 teeth in each subject at baseline and 90 days. in addition, plaque samples were taken from 2 randomly selected teeth at 3, 7 and 14 days during and after antibiotic administration. control subjects were sampled at the same time points. counts of  40 subgingival species were determined using checkerboard dna-dna hybridization and fluorescent detection. significance of differences between test and control groups was determined at each time point using the mann whitney test. significance of changes over time within test and control groups was determined using the quade test. a modest but significant reduction in mean pocket depth from baseline to 90 days occurred in both test and control groups. a significant  decrease in the % of sites with gingival redness occurred in the test group. there were no significant differences in proportions between test and control groups for 33 of the test species at any time point. test subjects exhibited lower proportions of 4 actinomyces species and an increase in 3 streptococcus species during antibiotic administration. after cessation of doxycycline, actinomyces sp. increased while streptococcus sp. returned to baseline proportions. the relationship between these 2 genera appeared to be reciprocal; an increase in one was accompanied by a decrease in the other. periodontal pathogens including b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and a. actinomycetemcomitans were not significantly altered by oral administration of doxycycline using conventional therapeutic dosage.

TI  == effects of mutans streptococci, actinomyces species and porphyromonas gingivalis  on collagen degradation.
AB  == background: while streptococcus mutans and actinomyces spp are considered to be major pathogenic microorganisms of root caries, their roles in the degradation of organic matrix components of human root dentin need clarification. methods: ten laboratory strains and 11 clinical isolates of mutans streptococci and actinomyces species, and positive bacterial or purified enzyme controls (porphyromonas gingivalis whole cell lysates, trypsin or clostridial collagenase) were used to establish the degradation of azocollagen (ac), insoluble type i collagen (ic) or human dentin collagen (dc) from dentin powder in two types of experiments investigating collagenolytic activity either during or after bacterial growth. ultraviolet-irradiated dentin powder and gamma-irradiated ic were used to assess the collagenolytic activity of test strains during bacterial  growth. ac, ic and acid-treated dentin powder were used to determine the collagenolytic activity of sonicated bacterial whole cells and cell-free culture  supernatants recovered from test strains after growth. hydroxyproline or spectrophotometric assays were used to analyze the level of degraded collagen. results: data from this study showed that in contrast to the positive controls, none of the laboratory strains or clinical isolates elicited significant degradation of ac, ic or dc. conclusions: results indicated that mutans streptococci and actinomyces species had no significant collagenolytic activity,  but may be involved in the root caries process through other mechanisms. in addition, proteolytic enzymes from other oral bacteria such as porphyromonas gingivalis or from host cells such as neutrophils may also participate in the pathogenesis of root caries.

TI  == mutans streptococci and other caries-associated acidogenic bacteria in five-year-old children in south africa.
AB  == correlations between mutans streptococci and caries are inconsistent; some studies show that early caries may occur with other bacterial species possessing  the ability to survive, interact and compete with mutans streptococci. this study looked at the relationship between mutans streptococci, lactobacillus, actinomyces and veillonella in saliva and plaque collected from four tooth sites  in two ethnic groups, with and without caries. all samples were collected and cultured onto selective media. colonies were enumerated and identified using biochemical tests. pearson correlations showed low yet statistically significant  correlations between plaque mutans streptococci counts and the number of decayed  surfaces (ds) and decayed, missing and filled surfaces (dmfs) of primary teeth in blacks and in coloreds (historical race classification). salivary mutans streptococci counts correlated with ds and dmfs in coloreds. no relationship was  found between ds, dmfs and lactobacillus, actinomyces or veillonella numbers. significant associations were evident between plaque mutans streptococci and veillonella and lactobacillus in black children with caries and between plaque mutans streptococci and actinomyces and lactobacillus and veillonella in colored  children. hence, oral microbes are in constant flux but have interrelationships in children with caries.

AB  == thirteen teeth with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis and nine severe periodontal pockets were cultured for presence of beta-hemolytic streptococci and other beta-hemolytic organisms. samples were dispersed and plated on two non-selective and one selective growth media and incubated anaerobically and in 10% co2 in air. a total of 59 beta-hemolytic colonies were purified and identified. eight beta-hemolytic streptococcal isolates were obtained from three  of the severe marginal periodontitis sites. all were identified as belonging to the streptococcus sanguis group. no beta-hemolytic streptococci were detected in  apical periodontitis samples. twenty obligately anaerobic isolates were detected, all of which were known periodontal and endodontic pathogens. isolates from apical periodontitis sites were identified as propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces naeslundii, actionomyces odontolyticus and peptostreptococcus micros, while severe marginal periodontal sites contained the same species with the addition of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces meyeri. of 19 staphylococci and  micrococci, staphylococcus epidermidis was the predominant isolate in both apical periodontitis and severe marginal periodontitis sites. however, less commonly known organisms such as staphylococcus cohnii and micrococcus sp. were identified in severe marginal periodontitis sites. the isolation of bacillus sp. (12 isolates) in one severe marginal periodontitis and two apical periodontitis subjects was especially interesting, warranting consideration of this organism as a legitimate isolate and potential pathogen in oral disease.

TI  == powdered milk micellar casein prevents oral colonization by streptococcus sobrinus and dental caries in rats: a basis for the caries-protective effect of dairy products.
AB  == three animal studies were performed to investigate the influence of the macromolecular structure of milk casein on caries incidence and the possible ecological changes of the oral microbiota by such casein fractions. towards this  end, rats were infected with mixed bacterial suspensions of streptococcus sobrinus omz 176 and actinomyces viscosus ny1. various milk protein fractions were incorporated into carefully balanced powdered cariogenic diets to constitute the sole major protein component. diets containing micellar casein had a pronounced and highly significant effect on almost all clinical and microbiological parameters examined. both the formation of advanced dentinal fissure (b) and smooth surface (e) caries lesions was inhibited by diets containing micellar casein; this caries-inhibiting effect appeared to be due mainly to modifications within the plaque microbiota. the proportion of s. sobrinus in the oral cavity of rats was reduced (73-80%) by micellar casein-containing preparations, whereas the a. viscosus population was increased. both these microbiological parameters were always negatively correlated. this appears to be the first example of a food component other than dietary sugars, selectively modifying the composition of the dental plaque microbiota of rats in  such a way as to reduce its pathogenic potential. it also demonstrates the importance of establishing a molecular basis for the role of food components, which prove to be beneficial to oral health.

TI  == molecular pathogenesis of root dentin caries.
AB  == human dentin has a higher content of organic matrix and more non-ideal hydroxyapatite than human enamel. ultrastructural studies indicate that root caries involves both mineral dissolution and breakdown of the organic matrix. factors involved in the root caries process seem more complicated than those in enamel caries. moreover, the distinct roles of acids and enzymes and the sequence of events in the root caries process are not well-understood. although streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus are considered to be major pathogenic micro-organisms of root caries, their roles in degradation of the organic matrix components of root dentin need clarification. the purpose of this  paper is to review the basic composition of root dentin and the roles of acids and both endogenous and bacterial enzymes in the root caries process.

AB  == the aim of the present study was to develop an automated image analysis method to quantify adherence of streptococcus sanguinis or actinomyces viscosus on surfaces of a currently used dental alloy. counting such bacterial strains was difficult because of their arrangement, thus s. sanguinis being a coccus arranged in chains or pairs, and a. viscosus a long complexly arranged polymorph rod. direct counting of fluorescently stained adherent bacteria was done visually and with image analysis methods. to differentiate these two morphotypes, two programs were developed: (i) for streptococci, thresholding and selection of the object maxima, and (ii) for actinomyces, two step thresholding and processing of the characteristic points of the object skeletons. the triplicate enumerations for each bacterial strain were not significantly different (p > 0.005) and correlations between visual counting and automated counting were significant (r = 0.91 for s. sanguinis and r = 0.99 for a. viscosus, p <00.0001). these rapid and  reproducible methods, allowed us to count either cocci or rods, adherent on an inert substratum, in high density conditions.

TI  == an in vitro investigation of the antimicrobial activity of an herbal mouthrinse.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of one prescription and two commercially available over-the-counter mouthrinses and positive and negative controls against bacteria commonly found in the oral cavity. the bacteria used in this study were streptococcus mutans, streptococcus  sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. sterile discs which were treated with the mouthrinses were placed on agar plates along with the controls. zones of microbial inhibition were measured in millimeters after 48 hours. the results indicated that all of the mouthrinses demonstrated antimicrobial activity against the bacteria tested. herbal mouth and gum therapy mouthrinse, containing natural  ingredients, produced the largest zones of microbial inhibition when compared to  listerine against all three of the bacteria tested. herbal mouth and gum therapy  mouthrinse produced larger zones of microbial inhibition when compared to peridex against two of the three bacteria tested, and produced similar zones of inhibition against the third bacteria.

TI  == adhesion and surface-aggregation of candida albicans from saliva on acrylic surfaces with adhering bacteria as studied in a parallel plate flow chamber.
AB  == adhesive interactions between candida albicans and oral bacteria are generally thought to play a crucial role in the microbial colonization of denture acrylic,  which may lead to denture stomatitis. this study investigated the influence of saliva on the adhesive interactions between c. albicans and streptococcus sanguis or actinomyces naeslundii on denture acrylic. first, bacteria were allowed to adhere to the acrylic surface from a flowing suspension, and subsequently yeasts  were flowed over the acrylic surface. the organisms were assayed in the presence  or absence of human whole saliva. all experiments were carried out in a parallel  plate flow chamber and enumeration was done in situ with an image analysis system. in the absence of adhering bacteria, adhesion of c. albicans from buffer  was more extensive than from saliva. however, in the presence of adhering bacteria, yeast adhesion from saliva was increased with respect to adhesion of yeasts from buffer, indicating that specific salivary components constitute a bridge between bacteria and yeasts. in all cases, yeast aggregates consisting of  3 to 5 yeast cells were observed adhering to the surface. a surface physico-chemical analysis of the microbial cell surfaces prior to and after bathing the microorganisms in saliva, suggests that this bridging is mediated by  acid-base interactions since all strains show a major increase in electron-donating surface free energy parameters upon bathing in saliva, with no  change in their zeta potentials. the surface physico-chemical analysis furthermore suggests that s. sanguis and a. naeslundii may use a different mechanism for adhesive interactions with c. albicans in saliva.

TI  == the effect of oral decontamination with clindamycin palmitate on the incidence of bacteremia after esophageal dilation: a prospective trial.
AB  == background: antibiotic prophylaxis to prevent bacterial endocarditis is recommended in high-risk patients undergoing esophageal dilation, a high-risk procedure. some studies suggest that the oropharynx is the source of bacteremia.  a topical antibiotic mouthwash, which reduces bacterial colonization of the oral  flora, might decrease bacteremia rates and would be an attractive alternative to  systemic administration of antibiotics. methods: adults undergoing outpatient bougienage for a benign or malignant esophageal stricture were randomized in a clinician-blinded fashion to either pre-procedure clindamycin mouthwash or no treatment. subjects were stratified by type of dilator used. blood cultures were  obtained immediately after the first esophageal dilation and 5 minutes after the  last dilation. results: fifty-nine patients were enrolled: 30 in the treatment arm and 29 in the no-treatment arm. there were 7 positive blood cultures: 5 in the treatment arm and 2 in the no-treatment arm. the identified organisms were streptococcus viridans (2), staphylococcus mucilaginous (2), lactobacillus (2), and actinomyces odontolyticus (1). patients with bacteremia reported greater subjective difficulty with dysphagia (p = 0.01) irrespective of stricture diameter, procurement of biopsies, or dilator type. conclusions: the percentage of cases with bacteremia for all dilations performed in this manner was 12% (95%  ci [5.3, 23.6]), much lower than previously cited. all organisms in this study were oral commensals. there appears to be no effect of a clindamycin mouthwash on reducing bacteremia after esophageal dilation.

TI  == effect of salivary biofilm on the adherence of oral bacteria to bleached and non-bleached restorative material.
AB  == objective: the objective of this work was to examine the effect of in vitro salivary biofilm on the adherence of oral bacteria to bleached and non-bleached restorative material (charisma). methods: charisma samples, prepared in silicon models, were treated with either 10% carbamide peroxide (cp) or 10% hydrogen peroxide (hp). after incubation with the bleaching agent for a period of one, two or three days, the samples were coated with freshly collected human saliva. the adsorption pattern of the saliva to the restorative material was determined using gel electrophoresis coupled with computerized densitometry techniques. the amount of salivary proteins adsorbed onto the treated surfaces was measured using the bradford method. sucrose-dependent bacterial adhesion to the salivary-coated charisma was tested using radio-labeled streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus. adhesion of each bacterium to surfaces pretreated with the bleaching agents was compared with saliva coated bleached surfaces. results: the profile of salivary proteins adsorption followed a similar pattern in charisma samples pretreated with either cp or hp or untreated samples. however, the total amount of salivary proteins adsorbed onto the samples decreased after bleaching with cp or hp. salivary biofilm, coating the surface of the restorative material, significantly decreased sucrose-dependent adhesion of streptococcus sobrinus and streptococcus mutans to the bleached and non-bleached  surfaces, compared to non-coated specimens (p < 0.05). saliva had a minor effect  on adhesion of actinomyces viscosus. significance: our study demonstrates the importance of salivary biofilm in controlling adhesion of oral bacteria to restorative material pretreated with bleaching agents or untreated.

TI  == distribution of three cariogenic bacteria in secondary carious lesions around amalgam restorations.
AB  == secondary dental caries remains an unresolved problem in dentistry and little is  known of its microbial etiology. the purpose of this study was to compare the distribution of the three most suspected cariogenic groups of bacteria, mutans streptococci. actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 and lactobacilli, in natural secondary caries around amalgam restorations. extracted teeth with secondary caries were sectioned to obtain three samples that were randomly distributed to three different groups. each group was immunolabeled with antibodies to either streptococcus mutans, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 or lactobacillus casei and subsequently labeled with secondary fluorescent antibodies. all samples were analyzed three-dimensionally using confocal microscopy. the results indicated that the three different bacteria were widely present and could have an important role in the development of secondary caries around amalgam restorations.

TI  == the influence of specific foods and oral hygiene on the microflora of fissures and smooth surfaces of molar teeth: a 5-day study.
AB  == a group of 20 students, harbouring >10(4) mutans streptococci per millilitre of saliva, was enrolled into the study. models for sampling, reproducibly, the dental plaque present in specific sites (fissure and smooth surface) on the dentition were developed and validated. withdrawal of normal oral hygiene procedures for only 1 day resulted in approximately 10-fold increases in the number of micro-organisms recovered from both sites. the effect of supplementing  the subjects' diets with particular food items given 5 times per day [lemonade (5.8% w/v sugars, 250 ml), biscuits (digestive biscuits, 67.6% w/w carbohydrate of which 22% w/w was sugars and 45.6% w/w was starch), caramel toffees and sugar  lumps] on the number of micro-organisms recovered and on the composition of the flora at both sites was determined. dental plaque samples were taken after 5 days and it was found that supplementation of the diet with toffee and sugar lumps resulted in significantly more micro-organisms at both sampling sites. the supplementation of the diets with lemonade or biscuits did not significantly alter the numbers of micro-organisms recovered from either site. the percentage composition of the plaque samples from both dental sites remained relatively unaffected by oral hygiene although there were lower levels of mutans streptococci which might be related to the use of an antimicrobial toothpaste containing fluoride, triclosan and zinc citrate. this study suggests that the cariogenicity of certain sucrose-containing foods may, in part, be due to the enhancement of plaque accumulation in addition to other effects on the percentage composition of the plaque which may become manifest on prolonged usage of these dietary foodstuffs. these observations are consistent with dietary survey findings which often find consumption of confectionery related to caries experience or incidence.

TI  == polymicrobial etiology of dental caries.
AB  == the present study was carried out to establish the normal bacterial oral flora and the aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora from deep seated dental caries, and to determine the antimicrobial sensitivity of the clinical isolates so obtained streptococcus mutans (48%) and streptococcus sanguis (20%) were the main aerobic  isolates whereas lactobacillus spp. (52%), veillonella spp. (24%) and actinomyces spp. (12%) were the major anaerobic isolates. hundred percent of the samples from dental caries yielded polymicrobial isolates while in two samples from healthy individuals s. mutans was the sole isolate. as the flora changed from healthy tooth to dental caries it changed from one predominated by anaerobic gram-positive cocci to anaerobic gram-positive bacilli. all the anaerobes isolated were sensitive to metronidazole and cefotaxime, whereas all the isolated streptococci were sensitive to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin. incorporation of the antibiotics in baseline restoration, if technically feasible, has been advocated.

TI  == the effects of histatin-derived basic antimicrobial peptides on oral biofilms.
AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

AB  == on a dairy farm, otitis media was diagnosed in 64 suckler calves (21.8%) during a study period of 2 years, and in 10 calves (3.4%) in the third year. the inflammation was unilateral in 63 and bilateral in 11 calves. the affected calves were dull, lacked appetite, were pyrexic and displayed drooping ear or ears and tilted heads with purulent discharge exuding from the external ear canal. of the  affected animals, 56 (87.5%) were aged between 3 and 8 weeks. morbidity was higher during the calving season and during the autumn and winter months (october-december). pasteurella haemolytica was isolated from 21 (32.8%), p. multocida from 20 (31.2%), actinomyces pyogenes from 11 (17.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae from three (4.7%) of the clinically affected calves only during the first two study years. the exudate of the acute ear infections contained, in addition to pasteurella spp., various bacteria and yeasts. most of these bacteria were isolated from healthy ears as well, and are likely to be part of the normal  ear flora. on the other hand most of the yeasts were isolated from otitic calves. after a short course of an appropriate treatment infections healed in all cases.  possible preventive measures are discussed.

TI  == cell wall-anchored csha polypeptide (259 kilodaltons) in streptococcus gordonii forms surface fibrils that confer hydrophobic and adhesive properties.
AB  == it has been shown previously that inactivation of the csha gene, encoding a major cell surface polypeptide (259 kda) in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii,  generates mutants that are markedly reduced in hydrophobicity, deficient in binding to oral actinomyces species and to human fibronectin, and unable to colonize the oral cavities of mice. we now show further that surface fibrils 60.7 +/- 14.5 nm long, which are present on wild-type s. gordonii dl1 (challis) cells, bind csha-specific antibodies and are absent from the cell surfaces of csha mutants. to more precisely determine the structural and functional properties of  csha, already inferred from insertional-mutagenesis experiments, we have cloned the entire csha gene into the replicative plasmid pam401 and expressed full-length csha polypeptide on the cell surface of heterologous enterococcus faecalis jh2-2. enterococci expressing csha exhibited a 30-fold increase in cell  surface hydrophobicity over e. faecalis jh2-2 carrying the pam401 vector alone and 2.4-fold-increased adhesion to human fibronectin. csha expression in e. faecalis also promoted cell-cell aggregation and increased the ability of enterococci to bind actinomyces naeslundii cells. electron micrographs of negatively stained e. faecalis cells expressing csha showed peritrichous surface  fibrils 70.3 +/- 9.1 nm long that were absent from control e. faecalis jh2-2(pam401) cells. the fibrils bound csha-specific antibodies, as detected by immunoelectron microscopy, and the antibodies inhibited the adhesion of e. faecalis cells to fibronectin. the results demonstrate that the csha polypeptide  is the structural and functional component of s. gordonii adhesive fibrils, and they provide a molecular basis for past correlations of surface fibril production, cell surface hydrophobicity, and adhesion in species of oral "sanguis-like" streptococci.

TI  == insertional inactivation of genes responsible for the d-alanylation of lipoteichoic acid in streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) affects intrageneric coaggregations.
AB  == most human oral viridans streptococci participate in intrageneric coaggregations, the cell-to-cell adherence among genetically distinct streptococci. two genes relevant to these intrageneric coaggregations were identified by transposon tn916 mutagenesis of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis). a 626-bp sequence flanking the left end of the transposon was homologous to dlta and dltb of lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (formerly called lactobacillus casei). a 60-kb probe based on this flanking sequence was used to identify the homologous dna in a fosmid library of s. gordonii dl1. this dna encoded d-alanine-d-alanyl carrier protein ligase that was expressed in escherichia coli from the fosmid clone. the cloned streptococcal dlta was disrupted by inserting an ermam cassette, and then it was  linearized and transformed into s. gordonii dl1 for allelic replacement. erythromycin-resistant transformants containing a single insertion in dlta exhibited a loss of d-alanyl esters in lipoteichoic acid (lta) and a loss of intrageneric coaggregation. this phenotype was correlated with the loss of a 100-kda surface protein reported previously to be involved in mediating intrageneric coaggregation (c. j. whittaker, d. l. clemans, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 64:4137-4142, 1996). the mutants retained the parental ability to participate in intergeneric coaggregation with human oral actinomyces, indicating the specificity of the mutation in altering intrageneric  coaggregations. the mutants were altered morphologically and exhibited aberrant cell septa in a variety of pleomorphs. the natural dna transformation frequency was reduced 10-fold in these mutants. southern analysis of chromosomal dnas from  various streptococcal species with the dlta probe revealed the presence of this gene in most viridans streptococci. thus, it is hypothesized that d-alanyl lta may provide binding sites for the putative 100-kda adhesin and scaffolding for the proper presentation of this adhesin to mediate intrageneric coaggregation.

TI  == the importance of fimbriae in the virulence and ecology of some oral bacteria.
AB  == cumulative evidence indicates that bacterial adherence to mucosal and tooth surfaces as well as bacterial coaggregation are essential steps for colonization  of various oral bacterial species. bacterial fimbriae have been shown to play an  important role in the interaction between bacteria and host cells or among bacterial cells. the properties of fimbriae from selected species of oral bacteria are discussed in terms of virulence traits and ecological significance.  among others, porphyromonas gingivalis fimbriae have been most extensively studied. the fimbrial structure is composed of 41-kda fimbrillin proteins. dna sequencing of the fimbrillin gene (fima) from nine strains of p. gingivalis suggests intraspecies variation in the structure of fima, while retaining common  immunochemical specificities. p. gingivalis fimbriae exhibit a wide variety of biological activities including immunogenicity, binding to various host proteins, stimulation of cytokine production and promotion of bone resorption, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans also possesses fimbriae; however, little is  known concerning their chemical, genetical, and biological properties. fimbriae of prevotella intermedia are shown to induce hemagglutination reaction, while those of prevotella loescheii are found to cause coaggregation with other bacteria, i.e., actinomyces viscosus and sanguis streptococci. fimbriae from gram-positive oral bacteria such as oral actinomyces and sanguis streptococci are described. these fimbriae may participate in coaggregation, binding to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite or glycoprotein of the surface layer of oral epithelial cells. taken together, fimbriae are key components in cell-to-surface  and cell-to-cell adherence of oral bacteria and pathogenesis of some oral and systemic diseases.

TI  == clinical and microbiological characteristics of smokers with early onset periodontitis.
AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

AB  == the intraperitoneal immunization of balb/c mice with subgingival plaque from advanced periodontal pockets or with certain strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces israelii, streptococcus mitis, or streptococcus oralis yielded frequently indistinguishable igm monoclonal antibodies which were reactive with antigens from a variety of oral bacteria. this study aimed to characterize the specificity of such monoclonal antibodies and the diversity of oral bacteria expressing this target antigen or epitope. using a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study a variety of competitor substances for their capacity to bind to the monoclonal antibodies, we identified phosphorylcholine as the recognized epitope. the concentration of positive bacteria with extraordinarily bright cell wall fluorescence in indirect immunofluorescence assays varied between 0.1% and 15% in subgingival and from 10 to 40% in supragingival plaque samples. labeled bacteria  belonged to different morphotypes, including cocci, rods, and filaments. of 75 species tested in vitro, 14 gram-positive and four gram-negative species were found to harbor positive strains. haemophilus aphrophilus, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces georgiae, actinomyces gerencseriae, actinomyces israelii, and actinomyces odontolyticus were human oral species of which all tested strains were capable of binding the cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies. in contrast, actinomyces naeslundii was consistently negative. these data provide evidence for a much more common expression of phosphorylcholine by oral bacteria than hitherto believed but do not indicate an obvious association of phosphorylcholine expression with oral health or inflammatory periodontal diseases.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of amalgams, alloys and their elements and phases.
AB  == objectives: this in vitro study aimed to evaluate the antibacterial effect of amalgams, alloys, elements and phases against two cariogenic bacteria, actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans. methods: test materials comprised: (i) commercial amalgams comprising amalcap (vivadent), cavex avalloy lc and dp (cavex), cupromuc (merz), fluoralloy and synalloy (dentoria); (ii) ag-cu alloy; (iii) gamma, gamma 1, gamma 2 and cu6sn5 phases; (iv) pure metal samples and chloride solutions of copper, mercury, tin and zinc; and (v) aqueous sodium fluoride. bacterial suspensions of each of the two bacteria were grown in the presence of the test materials for 24 h. antimicrobial effectiveness was assessed by measuring reduction in optical density at 640 nm using a visible spectrophotometer. results: cupromuc/fluoralloy, non gamma 2 amalgams and amalcap displayed high, moderate and no antibacterial activity, respectively. antibacterial effectiveness was not related to copper content. whereas mercury, copper, ag-cu alloy, fluoride and zinc showed antibacterial activity (hg > cu > f > zn), tin, gamma phases and cu6sn5 showed no such activity. significance: although the fluoride and copper solutions were most effective at 50 micrograms ml-1 concentration, their antibacterial action was still significant, albeit reduced, at 10 micrograms ml-1 concentration. this was not the case for mercury chloride which was just as effective at both concentrations. our results show that although mercury and copper contribute significantly to the antibacterial properties of amalgams, a high copper content does not necessarily relate to high antibacterial effectiveness. these elements could be useful in conferring antibacterial properties to amalgam although their effects on host cells must be  investigated.

AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf) reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and the specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase enzyme (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, periodontal sites (4 sites/patient) with a probing depth of > or =5 mm in early onset periodontitis (eop) patients were first examined for the ast levels in gcf by the periogard periodontal tissue monitor. to be eligible for the study, each of the patients had at least 1 ast positive site with clinical inflammatory changes (ast+, cic+)  and 1 ast negative site with no or minimum clinical inflammatory changes (ast-, cic-). in 15 eop patients who met the entry criteria, 30 ast+, cic+ sites (1st group) and 19 ast-, cic- sites (2nd group) were evaluated for microbiological variables. certain microbial species, including porphyromonas gingivalis, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and prevotella intermedia were detected more frequently (p<0.001, p<0.001 and p<0.05, respectively) in the 1st group, while gram-positive facultative organisms such as actinomyces species were found more often (p<0.001) in the 2nd group. parallel to the ast levels, the 2nd group had a lower number of total bacteria and proportion of obligate anaerobic and capnophilic micro-organisms than the first group (p<0.05 and p<0.05, respectively). within the scope of this study, ast activity and microbiological data were found in agreement in the examined groups. these findings are encouraging and indicate the need for further studies to evaluate the ability of  the ast test to differentiate the microbial flora of progressing sites and those  that are inflamed, but not progressing.

TI  == a synthetic peptide adhesion epitope as a novel antimicrobial agent.
AB  == the earliest step in microbial infection is adherence by specific microbial adhesins to the mucosa of the oro-intestinal, nasorespiratory, or genitourinary tract. we inhibited binding of a cell surface adhesin of streptococcus mutans to  salivary receptors in vitro, as measured by surface plasmon resonance, using a synthetic peptide (p1025) corresponding to residues 1025-1044 of the adhesin. two residues within p1025 that contribute to binding (q1025, e1037) were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. in an in vivo human streptococcal adhesion model, direct application of p1025 to the teeth prevented recolonization of s. mutans but not actinomyces, as compared with a control peptide or saline. this novel antimicrobial strategy, applying competitive peptide inhibitors of adhesion, may  be used against other microorganisms in which adhesins mediate colonization of mucosal surfaces.

TI  == actinomyces serovar wva963 coaggregation-defective mutant strain pk2407 secretes  lactose-sensitive adhesin that binds to coaggregation partner streptococcus oralis 34.
AB  == actinomyces serovar wva963 strain pk1259 mediates intergeneric coaggregation with several oral streptococci. these lactose-inhibitable coaggregations appear to involve a 95-kda putative actinomyces adhesin in complex with type 2 fimbriae. a  coaggregation-defective strain pk2407 lacking type 2 fimbriae synthesizes the putative adhesin but appears unable to present it properly on its surface. antiserum was raised against surface sonicates of pk2407 and was absorbed with a  different coaggregation-defective mutant pk3092 that synthesizes type 2 fimbriae  but no adhesin. this absorbed antiserum specifically blocked lactose-inhibitable  coaggregation of wild-type strain pk1259 and streptococcus oralis 34 and identified a 95-kda protein in ammonium sulfate precipitates of culture supernatant of the coaggregation-defective mutant pk2407. the 95-kda secreted protein was bound to the streptococcal partner cells and to lactose-agarose affinity beads and was released by lactose from both the affinity beads and partner, indicating that the secreted and precipitated protein is biochemically active and may mediate coaggregation with streptococci.

TI  == bacterial adherence to bleached surfaces of composite resin in vitro.
AB  == objective: the effect of bleaching agents on bacterial adherence to polished surfaces of composite resin restorations was assessed in vitro. study design: samples of light-curing composite resins were treated with either 10% carbamide peroxide or 10% hydrogen peroxide for 1, 3, or 7 days. bacterial adherence of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, and actinomyces viscosus to the treated resin samples was analyzed and compared with adherence to nonbleached controls. results: a 10% solution of carbamide peroxide caused a significant increase in surface adherence of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus  after 3 days (p < .01). a 10% solution of hydrogen peroxide caused a significant  increase in surface adherence of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus  after 3 and 7 days (p < .01). a decrease in adherence of actinomyces viscosus was found after treatment with 10% hydrogen peroxide for 7 days (p < .05). conclusions: it appears that bleaching agents may affect adherence of certain cariogenic microorganisms to the outer surfaces of composite resin restorations.

TI  == microorganisms in closed periapical lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the microorganisms of strictly selected closed periapical lesions associated with both refractory endodontic therapy and pulpal calcification. definitive criteria were established that assured complete clinical isolation of the periapical lesion from the oral and periodontal environment. a total of 13 criteria-referenced lesions were selected  from 70 patients with endodontic surgical indications. a well controlled culturing method was used in all cases and samples were taken by one clinician at three separate sites during each surgery. samples taken at the surgical window and within the body of the lesion served as controls, whilst a third sample was taken at the apex. in all 13 cases, samples taken from the apex yielded microorganisms comprising 63.6% obligate anaerobes and 36.4% facultative anaerobes. prevalence of the isolated species was 31.8% for actinomyces sp., 22.7% propionibacterium sp., 18.2% streptococcus sp., 13.6% staphlyococcus sp., 4.6% porphyromonas gingivalis, 4.6% peptostreptococcus micros and 4.6% gram-negative enterics. the results of this investigation indicate that closed periapical lesions associated with calcified teeth or those resistant to root canal treatment harbour bacteria. the inability to eradicate all root canal microorganisms during root canal treatment, along with anatomical factors, may allow further bacterial colonization of the root apex and surrounding periapical  tissues, and consequently prevent healing.

TI  == bacterial eradication from root dentine by ultrasonic irrigation with sodium hypochlorite.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate intracanal irrigation procedures in eradicating bacteria from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine using extracted human teeth. artificial bacterial smear layer was successfully produced by rubbing a mixture of dental plaque and artificially decalcified dentine or carious dentine on root canal walls. the reservoir holes were 3.5 mm in depth, 1  mm in diameter prepared 1.5 mm apart and parallel to the root canals on the decrowned planes, in which five separate bacterial species were placed (actinomyces israelii, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis). bacterial eradication after irrigation of the prepared canals was determined by bacterial recovery (i) from the root canal surfaces and shallow layers where bacteria were smeared artificially and (ii) from deeper layers of root canal dentine reservoir holes. ultrasonic irrigation with 5.5% and 12% naocl eradicated bacteria from artificial smear layer (p < 0.0001), whilst 12% naocl irrigation with a syringe was insufficient. ultrasonic irrigation with water or 15% edta-failed to eradicate bacteria from smeared surfaces. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl killed a. israelii, f. nucleatum, p. acnes, s. mutans, and s. sanguis placed in reservoir channels, although for f. nucleatum, a very small number of bacteria remained in  five samples out of 12. ultrasonic irrigation with less concentrated naocl failed to eliminate bacteria completely from reservoir channels in most samples. ultrasonic irrigation with 12% naocl appeared to eliminate bacteria efficiently from surface, shallow and deep layers of root dentine.

AB  == purpose: to determine and compare the in vitro antibacterial activity of three self-etching primers. materials and methods: lb primer (liner bond 2), fb primer  (fluoro bond), and mb conditioner (tokuso mac bond) were evaluated. the antibacterial activity against streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces viscosus was assessed using the agar disc-diffusion method. twenty microliters of each primer were impregnated into a paper disc and placed on a brain heart infusion agar plate inoculated with a bacterial suspension. the size  of inhibition zones produced around the specimens was measured after 48 hours of  incubation of the plate. in addition, 20 microliters of each primer was added to  a 1 ml suspension of s. mutans adjusted to 1 x 10(6), 1 x 10(5), or 1 x 10(4) cfu/ml in phosphate buffered saline and kept in contact for 30 seconds. the number of viable bacteria after contact with each primer was determined. the results were analyzed by anova and fisher's plsd test (p < 0.05). results: lb primer and fb primer produced inhibition zones against s. mutans and a. viscosus, and mb conditioner produced an inhibition zone only against a. viscosus. no inhibition zones were produced by any of the primers against l. casei. the three  primers completely killed 1 x 10(4) cfu of s. mutans within 30 seconds of contact. when 1 x 10(5) or 1 x 10(6) cfu of bacterial cells were kept in contact, significant differences in the number of recovered viable cells were found among  the three primers with mb conditioner being the most bactericidal. lb primer had  little bactericidal activity and the mean reduction of viable bacteria by fb primer and mb conditioner was approximately 30% and 65%, respectively.

TI  == retention of oral microorganisms on cobalt-chromium alloy and dental acrylic resin with different surface finishes.
AB  == statement of problem: the effect of surface finish of dental materials on the subsequent contamination by microorganisms. purpose: this study compared the retention of streptococcus oralis, actinomyces viscosus, and candida albicans on  polished, sandblasted (fine and coarse) and electrobrightened cobalt-chromium alloy and dental acrylic resin to assess in vitro the effect of such techniques on prosthesis contamination. material and methods: standardized cell suspensions  were incubated with test materials for 1 hour at 37 degrees c, after which retained cells were counted by using image analysis (percentage area of a microscopic field covered by cells). results: retention of bacterial cells was substantial (s oralis 12% to 20% and a viscosus 9% to 16%) irrespective of surface finish. maximal retention was observed on cobalt-chromium alloy that had  undergone fine sandblasting and electrobrightening (p < .01). for c albicans, an  increase in surface roughness (0.15 to 3.53 microns) resulted in an increase in retention (3% to 9%). conclusion: cell size and the type of roughening significantly affected the retention of microorganisms on surfaces. electrobrightening of cobalt-chromium alloy did not reduce the surface roughness  or subsequent cell attachment.

TI  == the microflora associated with human oral carcinomas.
AB  == both local and systemic infections may complicate the morbidity of patients with  oral malignant neoplasms, particularly those presenting intraorally. this study investigated the microbial contents of the biofilms present on the surfaces of oral squamous cell carcinomas. biofilm samples were obtained from the central surface of the lesions in 21 patients (20 male, 1 female) aged 52.8 (+/- 8.2) years, and from contiguous healthy mucosa, before any antibiotic therapy or any tumour treatment. all lesions were keratinising squamous cell carcinomas with surface ulceration. samples were transported in reduced brain heart infusion (bhi) broth and cultured within 1 h of removal, using aerobic and anaerobic complete and selective media. the median number of anaerobic colony forming units (cfu/ml) at the tumour sites (1.6 x 10(8)) was significantly higher than for the  healthy (control) mucosa (3.0 x 10(7); p = 0.0001, wilcoxon); the same was true for aerobes at the tumour sites (1.51 x 10(8)) relative to the controls (2.8 x 10(7); p = 0.0008, wilcoxon). the species isolated in increased numbers at tumour sites were veillonella, fusobacterium, prevotella, porphyromonas, actinomyces and clostridium (anaerobes), and haemophilus, enterobacteriaceae and streptococcus spp. (aerobes). candida albicans was found at eight of the 21 tumour sites, but never at control sites. it was concluded that human oral carcinoma surface biofilms harbour significantly increased numbers of aerobes and anaerobes as compared with the healthy mucosal surface of the same patient. candida albicans can also be present in these biofilms. these findings must be considered in relation to the known predisposition of such patients to systemic infections, and to the unpleasant complications of oral morbidity due to infected lesions.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == role of fusobacterium nucleatum and coaggregation in anaerobe survival in planktonic and biofilm oral microbial communities during aeration.
AB  == coaggregation is a well-characterized phenomenon by which specific pairs of oral  bacteria interact physically. the aim of this study was to examine the patterns of coaggregation between obligately anaerobic and oxygen-tolerant species that coexist in a model oral microbial community. obligate anaerobes other than fusobacterium nucleatum coaggregated only poorly with oxygen-tolerant species. in contrast, f. nucleatum was able to coaggregate not only with both oxygen-tolerant and other obligately anaerobic species but also with otherwise-noncoaggregating obligate anaerobe-oxygen-tolerant species pairs. the effects of the presence or absence of f. nucleatum on anaerobe survival in both the biofilm and planktonic phases of a complex community of oral bacteria grown in an aerated (gas phase, 200 ml of 5% co2 in air x min-1) chemostat system were then investigated. in the  presence of f. nucleatum, anaerobes persisted in high numbers (>10(7) x ml-1 in the planktonic phase and >10(7) x cm-2 in 4-day biofilms). in an equivalent culture in the absence of f. nucleatum, the numbers of black-pigmented anaerobes  (porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella nigrescens) were significantly reduced (p </= 0.001) in both the planktonic phase and in 4-day biofilms, while the numbers of facultatively anaerobic bacteria increased in these communities. coaggregation-mediated interactions between f. nucleatum and other species facilitated the survival of obligate anaerobes in aerated environments.

TI  == binding properties of streptococcus gordonii sspa and sspb (antigen i/ii family)  polypeptides expressed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363.
AB  == the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii expresses two cell wall-associated polypeptides, designated sspa (1,542 amino acid residues) and sspb (1,462 amino acid residues), that have 70% sequence identity. these polypeptides are members of the antigen i/ii family of oral streptococcal adhesins and mediate the binding of streptococci to salivary glycoproteins, collagen, and other oral microorganisms such as actinomyces naeslundii. to determine if sspa and sspb have differential binding properties, the coding sequences of the sspa and sspb genes  were cloned into expression plasmid vector ptrex1-usp45ls to generate ptrex1-sspa and ptrex1-sspb, respectively, and the ssp polypeptides were displayed on the cell surface of lactococcus lactis mg1363. lactococcal cells expressing similar levels of surface sspa or sspb polypeptide were then compared for their abilities to adhere to a range of antigen i/ii polypeptide substrates. more than twice as many l. lactis cells expressing sspa bound to immobilized salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag) as did l. lactis cells expressing sspb. in contrast, lactococci expressing sspb adhered twice as well as lactococci producing sspa to  collagen type i and to candida albicans. the binding of a. naeslundii to lactococci was only weakly enhanced by surface expression of ssp polypeptides. l. lactis(ptrex1-sspb) cells bound in greater numbers to sag than did enterococcus faecalis jh2-2 cells expressing sspb from pam401eb-5. the results suggest that sspa and sspb have markedly different binding affinities for their oral substrates and thus may function to promote site diversity in colonization by s.  gordonii.

AB  == the present study primarily aimed at investigating the oral microbiota in smokers and non-smokers with established gingivitis and monitoring its composition during experimental gingivitis. secondly, it aimed at examining whether the composition  of the microbiota is associated with different levels of gingival inflammation during this experimental gingivitis trial. for this purpose, 25 non-dental university students with gingivitis were recruited. 11 subjects were smokers and  14 were non-smokers. after achieving gingival health, they entered a 14-day experimental gingivitis trial. plaque and bleeding were assessed before entering  into the study (intake), at day 0, day 5 and at day 14 of the experiment. microbiological samples from mucosal sites and dental plaque (taken at intake, day 0, and day 14) were analysed for the presence of actinomyces species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, peptostreptococcus micros, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and streptococcus species. at day 14 of the experimental period, the level of plaque formation was not different between smokers and non-smokers, but bleeding scores were lower in smokers than in non-smokers (15% and 30% respectively, p=0.01). the change from natural gingivitis to a state of gingival health and a subsequent change from gingival health to experimentally induced gingivitis was accompanied by quantitative alterations in the cultivable microbiota in both groups. changes were most prominent in the transition from gingival health to experimental gingivitis and were found in dental plaque for actinomyces species, c. rectus, f. nucleatum, and p. intermedia. within the group of non-smokers, a distinction was made between subjects with a 'weak' or 'strong' inflammatory response. no relationship with a  single bacterial species could be established which would likely explain the differences in levels of inflammation. it is concluded that differences in response to experimental gingivitis are not caused by major differences in the composition of the oral microbiota.

TI  == actinomyces naeslundii displays variant fimp and fima fimbrial subunit genes corresponding to different types of acidic proline-rich protein and beta-linked galactosamine binding specificity.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 1 and 2 bind to acidic proline-rich proteins (aprps) and statherin via type 1 fimbriae and to beta-linked galactosamine (galnacbeta) structures via type 2 fimbriae. in addition, a. naeslundii displays  two types of binding specificity for both aprps-statherin and galnacbeta, while actinomyces odontolyticus binds to unknown structures. to study the molecular basis for these binding specificities, dna fragments spanning the entire or central portions of fimp (type 1) and fima (type 2) fimbrial subunit genes were amplified by pcr from strains of genospecies 1 and 2 and hybridized with dna from two independent collections of oral actinomyces isolates. isolates of genospecies 1 and 2 and a. odontolyticus, but no other actinomyces species, were positive for hybridization with fimp and fima full-length probes irrespective of binding to aprps and statherin, galnacbeta, or unknown structures. isolates of genospecies 1 and 2, with deviating patterns of galnacbeta1-3galalpha-o-ethyl-inhibitable coaggregation with streptococcus oralis ss34 and mpb1, were distinguished by a fima central probe from genospecies 1 and 2, respectively. furthermore, isolates  of genospecies 1 and 2 displaying preferential binding to aprps over statherin were positive with a fimp central probe, while a genospecies 2 strain with the opposite binding preference was not. the sequences of fimp and fima central gene  segments were highly conserved among isolates with the same, but diversified between those with a variant, binding specificity. in conclusion, a. naeslundii exhibits variant fimp and fima genes corresponding to diverse aprp and galnacbeta specificities, respectively, while a. odontolyticus has a genetically related but distinct adhesin binding specificity.

TI  == antibacterial effects of a bioactive glass paste on oral microorganisms.
AB  == bioactive glasses contain oxides of calcium, sodium, phosphorus, and silicon in a proportion that provides the material with surface activity and concomitantly with the property of forming a strong bond with bone. bioactive glasses have been tested as bone substitutes in different clinical situations. in an aqueous environment, ca2+, na+, po4(3-) , and si4+ are released from the glass, resulting in a rise in ph and in osmotic pressure in its vicinity. since these are factors  that potentially influence the viability of oral microorganisms at the dentogingival margin, we studied the effects of bioactive glass s53p4 on the oral microorganisms actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. this was done by incubating each microbe in a suspension, in the presence of bioactive glass s53p4 in powder form. a. naeslundii was found to lose its viability within  10 min under the experimental conditions. a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and s. mutans lost their viability within 60 min. also for s. sanguis a significant loss of viability was seen within 60 min, but it was the only microbe that had any viable cells left after 60 min. thus, in aqueous solutions the powdered bioactive glass s53p4 appears to have a broad antimicrobial effect on microorganisms of both supra- and subgingival plaque. consequently, it could be useful as an ingredient in tooth-care products that may have beneficial effects on oral health both from a cariologic and a periodontal point of view.

"oral health for a healthy life" proposed for the 1994 world health day. in this report, the efficacy of antimicrobial mouth rinses, mainly listerine, was reviewed by three investigators who are working as a microbiologist, a microbiologist, a dentist, and a dental hygienist participating in oral health care. listerine, an antimicrobial mouth rinse, completely killed microorganisms in 10 to 30 seconds; the microbes includes methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, helicobacter pylori, candida albicans, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. listerine was also weakly effective in inactivating human immunodeficiency viruses. bacteria in samples collected from human dental plaque and saliva were completely killed within 30 seconds when exposed to listerine. when saliva samples were collected from subjects who had rinsed their mouths with 20 ml of listerine or 1:50 diluted povidone-iodine, levels of viable anaerobic bacteria in the samples were reduced  to 1%. when listerine was used for oral surgery such as tooth extraction and periodontal surgery, the agent was effective in relieving toothache. this was probably due to a decrease in oral bacteria by the antimicrobial action of listerine, leading to lowering the inflammatory response of the host. the use of  antimicrobial mouth rinse during dental treatments such as endodontic treatment proved effective for more reliable infection control. in japan, there are an increasing number of elderly and medically compromised hosts who are potentially  at risk for developing pneumonia due to silent aspiration of microbes in the oral cavity and throat. for the aged with such potential risk, using of antimicrobial  mouth rinse may be effective in preventing dental plaque accumulation when used in addition to the mechanical control of plaque, since they tend to have difficulty in brushing teeth by themselves. indeed, the use of antimicrobial mouth rinse in these elderly people proved useful not only in preventing bacterial pneumonia, but also in improving their quality of life by preserving their oral health.

TI  == subgingival microbiota in healthy, well-maintained elder and periodontitis subjects.
AB  == this investigation compared the site prevalence of 40 subgingival species in 30 periodontally healthy (mean age 36+/-9 years), 35 elders with a well-maintained periodontium (mean age 77+/-5) and 138 adult periodontitis subjects (mean age 46+/-11). subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth (up to 28 samples) in the 203 subjects at baseline. the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 5003 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments including dichotomous measures of gingival redness, bleeding on probing, plaque accumulation and suppuration, as well as duplicate measures of pocket depth and attachment level, were made at 6 sites per tooth. the % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject. differences in prevalence and levels among groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis test. commonly detected species, such as actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2, streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus oralis did not differ significantly among subject groups. after adjusting for multiple comparisons, 4 species were significantly elevated and at greater prevalence in the periodontitis group. mean % of sites (+/-sem) colonized by bacteroides forsythus was 10+/-3, 12+/-2 and 40+/-2 (p<0.001) for healthy, elder and periodontitis groups respectively. the odds ratio was 14.4:1 that a subject had periodontitis when b. forsythus was detected at > or = 5% of sampled sites. mean prevalence for porphyromonas gingivalis in healthy, elder and periodontitis subjects was 4+/-2, 5+/-2 and 23+/-2 respectively (p<0.001); for treponema denticola 12+/-4, 10+/-3 and 30+/-2  (p<0.001) and for selenomonas noxia 6+/-2, 7+/-2 and 19+/-2 (p<0.01). similar differences among subject groups were observed when only sites with pd 0-4 mm were analyzed. the data suggest an etiologic role for b. forsythus, p. gingivalis, t. denticola and s. noxia in adult periodontitis.

TI  == the effect of herbal extracts in an experimental mouthrinse on established plaque and gingivitis.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to establish in vitro the inhibiting effect  of a herbal extract mixture on a selected number of micro-organisms and to test in vivo the effect of a mouthwash containing 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture on  plaque and gingivitis as compared to a minus active control mouthrinse. the herbal extract was a mixture of: juniperus communis (juniper), urtica dioca (nettle), achillaea millefolium (yarrow); 1:1:1. in the study, in-vitro, the effect of pure herbal extract mixture on acid production of streptococcus mutans  was tested and the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of the following micro-organisms were tested: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actynomyces viscosus, actynomyces naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, fusobacterium nucleatum, veillonella parvula. the mic-values for a. viscosus and p. gingivalis  were 100 mg/ml. the mic-values for a. naeslundii and a. actinomycetemcomitans were considerably lower (10 mg/ml). s. mitis was the most susceptible of the tested organisms to the extract with a mic value of 1 mg/ml. s. mutans, c. rectus, v. parvula, and f. nucleatum were not influenced by the extracts. no inhibitory effect of the 6.3 mg/ml herbal extract mixture was observed on the acid production of s. mutans. for the study in-vivo, 45 volunteers were selected  on the basis of having moderate gingival inflammation. as efficacy parameters the plaque index, modified gingival index and angulated bleeding index were assessed. the subjects were randomly divided among 3 experimental groups (2x test and 1 'minus active' control). the participants were requested to rinse with 10 ml of mouthwash twice a day for a period of three months. after 6 weeks and 3 months, the same clinical indices as at baseline were recorded. the results show no difference between the two test groups and the control group. in conclusion, the  results of the present study have shown that the mixture of the 3 herbal extracts, juniperus communis, urtica dioca and achillaea millefolium when used in a mouthrinse has no effect on plaque growth and gingival health.

TI  == increasing parasitism by the german yellow jacket wasp, paravespula germanica, on dairy cattle in israel.
AB  == during the past two decades, parasitism by the german yellow jacket wasp, paravespula germanica, on lactating dairy cattle has occurred in israel during august to october annually, affecting up to 65% of cows in certain herds. the nibbled and exposed tissues of teats and sometimes udders become infested by bacteria, especially streptococcus dysgalactiae and actinomyces pyogenes, causing clinical and subclinical mastitis. normally, german wasps are primarily insect predators, but the urbanization around many dairy farms has reduced open space and associated standard food sources, i.e. insects, plants and carcasses. this has resulted in p. germanica nesting more often on dairy farms. in some instances, when high densities of p. germanica correspond with scarcity of prey,  a segment of the wasp population preys primarily on the older and heavier cows with weak defensive behaviour. the teat feeding colonies of p. germanica may have an advantage, in that they are less dependent on fluctuations in the number of prey insects.

TI  == binding properties of streptococcal glucosyltransferases for hydroxyapatite, saliva-coated hydroxyapatite, and bacterial surfaces.
AB  == the binding specificities of streptococcus glucosyltransferase (gtf) b, c and d for hydroxyapatite (ha), saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha), and bacterial surfaces were examined. for ha beads the following values were obtained: (k = affinity; n = number of binding sites) gtfb, k = 46 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.65 x  10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 86 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 4.42 x 10(-6) mumol/m2.; gtfd, k = 100 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 0.83 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. for sha beads, the following values were obtained: gtfb, k = 14.7 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 1.03 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfc, k = 21.3 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 3.66 x 10(-6) mumol/m2; gtfd, k = 1.73 x 10(5) ml/mumol, n = 8.88 x 10(-6) mumol/m2. the binding of gtfb  to sha beads was reduced in the presence of parotid saliva, but the binding of gtfc and d was unaffected. the binding of gtfb to sha in the presence of parotid  saliva supplemented with gtfc and d was reduced when compared with its binding to sha in the presence of parotid saliva alone. in contrast, te binding of gtfc and  sha was unaffected when parotid saliva was supplemented with the other gtf enzymes. gtfb bound to several bacterial strains (strep, mutans gs-5, actinomyces viscosus omz105e and lactobacillus casei 4646) in an active form, while gtfc and  d did not bind to bacterial surfaces. it is concluded that of the three gtf enzymes, gtfc has the highest affinity for ha and sha surfaces and can adsorb on  the the sha surface in the presence of the other two enzymes. gtfd also binds to  sha in the presence of the other enzymes but has a very low affinity for the surface. gtfb does not bind to sha in the presence of the other gtf enzymes but binds avidly to bacterial surfaces in an active form. therefore, gtfc most probably binds to apatitic surfaces, while gtfb binds to bacterial surfaces.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentine primer containing mdpb after curing.
AB  == objectives: a monomer methacryloyloxydodecylpyridinium bromide (mdpb) has antibacterial activity before polymerization. furthermore, the antibacterial agent is immobilized by the polymerization of mdpb and the resin-based material incorporating mdpb is able to show an antibacterial effect even after being cured. the purpose of this study was to investigate the antibacterial effect of a dentine primer containing mdpb after curing. methods: the inhibitory effect of a  cured mdpb-containing primer on the growth of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and lactobacillus casei was determined by the agar-disc method. the bactericidal activity of cured primer during a 1-h contact period was assessed using s. mutans, and the elution of unpolymerized mdpb was measured with high performance liquid chromatography. results: cured mdpb-containing primer showed an inhibitory effect on the growth of all species which were in contact with the  specimen surface, and displayed a little bactericidal effect on s. mutans without releasing any unpolymerized antibacterial components. conclusion: incorporation of antibacterial monomer mdpb into dentine primer is beneficial for providing antibacterial activity after curing.

TI  == characterization of a novel n-acetylneuraminic acid-specific fusobacterium nucleatum pk1594 adhesin.
AB  == fusobacterium nucleatum has been identified as significantly associated with sites with active periodontal disease and, as a group, the oral fusobacteria coaggregate with members of all oral bacteria genera tested. monoclonal antibodies were prepared and used in conjunction with other potential inhibitors, such as simple sugars and amino acids, to characterize coaggregation interactions, of f. nucleatum pk1594. four unique monoclonal antibodies, 5h11, 14c7, 19f2 and 29c12, were obtained by their ability to inhibit coaggregation of  f. nucleatum pk1594 with actinomyces israelii pk16. they were also capable of inhibiting other coaggregations including streptococcus oralis h1, s. oralis j22, capnocytophaga ochracea atcc33596, prevotella denticola pk1277 and prevotella intermedia pk1511. all of these interactions were completely inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid. neither n-acetylneuraminic acid nor monoclonal antibody  5h11 had any inhibitory effect on other f. nucleatum pk1594 interactions, including all galactose-inhibitable coaggregations. the results indicate that f.  nucleatum pk1594 expresses upon its surface a distinct type of adhesin that mediates coaggregation interactions that are inhibited by n-acetylneuraminic acid.

TI  == subgingival microbiota of shallow periodontal pockets in individuals after head and neck irradiation.
AB  == this study aimed at investigating the subgingival plaque microorganisms of shallow pockets (< or = 5 mm) in subjects who previously received irradiation in  the head and neck region for treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. direct microscopy and anaerobic culture were used. subgingival paper point samples were  taken from 6 tooth-sites (one/sextant) per subject for direct microscopy (n = 108). another set of paper points was taken from the deepest of the previously selected sites (one per subject) with: group a) no bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 9) and group b) bleeding on probing to the sulcus depth (n = 6) for microscopic and anaerobic culture study. under the microscope, the microflora was found to be a complex mixture comprising gram-positive and gram-negative cocci, rods and filaments, fusiforms, curved rods and spirochetes. low level of fungi were observed and mycelia were occasionally detected. there was no significant variation in the plaque bacterial morphotypes observable according to sites of isolation and no significant difference between group a and group b in morphotypes of the different microflora. the predominant cultivable microflora comprised several species of facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria: gemella, peptostreptococcus, staphylococcus, stomatococcus, streptococcus, actinomyces, eubacterium, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, neisseria, veillonella, bacteroides, campylobacter, capnocytophaga, fusobacterium, kingella, porphyromonas and prevotella species. there was no difference between the two groups except the significantly higher proportion of kingella dentrificans isolated from group b sites. however, colonization of the gingival sulcus in these individuals by microbes that are normal flora of: skin (peptostreptococcus  prevotii and propionibacterium granulosum) and gut (eubacterium aerofaciens, fusobacterium mortiferum and fusobacterium varium) was detected. these findings appear to suggest that the major components of the subgingival microflora of shallow sites in previously head- and neck-irradiated individuals are similar to  that of gingivitis sites in the normal population although they may contain bacterial or fungal species uncommon in normal subjects.

TI  == identification of a gene involved in assembly of actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbriae.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the actinomyces naeslundii t14v type 2 fimbrial structural subunit gene, fima, and the 3' flanking dna region was determined. the fima gene encoded a 535-amino-acid precursor subunit protein (fima) which included both n-terminal leader and c-terminal cell wall sorting sequences. a second gene, designated orf365, that encoded a 365-amino-acid protein which contained a putative transmembrane segment was identified immediately 3' to fima. mutants in which either fima or orf365 was replaced with a kanamycin resistance gene did not participate in type 2 fimbriae-mediated coaggregation with streptococcus oralis 34. type 2 fimbrial antigen was not detected in cell extracts of the fima mutant by western blotting with anti-a. naeslundii type 2 fimbrial antibody, but the subunit protein was detected in extracts of the orf365 mutant. the subunit protein detected in this mutant also was immunostained by an  antibody raised against a synthetic peptide representing the c-terminal 20 amino  acid residues of the predicted fima. the antipeptide antibody reacted with fima isolated from the recombinant escherichia coli clone containing fima but did not  react with purified type 2 fimbriae in extracts of the wild-type strain. these results indicate that synthesis of type 2 fimbriae in a. naeslundii t14v may involve posttranslational cleavage of both the n-terminal and c-terminal peptides of the precursor subunit and also the expression of orf365.

TI  == microbial complexes in subgingival plaque.
AB  == it has been recognized for some time that bacterial species exist in complexes in subgingival plaque. the purpose of the present investigation was to attempt to define such communities using data from large numbers of plaque samples and different clustering and ordination techniques. subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth in 185 subjects (mean age 51 +/- 16 years) with (n = 160) or without (n = 25) periodontitis. the presence and levels  of 40 subgingival taxa were determined in 13,261 plaque samples using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. clinical assessments were made at 6 sites per tooth at each visit. similarities between pairs of species were computed using phi coefficients and species clustered using an averaged unweighted linkage sort. community ordination was performed using principal components analysis and correspondence analysis. 5 major complexes were consistently observed using any of the analytical methods. one complex consisted  of the tightly related group: bacteroides forsythus, porphyromonas gingivalis and treponema denticola. the 2nd complex consisted of a tightly related core group including members of the fusobacterium nucleatum/periodonticum subspecies, prevotella intermedia, prevotella nigrescens and peptostreptococcus micros. species associated with this group included: eubacterium nodatum, campylobacter rectus, campylobacter showae, streptococcus constellatus and campylobacter gracilis. the 3rd complex consisted of streptococcus sanguis, s. oralis, s. mitis, s. gordonii and s. intermedius. the 4th complex was comprised of 3 capnocytophaga species, campylobacter concisus, eikenella corrodens and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans serotype a. the 5th complex consisted of veillonella parvula and actinomyces odontolyticus. a. actinomycetemcomitans serotype b, selenomonas noxia and actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 (a. viscosus) were outliers with little relation to each other and the 5 major complexes. the 1st complex related strikingly to clinical measures of periodontal disease particularly pocket depth and bleeding on probing.

TI  == microbiota of health, gingivitis, and initial periodontitis.
AB  == this study compared the subgingival microbiota in periodontal health, gingivitis  and initial periodontitis using predominant culture and a dna probe, checkerboard hybridization method. 56 healthy adult subjects with minimal periodontal attachment loss were clinically monitored at 3-month intervals for 12 months. more sites demonstrated small increments of attachment loss than attachment gain  over the monitoring period. sites, from 17 subjects, showing > or = 1.5 mm periodontal attachment loss during monitoring were sampled as active lesions for  microbial analysis. twelve subjects demonstrated interproximal lesions, and 5 subjects had attachment loss at buccal sites (recession). cultural studies identified bacteroides forsythus, campylobacter rectus, and selenomonas noxia as  the predominant species associated with active interproximal lesions (9 subjects), whereas actinomyces naeslundii, and streptococcus oralis, were the dominant species colonizing buccal active sites. a. naeslundii, campylobacter gracilis, and b. forsythus (at lower levels than active sites) were the dominant  species cultured from gingivitis (10 subjects). health-associated species (10 subjects) included streptococcus oralis, a. naeslundii, and actinomyces gerencseriae. dna probe data identified higher mean levels of b. forsythus and c. rectus with active (7 subjects) compared to inactive periodontitis sites. porphyromonas gingivalis and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were detected infrequently. cluster analysis of the cultural microbiota grouped 8/9 active interproximal lesions in one subcluster characterized by a mostly gram-negative microbiota, including b. forsythus and c. rectus. the data suggest that b. forsythus c. rectus and s. noxia were major species characterizing sites converting from periodontal health to disease. the differences in location and microbiota of interproximal and buccal active sites suggested that different mechanisms may be involved in increased attachment loss.

TI  == clinical and microbiological features of refractory periodontitis subjects.
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to compare the clinical parameters and the  site prevalence and levels of 40 subgingival species in successfully treated and  refractory periodontitis subjects. 94 subjects received scaling and root planing  and if needed, periodontal surgery and systemically administered tetracycline. 28 refractory subjects showed mean full mouth attachment loss and/or > 3 sites showing attachment loss > 2.5 mm within 1 year post-therapy. 66 successfully treated subjects showed mean attachment level gain and no sites with attachment loss > 2.5 mm. baseline subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesial aspect of each tooth and the presence and levels of 40 subgingival taxa were determined using whole genomic dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. the mean levels and % of sites colonized by each species (prevalence) was computed for each subject and differences between groups sought using the mann-whitney test. most of the 40 species tested, including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, treponema denticola and bacteroides forsythus, were equally or less prevalent in the refractory group. prevotella nigrescens was significantly more prevalent in successfully treated subjects, while refractory subjects harbored a larger proportion of streptococcus species, particularly streptococcus constellatus. the odds of a subject being refractory was 8.6 (p < 0.001) if s. constellatus constituted > or = 3.5% of the  total dna probe count. since few microbiological differences existed between treatment outcome groups using dna probes to known species, the predominant cultivable microbiota of 33 subgingival samples from 14 refractory subjects was examined. 85% of the 1649 isolates were identified using probes to 69 recognized  subgingival species. the remaining unidentified strains were classified by analyzing 16s rrna gene sequences. many sequenced isolates were of taxa not considered a common part of the oral microbiota such as acinetobacter baumanni, gemella haemolysans, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus warneri, pseudomonas aeruginosa and novel species in the genera bartonella, ralstonia, neisseria, eubacterium, rothia, gordona, gemella, corynebacterium, leptotrichia, and actinomyces. refractory subjects constituted a heterogeneous group based on their subgingival microbiota. as a group, they did not harbor more of the "classic" periodontopathogens, although elevated proportions of s. constellatus were found.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == formation of dental caries is caused by the colonization and accumulation of oral microorganisms and extracellular polysaccharides that are synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferase of streptococcus mutans. the production of glucosyltransferase from oral microorganisms was attempted, and it was found that streptococcus mutans produced highest activity of the enzyme. ethanolic extracts  of propolis (eep) were examined whether eep inhibit the enzyme activity and growth of the bacteria or not. all eep from various regions in brazil inhibited both glucosyltransferase activity and growth of s. mutans, but one of the propolis from rio grande do sul (rs2) demonstrated the highest inhibition of the  enzyme activity and growth of the bacteria. it was also found that propolis (rs2) contained the highest concentrations of pinocembrin and galangin.

TI  == time-dependent interfacial tension of whole saliva and saliva-bacteria mixes.
AB  == using a tensiometer in accordance with the drop volume principle, the surface tension decrease with time was determined for whole and for 2%, 10%, and 50% aqueous solutions of saliva from one healthy donor. the reduction of surface tension with time was also measured for 10% and 20% saliva solutions with added samples of streptococcus salivarius krf2, s. sanguis krf3, and actinomyces naeslundii 2t-55. the results show that 1) there is a time dependence of the surface tension reduction of both whole saliva and diluted saliva, 2) an increase of the concentration of whole saliva in salivary solutions gives rise to larger and more rapid surface tension reduction, 3) the proteinaceous components of saliva appear to have a dominant contribution on surface tension in whole saliva  and diluted saliva, and 4) the surface-active proteinaceous components in saliva  have the ability to dominate the air-saliva interface also in the presence of high concentrations of salivary bacteria.

TI  == altered adherence properties of a streptococcus gordonii hppa (oligopeptide permease) mutant result from transcriptional effects on csha adhesin gene expression.
AB  == cell-surface polypeptide csha (259 kda) mediates multiple adherence interactions  of streptococcus gordonii. by generating a chromosomal csha promoter (p-csha)-cat gene fusion and measuring both cat enzyme activity and cat mrna levels, it was shown that csha is expressed maximally in cells in the late exponential phase of  growth in batch culture. the expression of cat enzyme activity from the p-csha-cat promoter fusion was 28% decreased in early stationary phase cell extracts of mutant strain ob528 in which the hppa (oligopeptide-binding lipoprotein) gene was insertionally inactivated. this effect was correlated with  proportionally reduced cell-surface expression of csha protein and with impaired  adherence of hppa mutant cells to cells of an oral actinomyces naeslundii strain. csha promoter activity was enhanced in streptococcal cells that were incubated in conditioned culture medium as opposed to fresh medium, but this did not occur in  an hppa genetic background. it is suggested that hppa is necessary for the response of cells to an extracellular factor that modulates csha transcription, and hence affects cell-surface csha expression and streptococcal cell adherence properties.

TI  == acid tolerance response and survival by oral bacteria.
AB  == using 21 species of oral bacteria, representing six acidogenic genera, we undertook to determine whether the ph-limiting exponential growth is related to the ability of the organisms to generate an acid-tolerance response that results  in enhanced survival at low ph. the lower ph limit of exponential growth varied by more than two units with that of neisseria a182 at ph 6.34; growth of lactobacillus casei rb1014 stopped at ph 3.81, with species of actinomyces, enterococcus, prevotella and streptococcus falling between these limits. the working hypothesis was that the organisms with the higher ph limits for growth are unable to respond to acidic environments in order to survive, whereas the more aciduric organisms would possess or acquire acid tolerance. adaptation to acid tolerance was tested by determining whether the prior exposure of exponential-phase cells to a low, sub-lethal ph would trigger the induction of a  mechanism that would enhance survival at a ph killing ph 7.5 control cells. the killing ph varied from ph 4.5 for prevotella intermedia atcc 25611 to ph 2.3 for  the three lactobacillus casei strains in the study, with the three streptococcus  mutans strains killed at ph 3.0 for 3 h. the adaptation experiments revealed three groups of organisms: non-acid-responders, generally representing strains with the highest terminal ph values; weak acid-responders in the middle of the ph list, generating low numbers of survivors at one or two ph values, and the aciduric, strong responders generating a high number of survivors at ph values in the range 6.0 to 3.5, but not at ph 7.5. predominant among the latter group were  the s. mutans and lactobacilli casei strains, with the most significant adaptive  response exhibited by s. mutans lt11 and s. mutans ingbritt, involving a process  that required protein synthesis. time course experiments with the latter organisms indicated that 90-120 min was required after exposure to the triggering ph before the acid response was fully functional. these results indicate that the sudden exposure of strains of oral streptococci and lactobacilli, as well as enterococcus faecalis, to ph values between 6.0 and 3.5 results in the induction  of an acid tolerance response that enhances the survival of these strains at or below ph 3.5.

TI  == oral food consumption and subgingival microorganisms: subgingival microbiota of gastrostomy tube-fed children and healthy controls.
AB  == this study examined the effect of oral food consumption on the prevalence and levels of subgingival bacteria and yeasts in 20 gastrostomy tube-fed children and 24 healthy controls. microbial identification was carried out using anaerobic culture and 16s rrna-based pcr identification methods. streptococcal and actinomyces species were recovered from 100% and 76% of all subjects and averaged 66% and 11% of total cultivable organisms, respectively. in decreasing order of prevalence, fusobacterium, enteric rods, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, capnocytophaga, propionibacterium, yeasts, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, coagulase-negative staphylococcus, campylobacter rectus, bacteroides forsythus, and porphyromonas gingivalis were detected in 48% to 2% of the study subjects. the cultivable levels of these species varied widely among subjects. pcr detection showed c. rectus and eikenella corrodens both to occur in 93% of the study subjects and to be the most prevalent putative periodontal pathogens examined. in decreasing order of prevalence, pcr identified treponema denticola, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. nigrescens, p. intermedia, b. forsythus,  and p. gingivalis in 38% to 21% of the subjects studied. tube-fed children and healthy controls exhibited similar subgingival microbial compositions. it appears from this study that oral food consumption is not a major determinant for the establishment of subgingival microbiota in children.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the subgingival microbiota of periodontitis-susceptible subjects.
AB  == the present study evaluated the long-term effect of (i) meticulous self-performed, supragingival plaque control and (ii) the use of a triclosan/copolymer containing dentifrice in adult subjects susceptible to destructive periodontitis. 40 individuals were recruited into the trial. 3-5 years prior to the baseline examination, they had all been treated by nonsurgical means- for advanced periodontal disease. during the subsequent maintenance phase, all subjects had at different time intervals exhibited sites with recurrent periodontitis. at a baseline examination, 6 surfaces per tooth were examined regarding bleeding on probing, probing pocket depth, and probing attachment level. the deepest pocket site in each quadrant (i.e. 4 sites per subject) was selected and samples of the subgingival bacteria were taken. at baseline, all volunteers received detailed information on proper oral hygiene techniques. this  information was repeated on an individual need basis during the course of the subsequent 36-months. no professional subgingival therapy was delivered between the baseline and the 36-month examinations. the subjects were randomly distributed into 2 equal groups of 20 individuals each, 1 test and 1 control group. the members of the test group were supplied with a fluoridated dentifrice  containing triclosan/copolymer (total, colgate), while the controls received a corresponding dentifrice but without triclosan/copolymer. the findings demonstrated that in subjects with advanced and recurrent periodontitis, carefully practiced supragingival plaque control had some effects on the subgingival microbiota, but also that this was insufficient to prevent disease progression. in a corresponding group of subjects, however, who used a triclosan/copolymer dentifrice, the subgingival microbiota was reduced in both quantitative and qualitative terms and recurrent periodontitis was almost entirely prevented.

AB  == bacterial binding to salivary proteins may in part account for individual differences in the colonization of tooth surfaces. high-molecular-weight glycoproteins, agglutinins, mediate s. mutans adherence, whereas acidic proline-rich proteins mediate adherence of other early-colonizing streptococci and actinomyces. the aim of the present study was to examine the composition of adherence-related salivary proteins and dental plaque micro-organisms in three individuals with a low, moderate, and high capacity to mediate s. mutans adherence. the s. mutans (strain ingbritt) binding activity resided with a 300-kda agglutinin which was six-fold more prevalent in the high s. mutans binding saliva compared with the low one. binding to all three salivas was completely blocked by a monoclonal anti-agglutinin antibody. the moderate s. mutans binding saliva was found to contain adherence-inhibiting components. furthermore, the low and moderate s. mutans binding salivas mediated binding of a. naeslundii strain ly7 to a greater extent than the saliva with high s. mutans  binding. the a. naeslundii binding activity resided with the acidic proline-rich  proteins (aprps) and paralleled the relative content of 106- and 150-residue aprps. low a. naeslundii binding coincided with an almost two-fold higher ratio of 106/150 aprps compared with the high a. naeslundii binding saliva. during conventional gel filtration, a degradation of the acidic, basic, and glycosylated proline-rich proteins was evident in the saliva with high s. mutans and low a. naeslundii binding. this saliva donor had a comparably high rate of dental plaque formation, high counts of s. mutans, and low counts of other streptococci and actinomyces.

TI  == anaerobic killing of oral streptococci by reduced, transition metal cations.
AB  == reduced, transition metal cations commonly enhance oxidative damage to cells caused by hydroperoxides formed as a result of oxygen metabolism or added externally. as expected, the cations fe2+ and cu+ enhanced killing of streptococcus mutans gs-5 by hydroperoxides. however, unexpectedly, they also induced lethal damage under fully anaerobic conditions in a glove box with no exposure to o2 or hydroperoxides from initial treatment with the cations. sensitivities to anaerobic killing by fe2+ varied among the organisms tested. the oral streptococci streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558, streptococcus rattus fa-1, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 were approximately as sensitive as s. mutans gs-5. enterococcus hirae atcc 9790, actinomyces viscosus omz105e, and actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 had intermediate sensitivity, while lactobacillus casei atcc 4646 and escherichia coli b were insensitive. killing of s. mutans gs-5 in response to millimolar levels of added fe2+ occurred over a wide range of temperatures and ph. the organism was able to take up ferrous iron, but ferric reductase activity could not be detected. chelators, uric acid, and thiocyanate were not effective inhibitors of the lethal damage. sulfhydryl compounds, ferricyanide, and ferrocyanide were protective if added prior to fe2+ exposure. fe2+, but not fe3+, acted to reduce the acid tolerance of glycolysis by intact cells of s. mutans. the reduction in acid tolerance appeared to be related directly to fe2+ inhibition of f-atpase, which could be assayed with permeabilized cells, isolated membranes, or f1 enzyme separated from membranes. cu+ and cu2+ also inhibited f-atpase and sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acid. all of these damaging actions occurred anaerobically and thus did not appear to involve reactive oxygen species.

TI  == investigation of calcium-binding sites on the surfaces of selected gram-positive  oral organisms.
AB  == dental plaque is rich in anionic groups with a high calcium-binding capacity which may affect mineral dynamics at the tooth surface. the two major calcium-binding sites on gram-positive cell surfaces are carboxylate groups (in proteins and peptidoglycan cross-links) and phosphate groups (in lipoteichoic and teichoic acid). equilibrium dialysis was used to measure calcium-binding capacities of whole cells and purified cell-wall material (cwm) from streptococcus mutans r9, strep. oralis ef186, strep. gordonii nctc 7865, strep. downei nctc 11391, actinomyces naeslundii wvu627 and lactobacillus casei ac413. this material was stripped of phosphate (ps-cwm) and treated to mask carboxylate  groups (cm-cwm). whole-cell calcium-binding capacities ranged from 240 (strep. downei) to 50 (l. casei) mu mol/g (dry wt). differences in cwm, ps-cwm and cm-cwm calcium-binding capacities demonstrated the greater importance of phosphate in comparison with carboxylate groups in cell calcium binding. these data indicate that, in streptococci, calcium binding is predominantly phosphate group-based, especially in the teichoic acid-containing strep. oralis. in the other species tested, calcium binding is predominantly carboxylate group-based.

TI  == comparison of the subgingival microbiota of periodontally healthy and diseased adults in northern cameroon.
AB  == our study is the 1st report on subgingival microbiota in adult cameronians. the aim was to investigate, using the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique, the prevalence of 18 oral species in subgingival plaque samples obtained from sex- and age-matched cameronian adults with and without periodontal destruction.  we also compared cultivation and the affirm dp test with the checkerboard technique in their capability to detect some selected species among the 18. 21 adult periodontitis patients and 21 periodontally healthy subjects were examined  and the results were compared statistically. each periodontitis patient had at least 4 pockets of > or = 6 mm depth, while the healthy subjects had no sites more than 3 mm deep. results of the checkerboard analysis showed that significantly (p < 0.05) more periodontitis patients tested positive for most of  the 18 bacterial species. the gram-positive species actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis, known as microbiota of healthy sites, were detected significantly more frequently in the healthy group. cultivation demonstrated p. gingivalis, b. forsythus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. intermedia and f. nucleatum in significantly lower %s of patients as compared  to the checkerboard technique. furthermore, the affirm dp test detected p. gingivalis and b. forsythus in significantly fewer patients than did the checkerboard technique. a. actinomycetemcomitans was detected in 52.3% of the patients by the latter technique while the affirm dp test failed to detect the bacterium in any of the samples. overall, the results of the present study confirm the importance of the screening method and indicate that the prevalences  of the investigated putative periodontal pathogens and beneficial species in the  healthy and diseased adult cameronians were similar to those reported for adults  in the west and in some developing countries.

TI  == structural and antigenic types of cell wall polysaccharides from viridans group streptococci with receptors for oral actinomyces and streptococcal lectins.
AB  == lectin-mediated interactions between oral viridans group streptococci and actinomyces may play an important role in microbial colonization of the tooth surface. the presence of two host-like motifs, either galnac beta1-->3gal (gn) or gal beta1-->3galnac (g), in the cell wall polysaccharides of five streptococcal strains accounts for the lactose-sensitive coaggregations of these bacteria with  actinomyces naeslundii. three streptococcal strains which have gn-containing polysaccharides also participate in galnac-sensitive coaggregations with strains  of streptococcus gordonii and s. sanguis. each gn- or g-containing polysaccharide is composed of a distinct phosphodiester-linked hexa- or heptasaccharide repeating unit. the occurrence of these polysaccharides on 19 additional viridans group streptococcal strains that participate in lactose-sensitive coaggregations  with actinomyces was examined. negatively charged polysaccharides that reacted with bauhinia purpurea agglutinin, a gal and galnac binding plant lectin, were isolated from 17 strains by anion exchange column chromatography of mutanolysin-cell wall digests. results from nuclear magnetic resonance and immunodiffusion identified each of 16 polysaccharides as a known gn- or g-containing structural type and one polysaccharide as a new but closely related  gn-containing type. unlike the reactions of lectins, the cross-reactions of most  rabbit antisera with these polysaccharides were correlated with structural features other than the host-like motifs. gn-containing polysaccharides occurred  primarily on the strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis while g-containing polysaccharides were more common among the strains of s. gordonii and s. mitis examined. the findings strongly support the hypothesis that lectin-mediated recognition of these streptococci by other oral bacteria depends on a family of antigenically diverse gn- and g-containing cell wall polysaccharides, the occurrence of which may differ between streptococcal species.

TI  == enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

AB  == during the search for antimicrobial compounds from higher plant sources, a methanol extract of ceanothus americanus demonstrated antimicrobial activity against selected oral pathogens. through further bioassay-guided fractionation and purification, three triterpenes (ceanothic acid, 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid) and two flavonoids (maesopsin and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside) were identified. among these, ceanothetric acid and maesopsin-6-o-glucoside were  new compounds. ceanothic acid and ceanothetric acid demonstrated growth inhibitory effect against streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia with mics ranging from 42 to  625 micrograms ml-1. maesopsin, its glucoside, and 27-hydroxy ceanothic acid, were inactive below the concentration of 500 micrograms ml-1.

TI  == adherence of oral streptococci to an immobilized antimicrobial agent.
AB  == an antimicrobial agent, 3-(trimethoxysilyl)-propyldimethyloctadecyl ammonium chloride, was immobilized on silica. interaction between the material (termed) oais) and various oral bacterial species were then studied. seven species of streptococcus and two actinomyces were investigated for their ability to adhere to this biomaterial. cell-surface hydrophobicity and zeta-potential were examined as well. analysis of extracted hydrophobic proteins which adhered to oais revealed that the adherence of these micro-organisms was closely related to the hydrophobicity of their cell surfaces. the results of zeta-potential assays indicated that negative charge on the cell surface inhibited adherence to oais. gel electrophoresis revealed that oais could absorb cell-surface hydrophobic proteins from all bacterial species tested. preadsorption of hydrophobic components on the cell surface inhibited adherence of the strep. mutans strain to oais in a dose-dependent manner. the results indicate that oais adsorption of these oral bacteria was dependent on the degree of hydrophobicity of their surfaces. a major component of this adherence was hydrophobic cell-surface proteins.

TI  == microbiology and pathology of fibrinous pericarditis in danish slaughter pigs.
AB  == the prevalence of fibrinous pericarditis detected at slaughter in danish slaughter pigs is approximately 0.02%. the microbiology and pathology of this disorder was studied through 46 field cases collected at slaughter from may 1994  to august 1995. mycoplasmas (mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, m. hyosynoviae and m. hyorhinis) were isolated from the pericardium in 38 cases and from the joints in  six. m. hyopneumoniae dominated with 33 isolates from the pericardium. actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae was isolated from the pericardium in three cases  (as mono-infection in one and together with m. hyopneumoniae in two cases) and actinomyces pyogenes was isolated from the pericardium twice (as mono-infection in one case and together with m. hyopneumoniae in another). a. pyogenes was also  present in the lung, liver and kidney in one of these cases. streptococcus suis was isolated together with mycoplasmas from the pericardium in three cases. the pericardium was sterile in three cases and contained a low grade mixed flora in two; the latter is believed to be a result of the slaughter procedure rather than an infection. no chlamydiae were found in connection with the microbiological examination. parvovirus was found in one case in the pericardium and in two cases in the spleen. forty-five cases were subacute to chronic. the gross pathological  examination showed that bronchopneumonia, chronic pleuritis and synovitis or a low grade arthritis occurred in most cases. only the arthritic lesions are believed to be pathogenetically concurrent with the pericarditis. slight evidence of stasis of the liver and/or periangiolar edema was present in six cases. the histopathological examination confirmed the above mentioned findings. bacterial colonies were found within the fibrinous layer on the pericardium in all cases from which either a. pleuropneumoniae, a. pyogenes or s. suis was isolated. it is concluded that in this study mycoplasmas, particularly m. hyopneumoniae, are the  more likely cause of fibrinous pericarditis in slaughter pigs.

TI  == a microbiological study of pre- and postoperative apicoectomy sites.
AB  == there is little information on the microbiology of periapical lesions, and no data on the residual microbial flora in the periapex, if any, after apicoectomy procedures. hence, 64 patients treated by apicoectomy procedures were prospectively studied to assess the bacterial flora in the periapex and to evaluate the residual bacteria in postoperative apicoectomy sites. of the 64 lesions studied, 14 (22%) were sterile and 50 (78%) yielded bacteria preoperatively. bacteria could be recovered from 28 (56%) of the latter lesions after apicoectomy and curettage. a total of 105 bacterial strains was isolated from 50 lesions, yielding a range of 1-4 (mean 2.1) species per sample. the isolates comprised 84 (80%) facultative anaerobes and 21 (20%) strict anaerobes.  a polymicrobial growth was obtained from 39 lesions whilst 11 lesions yielded pure cultures. on detailed microbiological analyses of 29 lesions, 40% of the isolates were identified as alpha-haemolytic streptococci, half of which were streptococcus sanguis; anaerobic streptococci were the predominant anaerobes. none of the organisms or group(s) of organisms emerged as recalcitrant colonisers which were difficult to dislodge after surgical debridement. these data indicate  that the majority of periapical lesions harbour a variety of flora which cannot be eradicated despite thorough apicoectomy procedures.

TI  == protein degradation by prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri supports the  growth of non-protein-cleaving oral bacteria in serum.
AB  == the proteolytic activities of oral bacteria are thought to play an important role in the aetiology of dental abscesses. bacteria-derived proteases may contribute to tissue destruction, and are likely to impair host defence by degrading immunoglobulins and complement. degraded periodontal tissue and tissue fluid are  likely to constitute essential sources of nutrients in the abscess. tissue fluid, which is derived from serum, is rich in protein and poor in carbohydrate, suggesting that breakdown of protein and fermentation of amino acids is a crucial step to generate energy for growth of the microflora. the number of oral bacterial species that perform hydrolytic cleavage of protein into polypeptides,  the first step in protein degradation, is relatively small compared to the large  majority of peptidase-producing species. in this study, we therefore investigated the growth-promoting effect of proteinase-producing species like prevotella intermedia and actinomyces meyeri on the growth of some non-proteinase producing  bacteria in mixed cultures. we used serum as a substitute for the supposed natural substrate of the abscess microflora. the breakdown of serum proteins was  investigated using capillary electrophoresis. poor growth was found in mono- and  mixed cultures of non-proteinase producing species eubacterium lentum, fusobacterium nucleatum. peptostreptococcus micros, and streptococcus intermedius. the presence of p. intermedia in mixed cultures strongly enhanced growth of these 4 species, according to the hypothesis that the growth of the mixed cultures was peptide-limited. the enhanced growth of p. intermedia in pronase-digested serum indicated peptide-limited growth of this organism in serum, despite its production of proteinase. we found that growth of monocultures of actinomyces meyeri was poor. in contrast, a. meyeri grew well in mixed cultures and its presence stimulated growth of f. nucleatum and p. micros, suggesting a synergistic relationship. the growth of mono- and mixed cultures was investigated using one representative strain of each species. thus, there is a small risk of having selected unique strains. proteinase inhibitors reduced the growth of porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella nigrescens, and p. intermedia in trypticase peptone-yeast extract medium with, and without, igg. our study indicated that proteinase-producing organisms play a key role in mixed cultures of oral bacteria in human serum by providing polypeptides for growth. this may explain their association with dental abscesses.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria of foods and their current taxonomy.
AB  == application of molecular genetic techniques to determine the relatedness of food-associated lactic acid bacteria has resulted in significant changes in their taxonomic classification. during the 1980s the genus streptococcus was separated  into the three genera enterococcus, lactococcus and streptococcus. the lactic acid bacteria associated with foods now include species of the genera carnobacterium, enterococcus, lactobacillus, lactococcus, leuconostoc, oenococcus, pediococcus, streptococcus, tetragenococcus, vagococcus and weissella. the genus lactobacillus remains heterogeneous with over 60 species (ymol% g+c content ranging from 33 to 55), of which about one-third are strictly  heterofermentative. however, many changes have been made and reorganization of the genus along lines that do not follow previous morphological or phenotypic differentiation from leuconostoc and pediococcus is being studied. phylogenetically belonging to the actinomyces branch of the bacteria, lactobacillus bifidus has been moved to the genus bifidobacterium also on account of its greater than 50 mol% g+c content. it is therefore no longer considered one of the lactic acid bacteria senso strictu, which form part of the clostridium branch of the bacteria. the new genus weissella has been established to include one member of the genus leuconostoc (leuc, paramesenteroides) and heterofermentative lactobacilli with unusual interpeptide bridges in the peptidoglycan. contrary to the clear-cut division of the streptococci, morphological and physiological features of weissella do not directly support this grouping which now incorporates species that produce d(-)- as well as dl-lactate. the new genus carnobacterium is morphologically similar to the lactobacilli, but it shares some physiological similarities (e.g. growth at ph 9.5) and a common phylogenetic branch with the genus enterococcus. the review includes information on the taxonomic changes and the relationship of the bacteria of food fermentation and spoilage.

TI  == in vitro models that support adhesion specificity in biofilms of oral bacteria.
AB  == adhesion to adsorbed pellicles and interspecies co-adhesion to form plaque biofilms involve selective interactions of bacterial adhesins with specific receptors. our laboratory has devised in vitro assays for co-adhesion between actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis or porphyromonas gingivalis on saliva-coated mineral and hexadecane droplet substrata. p. gingivalis structures  significant for co-adhesion with a. naeslundii include surface vesicles and fimbriae. a family of arginine-specific cysteine proteinases in vesicles may be involved in adherence to bacteria, to host cells, and to matrix proteins. new research from several laboratories has found that such proteinases are processed  from genes encoding polyproteins containing both proteinase and hemagglutinin domains. in addition to enzyme-substrate recognition, bacterial adhesion is often determined by specific protein-peptide and lectincarbohydrate recognition. a. naeslundii--salivary prolinerich protein, s. gordonii--salivary alpha-amylase, and treponema denticola--matrix protein recognition are examples of the former. co-adhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis is an example of the latter. lactose can selectively desorb a. naeslundii cells from mixed biofilms with s. oralis, a  demonstration of the significance of specificity. although non-specific forces are probably secondary to stereochemical fit in determining the selective range of surfaces that bacteria have evolved to recognize and bind, they probably help  stabilize non-covalent bonds within aligned, complementary domains.

AB  == the species actinomyces serovar wva963 is among the 20 bacteria most frequently isolated from human subgingival plaque. the interactions of this species with streptococci are inhibited by lactose, a function associated with type 2 fimbrial surface structures in actinomyces naeslundii. type 1 fimbriae mediate binding of  cells to salivary proline-rich proteins. specific polyclonal antisera against type 1 and type 2 fimbriae of a. naeslundii t14v revealed both types of fimbriae  on actinomyces serovar wva963 strain pk1259. to investigate the role of type 2 fimbriae of strain pk1259 in actinomyces-streptococcus lactose-inhibitable coaggregations, spontaneous coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants that failed to coaggregate with streptococci were isolated; three were chosen for study. all three mutant strains synthesized type 1 fimbriae and a 59 kda protein; mutant strains pk2415 and pk3092 synthesized type 2 fimbriae and a 57 kda protein. in contrast, the cog- strain pk2407 did not agglutinate with anti-type 2 antibodies  or show the 57 kda band, suggesting that the 57 kda protein was the type 2 fimbrial subunit. polyclonal antiserum raised against the actinomyces serovar wva963 strain pk2399, an antibiotic-resistant derivative of wild-type pk1259, blocked coaggregation between this strain and streptococci. anti-pk2399 serum absorbed with mutant strain pk3092 bearing type 2 fimbriae retained its blocking  ability. surface sonicates of the parent and mutant strains were adsorbed to streptococcal cells and to lactose-agarose beads. lactose eluates from both the streptococcal cells and the affinity beads were characterized by sds-page and corresponding immunoblots using anti-pk2399 serum absorbed with cog- mutant pk3092. these blots revealed a 95 kda putative adhesin in the parent strain pk2399 that was absent in the cog- mutant strain pk3092. these results suggest the presence of a putative 95 kda actinomyces adhesin distinct from the 57 kda type 2 fimbrial subunit and that this adhesin mediates lactose-inhibitable coaggregation with streptococci.

TI  == age-related changes in salivary antibodies to commensal oral and gut biota.
AB  == the prevalence of mucosally derived infections appears to increase with age, suggesting dysfunction at the mucosal surfaces. the present investigation was undertaken to examine any age-related changes in secretion rates and concentrations of secretory antibodies in whole and parotid saliva in a healthy adult population. a total of 116 subjects were subdivided into the following age  groups: 20-39 years, 40-59 years, 60-79 years and 80 years and over. specific immunoglobulin a (iga), igg and igm antibodies in whole and parotid saliva to streptococcus mutans (serotype c), actinomyces viscosus nctc 10951, and escherichia coli nctc 10418 were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. iga antibodies to all three organisms examined increased with age in both whole and parotid saliva, whereas igg antibody levels to s. mutans in whole saliva were significantly decreased with age. igg antibodies to e. coli in parotid saliva were reduced in older age groups. igm antibody levels to s. mutans were reduced with age in both secretions, whereas igm antibodies to a. viscosus were greatest  in the oldest age groups. no significant changes with age were observed in salivary igm antibody levels to e. coli. no significant reduction in the secretion rates of iga antibodies were observed in parotid or whole saliva, whereas igg and igm antibody secretion rates to all three microorganisms were reduced in most age groups in both whole and parotid saliva. the results of this  investigation have demonstrated age-related changes with salivary antibodies, but, whereas salivary igg and igm antibodies showed decreases, salivary iga levels generally increased with age. this suggests that the ability to form iga antibody responses is not impaired with increased age, and that secretion rates and functional properties of antibodies may be as important as concentrations in  protection against mucosal infective diseases.

TI  == variations in the predominant cultivable microflora of dental plaque at defined subsites on approximal tooth surfaces in children.
AB  == the distribution and composition of the resident microflora were determined in approximal gingival margin plaque from 21 premolars extracted from schoolchildren (mean age 12.0 +/- 1.8 yr). indigo carmine (5% w v) was used to visualize plaque  to facilitate sampling. about 1 mm2 of plaque was removed from sites away from (a), to the side of (s), and below (b) the contact area. plaque samples were dispersed, serially diluted, and cultured on selective and non-selective agar media. an average of seven to nine species was found at each subsite. streptococcus and actinomyces were subdivided on the basis of a range of biochemical tests. the predominant actinomyces and streptococcal species at most  subsites were a. naeslundii and strep. mitis biovar i. a. naeslundii and a. odontolyticus were isolated more often at subsite b (90.5 and 57.1%, respectively), and a. israelii at subsite s (66.7%) strep. mitis 1 and strep. sanguis were found more frequently at subsite s (76.2 and 66.7% respectively), whereas strep mutans, strep. sobrinus, strep. gordonii and veillonella spp. were  recovered most commonly from subsite b (85.7, 33.3, 38.1 and 76.2%, respectively). the isolation frequencies of strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus were significantly higher at subsite b (a b p < 0.01 and p < 0.05, respectively). veillonella spp. were significantly higher at subsites b and s (a < b, p > 0.01;  b > s, p < 0.05), while neisseria spp. were most common at subsite a (a > b. p >  0.03). igal protease-producing species were found at each subsite, but they formed only a small proportion of the total streptococcus population. this study  has shown that local variations were evident at different subsites, both with respect to species prevalence and to proportions of each species within each subsite. the population shifts in gingival margin plaque appear to relate to the  location of plaque in relation to the most caries-prone site below the contact area b.

TI  == does assessment of microbial composition of plaque/saliva allow for diagnosis of  disease activity of individuals?
AB  == microbiological tests are limited in their applicability in the assessment of caries activity and in caries prediction. they can be effective in group of persons with high or low caries experience. the reasons for the limitation of microbiological tests rests with unique characteristics of the microflora and local environments of the oral cavity, which will modify the cariogenicity of plaque in an individual. thus, high numbers of s. mutans may be associated with the development of a lesion at a site, while a second susceptible site with high  levels of this organism in the same subject will remain caries free. this paper identifies some aspects of oral bacteria which can contribute to the unique nature of the microflora associated with plaque in an individual. firstly, the range of bacteria potentially involved in caries has widened and now includes, for example, 'low ph' non-mutans streptococci. the presence of such organisms in  plaque in an individual may influence early enamel demineralization. most significantly, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces naeslundii have been shown to be comprise many distinct clones, with different distribution among subjects. little is known of the impact of clonal diversity on caries activity but in some bacterial diseases particular clones are associated with virulence. therefore, possession of a particular clone or clones by an individual could be related to caries activity. also, the extent of clonal diversity may reflect the nature of the oral environment. recent studies suggest  that cells are released from biofilms, during adherence and growth, i.e. the early phases of development. thus, determination of the numbers of a given species in non-stimulated saliva may indicate whether it is actively growing in plaque. microbiological tests on the oral flora should perhaps be used to monitor the status of the oral cavity, after establishing a norm for the individual patient. research on species and clonal diversity of oral bacteria among human populations; diversity and its role in the caries process; and the liberation of  biofilm cells could provide data to allow better appreciation and evaluation of the results of microbiological testing.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on the bacterial colonization and degradation of dentin  and completely demineralized dentin in situ.
AB  == the effects of 0.2% chlorhexidine on selected plaque microorganisms were studied  in an intraoral dentin caries model. in 8 individuals wearing partial dentures, sound and completely demineralized dentin specimens were placed consecutively in  2 periods of 4 weeks, respectively. throughout the experimental period, the specimens were treated 2 x daily with 0.2% chlorhexidine; control specimens were  treated with water. plaque accumulation on the specimens was left undisturbed. no protection against demineralization of the dentin or degradation of the dentin collagen by the chlorhexidine treatment was observed. the chlorhexidine treatment did not result in a reduction of the total cultivable flora when compared with the control specimens. a significant reduction of mutans streptococci and total streptococci recovered from completely demineralized dentin treated with chlorhexidine was observed, but the proportions of actinomyces and lactobacilli were not affected significantly. it is speculated that areas of exposed roots, which are difficult to reach by oral hygiene measurements, such as approximal surfaces, will not be protected by a 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthrinse against the caries process.

TI  == bacterial adherence to guided tissue regeneration barrier membranes exposed to the oral environment.
AB  == microbial colonization of barrier materials used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) is known to adversely affect treatment outcomes. the purpose of this study  was to compare the rate at which 11 commonly-occurring oral bacteria species colonize three different barrier materials (collagen, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene, and polylactic acid). the study group consisted of 10 systemically healthy individuals with no history of periodontal disease and absence of antimicrobial therapy within the previous 3 months. in each patient, 4 teeth per quadrant (p1, p2, m1, m2) were selected and 3 teeth were randomly assigned as test teeth while the remaining tooth acted as a control site (i.e., natural colonization of the tooth surface). these teeth were then randomly assigned to receive one of the three barrier types (i.e., each patient received 4 barriers of each type, 1 per quadrant). a 2 x 5 mm piece of barrier material was  positioned over the oral surface of the buccal marginal gingiva and secured with  an external sling suture. with oral hygiene procedures suspended, one barrier of  each type was collected at 1, 3, 7, and 14 days. slot immunoblot assay demonstrated that all species types (a. actinomycetemcomitans, a. viscosus, b. melaninogenicus, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis, p. intermedia, s. mutans, s. sanguis, selenomonas sputigena, t. denticola, and t. vincentii) were present. semi-quantitative scoring (scale 0 to 3) of slot blot results and analysis by chi-square ratio and pearson correlation test indicated that while total bacteria adherence increased over time (p < 0.05), the 3 barrier types and the control sites did not differ in numbers or species of colonizing bacteria detected per time point. these results suggest that under these experimental conditions the barrier materials tested do not differ in bacteria adherence or antimicrobial properties.

TI  == effect of different diets on oral bacteria and caries activity in sprague-dawley  rats.
AB  == the conventional rat model of dental caries has been used extensively to measure  the contribution of various inoculated bacteria or diets to dental caries production. only limited information is available on the effect of different diets on the oral bacterial community as a whole. in the present study, using selective and non-selective media, the oral bacterial populations of 21-day-old sprague-dawley rats fed diets with commercial rat and mouse cubes (control), high-starch (56%) and sucrose (56%) diets for 21 days were investigated. the high-starch diet did not significantly change the proportion of oral bacteria compared with the control group; the high-sucrose diet significantly enhanced the total cultivable bacteria, particularly actinomyces naeslundii, streptococcus rattus and streptococcus suis-like bacteria. the order of diets with respect to the production of dental caries was sucrose > starch > normal. thus the high-sucrose diet changed the oral bacterial population of sprague-dawley rats and these changes were reflected in the increased level of dental caries.

TI  == effect of antibodies on the chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus.
AB  == passive immunization has been suggested as a method to prevent colonization of teeth by mutans streptococci. however, the mechanism of action of antibodies, both polyclonal and monoclonal, is not clear. in this study we investigated the effect of polyclonal antibodies (pabs) and a monoclonal antibody (omvu10) on the  chain length and growth of streptococcus sobrinus. during growth in broth s. sobrinus formed significantly longer chains in the presence of pabs in comparison to pre-immune serum (p < 0.01), but pabs did not influence the growth rate of s.  sobrinus in broth. omvu10 did not influence the growth rate nor the chain length. in order to study the effect of the antibodies on adhesion and growth on a surface, s. sobrinus was grown on hydroxyapatite discs in the presence of two other bacteria, streptococcus oralis and actinomyces viscosus. no effect of the antibodies was found on the total cultivable count of the three bacteria after growth on hydroxyapatite discs. however, the morphology of the s. sobrinus microcolonies was different after growth in the presence of both pabs and omvu10. the colonies were less dense and chains of s. sobrinus could be seen using a confocal laser microscope. after growth in the presence of the control antibodies, the colonies were dense and no long chains could be observed. it was  concluded that pabs influenced the chain length, in broth and on hydroxyapatite discs, and the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs, whereas  omvu10 influenced the colony morphology of s. sobrinus on hydroxyapatite discs.

TI  == saliva mediated adherence, aggregation and prevalence in dental plaque of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces spp, in young and elderly humans.
AB  == salivary components in the pellicle mediate bacterial adherence to the tooth. such components may also aggregate bacteria in saliva and prevent them becoming established in dental plaque. in the present study, the adherence and aggregation of streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. sanguis strain 10556 and actinomyces  viscosus-strain 19246 mediated by parotid and whole saliva from groups of young and elderly people were examined. significant differences were found between test strains, salivary secretions and age groups. s. sanguis 10556 and a. viscosus 19246 generally adhered more strongly than s. mutans ingbritt, which adhered better to pellicles from parotid saliva than from whole saliva strain 19246 bound in higher numbers to parotid saliva pellicles from elderly compared to young individuals. strain 10556 adhered better to whole saliva than parotid saliva pellicles, and the difference was significant among the young individuals, indicating reduced adherence ability in elderly whole saliva. the streptococci were aggregated by parotid and whole saliva, and s. sanguis aggregation was less  with whole saliva from the elderly than from the young participants. besides a correlation between whole saliva aggregation of s. mutans and proportions of bacteria in plaque, no correlations were found for the individual binding properties of saliva and prevalence of bacteria in vivo. however, the level of saliva-mediated adherence in vitro was in the following order: s. mutans. actinomyces s sanguis, which corresponded to their isolation frequency in plaque. these findings emphasize the importance of initial adherence to salivary receptors in bacterial colonization on teeth. further studies are needed to reveal if individual patterns in the in vitro binding characteristics of saliva lead to variation of colonization in vivo.

TI  == community-acquired bacteremia in human immunodeficiency virus-infected children in harare, zimbabwe.
AB  == background: hiv infection is common in mothers and their children in zimbabwe, and hiv-infected children are particularly susceptible to bacterial infections. there is little information on the etiology and outcome of hiv-related bacteremia in african children. methods: blood cultures from 309 hospitalized children in zimbabwe, of whom 168 were diagnosed as having hiv, were examined for pathogens.  the association among significant bacteremia, hiv infection and mortality was assessed in these children. results: the most common isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (31 children, 25 clinically significant), staphylococcus aureus (22 children) and streptococcus pneumoniae (20 children). nontyphoidal salmonella (10 children), escherichia coli (4 children) and klebsiella sp. (4 children) were the most frequent gram-negative bacteria. two children had rhodococcus equi pneumonia. hiv-infected children showed increased risk of bacteremia (odds ratio (or) = 2.68), especially if younger than 18 months of age (or = 2.94), and high risk of enterobacteremia (or = 15.76). there was no  significant association of bacteremia with nutritional status. mortality was 17%  overall but was higher in hiv-infected children up to 6 months of age (or = 2.81) and in bacteremic children of any age (or = 2.03). conclusions: prompt recognition of pathogens and early administration of appropriate antimicrobials is important in reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with bacteremia in hiv-infected children in africa.

AB  == given the hypothesis that root caries is the result of acid formation by acidogenic micro-organisms, the present study was performed to relate sucrose-induced ph response of dental plaque on root surfaces to the microbial composition of the overlying plaque. seventeen caries-active elderly chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. plaque ph was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious ph-measurement sites in each subject. the prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on brucella agar: prevotella intermedia, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium nucleatum,  campylobacter rectus, capnocytophaga spp., actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundi, streptococcus spp., s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus spp., and candida spp. there was no difference in plaque ph response on sound and carious root surfaces. the plaque ph response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites.  there was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. the ph response to sucrose was the same regardless of the  presence or absence of mutans streptococci. our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation.

TI  == electrophoresis of whole-cell soluble proteins of microorganisms isolated from bacteremias in endodontic therapy.
AB  == we have previously demonstrated that anaerobic bacteria are the microorganisms most frequently isolated from blood following endodontic therapy of teeth with apical periodontitis. phenotypic characterisation of the isolates suggested that  the bacteria in the blood originated from the root canal. the present experiment  using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) was carried out in an effort to verify these findings, and to further study the microorganisms involved in endodontic bacteremias. soluble cellular proteins were extracted from 11 reference strains and 26 bacterial isolates recovered from the  root canal and blood. these included propionibacterium acnes, peptostreptococcus  prevotii, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia. actinomyces israelii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus sanguis. the electrophoretic patterns mostly confirmed the identity of the isolates as determined by the biochemical and antimicrobial resistance tests. furthermore, with this typing method the species prevotella intermedia and prevotella nigrescens could be differentiated.  these species had been recovered from both root canal and blood. also, differences between subspecies of fusobacterium nucleatum became evident with sds-page, and the results indicated that the organism recovered from the root canal and blood was fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. vincentii. the electrophoretic patterns of the different organisms isolated from the root canal and the blood were similar, providing further evidence that the bacteria found in the blood originated from the root canal.

TI  == the relation of microbiologic data to aspartate aminotransferase enzyme activity  in gingival crevicular fluid.
AB  == gingival crevicular fluid (gcf), reflects the immune and inflammatory reactions and is itself a location for specific host-microbe interactions that lead to periodontal diseases. aspartate aminotransferase (ast) is one of the components of gcf that is released as a result of cell death. in this study, 40 periodontal  sites in 10 early onset periodontitis patients before and after nonsurgical periodontal therapy, with and without local metronidazole administration, were first examined for the ast enzyme levels in gcf and then evaluated for microbiological and clinical variables. in each patient, 4 sites (one site/quadrant) with a probing depth of > or = 5 mm were selected and treated with separate treatment protocols. certain microbial species including prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans(a. a.) were found more often and/or in higher levels in ast active sites (36/40 first measurement--9/36 second measurement), while other species (streptococcus and actinomyces) were found more often and/or in higher levels in ast inactive sites (4/40 first measurement--8/36 second measurement). eight post-treatment ast active sites revealed 1.5 mm of attachment loss, whereas 8 post-treatment ast inactive sites showed 1.37 mm of attachment gain. ast activity and microbiological-clinical data presenting such an agreement suggests that, ast level assessment would be beneficial as an adjunctive method alongside other clinical criteria, in guiding the clinician in periodontal treatment.

TI  == influence of ionic strength and substratum hydrophobicity on the co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs.
AB  == co-adhesion between oral microbial pairs (i.e. adhesion of a planktonic microorganism to a sessile organism adhering to a substratum surface) has been described as a highly specific interaction, mediated by stereochemical groups on  the interacting microbial cell surfaces, and also as a non-specific, critical colloid-chemical interaction. in a colloid-chemical approach, microbial co-adhesion is considered as an interplay between, amongst others, hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of ionic strength on the co-adhesion of streptococcus oralis 34 to either actinomyces naeslundii t14v-j1 or its mutant strain 5951 adhering to glass in a parallel-plate flow chamber. to this end, the ionic strength of the suspension was varied by the addition of kcl. another aim was to investigate whether substratum hydrophobicity affected the co-adhesion between the organisms  by allowing the sessile organisms (in this case the actinomyces) to adhere either to hydrophilic or to hydrophobic, dimethyldichlorosilane (dds)-coated glass. the  kinetics of co-adhesion of s. oralis 34 to the actinomyces decreased with increasing ionic strength, expressed as the ratio, chi, between the local and non-local initial deposition rates of the streptococci in the vicinity of, or far away from, the adhering actinomyces, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, ionic strength appeared not to be a determinant factor for the co-adhesion of s. oralis 34 with a. naeslundii 5951, either when the actinomyces  were adhering to hydrophilic glass or to hydrophobic, dds-coated glass. however,  for s. oralis 34 co-adhering in a stationary end-point with a. naeslundii t14v-j1 in the high-ionic-strength (250 mm kcl) suspension, co-adhesion was far less on hydrophobic, dds-coated glass than on hydrophilic glass. it is possible that the  hydrophobic fibrils on a. naeslundii t14v-j1 bearing the lectin responsible for co-adhesion were immobilized in the latter case by adsorption to the hydrophobic  substratum, making them less available for interaction with the streptococci.

AB  == coaggregation (interactions between two planktonic microorganisms) and co-adhesion (interactions between sessile and planktonic microorganisms) are believed to be important factors in the formation of dental plaque by many investigators, although others doubt whether coaggregation and co-adhesion occur  in vivo. it is known that coaggregation and co-adhesion generally occur equally well in buffer as in saliva, but the influence of temperature on the co-adhesion  of coaggregating oral microbial pairs in saliva is unknown. therefore, co-adhesion of streptococci suspended in saliva to glass with adhering actinomyces present (1.0 x 10(6) cells cm-2) was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber in the temperature range from 22 degrees c to 40 degrees c. in the range  from 22 degrees c up to 35 degrees c both pairs studied, streptococcus oralis 34  with actinomyces naeslundii 5951 and streptococcus oralis j22 with a. naeslundii  5951, displayed similar co-adhesion kinetics and co-adhesion in a stationary end-point, but around and above 37 degrees c co-adhesion almost disappeared. hence, we conclude that co-adhesion of coaggregating oral microbial pairs in saliva may be critically influenced by temperature, especially around the temperatures prevailing in the oral cavity.

TI  == serum antibodies to commensal oral and gut bacteria vary with age.
AB  == this study examined the relationship between serum antibody levels to selected bacteria from the commensal oral and gut flora with increased age in a healthy adult population. a total of 116 healthy subjects were studied consisting of the  following age groups: 20-39 years (group a), 40-59 years (group b), 60-79 years (group c) and 80+ years (group d). only significantly lower mean igm antibody levels to streptococcus mutans strain guy's serotype c were observed in older age groups (p < 0.001). with actinomyces viscosus nctc 10951 significantly reduced igm levels (p < 0.02) and significantly elevated iga levels were observed with increased age (p < 0.05). iga and igg antibodies to escherichia coli nctc 10418 were increased significantly in the older age groups (p < 0.001), whilst a trend  toward lower levels of igm antibodies was recorded with age. no changes in iga antibodies to streptococcus faecalis nctc 775 were observed but the lowest level  of igm antibodies were detected in the oldest age group (p < 0.05). mean specific activity was decreased with age with igm antibodies to the oral bacteria and increased with age with igg and iga antibodies to e. coli. overall, our results suggest a general reduction in serum igm antibody responses. this impairment in the circulatory igm immune response may contribute to the increased occurrence of infections in the elderly.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of supragingival dental plaque in chinese individuals.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the predominant supragingival cultivable bacterial flora in chinese individuals, using the experimental gingivitis model.  a total of 11 healthy dental students, mean age 22.5 years (range 20-25) were recruited. all were provided with once-a-week dental prophylaxis and oral hygiene reinforcement for 3 weeks to ensure gingival health. in the fourth week, after prophylaxis, the participants entered a 14-day period without any plaque control. a plaque sample was collected at days 1, 3, 7 and 14 from the buccal surface of the upper right canine, second premolar, first premolar and first molar, respectively. each sample was then dispensed in tryptic soy-broth transport medium and grown anaerobically to obtain pure cultures, which were subsequently identified. results showed that gram-positive cocci and rods were the predominant cultivatable species (51-61%) in the samples throughout the 14-day period; with time there was a decreasing percentage of cocci and an increasing percentage of rods. gram-negative cocci and rods increased in proportion with the plaque age (11-37%). streptococcus spp. were the predominant gram-positive cocci while actinomyces were the predominant gram-positive rods isolated. fusobacterium and capnocytophaga spp. were the two most frequent gram-negative anaerobic rods cultured. the results compared with those from other analogous studies from the west suggest the possibility of interracial differences in supragingival plaque flora.

TI  == shear bond strength, microleakage and antimicrobial properties of aelitebond.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the shear bond strength (sbs) and microleakage (ml) to dentin as well as the antimicrobial action against five strains of oral bacteria  of aelitebond single primer restorative system. materials and methods: fifteen molars were tested to failure for each of the four time periods: 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days and 30 days, after final cure. the test specimens were prepared on  the dentin surfaces of the extracted molars ground on 600 grit sic paper. the bonded cylinders were removed from the assembly apparatus after cure, stored in physiological saline at 37 degrees c for the four different time periods and subjected to a shear bond load at 0.5 mm/minute until fractured. for the microleakage determination, class v cavity preparations were done on the facial surfaces of the roots of 15 canines below the cemento-enamel junction and the specimens thermocycled (500x) between 8 degrees c and 15 degrees c in 2% methylene blue. the teeth were cut into 6 mm thick sections and the sections which included the restorations were separately dissolved in acid. the color intensities of the dissolved sections were measured at a wavelength of 590 nm against a standard curve which was constructed from the dye. the modified model cavity method of meryon & johnson (1989) was used to assess the antimicrobial properties of the restorative system. results: the mean sbs values (in mpa) were  found to be 10.3, 9.8, 11.47 and 9.9 after 15 minutes, 24 hours, 7 days, and 30 days, respectively. there was no significant increase (p < 5%) in the sbs after 15 minutes. the ml of 0.76 micrograms dye/ restoration was relatively low in comparison to the sbs values. the restorative system significantly (p < 5%) inhibited the growth of actinomyces naeslundii with 88%, streptococcus mutans with 42%, streptococcus sanguis with 39% and streptococcus oralis with 9%. however, the growth of veillonella parvula was stimulated with 49%.

TI  == salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == scba from streptococcus crista cc5a: an atypical member of the lrai gene family.
AB  == a new member of the lrai family of putative adhesin genes was cloned, from streptococcus crista cc5a, and sequenced. the gene, scba appears to be part of an abc transport operon and encodes a putative peptide of 34.7 kda. the protein contains a signal sequence with residues 17 to 21 (l-a-a-c-s) matching the consensus sequence for the prolipoprotein cleavage site of signal peptidase ii. scba is 57 to 93% identical, at the amino acid level, with the five previous sequenced members of the lrai family. surprisingly, scba does not exhibit adhesion properties characteristic of the other lrai proteins. strain cc5a bound  poorly to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite and did not coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii pk606. an scba insertion-duplication mutation that abolished expression (of scba was created. there was no difference in fibrin binding between this mutant and wild-type cc5a. since it is possible that scba could play a role in corncob formation between s. crista and fusobacterium nucleatum, this property was examined. the mutant strain retained the ability to form corncobs. on the basis of the lack of adhesin properties it appears that scba is an atypical member of the lrai family.

TI  == inhibitory effects of funoran on the adherence and colonization of oral bacteria.
AB  == funoran, a sulfated polysaccharide extracted from the seaweed gloiopeltis furcata, strongly inhibited the adsorption of mutans streptococci to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) used as an experimental pellicle and strongly desorbed cariogenic mutans streptococci pre-adsorbed to s-ha. colonization inhibition and anticariogenic effects of funoran were also investigated in experimental rats. the colonization of streptococcus cricetus e49 inoculated on the molar teeth of experimental rats administered funoran was less frequent than  that in a funoran-free group. the mean buccal and lingual, sulcal, and total caries scores of rat groups administered funoran were significantly lower than those of the funoran-free group. the inhibitory effect of funoran on periodontopathic bacterial attachment was studied in vitro. funoran strongly inhibited the adsorption of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and actinomyces species to s-ha and collagen-coated hydroxyapatite (co-ha) and apparently inhibited their attachment to the human gingival fibroblast gin-1 cell line. the present study indicates that funoran inhibits colonization by cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria and excludes them from human oral cavity.

AB  == lame pigs, up to 12 weeks of age, were necropsied to establish a diagnosis. of 175 pigs examined, 165 were confirmed to have arthritis by histopathological examination of joint tissues. lesions were most common in the elbow and tarsal joints and least common in the joints of the feet. typically, there was severe fibrinopurulent inflammation of synovial membranes regardless of the bacteria isolated. a bacterial aetiology was found in 114 (69%) of the 165 pigs. in arthritic pigs in which an aetiology was established the causative agents were staphylococcus hyicus ssp hyicus (24.6%), streptococcus equisimilis (26.3%), actinomyces pyogenes (13.2%), staphylococcus aureus (7.9%) and haemophilus parasuis (7.9%). while gender did not affect the prevalence of arthritis, there was an age influence, most of the pigs culled for arthritis being under 6 weeks of age.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and immunological profile of healthy, gingivitis and putative active periodontal subjects.
AB  == thirteen periodontally healthy subjects were monitored clinically for 6-12 months. clinical measurements at 6-weekly intervals included duplicate pd measurements, presence of plaque, redness, and bleeding on probing. baseline measurements consisted of 2 visits 1 wk apart. microbial samples were taken from  11 of the subjects who had completed at least 8 months of monitoring. levels of serum antibodies to 12 periodontal species were determined from 10 subjects. standard deviations of replicate pd measurements, computed for each subject, ranged from 0.2-0.3 mm over the monitoring period. plaque and redness increased during monitoring, and showed a weak association with pd change. baseline and follow-up distributions of pd changes indicated that changes of > 1.5 mm could reasonably be considered to represent active sites. five subjects demonstrated at least 1 site deepening by 1.5 mm over the period monitored, and these were considered putative active subjects. sites from 2 subjects showed pd increases in the 6 wk just before sampling, and these were considered to represent active sites. species associated with putative active subjects included actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, selenomonas noxia and prevotella nigrescens. streptococcus sanguis, s. gordonii and peptostreptococcus micros were associated  with inactive subjects. s. gordonii and s. oralis were associated with health, whereas p. nigrescens was associated with gingivitis. elevated serum antibodies were detected to a. actinomycetemcomitans in 4 subjects. the predominant microbiota of putative active subjects included some species previously associated with gingivitis, and some species previously associated with progressing periodontitis.

TI  == tandem genes encode cell-surface polypeptides sspa and sspb which mediate adhesion of the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii to human and bacterial receptors.
AB  == the highly conserved antigen i/ii family of polypeptides produced by oral streptococci are believed to be colonization determinants and may mediate adhesion of bacterial cells to salivary glycoproteins absorbed to cells and tissues in the human oral cavity. streptococcus gordonii is shown to express, on  the cell surface, two antigen i/ii polypeptides designated sspa and sspb (formerly ssp-5) that are the products of tandemly arranged chromosomal genes. the structure and arrangement of these genes is similar in two independently isolated strains, dl1 and m5, of s. gordonii. the mature polypeptide sequences of m5 sspa (1539 amino acid (aa) residues) and sspb (1462 aa residues) are almost wholly conserved (98% identical) in the c-terminal regions (from residues 796 in  sspa and 719 in sspb, to the respective c-termini), well-conserved (84%) at the n-terminal regions (residues 1-429), and divergent (only 27% identical residues)  within the intervening central regions. insertional inactivation of the sspa gene in s. gordonii dl1 resulted in reduced binding of cells to salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag), human erythrocytes, and to the oral bacterium actinomyces naeslundii. further reductions in streptococcal cell adhesion to sag and to two strains of a. naeslundii were observed when both sspa and sspb genes were inactivated. the results suggest that both sspa and sspb polypeptides are involved in adhesion of s. gordonii cells to human and bacterial receptors.

AB  == mycothiol [2-(n-acetylcysteinyl)amido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl- (1-->1)-myo-inositol] (msh) has recently been identified as a major thiol in a number of actinomycetes (s. sakuda, z.-y. zhou, and y. yamada, biosci. biotech. biochem. 58:1347-1348, 1994; h. s. c. spies and d. j. steenkamp, eur. j. biochem. 224:203-213, 1994; and g. l. newton, c. a. bewley, t. j. dwyer, r. horn, y. aharonowitz, g. cohen, j. davies, d. j. faulkner, and r. c. fahey, eur. j. biochem. 230:821-825, 1995). since this novel thiol is more resistant than glutathione to heavy-metal ion-catalyzed oxidation, it seems likely to be the antioxidant thiol used by aerobic gram-positive bacteria that do not produce glutathione (gsh). in the present study we sought to define the spectrum of organisms that produce msh. gsh was absent in all actinomycetes and some of the other gram-positive bacteria studied. surprisingly, the streptococci and enterococci contained gsh, and some strains appeared to synthesize it rather than import it from the growth medium. msh was found at significant levels in most actinomycetes examined. among the actinobacteria four micrococcus species produced msh, but msh was not found in representatives of the arthrobacter, agromyces, or actinomyces genera. of the nocardioforms examined, nocardia, rhodococcus, and mycobacteria spp. all produced msh. in addition to the established production of msh by streptomycetes, we found that micromonospora, actinomadura, and nocardiopsis spp. also synthesized msh. mycothiol production was not detected in propionibacterium acnes or in representative species of the listeria, staphylococcus, streptococcus, enterococcus, bacillus, and clostridium  genera. examination of representatives of the cyanobacteria, purple bacteria, and spirochetes also gave negative results, as did tests of rat liver, bonito, candida albicans, neurospora crassa, and spinach leaves. the results, which indicate that msh production is restricted to the actinomycetes, could have significant implications for the detection and treatment of infections with actinomycetes, especially those caused by mycobacteria.

TI  == experimental model for porphyromonas gingivalis infection in animals.
AB  == a virulence model suitable for studying the dynamics of porphyromonas gingivalis  infection, including the pathogenicity of p. gingivalis in experimentally induced infections of multiple organs was developed using mouse and hamster. virulence of p. gingivalis strains was expressed contrastingly in subcutaneous (sc) infection  in the murine abscess model (mam) and the hamsters abscess model (ham). subcutaneous infection in the mam was characterized by a gravity abscess, spreading from the primary site of inoculation downwards, frequently erupting as  a secondary lesion. in contract, s.c. p. gingivalis infection in ham was characterized as a palpable localized abscess at the primary site of inoculation. when the semi-solid agar (ssa) was added to the mono-culture of p. gingivalis, reproducibility of infection in both models was enhanced. p. gingivalis culture supplemented with haemin, or combined with oral actinomyces viscosus had its virulence overtly enhanced and often fatal in the mam. menadione, eh reducing agents and mixture with the streptococcus or a. neaslundii did not potentiate virulence in either mode. transtracheal challenge of the lungs of hamster with p. gingivalis initiated an early pneumonitis and later sequelae of necrosis and abscess formation. also, abscess was induced by direct inoculation of p. gingivalis in the muscles, liver and testes, but did not induce intra-abdominal abscesses. in conclusion, the ham applied with the ssa procedure caused a localized p. gingivalis tissue infection with practical advantages for quantitative and qualitative studies of p. gingivalis infections. this study also demonstrates the pathogenic potential of p. gingivalis by reproducing similar infections in multiple anatomical sites.

TI  == a flexible model for the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22 determined by three-dimensional 13c edited nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy and 13c-1h long-range coupling constants combined with molecular modeling.
AB  == we report on the conformation of a tetrasaccharide fragment in the repeating subunit of the cell wall polysaccharide of streptococcus mitis j22, a receptor for the lectin of actinomyces viscosus t14v in a bacterial coaggregation that is  important in the ecological interactions of oral bacteria. although there is considerable overlap of the 1h-nmr signals, some cross peaks can be extracted from conventional two-dimensional nuclear overhauser effect spectroscopy (noesy)  data on the polysaccharide. these data cannot be fit to a single conformation of  the tetrasaccharide fragment. therefore we have prepared a polysaccharide sample  fully enriched in 13c from which we have determined accurate noesy cross-peak volumes in a three-dimensional heteronuclear-resolved spectrum that allows accurate determination of many more noesy cross peaks than does conventional two-dimensional spectroscopy. we have also used the 13c enriched polysaccharide to measure accurate values of long-range 13c-1h coupling constants that can be correlated with glycosidic dihedral angles. molecular modeling calculations on the polysaccharide fragment, including molecular dynamics simulations, identify multiple low-energy conformations. this result is to be contrasted with previous  calculations on blood group oligosaccharides in our laboratory using similar methods that showed relatively rigid conformations with little flexibility of the glycosidic linkages. the present noesy and 3jch data can be reconciled with a model for the antigenic tetrasaccharide in which three distinct conformations are in fast exchange. we propose that some carbohydrate epitopes such as those of the blood group oligosaccharides are relatively rigid while others such as the tetrasaccharide fragment in these studies exhibit much greater flexibility.

TI  == co-adhesion of oral microbial pairs under flow in the presence of saliva and lactose.
AB  == co-aggregation (interactions between two suspended micro-organisms) between oral  microbial pairs has been studied extensively and is believed to be an important factor in dental plaque formation. however, co-adhesion (interactions between suspended and already-adhering micro-organisms) may well be equally important. the aim of this paper was to determine the influence of saliva and lactose on the co-adhesion of streptococci (s. oralis 34 and s. sanguis pk1889) to actinomyces (a. naeslundii t14v-j1 or 5951) adhering on glass under flow from buffer and saliva in the absence and presence of lactose. the kinetics of co-adhesion as well as co-adhesion in a stationary end-point of co-aggregating and non-co-aggregating pairs was studied in a parallel plate flow chamber by analysis of the spatial arrangement of co-adhering micro-organisms as a function of time.  for co-aggregating pairs, initial deposition rates of streptococci in the immediate vicinity of adhering actinomyces (local initial deposition rates) were  up to 5 to 10 times higher than the non-local initial deposition rates in buffer  and in saliva, respectively. in a stationary end-point of co-adhesion, 5 to 6 times more streptococci co-adhered with the adhering actinomyces than averaged over the entire substratum surface. a non-co-aggregating pair showed only minor preferential (co-)adhesion near the adhering actinomyces. co-adhesion in buffer was fully lost when lactose was added. however, addition of lactose to saliva did not inhibit co-adhesion, but co-adhesion became more reversible. detachment of micro-organisms from the substratum due to the passage of an air-liquid interface, as occurs in the oral cavity during eating, drinking, and speaking, was minimal when deposition was carried out from buffer to bare glass. major detachment of streptococci adhering to the substratum occurred when adhesion was  mediated through a salivary conditioning film on the glass, while detachment of adhering actinomyces and streptococci co-adhering with them remained low. it is suggested that, in the development of dental plaque, adhering actinomyces may act as strongholds for other micro-organisms, like streptococci, to adhere.

AB  == developing dental bacterial plaques formed in vivo on enamel surfaces were examined in specimens from 18 adult volunteers during the first day of plaque formation. an intraoral model placing enamel pieces onto teeth was used to study  bacterial plaque populations developing naturally to various cell densities per square millimeter of surface area of the enamel (w. f. liljemark, c. g. bloomquist, c. l. bandt, b. l. philstrom, j. e. hinrichs, and l. f. wolff, oral microbiol. immunol. 8:5-15, 1993). radiolabeled nucleoside incorporation was used to measure dna synthesis concurrent with the taking of standard viable cell counts of the plaque samples. results showed that in vivo plaque formation began  with the rapid adherence of bacteria until ca. 12 to 32% of the enamel's salivary pellicle was saturated (ca. 2.5 x 10(5) to 6.3 x 10(5) cells per mm2). the pioneer adherent species were predominantly those of the "sanguis streptococci."  at the above-noted density, the bacteria present on the salivary pellicle incorporated low levels of radiolabeled nucleoside per viable cell. as bacterial  numbers reached densities between 8.0 x 10(5) and 2.0 x 10(6) cells per mm2, there was a small increase in the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleosides per cell. at 2.5 x 10(6) to 4.0 x 10(6) cells per mm2 of enamel surface, there was a  marked increase in the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleosides per cell which appeared to be cell-density dependent. the predominant species group in developing dental plaque films during density-dependent growth was the sanguis streptococci; however, most other species present showed similar patterns of increased dna synthesis as the density noted above approached 2.5 x 10(6) to 4.0  x 10(6) cells per mm2.

AB  == the microbiota of root caries lesions of different grades of severity were studied. fourteen lesions were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed correlation of histopathologically distinguishable stages with specific and distinct microbial populations. dentin samples were ground in a sterile mortar and cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, apizym, and api50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. in initial as well as in  advanced lesions gram-positive bacteria accounted for approximately 90% of the cfut. the proportion of actinomyces, and in particular a. naeslundii was significantly higher (p < 0.05) in initial lesions than in advanced lesions. in contrast, the percentage of streptococcus and especially s. mutans was higher (p  < 0.05) in advanced than in initial lesions. surprisingly low (0.8% of the cfut)  was the percentage of lactobacilli in advanced lesions. gram-negative bacteria formed a minor part of the microbiota in both initial and advanced lesions. among the gram-negative isolates, prevotella, selenomonas, and bacteroides spp. were most noticeable. in advanced lesions, only the outermost layer of 0.5 mm thickness was populated by a high number of bacteria; the following segments harbored a negligible number of bacteria only. it is concluded that root caries is a continuous destruction process which is restricted to a subsurface zone of limited depth. the necrotic dentin is successively worn away, leading to a saucer-shaped cavitation which is repopulated by plaque. the creation of cavitations favors an aciduric flora. this might explain the succession of bacterial populations observed during the destruction process.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on actinomyces naeslundii genospecies in plaque from dental fissures.
AB  == this study describes the effects of varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on actinomyces naeslundii populations in plaque from human molar fissures. in each of 15 subjects two dental fissures with high levels of mutants  streptococci were selected. the experimental treatment consisted of the single application of a small amount of chlorhexidine varnish onto the selected fissures. the varnish was removed 15 min after application. one month after varnish application a significant increase was observed in a. naeslundii counts while the number of mutans streptococci had decreased significantly compared with preexperimental levels. from 85 randomly selected actinomyces isolates taken from blood agar plates before varnish application, 44% belonged to a. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 56% to a. naeslundii genospecies 2. from 106 isolates taken 1 month after chlorhexidine varnish application, 42% belonged to a. naeslundii genospecies 1 and 58% to a. naeslundii genospecies 2. at baseline 28% of a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were catalase-positive, but 1 month after varnish application 4% of the strains were catalase-positive (p < 0.05). it is concluded that chlorhexidine varnish application caused an increase of a. naeslundii in dental plaque, but induced no significant changes in the distribution of the two a. naeslundii genospecies.

TI  == susceptibilities of bovine summer mastitis bacteria to antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the susceptibility to 9 antimicrobial agents of 32 aerobic bacterial isolates and to 10 antimicrobial agents of 37 anaerobic bacterial isolates from 23 cases of bovine summer mastitis (16 actinomyces pyogenes isolates, 8 streptococcus dysgalactiae isolates, 3 s. uberis isolates, 3 s. acidominimus isolates, 2 streptococcus spp., 15 peptostreptococcus indolicus isolates, 10 fusobacterium necrophorum isolates, and 12 isolates of anaerobic gram-negative rods) was determined by the agar dilution method. all isolates except one bacteroides fragilis isolate (beta-lactamase producer) were susceptible to penicillin g, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol (the b. fragilis strain was susceptible to the last four), which had mics at which 90% of isolates were inhibited (mic90s) of < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06, < or = 0.06 0.25, < or = 0.06, and 4.0 micrograms/ml, respectively. spiramycin was active against the gram-positive aerobes (mic90, 1.0 microgram/ml) but not against the anaerobes (mic90, 16.0 micrograms/ml). similar trends were noted for  susceptibilities of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to ofloxacin (mic90s, 2.0 and  8 micrograms/ml, respectively). occasional strains of aerobic streptococci were resistant to oxytetracycline, but all anaerobes were susceptible. tinidazole was  active against all anaerobes (mic90, 2.0 micrograms/ml). beta-lactamase was produced only by the b. fragilis isolate.

TI  == effect of titanium on selected oral bacterial species in vitro.
AB  == titanium granules were tested for their antibacterial effect on strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces naeslundii, haemophilus parainfluenzae, fusobacterium spp. and prevotella intermedia in comparison with amalgam and two of its components, copper and tin. glass beads were used as controls. the number of viable bacteria was estimated in samples exposed to the various materials for 1, 3, 6 and 24 h, respectively, and the viable counts were  related to the baseline value. titanium showed low antibacterial effect on the species tested. copper and amalgam showed an expressed toxicity to all species and differed significantly from titanium and glass particles. gram positive streptococcus spp. and a. naeslundii showed a lower susceptibility to the metals  than the gram negative species. the antibacterial effect of copper and amalgam test particles on s. sanguis and p. intermedia was significantly decreased in the presence of serum. this study showed that some metals have a toxic effect in vitro on oral bacteria, a fact that may play a role in plaque formation when these materials are used for dental restorations. titanium did not have a similar antibacterial effect.

TI  == the microbiology and histopathology of human root caries.
AB  == based on numerous microbiological studies performed over the past several decades, it is clear that mutans streptococci can cause human root caries. s. mutans fulfills the criteria for implicating bacteria in the etiology of a mixed  infection. for example, s. mutans is found in high numbers in lesion sites, higher than on sound root surfaces in the same subject. subjects make elevated antibody levels to s. mutans antigens. the organism produces a number of virulence factors including metabolic acid from dietary sucrose and extracellular polysaccharides which facilitate bacterial colonization of tooth surfaces. eliminating or reducing the number of s. mutans reduces the number of root caries lesions and can even result in "healing" of incipient lesions. there is also data demonstrating the cariogenic potential of s. mutans in animal models. clearly, s. mutans fulfills the aforementioned requirements. further, there is also evidence  to implicate lactobacillus as being important in the pathogenesis of root caries  by virtue of its association with s. mutans in these lesions. there is less recent evidence regarding the importance of actinomyces in this disease. while this microorganism is present in root caries and while animal studies clearly point to their cariogenic potential, more recent studies with few exceptions fail to find much association between actinomyces and root caries. there is an important caveat, however. the actinomyces may have subspecies groups which are more highly virulent and more closely involved in the etiology of root caries than other groups. for example, a. viscosus serovar 2 is associated with root caries. this and other subspecies groups may produce certain virulence factors not found within actinomyces species as a whole. for this group of microorganisms and for other potential pathogens, techniques in molecular biology such as 16s ribosomal rna sequencing offers the hope of more precisely defining species and unraveling what may be largely problems in bacterial taxonomy. ribosomal rna sequencing may reveal taxonomic relationships not apparent with classical phenotypic or serologic analyses. other molecular methods, such as dna or rna probes to specific virulence factors may also reveal relationships between clinical lesions and microorganisms possessing these virulence factors. finally,  there are clearly a number of additional species which may have importance in root surface caries as shown in some studies. these techniques can be used to identify the distribution of novel, even uncultivable bacteria in root caries lesions and in this way establish their role in this important disease.

TI  == enhanced bactericidal activity of arm and hammer dental care.
AB  == purpose: to compare and contrast antibacterial activities of a baking soda-containing dentifrice, arm and hammer dental care (ahdc) with two fluoride dentifrices without baking soda (crest and colgate). materials and methods: a biphasic approach was taken, utilizing newly-developed laboratory model systems to: (1) assess the activity of brief exposure to dentifrices on single and mixed  cultures; and (2) determine the effect of multiple, short-term exposure of sucrose-colonized streptococcus mutans to simulate cumulative activity against cariogenic plaque. results: the short-term exposure assays revealed that s. mutans was significantly more susceptible to ahdc than either crest of colgate (p<0.05). moreover, exposure of mixed suspensions of bacteria by ahdc resulted in complete killing of actinomyces viscosus and significantly greater decreases in s. mutans (p<0.05). this enhanced bactericidal effect was not due to an alkaline  ph as ph-adjusted ahdc solutions exhibited similar activity. the comprehensive in vitro plaque studies showed that exposure of colonized s. mutans to ahdc resulted in significantly greater decreases in numbers of viable cells than crest (p<0.05). under the conditions employed, the baking soda-containing ahdc exhibited greater antibacterial efficacy overall than the standard crest or colgate pastes. these studies suggest that the use of ahdc may provide additional clinical benefit as a result of the enhanced bactericidal activity.

TI  == experimental root surface caries in hamsters the development of the disease after inoculations of two types of cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the development of root surface caries in hamsters fed a high-sucrose diet over a 24-week period after inoculations of two types of cariogenic bacteria. twenty-one day old male golden hamsters (n = 103) were divided into 5 groups. four groups were given diet 2000, and one group  was given a stock diet ce-2, of the groups given diet 2000, three groups were infected with actinomyces viscosus atcc 15987 and streptococcus mutans ntcc 10449 separately (av and sm groups) or in combination (avsm group), and one group remained uninfected. a grid method was used to evaluate the plaque accumulation,  alveolar bone loss, and root surface caries. after 12 weeks, root surface caries  developed mainly on the first mandibular molars in the three infected groups. at  24 weeks, the prevalence of root surface caries was highest in the av group, but  root caries scores were not significantly different among the three infected groups. in the groups sm and avsm, the molar crowns were extensively destroyed by caries, while in the av group the crowns were almost intact. it was concluded that challenge with actinomyces viscosus may be appropriate to study root surface caries in hamsters.

TI  == identification of a 100-kilodalton putative coaggregation-mediating adhesin of streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis).
AB  == streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis) bears coaggregation-relevant surface proteins which mediate lactose-inhibitable coaggregations with other streptococci. six spontaneously occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants  of wild-type strain s. gordonii dl1 unable to coaggregate with wild-type streptococcal partners were characterized. antiserum raised against wild-type cells and absorbed with cog- cells specifically blocked lactose-inhibitable coaggregations between s. gordonii dl1 and its streptococcal partner strains; it  did not block lactose-noninhibitable coaggregations with actinomyces partners. surface proteins were released from the cells by mild sonication treatment and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. a 100-kda surface protein from s. gordonii dl1 was identified by immunoblot analysis with the mutant-absorbed antiserum. each of the six cog- mutants lacked the 100-kda protein. several other oral viridans streptococci that exhibit intrageneric lactose-inhibitable coaggregations expressed an immunoreactive protein with about the same size as the 100-kda putative adhesin. it is proposed that the 100-kda protein is the adhesin which mediates coaggregation between s. gordonii dl1 and its streptococcal partners. the role of this putative adhesin in accretion of streptococci in early colonization of the tooth surface is discussed.

TI  == pathogenicity of bacteria using a simulated root canal system.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the reliability of an implantation test using teflon-simulated root canals for evaluating the pathogenicity of root  canal bacteria. models including suspensions of lyophilized strains (actinomyces  israelii, streptococcus faecalis, and porphyromonas asaccharolyticus) were implanted in rat subcutaneous tissue for 1 wk, and histological changes were observed. severe inflammation occurred around the models. among them, p. asaccharolyticus induced the severest inflammatory response. further study using  p. asaccharolyticus was conducted to compare the implantation test's ability to evaluate pathogenicity with that of an injection test at 1, 2, or 4 wk. tissue injected with a bacterial suspension showed no clear response through the experimental periods, whereas tissue around implantation sites showed a severe response at 1 wk. however, the inflammatory response subsided at later stages. consequently, further improvement is needed to investigate pathogenicity for long periods.

TI  == microbial induction of dentinal caries in human teeth in vitro.
AB  == the ability of lactobacillus casei, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus salivarius to induce dental caries was determined in vitro. a class i cavity (depth: 2mm) was prepared in extracted human caries-free premolars to make dentin blocks. the blocks were inoculated with these four bacterial strains in a monoinfective fashion and were incubated under anaerobic conditions. in addition to the monoinfection groups, mixed-infection groups of l. casei with  s. sobrinus or a. viscosus were also prepared. half of the culture medium was renewed every 3 days, and the ph of the medium was measured. after 4 or 12 wk, these dentin blocks were prepared by brown-brenn staining and by contact microradiography for light microscopic observation and for immunohistochemical staining. the final ph of the s. salivarius group was the highest among the experimental groups, at approximately 5.1; that of the others was approximately 4.3. bacterial invasion into the dentinal tubules was observed in all but the s.  salivarius group. among the monoinfection groups, the s. sobrinus group showed the highest invasion rate, followed by the a. viscosus group and the l. casei group. the invasion rate was also high in the mixed-infection groups. immunohistochemical staining revealed invasion only by l. casei, and not by s. sobrinus and a. viscosus. the invasion rate by l. casei was higher in the mixed-infection group with either s. sobrinus or a. viscosus than in the monoinfection groups. these findings suggest that lactobacillus might play an important role in the initiation and progress of dentinal caries, and that this bacterial species might exhibit a cooperative cariogenicity when it coexists with other bacterial species that surpasses its individual cariogenicity.

TI  == lectin recognition of host-like saccharide motifs in streptococcal cell wall polysaccharides.
AB  == viridans streptococci that participate in the microbial colonization of teeth have cell wall polysaccharides composed of linear phosphodiester-linked hexa- or  heptasaccharide repeating units, each containing a host-like disaccharide motif,  either gal beta 1-->3galnac or galnac beta 1-->3gal. whereas strains with galnac  beta 1-->3gal-containing polysaccharides co-aggregated with streptococci that possess galnac-sensitive lectins, strains with either host-like motif co-aggregated with actinomyces spp. the latter interactions reflected the specificity of actinomyces spp. lectins for common features of gal beta 1-->3galnac and galnac beta 1-->3gal. thus, alpha-linked glycosides of both disaccharides were much more potent inhibitors of co-aggregation than gal or galnac. six non-bacterial lectins also reacted with the streptococcal polysaccharides. in general, precipitation of each lectin with each polysaccharide involved binding of gal or galnac within the host-like motifs, but not saccharides outside these regions. the lectins of ricinus communis, abrus precatorius, codium fragile and agaricus bisporus were most reactive with the gal beta 1-->3galnac-containing polysaccharides, the wisteria floribunda lectin with  the galnac beta 1-->3gal-containing polysaccharides and the bauhinia purpurea lectin with polysaccharides containing either disaccharide. thus, lectin recognition of the streptococcal cell wall polysaccharides involved either the common or specific sides of the gal beta 1-->3galnac and galnac beta 1-->3gal motifs present within these molecules.

TI  == bacteria in human mouths involved in the production and utilization of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == earlier studies have demonstrated that pure cultures of oral streptococci produce hydrogen peroxide but none has found any free peroxide in dental plaque or salivary sediment despite streptococci being major components of their mixed bacterial populations. the absence of peroxide in plaque and sediment could be due to the dominance of its destruction over its formation by bacterial constituents. to identify which of the oral bacteria might be involved in such a  possibility, pure cultures of 27 different oral bacteria were surveyed (as well as dental plaque and sediment) for their peroxide-forming and peroxide-removing capabilities. peroxide production was measured for each of the pure cultures by incubation with glucose at low and high substrate concentrations (2.8 and 28.0 mm) for 4 h and with the ph kept at 7.0 by a ph-stat. removal of hydrogen peroxide was assessed in similar experiments where peroxide at 0, 29.4, 147.2 or  294.4 mm [0, 0.1, 0.5 and 1% (w/v)] replaced the glucose. hydrogen peroxide formation was seen with only three of the bacteria tested, streptococcus sanguis  i and ii (sanguis and oralis), and strep. mitior (mitis biotype i); levels of hydrogen peroxide between 2.2 and 9.8 mm were produced when these micro-organisms were grown aerobically and 1.1 and 3.9 mm when grown anaerobically. earlier reports indicate that such levels were usually sufficient to inhibit the growth of many plaque bacteria. the amounts formed were similar at the two glucose levels tested, suggesting that maximum peroxide production is reached at low glucose concentration. none of the three peroxide-producing organisms was able to utilize hydrogen peroxide but five of the other 24 tested, neisseria sicca, haemophilus segnis, h. parainfluenzae, actinomyces viscosus and staphylococcus epidermidis, could readily do so, as could the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment and dental plaque, both of which contain relatively high numbers of these peroxide-utilizing micro-organisms. the ability of the bacteria in plaque and sediment to degrade hydrogen peroxide was considerable and extremely rapid; peroxide removal and usually complete within the first 15 min of the incubation even when its initial level was as high as 294.4 mm. this almost overwhelming ability to remove peroxide was confirmed when peroxide-producing and -using cultures were mixed and when each of eight salivary sediments was incubated with  glucose and with peroxide at concentrations up to 294.4 mm. in the glucose incubations, no hydrogen peroxide was observed, indicating dominance of microbial peroxide removers over hydrogen peroxide producers.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

AB  == the bacteriology of cutaneous or subcutaneous abscesses (86 specimens) among intravenous drug users (ivdus) was compared with the bacteriology of abscesses (74 specimens) in patients with no history of intravenous drug use (non-ivdus). the ivdu abscesses yielded 173 aerobes and 131 anaerobes. staphylococcus aureus was the most common aerobe isolated (50% of specimens yielded this isolate), followed by "streptococcus milleri" (46%). the commonly encountered anaerobes were fusobacterium nucleatum (17%), pigmented prevotella species (22%), peptostreptococcus micros (17%), actinomyces odontolyticus (15%), and veillonella species (13%). the non-ivdu isolates included 116 aerobes and 106 anaerobes. s. aureus was isolated from 53% of these specimens, followed by coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%), "s. milleri" (19%), and streptococcus pyogenes (16%). the main groups of anaerobes were peptostreptococcus species (35%), bacteroides species (19%), and gram-positive bacilli (31%). overall, 67% of the ivdu isolates were of oral origin, compared with 25% of the non-ivdu isolates. of the specimens from ivdus and non-ivdus, 48% and 67%, respectively, yielded only aerobes, and 2% and 4%, respectively, yielded only anaerobes. sixty-four percent of the patients  had one or more beta-lactamase-producing organisms.

TI  == a retrospective review of cases of anaerobic empyema and update of bacteriology.
AB  == we conducted a retrospective study to update the bacteriology of 46 cases of anaerobic empyema that were originally studied between 1976 and 1993 at the wadsworth anaerobic bacteriology clinical research laboratory (los angeles). anaerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for all 46 pleural fluid specimens, and aerobic bacteriologic studies were completed for 41 of these specimens. thirty-seven clinical charts were available for review. a total of 161 anaerobic isolates (3.5 per patient) representing 64 species or groups were recovered. the most common isolates were as follows: fusobacterium nucleatum (19); prevotella oris-buccae group (13, 9 of which were p. oris); bacteroides fragilis group (11, 4 of which were b. fragilis); pigmented prevotella species (17, 8 of which were in the prevotella intermedia-nigrescens group); peptostreptococcus species (17, 9 of which were peptostreptococcus micros); eubacterium species (7); lactobacillus species (8); actinomyces species (7); and  clostridium species (7). nineteen if the cases were of purely anaerobic etiology; of these, eight were caused by a single organism: f. nucleatum (five cases); b. fragilis (two cases); and prevotella mangus (one case). of the 45 aerobic isolates (1.1 per patient), viridans streptococci were most common (21 isolates), followed by group d nonenterococcal streptococcus (four isolates). only nine gram-negative rods (six enteric and three nonenteric organisms) and one staphylococcus aureus isolate were recovered. the susceptibility to penicillin of 64 isolates was examined with the use of the spiral gradient method; 21 (33%) of  these isolates were beta-lactamase positive (mics ranged from 1.1 to > or = 54 micrograms/ml vs < or = 0.27 micrograms/ml for beta-lactamase-negative strains).

TI  == initial microbial adhesion is a determinant for the strength of biofilm adhesion.
AB  == this paper presents a hypothesis on the importance of initial microbial adhesion  in the overall process of biofilm formation. the hypothesis is based on the realization that dynamic shear conditions exist in many environments, such as in  the oral cavity, or on rocks and ship hulls. recognizing that an entire biofilm is detached during high shear once the bond between the initially adhering organisms and a surface (often constituted through a so-called 'conditioning film') is broken, it becomes clear that research should focus on detachment rather than adhesion. experiments were done in a parallel plate flow chamber in which attempts were made to detach adhering oral streptococci from glass by applying a high shear caused by the passage of a bubble, giving an air-liquid interface. detachment of streptococci from bare glass and from an initially adhering actinomycete strain appeared not to occur. however, substantial detachment of adhering streptococci occurred when adhesion was mediated through a salivary conditioning film, presumably because of cohesive failure in the conditioning film.

TI  == quantifying the strength of bacterial adhesive interactions with salivary glycoproteins.
AB  == we adapted an assay that has been used to estimate the strength of eukaryotic cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix adhesive interactions (mcclay et al., 1981) to quantify the strength of bacterial (streptococci, fusobacteria, actinomyces) interactions with salivary receptors. bacteria are centrifuged onto  human submandibular/sublingual or parotid-saliva-coated microtiter wells. plates  are sealed with pressure-sensitive, double-sided tape which allows them to be inverted and centrifuged again. the force required to remove the bacteria from the coated wells is a direct measure of the adhesive strength of the interaction(s) being disrupted. the bacteria-saliva adhesive forces we detected ranged from 1.6 x 10(-8) dynes (streptococcus sanguis 72-40) to > 1.1 x 10(-7) dynes (actinomyces viscosus t14 v). these forces were in the range to withstand the shear stress produced by salivary flow, which we calculated as approximately  6.1 x 10(-7) dynes.

TI  == bacteria in supragingival plaque samples can be killed by low-power laser light in the presence of a photosensitizer.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether bacteria in supragingival plaque samples could be killed by low-power laser light in the presence of a suitable photosensitizer. plaque samples were obtained from 10 volunteers, treated with either toluidine blue o (tbo) or aluminum disulphonated phthalocyanine (alpcs2), and then exposed to light from a helium/neon (hene) or gallium aluminium arsenide (gaas) laser respectively. following irradiation, substantial reductions were achieved in the total anaerobic count as well as in the number of viable streptococci and actinomyces present in the samples. in the  absence of laser light, the sensitizers themselves had little effect on the viability of the bacteria in the plaque samples. the hene/tbo combination appeared to be more effective than the gaas/alpcs2 combination, achieving log10 reductions of 2.95, 5.40 and 3.34 in the total anaerobic count, streptococci and  actinomyces respectively with a light energy dose of 1.31 j. if effective in vivo, lethal photosensitization may be useful as a means of eliminating plaque bacteria from a carious lesion prior to its restoration.

TI  == clinical pharmacologic aspects of cefixime in dogs.
AB  == the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefixime, a new third-generation orally administered caphalosporin, was determined for reference and clinical isolates from dogs. the mic of the drug for all but 1 of the 18 enterobacteriaceae isolates tested, 1 pasteurella canis, 1 rhodococcus equi, 1 streptococcus canis, and 1 streptococcus group g isolate, was less than 1.0 microgram/ml. the mic for 9 staphylococcus intermedius isolates ranged from 1.56  to 6.25 micrograms/ml and, for 8 sta aureus isolates, the mic values ranged from  1.56 to 12.5 micrograms/ml. pseudomonas aeruginosa, actinomyces sp, and a single  bordetella bronchiseptica isolate were considered resistant to cefixime. cefixime was administered orally in 2 phases at a standard dosage of 5 mg/kg of body weight to clinically normal adult male and female dogs. in the first phase, the drug was given once as a capsule and once as a suspension. in the second phase, it was administered once per day for 6 consecutive days in capsule form. serum drug concentration was determined by use of a microbiological assay, and the following kinetic values were estimated for each dog: area under the concentration-time curve, peak serum drug concentration (cmax), time of cmax, absorption half-life, and elimination half-life (t1/2el). the kinetic profile of  the drug in serum after oral administration of a single dose of cefixime was similar, with mean cmax values of 3.36 and 4.76 micrograms/ml after treatment with the capsule and suspension, respectively.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == periodontopathogens in elderly chinese with different periodontal disease experience.
AB  == if an etiological relationship exists between destructive periodontal disease and putative periodontopathogens, they would be expected to have a very low prevalence in periodontally healthy elderly persons. to test this hypothesis, 2 subgroups of elderly, rural chinese (a periodontally "best" and a "worst" group,  each comprising 15 persons) were identified in 1990 from a cohort aged 55-69 years, examined in 1984. assessment of changes in periodontal status over the 6-year period were possible by comparing detailed clinical recordings performed by the same examinator. subgingival microbial samples were taken at the mesial aspects of an upper central incisor and a lower canine and examined for the presence of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia group, prevotella melaninogenica group, capnocytophaga, selenomonas, campylobacter rectus as well as predominant streptococcus and actinomyces species. during the 6 years prior to microbiological sampling, persons in the "best" group had lost an average of 1.21 +/- 0.48 mm attachment, while persons in the "worst" group had lost an average of 1.60 +/- 0.94 mm. the latter group had lost 53.3 teeth, predominantly for periodontal reasons, in contrast to 1.8 teeth lost in the "best" group. "best" persons did not differ from "worst" persons with respect to the occurrence of the putative periopathogens, total viable count, and total streptococcal and actinomyces recovery. similarly, sites which had experienced an attachment loss > or = 2 mm during the 6-year period did not differ microbiologically from sites with less attachment loss. it is concluded that subgingival microbial characterization does not allow for a distinction between elderly individuals with markedly different periodontal disease experiences.

TI  == detection and incidence of the tetracycline resistance determinant tet(m) in the  microflora associated with adult periodontitis.
AB  == subgingival plaque samples were collected from 68 patients with adult periodontitis, enumerated on trypticase-soy blood agar plates, with and without tetracycline at 4 micrograms/ml, and incubated anaerobically for 5 days. each different colony morphotype was enumerated, and a representative colony was subcultured for identification and examined for the tetracycline resistance gene  tet(m). both pcr amplification and dna hybridization, using a fragment of tet(m)  from tn1545, were used to detect tet(m). the pcr primers (5'-gacacgccaggacatatgg-3' and 5'-tgctttcctcttgttcgag-3') were chosen to amplify  a 397 bp region of tet(m). tetracycline-resistant bacteria represented approximately 12% of the total viable count. the percentage of tet(m)-positive bacteria in the tetracycline resistant microflora varied from < or = 0.05 to 83%  (mean of 10%). tet(m) was detected in 60% of 204 tetracycline-resistant strains subcultured and identified. the tet(m) containing strains consisted of streptococci (55%, mainly s. intermedius, s. oralis, s. sanguis, and streptococcus sm4), actinomyces d01 (14%), bifidobacterium d05 (11%), and veillonella spp. (10%). tetracycline-resistant strains in which tet(m) was not detected included the prevotella and bacteroides species (41%, mainly bacteroides d28, p. intermedia, p. nigrescens, and p. oris). these results suggest that tet(m) is widely spread in the adult periodontal microflora, but it appears, with the exception of s. intermedius, to be mainly associated with microorganisms not  considered to be periodontopathogens. assessment of other tetracycline-resistant  genes in oral organisms is needed to fully evaluate the nature of resistance to this antibiotic in the oral flora.

TI  == oral bacterial attachment to titanium surfaces: a scanning electron microscopy study.
AB  == despite the wide use of dental implants, the understanding of the mechanism(s) of bacterial attachment to implant surfaces and of the factors that affect such attachment is limited. in this study, the attachment of oral bacteria--including  streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and porphyromonas gingivalis--to titanium (ti) discs with different surface morphology (smooth, grooved, or rough) was examined by scanning electron microscopy (sem). the most bacterial attachment was observed on the rough bsa-coated ti surfaces. the smooth surfaces promoted poor attachment for s. sanguis and a. viscosus. however, p. gingivalis attached equally well to both the smooth and grooved coated ti surfaces, based on direct cell quantitation and examination with sem. cell-surface fimbriae (which may play a role in adhesion) of both a. viscosus and p. gingivalis observed were associated with the ti surfaces. ti implant surface characteristics appeared to influence oral bacterial attachment in vitro. the in vitro attachment system has  proven its usefulness for future bacterial attachment studies with model implant  surfaces.

TI  == microbiological assessment of an improved stannous fluoride dentifrice.
AB  == recently, a new stabilized stannous fluoride (snf2) dentifrice (ssf) has been developed. the aim of the present work was to examine the antimicrobial activity  of snf2, and to assess the long-term microbial safety of this dentifrice in a series of in vitro and clinical evaluations. results of in vitro time-kill experiments with representative oral bacteria demonstrated that snf2 exerts broad antimicrobial activity against both gram-positives and gram-negatives and, in particular, has potent activity against streptococcus mutans. sixty-eight subjects participated in a nine-day plaque regrowth clinical study to assess the  short-term antiplaque effect of ssf. the results revealed no significant differences from the negative control, suggesting that snf2 does not detectably or directly alter plaque microbial viability or composition. separately, evaluation of microbial safety in a subgroup of 120 subjects participating in a six-month clinical efficacy and safety trial found no significant ecological shifts between ssf and the negative (naf dentifrice) control among 11 supragingival microbial populations examined. the potential for development of bacterial resistance to snf2 was assessed under both in vitro and clinical conditions. in a rigorous assessment of the ability of bacterial populations to develop either phenotypic or genotypic resistance to snf2, representative bacteria were exposed to continuous sub-lethal concentrations of snf2 in a laboratory chemostat for at least 9 days. results of time-kill experiments on exposed populations revealed no significant changes in susceptibility despite exposure of over 10(12) bacteria. based on typical spontaneous mutation rates of  10(-6) to 10(-8), these results suggested that the potential for bacteria to develop resistance to snf2 is low. evaluation of susceptibility to snf2 to over 800 bacterial isolates obtained over the course of the six-month clinical trial corroborate the in vitro findings, revealing no changes in susceptibility suggestive of development of resistance to snf2 is a microbiologically safe agent for oral use and support separate clinical observations demonstrating the safety  and efficacy of this stabilized snf2 dentifrice.

TI  == adherence of microorganisms to rat salivary pellicles.
AB  == numerous studies, using models to mimic the formation of the acquired pellicle, have concentrated on human saliva-coated hydroxyapatite; in contrast, although the rat is frequently used as an animal model, the information concerning the formation of pellicles from rat saliva is sparse. we compared the ability of streptococcus and actinomyces species to adhere to hydroxyapatite coated by rat saliva (rsha) and human saliva (sha). we also explored the influence of glucan synthesized in situ on the adherence of organisms. we show that each strain of organism has a distinct binding pattern, which was essentially the same with surfaces coated with either rat or human saliva. dissolved rsha beads revealed a  major protein band (35-49 kd), identified as glutamine/glutamic-acid-rich protein; acidic proline-rich protein (31-45 kd and alpha-amylase (66 kd) were also identified. overall, these in vitro data strongly suggest that the principles of bacterial adhesion to rsha are similar to those observed with sha.

TI  == plaque composition, fluoride tolerance and acid production of mutans streptococci before and after the suspension of the use of fluoride toothpastes.
AB  == although fluoride toothpastes are widely used for caries prevention, little is known about the impact of fluoride dentifrices on plaque composition. also the issue of adaptation of mutans streptococci to grow in vivo in a fluoride environment has received little attention. such an adaptation may be of interest  as it has been suggested that adapted mutans streptococci may show reduced glycolytic activity thereby being less cariogenic. in the present experiments the impact of the suspension of the use of fluoride toothpastes on plaque composition, fluoride tolerance and acid production of mutans streptococci was studied. pooled plaque samples from the lingual surfaces of the lower incisors were collected from individuals (n = 13) just before and 7 weeks after they had replaced their fluoride toothpastes (0.1-0.15% f) with a non-fluoride one. the samples were analysed for fluoride and the numbers and proportions of streptococci, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, actinomyces species,  and lactobacilli, respectively. the fluoride tolerance of the mutans streptococci was estimated by culture of the plaque samples on tycsb agar supplemented with of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mmol/l fluoride (naf) at ph 7.2. from each plaque sample six s. mutans strains were isolated for the measurement of the rate of acid production (vap) at ph 7 in the presence of 0, 5, and 10 mmol/l f. the overnight  final ph was measured in cultures of the s. mutans strains with excess of glucose and 0, 5, and 10 mmol/l f. the results showed that the removal of the fluoride pressure from plaque did not affect the numbers or proportions of the various species and genera of bacteria. the fluoride tolerance of the mutans streptococci, and the vap or the overnight final ph of the isolated strains had not changed. these results suggest that the use of fluoride toothpaste had not affected plaque composition, nor fluoride tolerance or acidogenicity of mutans streptococci. probably the amount of fluoride delivered by fluoride dentifrices to dental plaque is too low to induce such adaptations.

TI  == [main infectious agents involved in the etiology of lung diseases of small ruminants in northern cameroon].
AB  == between 1990 and 1992, 91 necropsies of small ruminants affected with pulmonary illness led to the isolation of the following strains of mycoplasma (m.): m. mycoides subsp. mycoides lc, m. ovipneumoniae, m. agalactiae, m. sp. type d2 and  m. arginini. eleven pasteurella multocida strains (serotypes a1, a3, a5, a7 and d2) and 11 pasteurella haemolytica strains (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 9) were isolated. corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, actinomyces pyogenes, staphylococcus sp., streptococcus sp., bacillus sp. and mycobacterium sp. were also isolated. thirty-two antibiograms were performed on pasteurella, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and actinomyces pyogenes strains. eighty eight p. cent were sensitive to penicillin g and oxytetracycline, and 84% to chloramphenicol; 50% were not sensitive to spiramycin and 47% to streptomycin. one capripoxvirus strain was isolated on sheep. pest of small ruminants (ppr) virus was detected by immunocapture elisa test performed on some lung samples. two serological surveys, one for contagious caprine pleuropneumonia (898 goats),  between 1991 and 1993, and one for ppr (902 sheep and goats) in 1993, were conducted in the north and far north provinces. no antibody against contagious caprine pleuropneumonia was detected. among the animals in the sample, ppr prevalence was 64 +/- 7% in the far north province and 14 +/- 3% in the north province. concerning control measures, a vaccination campaign against small ruminant pasteurellosis appears to be hardly feasible because of the antigenic diversity of the isolated pasteurella strains. ppr is endemic especially in the far north province. the efficiency of a vaccination campaign against ppr must be  estimated with a field survey.

TI  == human root caries: microbiota in plaque covering sound, carious and arrested carious root surfaces.
AB  == the plaque microbiota covering sound or carious root surfaces were studied and compared with that covering arrested root caries lesions. from each of these categories five extracted teeth were examined. the experimental design of the study allowed us to relate the qualitative and quantitative microbial composition to the degree of integrity of the root surface. plaque was sampled by a newly developed 'mowing' technique. plaque samples were cultured anaerobically on nonselective columbia blood agar plates supplemented with 5% hemolyzed human blood and on media selective for lactobacillus spp. and streptococci of the mutans group. the cultivable microbiota were quantitatively speciated using rapid id 32a, rapid id 32 strep, api 20 strep, api zym, and api 50 ch tests and sds-pag electrophoresis. regardless of the state of mineralization, the microbiota on all surfaces resembled marginal plaque associated with gingivitis. in addition to the gram-positive predominant facultative anaerobic genera streptococcus, staphylococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces, gram-negative anaerobes, predominantly bacteroides, prevotella, selenomonas, fusobacterium, leptotrichia,  and capnocytophaga, showed the highest isolation frequencies. on all surfaces actinomyces spp. predominated, with streptococci and lactobacilli forming a minor part of the microbiota. with respect to the detected proportions of anaerobes, microaerophiles, actinomyces naeslundii, prevotella buccae and selenomonas dianae, significant differences were observed between the three categories of root surfaces. the total cfu's on both caries-free and caries-active surfaces were significantly higher than on arrested lesions. in general, the results support a polymicrobial etiology for caries initiation on root surfaces, with a.  naeslundii, capnocytophaga spp., and prevotella spp. making specific contributions to the processes of cementum and dentin breakdown.

AB  == it is not known whether the aetiology of occlusal hidden caries lesions (hcl) is  identical to that of small visible lesions (svl). previous studies of the microflora of hcl suggest that relatively few species can be isolated. the aim of the present study was to compare the bacterial composition of dentine from 10 hcl and 17 svl in a population of children aged 8-18 years. the following bacteria were identified: actinomyces spp., mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii. streptococcus mitis, and lactobacillus spp. streptococcus mutans was found more often in the hcl group (p  = 0.03), while streptococcus sobrinus was found more often in the svl group (p =  0.05). however, proportions of both species were lower in the svl group as compared with the hcl group (s. mutans p = 0.07; s. sobrinus p = 0.03). lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. were found at similar levels in both groups. a  more diverse range of streptococcal species and veillonella was found in the svl  group (p = 0.001). these results show a less complex microflora in hcl as compared with svl, indicating that the aetiology of hidden caries might be different from that of open caries.

TI  == streptococci and actinomyces inhibit regrowth of streptococcus mutans on gnotobiotic rat molar teeth after chlorhexidine varnish treatment.
AB  == clinical studies suggest that the long-term suppression of mutans streptococci on tooth surfaces after intensive chlorhexidine therapy is mainly due to bacterial interference. other streptococci and also actinomyces naeslundii are proposed to  inhibit regrowth of mutans streptococci after suppression by the agent. we have tested this hypothesis in gnotobiotic rats associated with streptococcus mutans alone, or associated with s. mutans and strains of streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis biovar i, and  a. naeslundii. left lower jaws in these rats were treated with concentrated chlorhexidine varnish, and the return of s. mutans on the treated jaws monitored. in mono-associated rats, s. mutans regained the level of the untreated right lower jaw in approximately 1 week. in contrast, s. mutans remained suppressed for several weeks in rats multi-associated with other streptococci and actinomyces strains. the suppression was more pronounced in the rats fed on basal diet with little free sugars than in rats fed on a sucrose-containing diet. counts of other streptococci recovered quickly from the intensive chlorhexidine treatment, but a. naeslundii remained suppressed for at least 1 week. the findings demonstrate the  crucial importance of the oral microflora in controlling regrowth of mutans streptococci after chemotherapy.

TI  == kinetics of lactose-reversible coadhesion of actinomyces naeslundii wvu 398a and  streptococcus oralis 34 on the surface of hexadecane droplets.
AB  == most investigations of mechanisms accounting for intergeneric coaggregation have  emphasized stereospecific rather than nonspecific interactions. the purpose of this investigation was to determine the relative importance of lectin-carbohydrate and nonspecific hydrophobic and ionic interactions, using a model based on strains with one of the most well understood specific coaggregation mechanisms, the lactose-reversible coaggregation of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus oralis. the kinetics of coadhesion and desorption of coadherent bacteria were studied using s. oralis 34 bound to hexadecane droplets  as an affinity support for the adhesion of a. naeslundii wvu 398a. light, confocal microscopy and transmission electron microscopy confirmed that a. naeslundii cells adhered only to the s. oralis cells, not to exposed hexadecane between the streptococci. coadhesion was inhibited by lactose concentrations as low as 2.0 mm. the rate of coadhesion was halved at 60 mm lactose. the hydrophobicity inhibitors bovine serum albumin and defatted bovine serum albumin  and the salts licl and kcl failed to inhibit coadhesion in the hexadecane assay,  and bovine serum albumin also failed to inhibit coaggregation in a bacterial aggregation assay on glass slides. high concentrations of the salts achieved a 50% rate decrease in a. naeslundii adhesion to the s. oralis-coated droplets only when they were combined with > 20 mm lactose. sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds) and tween 20 inhibition was tested by the slide coaggregation assay because they tended to emulsify the droplets; sds was inhibitory. lactose selectively desorbed a. naeslundii from s. oralis-coated droplets at low concentrations equivalent to  those that inhibited coadhesion. neither licl nor kcl desorbed a. naeslundii from the droplets, even at 500 mm. at low concentrations, sds but not tween 20 eluted  both a. naeslundii and s. oralis from the droplets. although the sds results might suggest a degree of cooperative charge interactions, the results support the hypothesis that stereospecific, beta-galactoside-sensitive interactions have  a much greater impact than nonspecific interactions on the coadhesion of a. naeslundii and s. oralis.

AB  == to elucidate an ecological profile of several periodontopathogens, the authors examined the coaggregation between cells of porphyromonas gingivalis and oral bacterial strains including treponema denticola in vitro. coaggregation between cells of plaque bacteria was examined by visual assay and phase-contrast microscope. p. gingivalis cells coaggregated with strains of t. denticola and treponema socranskii subspecies socranskii, but did not coaggregate with t. socranskii subspecies buccale, t. socranskii subspecies paredis, treponema vincentii, or treponema pectinovorum. the extracted hemagglutinin from p. gingivalis was active agglutinating t. denticola cells. addition of serum and saliva somewhat affected the coaggregation, but no effects of tested sugars or amino acids were found. heat treatment of t. denticola cells did not reduce the coagregation: heat treatment of p. gingivalis cells eliminated it. growth inhibitory activity among these bacterial species was examined by the stab culture method. strains of t. denticola atcc 35404 and 35405 and t. vincentii inhibited the growth of some p. gingivalis strains, but not others. no strain of  treponema was inhibited by black-pigmented anaerobic rods. the coaggregation observed between p. gingivalis and t. denticola indicates the potential importance of their simultaneous existence in human periodontal pockets and development of the disease.

TI  == chemostat flow cell system: an in vitro model for the evaluation of antiplaque agents.
AB  == we developed an experimental in vitro model of dental plaque to assess the potential efficacy of antiplaque agents. the model used a chemostat, which provided a continuous source of 5 species of oral bacteria grown in an artificial "saliva-like" medium. this mixture was pumped through six flow cells, each containing two types of surfaces on which plaque formed and was subsequently measured. formation of bacterial plaque on hydroxyapatite surfaces was assessed by measurement of the dna and protein content of the plaque film. the amount of bacterial plaque formed on germanium surfaces was measured by attenuated total reflectance (atr/ft-ir) spectroscopy. plaque viability was also assessed by a fluorescent staining technique. the quantity of plaque formed on both types of surfaces gradually increased with the duration of flow (from 24 to 72 h) through  the cells during a 72-hour experimental period. the flow cells were then pulsed with experimental treatment solutions for 30 s, twice daily. parallel to results  of human clinical studies, the model was capable of discriminating among water, a placebo mouthrinse, and an active antimicrobial mouthrinse formulation containing 0.03% triclosan. it therefore offers a valuable alternative to animal model testing and allows for more rapid evaluations under well-controlled experimental  conditions.

TI  == the predominant cultivable flora of sound and carious human root surfaces.
AB  == little detailed knowledge exists about the composition of the human root flora. therefore, the predominant cultivable flora (pcf) was determined for samples of:  (1) plaque from sound root surfaces (srs) in eight subjects without root caries,  (2) plaque from incipient root lesions (irl) in eight subjects with root caries,  and (3) carious material from advanced root lesions (arl) in nine other subjects  with root caries. generally, one root surface was sampled per subject, and organisms-358, 512, and 389 for srs, irl, and arl, respectively-were identified by standard methods. it was found that: (1) streptococci, actinomyces, and veillonellae constituted 84.2, 57.8, and 65.7% of the pcf of srs, irl, and arl samples, respectively; (2) a wide variety of other gram-positive cocci and gram-positive and -negative rods was also present; (3) the pcf of many samples was often dominated by few organisms, the identity of which differed from sample  to sample; (4) a negative and no association with root caries existed for the pcf levels of the non-mutans streptococci (non-ms) and the actinomyces; and (5) mutans streptococci (ms) and lactobacilli (l) were not always present among the pcf of irl and arl, respectively, and non-ms were isolated from the pcf of most lesions and actinomyces from all lesions. our findings illustrate the complexity  of the root surface flora and suggest that root caries development involves organisms other than ms and l.

TI  == cell-surface-associated polypeptides csha and cshb of high molecular mass are colonization determinants in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the human oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii expresses, on the cell surface, two antigenically related high-molecular-mass polypeptides denoted csha and cshb, encoded by genes at separate chromosomal loci. the precursor form of csha is composed of four distinct segments: (i) a 41-amino-acid residue leader peptide, (ii) n-terminal 42-878 residues, (iii) residues 879-2417 comprising 13 repeat blocks of 101 amino acid residues and three shorter blocks, and (iv) a c-terminal anchor domain similar to those present in some other gram-positive bacterial cell-wall polypeptides. insertional mutations within csha reduced both cell-surface hydrophobicity and ability to adhere to oral actinomyces naeslundii. insertional mutations in cshb had less effect on hydrophobicity and coadherence.  however, expression of both polypeptides was found to be necessary for streptococci to colonize the murine oral cavity.

TI  == the effect of environmental ph and fluoride from the substratum on the development of biofilms of selected oral bacteria.
AB  == the present study was initiated to answer the question, "does fluoride from the substratum influence the accumulation of bacterial cells in an associated biofilm?" 'fluoride-bound hydroxyapatite' (fha) and 'fluoride-free hydroxyapatite' (ha) rods were prepared as test and control surfaces, respectively. biofilms of s. mutans bm71, a. naeslundii genospecies 2 wvu627, and l. casei bm225 accumulated on the surfaces of rods in a semi-defined, mucin-based medium in a chemostat. culture conditions were varied from ph 4.5 to 7.0 under carbon (glucose) limitation and excess, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1. low environmental ph reduced both the numbers of cells on ha surfaces during the early phases (from 0 to 2 h) of accumulation and the final numbers of cells in mature biofilms (20 h). the initial adherence of cells was unaffected by surface  fluoride under any of the conditions tested. similarly, biofilm cells under carbon limitation and those under carbon excess at ph 7.0 were not affected by surface fluoride. however, at low environmental ph values, ph 5.5 for s. mutans and ph 6.0 for a. naeslundii under glucose excess, the accumulation of biofilm cells on the fha surfaces was significantly reduced (p < 0.05-0.001). biofilm cell number doubling times of s. mutans and a. naeslundii were increased on fha relative to ha. biofilms of l. casei were not significantly affected, even at ph  4.5 in glucose excess. the results confirmed that fluoride from the substratum affected fluoride-sensitive biofilm cells but only under conditions of glucose excess ad low ph.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus gordonii pk488 coaggregation adhesin gene, scaa, and atp-binding cassette.
AB  == human oral viridans group streptococci that coaggregate with actinomyces naeslundii pk606 express surface proteins related to scaa, the coaggregation-mediating adhesin of streptococcus gordonii pk488 (r. n. andersen,  n. ganeshkumar, and p. e. kolenbrander, infect. immun. 61:981-987, 1993). the nucleotide sequence of the 6,125-bp ecori insert of pra1, containing scaa, the gene encoding scaa, was determined. six open reading frames (orfs) were identified. the orientation of four orfs, two upstream (orf 1 and orf 2) and one  downstream (orf 4) of scaa (orf 3), indicated transcription in one direction, whereas orf 5 and orf 6 were transcribed divergently. computer analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences identified a consensus binding site for atp (gxxgxgks) in the putative 28,054-da protein encoded by orf 1. orf 2 potentially  encoded a hydrophobic protein of 29,705 da with six potential membrane-spanning regions. scaa was 310 amino acids, 34,787 da, and contained the lipoprotein consensus sequence lxxc, also reported for the scaa-related proteins ssab, fima,  and psaa from streptococcus sanguis 12, streptococcus parasanguis fw213, and streptococcus pneumoniae r36a, respectively. orf 4 potentially encoded a 163-amino-acid protein of 17,912 da, which was nearly identical to the downstream adjacent gene products of ssab, fima, and psaa. no significant homology with other proteins was found with the putative orf 5 gene product, a 229-amino-acid protein of 25,107 da. orf 6 was incomplete and encoded a protein larger than 564  amino acids. this putative protein had a consensus zn2+ binding motif, hexxh, found among bacterial thermolysins and mammalian neutral endopeptidases and was 40% identical to a homologous 210-amino-acid region of human enkephalinase. the genetic organization of orfs 1, 2, and 3 was similar to those of the bacterial periplasmic-binding protein-dependent transport systems of gram-negative bacteria and binding-lipoprotein-dependent transport systems of gram-positive bacteria, and these genes appeared to encode abc (atp-binding cassette) proteins. this report describes a cell-to-cell adherence function associated with an atp-binding cassette.

AB  == suspensions of streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus were exposed to light from a gallium aluminium arsenide laser in the presence of aluminium disulphonated phthalocyanine and the numbers of survivors determined. exposure to the laser light in the absence of the dye, or the dye in the absence of the laser light, had no significant effect on the viability of the organisms. however, a light-dose-related decrease in the viable  count of all four target organisms was found on exposure to the laser light in the presence of the dye. the kills attributable to lethal photosensitization amounted to approximately 10(6) cfu in the case of each organisms. as appreciable kills were achieved within clinically convenient exposure times (30-90 s), these  results imply that lethal photosensitization may be a useful technique for eliminating bacteria from carious lesions prior to restoration.

TI  == cell surface protein receptors in oral streptococci.
AB  == streptococci have a vast repertoire of adherence properties which include binding to human tissue components, epithelial cells and to other bacterial cells. these  interactions are determined by the expression of cell-surface receptors some of which are species-specific. in the oral streptococci, two families of surface protein receptors with highly conserved amino acid sequences have been identified. the antigen i/ii family of polypeptides are wall-associated high molecular mass proteins (158-166 kda) with several binding functions that may be  attributed to different domains of the receptor molecules. the lrai family of polypeptides are surface-associated lipoproteins (32-33 kda) involved in adherence of streptococci to salivary glycoprotein pellicle and to oral actinomyces. a region of amino acid sequence similarity is evident amongst members of the two protein families in streptococcus gordonii. ligand-binding specificities of these receptor polypeptides may account for species-specific adherence and site-directed colonization of streptococci within the human oral cavity.

TI  == oral health status related to subgingival bacterial flora and sex hormones in saliva during pregnancy.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate oral health status in relation to subgingival microflora and sex hormone concentrations in saliva during pregnancy. oral health examinations were performed on 39 subjects: of 19 pregnant women (mean age 28.5), and 8 women in the fifth post-partum month (mean age 27.1), and  12 non-pregnant women (mean age 22.9). periodontal conditions of bleeding on probing, redness, swelling, and probing depth were examined. subgingival microbial compositions were examined with several selective media. concentrations of estradiol and progesterone in saliva were determined during pregnancy and the  first post-partum month. from the third to the fifth month of pregnancy, the number of gingival sites where probing caused bleeding increased concomitantly with increasing percentages of prevotella intermedia. the number of gingival sites with redness and swelling increased in the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy and decreased in the last month of pregnancy to the level of the second month. the gingival inflammatory signs, however, tended to increase in the first  post-partum month. the probing depth of gingiva gradually increased during pregnancy and the first post-partum month. percentage of p. intermedia increased  in the fourth month of pregnancy with increasing of hormones in saliva. the concentrations of hormones in saliva attained peaks in the ninth month of pregnancy. thereafter, proportion of p. intermedia decreased. as a further step,  these pregnant women were divided into three groups on the bases of percentages and detectable rates of p. intermedia. gingival inflammation was more extensive in the high group subjects in which more than 15% p. intermedia in total cfu was  detected; its severity also tended to increase.

TI  == the effect of indigenous bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells on subsequent microbial adhesion in vitro.
AB  == despite the numerous investigations on the adhesion of microorganisms to buccal epithelial cells, it is difficult to correlate different results, as disparate adherence values have been reported for a given organism. as one reason for this  disparity may be the indigenous or natural bacterial populations on human buccal  epithelial cells, the effect of the latter on subsequent microbial adherence in vitro was examined. there was a highly significant correlation between the degree of natural bacterial colonization on pooled buccal epithelial cells from 8 healthy donors and the adhesion of a single isolate each of streptococcus mitis,  escherichia coli and actinomyces naeslundii. however, no such relationship could  be established for candida albicans, streptococcus milleri and another isolate of streptococcus mitis. as in previous studies, variation in adherence values was found, both between samples from different donors, and from the same donor over time, but to a far lesser degree in pooled samples from different donors. these results imply that natural bacterial populations on buccal epithelial cells may affect the adhesion values derived from laboratory experimentation, and hence such data should be interpreted with caution.

AB  == previous studies have shown increased levels of proteolytic enzymes in affected periodontal sites. the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate the effect of proteolytic environments on the lysis and growth of selected oral bacteria associated with either healthy or diseased periodontal sites. the effect of trypsin, chymotrypsin and proteinase k on cell lysis was determined following  incubation with bacteria, whereas the effect of the same proteolytic enzymes on bacterial growth was tested using a disc-plate technique. overall, gram-positive  bacteria appeared to be more resistant to lysis than gram-negative bacteria. the  most susceptible bacteria were actinomyces spp., eubacterium saburreum, prevotella intermedia, capnocytophaga ochracea, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella loescheii, treponema denticola and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. the disc-plate procedure indicated that the growth of actinomyces spp., e. saburreum, c. ochracea, p. intermedia, p. loescheii, porphyromonas gingivalis and t. denticola were the most affected, more particularly by chymotrypsin and proteinase k. interestingly, the growth of f. nucleatum was rather stimulated by proteolytic enzymes. the observations reported in this investigation indicate that specific and general proteolytic activities have the ability to lyse some oral bacterial species and to interfere with their  growth. it is suggested that such effects could represent new mechanisms by which the bacterial ecology of subgingival sites may be affected.

AB  == bovine caseinate, derivatives of its glycosylated moiety [caseinoglycomacropeptide (cgp)], and caseinophosphopeptides were evaluated as inhibitors of adhesion of oral bacteria to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads (s-ha). all milk casein-derived components behaved as potent inhibitors of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 and streptococcus sobrinus omz 176 adhesion to s-ha,  whereas neither bovine serum albumin nor polyethyleneglycol were able to interfere with the adhesion of these strains. by contrast, none of the molecular  species tested was able to inhibit the attachment of actinomyces viscosus ny 1 to s-ha. on the other hand, casein derivatives were shown to displace human serum albumin from s-ha beads. they were also able to bind to the bacterial cell surface of all strains examined. collectively, these findings suggest that interactions between acidic casein-derived milk components and the biological surfaces involved in bacterial adhesion to s-ha result in an inhibitory effect that is selective for the oral streptococci examined.

TI  == bacterial-protein interactions in the oral cavity.
AB  == bacteria in the oral cavity must interact with salivary proteins if they are to survive. such interactions can take several forms, either providing nutrients, a  means of adhesion to surfaces, or resulting in aggregation or killing and, therefore, clearance of organisms. recent work has provided an insight into the mechanisms of some of these bacterial-protein interactions, revealing complexity  and diversity. for example, the interaction between a putative streptococcus mutans adhesin, p1 (b, i/ii, etc.), and a parotid glycoprotein results in adhesion when it occurs at a surface or aggregation when in solution, and different domains of p1 appear to be involved in the two processes. an alternative strategy is employed by actinomyces viscosus, which interacts, via its type-1 fimbriae, with a proline-rich salivary protein; however, this interaction occurs only when the prp is adsorbed to a surface. a. viscosus takes  advantage of a conformational change in the prp when it becomes surface-bound, which exposes a cryptic part of the molecule. a third, and intriguing, type of interaction is seen between various streptococci and salivary amylase. this does  not result in either adherence or aggregation but provides organisms with the ability to utilize starch breakdown products for metabolism. an understanding of  the mechanisms involved in bacterial-protein interactions could conceivably lead  to novel methods for controlling specific pathogens, but the systems operating in the mouth are numerous, complex, and diverse.

AB  == as part of our ongoing investigations involving lectin-mediated adhesion among oral bacteria, the receptor polysaccharide from streptococcus gordonii 38 was isolated and characterized. carbohydrate analysis of the hydrolysed s. gordonii 38 polysaccharide by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (hpaec-pad) showed galactose (gal) (2 mol), n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac) (1 mol), rhamnose (rha) (2 mol), glucose (glc) (1  mol) and galactosamine-6-phosphate (1 mol). mild acid hydrolysis of the polysaccharide yielded a heptasaccharide repeating unit. the structure of the heptasaccharide repeating unit was determined by high-resolution nmr spectroscopy which includes various homonuclear (dqf-cosy, tqf-cosy, noesy and hohaha) and heteronuclear experiments (hmqc), including linkage assignments by 1h-13c long-range correlation (hmbc). complete 1h and 13c nmr assignments for the intact polysaccharide yielded the covalent structure of a heptasaccharide repeating unit: [formula: see text] the structure of the strain 38 polysaccharide is closely related to those of streptococcus mitis j22 and streptococcus oralis 34.  thus, the difference between the strain 38 and j22 heptasaccharides was at their  reducing ends, with galnac beta-(1-->3)-gal in the former and gal beta-(1-->3)-galnac in the latter, while the difference between the 38 heptasaccharide and 34 hexasaccharide was at the non-reducing ends, where a rhamnose branch occurred in the former but not the latter structure. when compared by their quantitative precipitin curves with rabbit antibodies against each streptococcal strain, the strain 38 polysaccharide reacted more like the polysaccharide of strain j22 than that of strain 34. in contrast, each strain was recognized by the gal- and galnac-reactive lectins of actinomyces spp., but only  strains 38 and 34 were recognized by galnac-sensitive lectins of other streptococci. these findings strongly support the hypothesis that the immunogenic features of these polysaccharides are distinct from those detected by lectin binding.

AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether pyrophosphate, the anticalculus component of tartar-control dentifrices, exerts antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria commonly found in supragingival plaque. minimal inhibitory concentrations of pyrophosphate were determined for streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces  naeslundii. all of the bacteria tested were susceptible to pyrophosphate with identical minimal inhibitory concentrations of 0.67% wt/vol (25 mm). bactericidal kinetics assays revealed that both s. mutans and a. viscosus were killed by pyrophosphate, with the latter being considerably more susceptible. the mechanism of killing was not due to high ionic strength, as comparable controls showed no loss in numbers of viable cells. brief exposure (two 5-min incubations) of s. mutans to pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate caused pronounced inhibition of growth over the 24-h test period. under the constraints of the conditions used, these studies indicate that pyrophosphate and sodium dodecyl sulfate can substantially inhibit the growth of oral bacteria. these compounds may affect the oral microflora of patients who routinely use tartar-control dentifrices and mouthrinses.

TI  == the influence of saliva on interbacterial adherence.
AB  == the mechanism of bacterial adherence to the mat of bacteria in preformed dental plaque is not well defined. this study measured the influence of saliva on the adherence of bacteria in suspension to a continuous bacterial surface in vitro. twenty different pairs of bacteria were tested, consisting of streptococcus spp., haemophilus spp. and actinomyces spp. the species were chosen based on the parameters of coaggregation, and salivary agglutination. the results were expressed as bacteria that adhered per mm2 of bacterial surface. when both the surface bacteria and the bacteria in suspension agglutinated in saliva, interbacterial adherence was increased 2.5-fold when a salivary coating was placed on the surface. when one or both of the bacteria did not agglutinate in saliva, interbacterial adherence was increased only slightly when the surface was saliva-coated. the results suggested that salivary-mediated adherence is significant to plaque formation once the tooth surface becomes covered with bacteria. thus bacteria that are capable of agglutinating in saliva may have a distinct advantage in colonization of the plaque surface.

TI  == characteristics of accumulation of oral gram-positive bacteria on mucin-conditioned glass surfaces in a model system.
AB  == strains of streptococcus, actinomyces and lactobacillus were grown on glass surfaces in semi-defined medium (ph 7.0) with mucin, at a dilution rate of d = 0.1 h-1, in a modified chemostat. the accumulation of cells followed four phases. in phase 1 (0-1 h), cells did not divide on the surfaces and adhesion accounted for rapid accumulation. phase 2 (1-4 h) comprised adhesion and cell division, and accumulation slowed, cell number doubling times (cdt) streptococcus, 2.7 h to 8.6 h, actinomyces, 2.3 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 3.6 h to 3.8 h. cell division on surfaces accounted for accumulation in phase 3 (4 h to 12 h): cdt streptococcus, 1.7 h to 5.2 h, actinomyces, 2.4 h to 7.5 h and lactobacillus, 2.2 h to 7.2 h. the biofilm stabilized in phase 4, cdt 18.5 h to 90.2 h. the numbers  (10(6) colony-forming units per cm2) of cells in stable biofilms were streptococcus, 4.02 to 5.12, actinomyces, 12.5 and 34.0 and lactobacillus, 2.77.  accumulation increased (cdt 0.9 h-2.7 h) when cells were exposed to glucose excess or high dilution rates and phase 2 of accumulation did not occur.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine varnish on streptococci in dental plaque from occlusal fissures.
AB  == the treatment of tooth surfaces with chlorhexidine varnish may lead to long-lasting suppression of mutants streptococci in dental plaque. microbiological observations following varnish treatment suggest that this prolonged suppression might be caused by bacterial interference. to investigate whether physiologically related organisms, such as other streptococcus species, compete with mutans streptococci in the ecosystem, we have analyzed streptococcal populations on the tooth surface before and after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. occlusal surfaces with high numbers of mutans streptococci were selected in human volunteers and treated with chlorhexidine varnish. analyses of  sequentially collected plaque samples confirmed that s. oralis-group streptococci returned to baseline levels shortly after the chlorhexidine application, while actinomyces naeslundii populations reached prestudy or even higher levels only several days after treatment. mutans streptococci, however, were below the detection level in the 14-day samples, except in 1 individual. the pattern of recolonization by individual streptococcus species after chlorhexidine application closely resembled that of cleaned enamel surfaces: s. oralis and s. sanguis were primary colonizers while s. gordonii became dominant at a later stage. it is concluded that after intensive chlorhexidine treatment, a normal oral microflora reestablished, characterized by low proportions of mutans streptococci.

TI  == a comparison of primary root caries lesions classified according to colour.
AB  == three hundred and ninety-five primary root caries lesions in 117 patients were included in this study. each lesion was clinically characterised (colour, dimensions, distance from gingival margin and texture) and a sample of infected or altered dentine was taken using a standardised sampling procedure. the relationships between the colour and the microflora, texture, physical dimensions and distance from the gingival margin of the lesions were investigated. lesions in each colour group (light brown, yellow, dark brown and black) were identified  in each texture category (soft, leathery and hard), except for black lesions which were recorded as only soft or leathery. black soft and black leathery lesions had a significantly greater area and harboured more lactobacilli than all other types of lesions while black leathery lesions also harboured significantly  more yeasts. there were no significant differences in the number of bacteria or mutans streptococci isolated from soft or leathery lesions irrespective of lesion colour. overall, these data indicate that the colour of primary root caries lesions is not a reliable indicator of primary root caries activity. assessment of the clinical severity of primary root caries lesions requires consideration of lesion texture and the distance of the lesion from the gingival margin rather than the colour of the lesion.

AB  == the levels of selected cariogenic and obligately anaerobic bacteria have been compared in carious dentine taken from fissures, smooth surfaces, and root surfaces. the numbers of infected dentinal tubules were determined by immunohistological staining using species-specific antisera against selected bacteria. selective localization was observed; mutans streptococci were the predominant bacteria in dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal caries,  but not from root surface caries. the proportion of mutans streptococci was higher in the shallow and middle layers of dentine from fissures and smooth surface coronal carious lesions than from the deep layers. in root surface caries, actinomyces spp. were the predominant bacteria, and were present at higher levels in the deep layer of root lesions than in the shallow and middle layers. the proportion of lactobacillus spp. was relatively low despite its high  detection frequency in all layers of the three types of carious lesion. immunohistological staining with species-specific antisera was able to reveal the distribution and the localization of various bacteria in carious dentine.

TI  == coaggregation between bacterial species.
AB  == bacterial coaggregation, or interbacterial adherence, is one mechanism involved in the development of bacterial biofilms that are found on surfaces in nature. assays used to measure coaggregation rely on the interaction of bacterial cells in suspension or attachment of one species to a second species that has been fixed to a solid substrate. both semiquantitative and quantitative assays are described. these methods have also been used to determine the nature of the adherence and molecules involved in mediating the interaction, to characterize potential inhibitors, to isolate the bacterial adhesins and receptors, and to isolate adherence-deficient mutant strains. each of the assay systems offers different advantages, with significant variations in sensitivity. selection of a  particular assay system should depend on the goals of the study to be performed.

TI  == a microbiological study of recurrent dentinal caries.
AB  == a cross-sectional microbiological study of recurrent (secondary) dentinal caries  was conducted. freshly extracted human teeth containing amalgam restorations judged to be clinically intact were scrubbed with chlorhexidine soap and soaked in povidone-iodine solution. the teeth were then split to remove the fillings and examined for dentinal caries. of 54 teeth examined, 22 (40%) were free of dentinal caries in the restored site. the remainder were assigned to arbitrary groups of questionable (15), initial (8) and active caries (9), based on the amount of dentinal decay observed. comparison of pre-extraction bite-wing radiographs with the in situ findings revealed the sensitivity for secondary caries detection to be only about 50%. in contrast, the specificity for absence of caries was 73%. there was considerable variation in the numbers and types of micro-organisms found in dentine samples from lesions of comparable severity. facultatively, anaerobic streptococci were the most numerous and most prevalent micro-organisms in the affected dentine, but no single species was significantly  associated with recurrent caries. mutans streptococci were found in 40% of sites  with any degree of caries and in only 3 of the 9 sites with the most caries. homofermentative lactobacilli were present in 18 of the 54 dentine samples, including 4 from caries-free sites. while the prevalence and numbers of lactobacilli increased with the degree of caries, they occurred in less than half of the affected dentine samples. actinomyces occurred in 15 of 32 affected sites  but only in 2 of the 9 most active sites. their numbers never exceeded 3 x 10(3)  cfu/mg.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == saliva-bacterium interactions in oral microbial ecology.
AB  == saliva is thought to have a significant impact on the colonization of microorganisms in the oral cavity. salivary components may participate in this process by one of four general mechanisms: binding to microorganisms to facilitate their clearance from the oral cavity, serving as receptors in oral pellicles for microbial adhesion to host surfaces, inhibiting microbial growth or mediating microbial killing, and serving as microbial nutritional substrates. this article reviews information pertinent to the molecular interaction of salivary components with bacteria (primarily the oral streptococci and actinomyces) and explores the implications of these interactions for oral bacterial colonization and dental plaque formation. knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling bacterial colonization of the oral cavity may suggest methods to prevent not only dental plaque formation but also serious medical infections that may follow microbial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

AB  == prevention mouthrinse was designed to serve as a vital supplement to normal oral  hygiene procedures. to determine the antimicrobial potency of this mouthrinse, minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics), bactericidal kinetics, and short-term exposure studies were conducted. a spectrum of oral microorganisms was employed in this investigation: streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, fusobacterium nucleatum, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, serratia  marcescens and candida albicans. microorganisms were cultured in standard enriched media and under appropriate atmospheric conditions. inhibition assays were conducted in tubes, with each mouthrinse dilution assayed in triplicate. mic determinations revealed that all of the microorganisms studied were highly susceptible to prevention mouthrinse, with mics ranging from 16-fold to 128-fold  dilutions. bactericidal kinetics assays showed rapid killing of the test organisms in the presence of the mouthrinse. brief (5-minute) exposure of s. mutans to 8-fold diluted mouthrinse resulted in a substantial delay in growth. under the constraints of this type of study, prevention mouthrinse exhibited potent antimicrobial activity against all of the microorganisms studied. we support the notion that prevention mouthrinse may be a valuable supplement to normal oral hygiene procedures. a 6-month clinical trial assessing the in vivo efficacy of prevention mouthrinse is currently being conducted.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

AB  == the ability of oral bacteria to adhere to surfaces is associated with their pathogenicity. actinomyces can adhere to pellicle and cells through extracellular fimbriae. research on adhesion of actinomyces has been conducted with use of hydroxyapatite (ha) coated with mammalian-derived salivary constituents, whereas  the bacterial-derived components of the acquired pellicle have been largely ignored. the influence of the cell-free bacterial enzyme, glucosyltransferase (gtf), on adhesion of human and rodent isolates of actinomyces viscosus was examined. cell-free gtf was adsorbed onto parotid saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha). next, a. viscosus was exposed to the pellicle following the synthesis of glucan formed in situ by gtf. glucans formed on the pellicle served as binding sites for adhesion of a rodent strain of a. viscosus. conversely, the presence of in situ glucans on sha reduced the adhesion of human isolates of a. viscosus compared with their adhesion to sha. adhesion of the rodent strains may be facilitated through a dextran-binding protein, since the rodent strains aggregated in the presence of dextrans and mutan. the human isolates were not aggregated by dextran or mutan. pellicle harboring a. viscosus rodent strains interfered with the subsequent adhesion of streptococcus mutans to the bacterial-coated pellicle. in contrast, the adhesion of s. mutans to pellicle was not decreased when the pellicle was pre-exposed to a human isolate of a. viscosus. the experimental data suggest that human and the rodent isolates of a.  viscosus have distinct glucan adhesion properties.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacteriologic findings in peritonsillar abscesses in young adults.
AB  == aspirated pus samples from 124 patients with peritonsillar abscess were cultured  quantitatively for aerobes and anaerobes. a total of 98% of the samples yielded bacteria. of the 550 isolates obtained (mean, 4.4 per patient), 143 were aerobes  (representing 16 species or groups) and 407 were anaerobes (representing 40 species or groups). aerobes were isolated from 86% of patients-alone in 20 cases  and together with anaerobes in 87. the most common aerobic isolates were streptococcus pyogenes (isolated from 45% of patients), streptococcus milleri group organisms (27%), haemophilus influenzae (11%), and viridans streptococci (11%). anaerobes were isolated from 82% of the samples and as a sole finding from 15 abscesses. fusobacterium necrophorum and prevotella melaninogenica were both isolated from 38% of patients, prevotella intermedia from 32%, peptostreptococcus micros from 27%, fusobacterium nucleatum from 26%, and actinomyces odontolyticus  from 23%. the rate of previous tonsillar/peritonsillar infections was lowest (25%) among patients infected with s. pyogenes and highest (52%) among those infected with f. necrophorum (p < .01). recurrences and/or related tonsillectomies were more common among patients infected with f. necrophorum than among those infected with s. pyogenes (57% vs. 19%; p < .0001) or with s. milleri group organisms (43% vs. 19%; p < .05). beta-lactamase was produced by only 38% of the 73 isolates of prevotella species tested; however, 56% of the 36 patients  studied harbored one or more such strains.

AB  == the strains formerly classified as streptococcus anginosus or "streptococcus milleri" have now been recognized as three distinct species, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, and streptococcus intermedius. streptococcus morbillorum has been transferred into the genus gemella. four new species within the genus peptostreptococcus were recently named. a recent addition to the genus clostridium is clostridium argentinense, which includes clostridium botulinum type g. two new species of actinomyces have been introduced: actinomyces georgiae and actinomyces gerencseriae. arachnia propionica was shown to be related to propionibacteria and has been renamed propionibacterium propionicum. eubacterium yurii was named to contain "test-tube  brush" bacteria found in subgingival plaque. lactobacillus uli and lactobacillus  rimae are obligately anaerobic lactobacilli found in periodontal pockets. bilophila is a new genus of gram-negative bacilli. wolinella recta and wolinella  curva are now included in the genus campylobacter. the taxonomic position of mobiluncus, currently assigned to the family bacteroidaceae, remains uncertain.

TI  == simultaneous caries induction and calculus formation in rats.
AB  == weanling specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats were fed a high-calcium, high-phosphorus diet with various levels of sucrose and inoculated with streptococcus sobrinus strain 6715-13wt and actinomyces viscosus strain omz-105 in order to determine whether calculus and caries could develop simultaneously. rats consumed diets designated rc-16-5, rc-16-25, or rc-16-50 which partially replaced the corn starch component with progressively higher levels of sucrose, thus, to 5, 25, or 50% sucrose. in general, bacterial recoveries of a. viscosus declined with higher sucrose content of the diet, but a pattern of recovery for s. sobrinus was less clear with respect to dietary sucrose. s. sobrinus, however, was recovered at higher percentages from the tooth surface flora at the later two of three sampling dates. most calculus--identified by the brittle quality, staining characteristics, and apatitic x-ray diffraction patterns of tooth surface deposits--was formed on the maxillary molars, and most carious lesions occurred on mandibular molars. while there was minimal association of the calculus score with the amount of sucrose in the diet, calculus scores increased  greatly from 23 to 43 days after infectious challenge. caries scores, of both fissure and smooth surfaces, by contrast, increased in a dose-response fashion with increasing dietary sucrose and with time. it is thus possible to induce calculus formation and caries simultaneously in specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats consuming a high-calcium and -phosphorus diet conducive to calculus formation and containing sucrose.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == isolation of gram-positive rods that resemble but are clearly distinct from actinomyces pyogenes from mixed wound infections.
AB  == beginning in 1990, gram-positive rods resembling actinomyces pyogenes were found  with increasing frequency in mixed cultures from various infectious processes, most of them from patients with otitis, empyema, pilonidal cysts, perianal abscesses, and decubitus ulcers. ribotyping and hybridization showed that these gram-positive rods could be divided into five groups not related to known actinomyces species. biochemical markers for reliable differentiation into these  groups, however, could not be found. therefore, naming new species is not warranted unless parameters are discovered that allow identification without dna  hybridization. these gram-positive rods have been isolated only in mixed cultures with anaerobes, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus "milleri," enterococci, and  gram-negative rods. their exact role in these possibly synergistic infections needs further investigation.

TI  == characterization of hemolytic bacteria in subgingival plaque.
AB  == three-quarters of the patients with periodontal diseases surveyed in this study had one or more distinct types of hemolytic bacteria in their subgingival plaque. twelve different species of bacteria were identified, belonging to five genera (actinomyces, streptococcus, staphylococcus, prevotella, and actinobacillus). nine hemolytic isolates, consisting of four prevotella denticola strains, two actinomyces naeslundii genospecies 2 strains, and one each of p. melaninogenica,  streptococcus constellatus, and a. naeslundii genospecies 1 strains were characterized. incorporation of pronase into blood agar medium inhibited hemolysis by all of the isolates, suggesting a proteinaceous component for each of their hemolysins. with one exception, hemolysin production appeared to be regulated by the concentration of environmental iron: exogenous hemin was found to inhibit hemolysin production, and the iron scavenging compound, 2,2'- dipyridyl, was found to promote hemolysin production by all of the strains except for the s. constellatus isolate. genomic libraries of each of the hemolytic plaque isolates were prepared in escherichia coli using pbr322. hemolytic clones  were isolated on blood agar medium containing ampicillin at frequencies ranging from 1-6.7 x 10(-4). extensive restriction mapping revealed regions of homology in the case of clones derived from three p. denticola strains isolated from the same subjects. two of the p. denticola-derived clones were virtually identical throughout the entrety of their > 5 kb inserts. the clone derived from the third  strain showed good homology to the other two within a 1.3 kb region, but the flanking dna showed no homology even though all three p. denticola isolates were  shown to be clonally related by ribotyping.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == colonization of retrieved polytetrafluoroethylene membranes: morphological and microbiological observations.
AB  == polytetrafluoroethylene membranes (eptfe) used in guided tissue regeneration (gtr) are accessible to colonization by oral bacteria. the bacterial composition  of the adherent biomass is unknown. we examined a total of 6 membranes that were  retrieved after 4 to 6 weeks from human periodontitis sites, using optical and transmission electron microscopy (tem) as well anaerobic cultivation. five of the 6 membranes provided the microbiological data and microscopic data. tem revealed  an organized microbial mass covering the surfaces and also within the interstices of the open microstructure and occlusive portions of the membranes. numerous bacterial forms including cocci, rods, and filaments with an interbacterial matrix, frequently in microcolonies, were identified. anaerobic cultivation yielded streptococcus and actinomyces species with a minor component of gram-negative facultative rods comprised mainly of haemophilus species. candida species was recovered from one membrane. these data show that eptfe is heavily colonized by oral bacteria during retention. the impact of bacterial colonization of eptfe is not known but it seems reasonable to assume that colonization of membranes may affect connective tissue regeneration. further studies will be needed to examine the effect of systemic antimicrobials on eptfe colonization and in turn to examine the effect on gtr.

TI  == a review of commonly prescribed oral antibiotics in general dentistry.
AB  == the microflora associated with odontogenic infections are typically mixed and of  indigenous origin. streptococcus, peptostreptococcus, peptococcus, fusobacterium, bacteroides, and actinomyces species are the principle microflora isolated from these infections. penicillin v (phenoxymethyl penicillin) remains the antimicrobial of choice for the initial empirical treatment of odontogenic infections. this agent is safe, highly effective and inexpensive. amoxicillin has little indication for the routine treatment of odontogenic infections. however, it is the agent of choice for endocarditis prophylaxis, as it produces higher serum levels than penicillin v. erythromycin may be used for mild, acute odontogenic infections in penicillin-allergic patients. the high incidence of gastrointestinal disturbances and superinfection commonly associated with the ingestion of tetracycline limits its role in general dental practice. tetracycline may be considered as an alternative therapy for penicillin-allergic  patients over the age of 13 who cannot tolerate erythromycin. clindamycin is very effective against all odontogenic pathogens, but its potential gastrointestinal toxicity relegates it to third- or even fourth-line therapy in general dentistry. although metronidazole displays excellent activity against anaerobic gram-negative bacilli, it is only moderately effective against facultative and anaerobic gram-positive cocci, and should not be used alone in the treatment of acute odontogenic infections.

TI  == a microbiological study of primary root-caries lesions with different treatment needs.
AB  == samples of altered or carious dentin for microbiological culture were obtained from 301 primary root-caries lesions in 59 patients by means of a standardized sampling procedure. this involved the cleansing of each root surface of extraneous supragingival plaque by means of a hand-held toothbrush and distilled  water and the collection of the sample with a sterile dental excavator passed through the entire vertical dimension of each lesion. the total number of colony-forming units (cfu) in each sample and the numbers of mutans streptococci  (primarily streptococcus mutans), lactobacilli, yeasts, and gram-positive pleomorphic rods (gppr) were determined. individual bacterial counts were expressed as log10 (cfu per sample), as a percentage of the total number of bacteria per sample, and as a frequency of isolation from lesions with different  clinical diagnostic criteria. clinical measurements of each lesion were made for  color, texture, position relative to the gingival margin, and treatment need. lesions classified as soft yielded significantly more bacteria, mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and gppr than leathery lesions, which yielded more bacteria than hard lesions. lesions were classified into 5 treatment categories:  soft and restore, leathery and restore, leathery and debride of caries; leathery  and treat therapeutically; and hard no treatment. the total numbers of bacteria,  mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, gppr, and yeasts decreased significantly with  decreasing treatment need. the frequency of isolation of mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, and yeasts was significantly greater from lesions requiring restoration and from lesions situated within 1 mm of the gingival margin. we suggest that the majority of root caries is initiated adjacent to the gingival margin.

AB  == coaggregation between streptococcus gordonii pk488 and actinomyces naeslundii pk606 is mediated by a 38-kda streptococcal protein, designated scaa. the gene, scaa, which encodes this protein has been cloned into escherichia coli. a genomic s. gordonii pk488 library (in lambda zap ii) was screened with anti-s. gordonii immunoglobulin g absorbed with s. gordonii pk1804, an isogenic coaggregation-defective mutant of strain pk488. a positive recombinant phage was  isolated, and a phagemid designated pra1 was obtained which contained a 6.6-kb insert. expression of scaa from pra1 and from a subcloned internal 2.1-kb fragment was observed. the absorbed antiserum cross-reacted with a 34.7-kda protein, ssab, from s. sanguis 12, also a coaggregation partner of a. naeslundii  pk606. absorbed antiserum to s. gordonii pk488 and antiserum to ssab both reacted with 38-kda proteins in supernatants from mildly sonicated preparations from 11 other coaggregation partners of a. naeslundii pk606. putative adhesin genes were  identified in each of these coaggregation partners by southern analysis of their  genomic dna with the cloned 2.1-kb fragment as a probe. a 30-base oligonucleotide probe based on the sequence of ssab of s. sanguis 12 hybridized in an identical manner. these data extend the notion that most of the viridans streptococci that  coaggregate with actinomyces are capable of expressing scaa-related proteins.

AB  == the aim of this double blind, cross-over, microbiological study was to compare the effect of topical application of the plaque control agent 0.5% delmopinol hcl with placebo on early supragingival plaque formation. six subjects underwent 7 periods (0.5, 1, 2, 8 and 24 h and 3 and 7 days) of placebo and delmopinol application, respectively. at the start of each study period the teeth were professionally cleaned and 2 ml of placebo and delmopinol 0.5%, respectively, were applied on all teeth (twice daily for periods lasting 24 h or more). at the  end of each period, supragingival plaque samples of one upper and one lower buccal tooth surface were collected separately and cultured on anaerobically incubated brucella blood agar, on aerobically incubated blood agar and on selective media for the enumeration of streptococcus spp., haemophilus spp., actinomyces spp., veillonella spp., neisseria spp. and fusobacterium spp. the total anaerobic cultivable microflora after delmopinol use was 10-100 times lower than after placebo use. compared with placebo, the proportion of cultivable aerobes (61.3%), streptococcus spp. (104.8%) and haemophilus spp. (82.3%) increased and the proportion of actinomyces spp. (86.1%), veillonella spp. (60.5%), neisseria spp. (96.9%) and fusobacterium spp. (60.6%) decreased after 7  days. short-term application of 0.5% delmopinol hcl on supragingival dental plaque regrowth resulted in a reduction of the number of cultivable microorganisms in the plaque and produced a shift in the cultivable plaque composition.

TI  == dental plaque development on defined streptococcal surfaces.
AB  == coaggregations between bacterial species have been widely studied in vitro but not in the mouth. a new in vivo assay was used to measure the rate and composition of indigenous plaque formation onto bovine enamel chips covered with  a continuous layer of bacteria. chips were covered with streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, which coaggregated with many oral species, or streptococcus gordonii s7, which did not coaggregate with these oral species, and placed in the mouth for 4  and 24 h. there were no differences in the number of most indigenous bacterial species isolated from the two streptococcal surfaces. however, the number of actinomyces viscosus as a proportion of total actinomyces spp. was significantly  different on the two surfaces at 24 h. with the exception of actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus removed from the s7 surface, all indigenous species increased significantly in number from 4 to 24 h, irrespective of the streptococcal surface. this study demonstrated that interbacterial coaggregation  had only a limited effect on in vivo plaque development. thus suggesting that environmental factors, growth or other adherence phenomena are dominant in in vivo plaque formation.

TI  == synergistic, growth-inhibitory effects of chlorhexidine and copper combinations on streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii.

(c), tubulicid blue (tb) and red label (tr), blue experimental  solution (sb) and red experimental solution (sr) and sterile distilled water (control). the preparation was incubated at 37 degrees c for seven days to test viability. p, tr, tb and sb produced complete inhibition of germs tested. the results reveal that, "in vitro", not all the substances tested exert a germicide  effect on the microorganisms analyzed.

AB  == in 15 caries-active patients, with a total of 770 exposed root surfaces, the effect of fluoride therapy and professional tooth cleaning was studied during a 1-year period. dental plaque from 92 of the root surfaces and whole saliva samples were analysed at baseline and after 12 months for the presence of specific bacteria. the results showed that the number of active carious lesions had decreased from 99 to 46, while the inactive lesions had increased from 69 to  124. of the active lesions which had been converted into inactive lesions, most were on the buccal and fewest were located on the distal surfaces. lower plaque scores were found on sound and inactive root surfaces compared to active surfaces. the salivary concentrations of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli remained constant during the 12-month observation period. there was a tendency for higher levels of streptococcus mutans in plaque from active lesions compared  with sound root surfaces, whereas an inverse relationship was noted for the streptococcus oralis group. no significant differences in the actinomyces naeslundii counts were detected. in conclusion, the 12-month prophylactic programme had an effect on the clinical surface characteristics of root caries, but the components of the oral microflora selected for study seemed to be relatively unaffected during the observation period.

AB  == the macaca mulatta species of rhesus monkey is one of several non-human primate (nhp) models for periodontal disease. this report presents the bacteriology of the gingival sulci in m. mulatta monkeys. three sub-gingival sites (maxillary right central incisor, the disto-buccal of the mandibular left second molar and mesio-buccal of the mandibular right second molar) of 9 monkeys were evaluated clinically before scaling and 7 days after scaling. plaque samples were obtained  from sub-gingival sites before clinical examination and studied bacteriologically by dark field microscopy, selective and non-selective culture, and by primary phenotypic characterizations of culture isolates. several gingival sites presented with mild gingival inflammation. anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic  bacteria were the predominant flora colonizing the gingival sulci. the major microbial groups were haemophilus species (100% of sites; percentage of total anaerobic count (tac): 21-51), peptostreptococcus micros (89%, 7.5-29.5), actinomyces sp. (85%, 7-27), fusobacterium nucleatum (90%, 5-8), actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (73%, 1.3-12), black-pigmented anaerobic rods (bpar) (80%,  0.6-6.5) and oral streptococci (80%, 0.2-1.0). microbial groups detected less often were wolinella sp.

(28%, 0-0.1) and spirochetes (4.7%, 0-0.07). seven days after gingival sites were scaled, the plaque score and indices for gingival inflammation declined significantly. the gingival flora after scaling were characterized by lower proportions of the actinomyces sp., p.  micros and bpar; and increased proportions of the oral streptococci, relative to  pre-scaling levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == modulation of intergeneric adhesion of oral bacteria by human saliva.
AB  == porphyromonas gingivalis adheres in vitro to biofilms containing streptococcus and actinomyces species. on initial entry to the mouth, this interbacterial adhesion may enable p. gingivalis to colonize dental plaque and to avoid clearance by saliva flow. saliva may also interfere directly with p. gingivalis colonization of dental plaque; a 43-kda glycoprotein in human submandibular-sublingual saliva binds to p. gingivalis surfaces and diminishes interbacterial adhesion activity. to avoid fouling of its surface by host components, p. gingivalis produces surface-localized proteases that can degrade adsorbed proteins and may serve to unmask bacterial adhesins. successful management of p. gingivalis colonization might be achieved in the future by devising artificial methods to block its surface adhesins or to prevent bacterial proteolysis of native salivary molecules that have protective functions.

AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system has been used as a more stringent laboratory system for evaluation of the antimicrobial effects of triclosan and zinc citrate. the inhibitors were added alone, and in combination, as a pulse (a high initial inhibitor concentration which decreased with time) or as a dose (concentration of inhibitor increased with time) to give maximum concentrations of 34.5 mumol/l triclosan and 39.8 mumol/l zinc citrate. when dosed, triclosan inhibited a. viscosus and all five gram-negative species, whereas zinc citrate had less effect, probably due to complexation by media components. similar effects were seen when triclosan was pulsed, except that s. mutans was the most sensitive gram-positive species and v. dispar was unaffected. however, when the inhibitors  were dosed or pulsed in combination, marked complementary and additive inhibitory effects were observed, particularly against gram-negative species, although s. gordonii and s. oralis were relatively unaffected. the data confirm that increased effects can be obtained with suitable combinations of antimicrobial agents and suggest that, under certain conditions, apparently broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents may be acting more selectively than hitherto suspected.

AB  == the existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. the  most frequent species were fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, peptostreptococcus micros, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, eubacterium alactolyticum, eubacterium lentum and wolinella recta. an odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. strong positive associations were found between f. nucleatum and p. micros, porphyromonas endodontalis, selenomonas sputigena and w. recta. there was also a positive association between p. intermedia and p. micros, p. anaerobius and the eubacteria. in general, species of streptococci, propionibacterium propionica, capnocytophaga ochracea and veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. the results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.

TI  == gene disruption identifies a 290 kda cell-surface polypeptide conferring hydrophobicity and coaggregation properties in streptococcus gordonii.
AB  == the c-terminal coding region of the gene (denoted csha) encoding a high-molecular-mass (290 kda) cell-surface polypeptide in the oral bacterium streptococcus gordonii was cloned and sequenced. insertion of ermam into the s. gordonii chromosome at the 3' end of the coding region of csha led to the production of isogenic mutants that secreted a truncated form (260 kda) of the csha polypeptide into the growth medium. mutants had reduced cell-surface hydrophobicity and were impaired in their ability to coaggregate with oral actinomyces. the results identify a carboxyl terminus-anchored cell-surface protein determinant of hydrophobicity and coaggregation in s. gordonii.

TI  == effect of gels containing stannous fluoride on oral bacteria--an in vitro study.
AB  == the purposes of this investigation were to evaluate and compare the antimicrobial effect of (1) twelve 0.4 per cent stannous fluoride (snf2) commercial products and (2) different concentrations of snf2 (range = 0.02 to 3.28 per cent). the antibacterial inhibitory effect of various snf2 gels was evaluated as to their effectiveness against oral plaque bacteria including strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. sobrinus, a. viscosus, a. actinomycetemcomitans, and b. intermedius.  when twelve different commercial preparations of 0.4 per cent snf2 were compared  for inhibitory effect on plaque bacteria, several of the snf2 preparations were significantly more effective in inhibiting oral bacteria (p < 0.05). with increasing concentration of snf2, there was a comparable increase in the inhibitory effect on the oral bacteria tested (r2 ranged from 0.867 to 0.996). snf2 at a concentration of 0.4 per cent had a similar antibacterial effect to 0.12 per cent chlorhexidine. this in vitro study demonstrated that certain snf2 products are highly effective in inhibiting the growth of bacteria often found in plaque, and this inhibitory effect is directly related to the concentration of the snf2.

TI  == comparison of the effects of galactose and glucose on the ph responses of human dental plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria.
AB  == comparisons made in dental plaque in vivo demonstrated that galactose produces a  significantly smaller decrease in ph than does glucose. in vitro studies with plaque, salivary sediment and pure cultures of oral bacteria done in the absence  of intraoral factors such as flowing saliva confirmed this lesser acidogenicity of galactose. pure culture showed that most of the bacteria tested produce a moderate to large decrease with glucose but only a few do so with galactose; most produced a moderate to little or no ph response with this sugar. this suggested that the smaller decreases in ph seen in plaque in vivo with galactose were largely due to bacterial differences, basically that resident micro-organisms individually have less galactolytic than glucolytic capability. variance in capability was attributed to differences in membrane transport processes and metabolic pathways normally available to bacteria for galactose and glucose catabolism. in the in vitro experiments, because plaque and sediment can produce  base as readily as they can produce acid, the nitrogenous substrates identified earlier as major stimulants of base formation, urea and arginine, were concurrently examined for their attenuating effects on the galactose and glucose  ph responses. these showed, consistent with its lesser acidogenicity, that galactose could be countered more readily in its ability to reduce the ph by either of these two base-forming substrates than could glucose. the effects were  different with urea and with arginine, urea attenuation occurred sooner and arginine attenuation later in both plaque and sediment. the corresponding acid-base ph profiles for pure cultures were different.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine-containing gel and varnish on abutment teeth in patients with overdentures.
AB  == previous experiments have shown that daily use of 1% chlorhexidine gel strongly reduced caries development in the abutment teeth under overdentures. the present  experiment was designed to determine whether intermittent application of chlorhexidine, either in a varnish or in a gel, might be used as an alternative preventive method, less demanding for the patient. to this end, 31 patients were  distributed among four treatment groups, with the number of mutans streptococci in plaque and saliva used as a balancing criterion. the treatments consisted of a single application of 40% chlorhexidine varnish, daily application of 1% chlorhexidine gel for one week, or the corresponding placebo treatments with varnish or gel without chlorhexidine. patients were re-called for bacteriological and clinical examination at various intervals during an eight-week period following treatment. chlorhexidine varnish and chlorhexidine gel applications significantly suppressed mutans streptococci on the abutment teeth for four and eight weeks, respectively. in agreement with earlier findings, the numbers of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii in plaque were significantly increased after chlorhexidine varnish treatment. the chlorhexidine gel reduced plaque accumulation and gingival bleeding for one week but had no long-lasting effect. the results seem to justify a long-term clinical test of intermittent chlorhexidine applications as an alternative for daily use in patients with overdentures.

TI  == immunoglobulins in milk from cows immunized with oral strains of actinomyces, prevotella, porphyromonas, and fusobacterium.
AB  == immunization of pregnant cows with bacteria leads to the presence of high concentrations of specific antibodies in colostrum and milk. a total of 14 cows was immunized with single strains of heat-killed oral bacteria or pools of strains of actinomyces, porphyromonas, prevotella, and fusobacterium. two cows were treated with adjuvant alone. the mean percentages of igg1, igg2, igm, and iga in all of the milks were 83.8, 3.8, 9.3, and 3.1, respectively. elisa and whole cell agglutination assays demonstrated high titers in the milks from the cows immunized with either individual strains or the bacterial pools. the highest titers determined by elisa belonged to the igg1 isotype and in several milks were 64-fold greater than titers in milk from cows treated with adjuvant alone. the concentrations of all antibodies and the titers determined by elisa and whole cell agglutination assays markedly decreased from the first to the sixth milkings. the functional specificity of the antibodies was demonstrated by agglutination tests against a wide range of bacteria including members of actinomyces, fusobacterium, porphyromonas, prevotella, streptococcus, eubacterium, propionibacterium, peptostreptococcus, bacteroides, actinobacillus,  haemophilus, capnocytophaga, and wolinella. minimal cross-reactions with bacteria in other genera were observed with all of the milks. high-titer milk preparations have been obtained from immunized cows, and the capacity of the bovine antibodies to agglutinate target bacteria indicates their potential usefulness in oral passive immunization studies.

TI  == actinomyces tissue specificity may depend on differences in receptor specificity  for galnac beta-containing glycoconjugates.
AB  == actinomyces naeslundii 12104 and a. viscosus ly7 were compared for receptor specificities and adherence properties because these relate to their oral colonization sites. both strains bind galnac beta-containing glycosphingolipids (gsls) in a galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl-sensitive fashion but differ with respect to the number of cells bound to gsls and the effect of neighboring sugar  groups on the binding. their hemagglutination and saccharide inhibition profiles  confirms the existence of two receptor specificities (for example, when galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl is multivalently conjugated to albumin, its inhibitory activity increases fourfold toward strain 12104 but decreases fourfold toward strain ly7). trypsin or chymotrypsin treatment of human erythrocytes, which possess receptor gsls, improves their hemagglutination with strain 12104. in contrast, the same treatment of chicken erythrocytes, which lack receptor gsls, abolishes their hemagglutination. these findings suggest that both gsls and glycoproteins act as functional receptors on eukaryotic cells. the strains also differ with respect to the following galnac beta 1-3gal alpha oethyl-sensitive adherence properties: (i) strain ly7 adheres somewhat better than does strain 12104 to buccal epithelial cells; (ii) in spite of their similar overall coaggregation patterns with streptococci, strain 12104 coaggregates with streptococcus oralis mpb1 but strain ly7 does not; (iii) strain 12104 alone shows galnac beta-sensitive saliva aggregation and adherence to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. the gsl binding patterns of fresh actinomyces isolates reveal a high prevalence of ly7-like specificities among buccal isolates, whereas 12104-like specificities are most prevalent among plaque isolates. these findings strongly suggest that fresh actinomyces isolates use fine specificity for galnac  beta-containing glycoconjugates in recognition and subsequent colonization of specific oral surfaces.

TI  == the influence of denture-wearing and age on the oral microflora.
AB  == the effects of denture-wearing and age on the prevalence of selected bacteria of  dental significance and on the carriage of opportunistic pathogens in molar plaque and whole saliva were determined in 120 healthy subjects, 41 of whom wore  partial dentures. the subjects were divided into four age groups: 20-39 years (group a), 40-59 years (group b), 60-79 years (group c), and greater than or equal to 80 years (group d). the proportions, mean log10 viable counts, and isolation frequency of yeasts and lactobacilli in saliva and plaque were consistently higher in partial-denture wearers. the proportions of staphylococci  and mutans streptococci were also raised in denture wearers, but these differences did not reach statistical significance. when the data were analyzed for age effects, both yeasts and lactobacilli were found to be increased in saliva with age, but statistically significant differences were generally found only between denture wearers in group d and subjects in the control group a. the  isolation frequency of yeasts from plaque was also significantly higher in denture wearers of the oldest age group (d) compared with those in group a. a. viscosus predominated over a. naeslundii in the older age groups, regardless of the presence of dentures. enterobacteria were isolated occasionally but only from the saliva of denture wearers in group d. spirochetes and black-pigmented anaerobes were generally found in lower numbers in denture wearers. collectively, the data show that components of the oral microflora in adults can be independently influenced by both age and the wearing of partial dentures.

TI  == the bactericidal effect of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase on bacteria.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of n-acetyl-beta-d-glucosaminidase (nagase) on some of  the potential bacterial pathogens of the cow was determined. nagase treatment significantly decreased the mean log10 number of actinomyces pyogenes (p less than 0.01) and staphylococcus aureus (p less than 0.05) after 2 and 4 hours of incubation at 37 degrees c. similarly nagase treatment significantly (p less than 0.05) reduced the mean log10 number of streptococcus agalactiae and pseudomonas aeruginosa after 4 hours incubation at 37 degrees c. nagase did not reduce the numbers of escherichia coli or enterobacter aerogenes after either 2 or 4 hours incubation. since nagase and presumably other lysosomal enzymes are free on normal mucosal surfaces such as the uterus it is suggested that this direct bactericidal activity may be an important component of the normal defense mechanisms.

TI  == humoral igg antibodies to oral microbiota in a population at risk for root-surface caries.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been strongly implicated in the initiation of dental caries on coronal surfaces. their role in development of root-surface caries is less clear. the etiologic agents of both types of dental caries are likely to elicit systemic immune responses. the objective of the present study, therefore,  was to study the association of clinical variables of disease with humoral igg antibodies to nine oral micro-organisms in 314 adult subjects, aged 45-65 years,  who were at risk for root-surface caries. antibody activity to streptococcus mutans strain ingbritt, s. mutans/s. sobrinus gtfs, s. faecalis strain 19433, actinomyces viscosus strain wvu 626, actinomyces naeslundii strain 12, lactobacillus casei, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans strain y4, porphyromonas gingivalis strain 381, eikenella corrodens strain 1073, and wolinella recta strain 371 was measured by elisa. pearson correlation coefficients among log10 antibody levels within subjects revealed marked positive correlations among subgingival bacteria, generally weak positive correlations among supragingival micro-organisms, and no correlations between elements of the  supragingival battery with the subgingival battery. igg antibody levels to mutans streptococcal antigens were significantly correlated with subject dmf scores (r = 0.23; p less than 0.0001). no significant correlation was seen between dmf scores and antibody to any other supragingival micro-organism tested. further relationships between levels of s. mutans antibody and individual clinical variables were analyzed by step-wise multiple linear regression, resulting in a model that was highly significant (p = 0.0001), with an r2 = 0.14. numbers of missing teeth, coronal caries, root-surface caries, and root-surface restorations were each positively associated with antibody levels to mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == isolation and characterization of actinomyces viscosus mutants defective in binding salivary proline-rich proteins.
AB  == recent studies have provided evidence for human salivary proline-rich proteins (prps) serving as potential receptors in the acquired pellicle for actinomyces viscosus type 1 fimbriae. we report here the isolation of mutants derived from a. viscosus t14v-j1 which are defective in binding to prps partially purified from parotid gland saliva. mutagenesis with ethyl methanesulfonate preceded enrichment for cells nonreactive with prps by successive adsorptions with prp-treated latex  beads. screening was accomplished by random selection of 250 isolated colonies from each of four enrichment cycles and reaction with prp-treated latex beads in  microtiter plates. two mutants of independent origin were examined for adherence  to hydroxyapatite treated with either prps, proline-rich glycoproteins, deglycosylated proline-rich glycoproteins, or whole saliva. additional surface properties that were examined included agglutination with polyclonal antisera to  type 1 and type 2 fimbriae, agglutination by a monoclonal antibody to type 1 fimbriae that inhibits adherence of the parent strain to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite, the ability to bind monoclonal antibody to the type 1 fimbrial subunit, and lactose-reversible coaggregation with streptococcus sanguis 34. both mutants exhibited reduced binding to hydroxyapatite treated with whole saliva or  salivary protein preparations but were still capable of reaction with antiserum to type 1 and type 2 fimbriae. in addition, these mutants possessed the ability to bind monoclonal antibody to the type 1 fimbrial subunit in amounts comparable  to the amount bound by the parent strain but were not agglutinated by the adherence-inhibiting monoclonal antibody. when considered with previously published data, these results suggest that an adhesive molecule is probably associated with type 1 fimbriae and allows for the interaction of a. viscosus with constituents in the salivary pellicle.

AB  == this study was carried out to investigate the predominant anaerobic bacteria of periodontal pockets in patients with advanced periodontitis, who had no previous  treatment other than supragingival scaling, no history of recent or chronic systemic illness, nor any intake of antibiotics within 6 weeks prior to bacteriological sampling. care was taken not to ignore tiny-colony-forming anaerobes, by means of a stereoscope and an anaerobic glove box system. out of 422 (100%) isolates, 380 (90%) were obligate anaerobes, suggesting that the environment in periodontal pockets was anaerobic and favors the growth of obligate anaerobes. among the 380 obligate anaerobes isolated, strains belonging  to eubacterium (54%) were predominant, and many of them occurred in tiny colonies. the other obligate anaerobes isolated were assigned to wolinella (9%),  unidentified motile rods which resemble wolinella (7%), peptostreptococcus (6%),  fusobacterium (5%), bacteroides (2%; including those reclassified to prevotella and porphyromonas) and selenomonas (0.5%). among the isolates, 67% were gram-positive bacteria, including 59% of rods (mostly asaccharolytic eubacterium), suggesting that these bacteria, particularly strains of the eubacterium species, may play an important role in etiology of adult periodontitis.

TI  == inhibition of microbial adherence and growth by various glass ionomers in vitro.
AB  == this study measured the in vitro inhibition of growth and adherence of five oral  bacteria by glass-ionomer materials. disks were prepared from two cavity liners and four restorative class materials, by use of teflon plates with circular wells, five mm wide and two mm deep. the bacterial species tested included: a. viscosus, s. mitis, s. mutans, l. casei, and s. sanguis. growth inhibition studies were performed by the spreading of 0.1 ml of standardized inocula over agar plates produced with selective media, followed by the direct application of  glass-ionomer disks onto the agar. on other plates, disks were placed onto uninoculated agars for 48 h, followed by bacterial inoculation. all agar plates were incubated under optimal growth conditions for each bacterial species. the four restorative materials were also placed aseptically into sterilized bovine incisors and placed into sucrose containing broth media, inoculated with s. mutans for three days. adhering materials were disclosed and scored. an ion-exchange electrode was used to measure fluoride release over a seven-day period for all six glass ionomers. the two cavity liners and two of the restorative materials produced the largest growth inhibition zones by direct contact. no growth inhibition occurred when the specimens were allowed to come into contact with the agars prior to inoculation. all four restorative materials  reduced bacterial accumulations on enamel surfaces by over 80%. elevations in short-term fluoride release levels were positively correlated with growth inhibition.

AB  == the microbial flora of 35 dental root canals were examined, taking care to maintain the viability of obligate anaerobes which accounted for 45% of total isolations, while streptococcal species accounted for 24% of the total species isolated. individual root canals yielded a maximum of eight bacterial species. a  total of 40 different species was isolated of which the most prevalent were the facultative anaerobe streptococcus sanguis and the obligate anaerobe, peptostreptococcus micros (both in 23% of root canals), followed by eubacterium aerofaciens and the 'streptococcus milleri group' (both 17%) then prevotella melaninogenica (formerly bacteroides melaninogenicus), enterococcus faecalis and  prevotella oralis (formerly bacteroides oralis), which were each isolated from 14% of root canals. highly significant associations were discovered between four  pairs of species, viz p. melaninogenica with p. micros, p. melaninogenica with p. oralis, prevotella corporis with streptococcus morbillorum and actinomyces odontolyticus with e. faecalis.

TI  == noncariogenicity of erythritol as a substrate.
AB  == erythritol is a sugar alcohol produced by aureobasidium sp. from glucose. it is 75-80% as sweet as sucrose and is also nonhygroscopic. the aim of this study was  to evaluate this sugar substitute from a cariological point of view. erythritol was neither utilized as a substrate for the lactic acid production nor for plaque formation of mutans streptococci (serotypes a-h) and certain oral microorganisms. it was not utilized for water-insoluble glucan synthesis or cellular adherence by glucosyltransferase from streptococcus mutans ps-14 (c) and streptococcus sobrinus 6715 (g). finally, a significantly lower caries score (3.1 +/- 0.5; mean +/- sem) was observed in specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. sobrinus 6715 and fed with a diet containing 26% erythritol, as compared to control rats fed with a diet containing 26% sucrose (60.5 +/- 2.0). also, rats provided a diet containing 56% erythritol chocolate (23.8% erythritol) and challenged with s. mutans ps-14 exhibited a significantly lower caries score (6.7 +/- 0.8) compared  to the sucrose chocolate group (82.8 +/- 2.8). the main conclusion from this study is therefore that erythritol is a promising sugar substitute from a cariological point of view.

TI  == bacterial invasion of non-exposed dental pulp.
AB  == anaerobic procedures were adopted to demonstrate the early bacterial invasion of  non-exposed dental pulps, and to isolate and identify the bacteria. of 19 freshly extracted teeth which originally exhibited deep dentinal lesions, clinical examination and electric pulp testing showed that nine of them had no pulpal exposure. thus the pulps of these teeth were covered by clinically sound dentine  beneath the carious lesion. bacteria were found to have invaded the pulps of six  of these nine teeth. the predominant bacteria were obligate anaerobes belonging to the genera eubacterium, propionibacterium and actinomyces. other obligate anaerobes were lactobacillus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and streptococcus.  the bacterial composition resembled that of the deep layers of dentinal lesions described previously, suggesting that the bacteria isolated in this study had passed through some individual dentinal tubules, to invade the dental pulp.

TI  == antimicrobial effect of a dental varnish, in vitro.
AB  == the effects of a polymer based antimicrobial releasing varnish cervitec were investigated against different gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains  as well as a yeast using the agar diffusion inhibitory test (adt-test in vitro).  as positive controls a 1% chlorhexidine gel and 1% aqueous solution of thymol and a placebo polymer varnish without active agents were employed. the test experimental varnish containing 1% chlorhexidine and 1% thymol showed antimicrobial activity against all gram-positive and gram-negative microorganisms tested including one candida strain. the positive controls were similar in effect compared to the test varnish. no antimicrobial effect was observed with the placebo varnish without active ingredients. toothpicks and dental floss treated with the test varnish showed an antimicrobial effect against s. mutans even after storing in room temperature up to 12 months. the results from this study support  earlier laboratory studies that chlorhexidine and thymol diffuse out of the experimental varnish and that the varnish is active against various of oral pathogens. the possibility to use toothpicks or dental floss impregnated with the varnish with the aim to become chemotherapeutically active against periodontal diseases as well as against dental caries, is promising and should be tested in vivo.

AB  == highly hydrated polyethylene oxide (peo) films represent one type of surface modification which may interfere with biofilm formation. protein adsorption and saliva-mediated bacterial adherence were investigated in vitro on normal and hydrophobized glass surfaces and on glass surfaces with immobilized peo films. more protein and bacteria bound to untreated compared to hydrophobized and peo-treated glass. pellicle and plaque formation was also studied in vivo on ceramic crown surfaces either untreated, hydrophobized or with immobilized peo films. pellicle and plaque formation was similar on the untreated ceramic and peo surfaces. less plaque seemed to collect on these surfaces compared to adjacent normal tooth surfaces. almost no plaque accumulated on the hydrophobic crown surface and it was virtually devoid of stainable pellicle. even after 7 days in the mouth without oral hygiene this surface was very hydrophobic and the disclosing solution could not spread.

TI  == salivary-agglutinin-mediated adherence of streptococcus mutans to early plaque bacteria.
AB  == interspecies binding is important in the colonization of the oral cavity by bacteria. streptococcus mutans can adhere to other plaque bacteria, such as streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus, and this adherence is enhanced by saliva. the salivary and bacterial molecules that mediate this interaction were investigated. salivary agglutinin, a mucinlike glycoprotein known to mediate the  aggregation of many oral streptococci in vitro, was found to mediate the adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis or a. viscosus. adherence of s. mutans to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus was inhibited by antibodies to the bacterial agglutinin receptor. expression of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) gene in enterococcus faecalis increased adhesion of this organism to saliva- or agglutinin-coated s. sanguis and a. viscosus. this interaction could be inhibited by antibodies to the agglutinin receptor. the results suggest that salivary agglutinin can promote adherence of s. mutans to s. sanguis and a. viscosus through interactions with the agglutinin receptor on s. mutans.

AB  == the results of identification and sensitivity assay of 156 strains of pathogens causing odontogenic infections are presented. in the sensitivity assay antibacterial drugs were used. 42.3 percent of the strains were obligate anaerobes belonging to bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, veillonella and actinomyces. significant differences in the microbial sensitivity to the drugs used for general and local therapy were detected. there was observed high sensitivity of the obligate anaerobes to gramicidin (0.02 micrograms/ml), nitazol (10 micrograms/ml), levomycetin and tetracycline (60 micrograms/ml). antiseptics such as dioxidine and chlorhexidine  used locally showed satisfactory results. the above mentioned drugs and especially levomycetin were also rather active against facultative organisms in associations of pathogens causing odontogenic infections: bacillus coagulans, b.  licheniformis, pseudomonas sp., acinetobacter calcoaceticus, staphylococcus sp. and streptococcus sp.

AB  == the summer mastitis pathogens actinomyces pyogenes, peptococcus indolicus, bacteroides melaninogenicus ss. levii, fusobacterium necrophorum and streptococcus dysgalactiae were isolated from the polyphagous symbovine dipterans hydrotaea irritans (fallen) and morellia sp. caught around dairy heifers on pasture, but not from the haematophagous species haematobia irritans (l.), haematobosca stimulans (meigen), culicoides sp. and simulium sp. secretions from  clinical cases of summer mastitis proved to be sources of summer mastitis bacteria for more than 3 weeks despite antibiotic treatment and teat amputation.  taking into account the seasonal activity pattern of hydrotaea irritans and its topographical distribution on grazing cattle, it appears evident that this fly may play a central role in the establishment and maintenance of the bacterial contamination with summer mastitis pathogens on the teats of healthy cattle. in the present study the survival of a.pyogenes and p.indolicus for 7 days in experimentally infected hydrotaea irritans, as demonstrated by the recovery of these microorganisms from agar plates exposed to live infected flies, is described. however, experimental transmission of summer mastitis from sick to healthy heifers by hydrotaea irritans proved unsuccessful.

TI  == microbiology of chronic sinusitis in children.
AB  == to better understand the factors involved in chronic sinusitis in childhood, we cultured the sinuses, middle meatus, and nasopharynx in 39 children requiring surgical intervention. sixty-nine percent of these patients had other medical problems, including asthma (49%) and immunologic compromise (18%). we cultured coagulase-negative staphylococcus in 18 patients, streptococcus viridans in 14 patients, normal flora in 10 patients, staphylococcus aureus in nine patients, group d streptococcus in five patients, corynebacterium in five patients, haemophilus influenzae in three patients, neisseria in three patients, and streptococcus pneumoniae, group a streptococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella oxytoca, propionibacterium acnes, actinomyces, and an anaerobic gram-negative bacillus in one patient each. cultures yielded no growth  in nine patients. a strong association between cultures of the middle meatus obtained ipsilaterally and cultures of the maxillary (83%) and ethmoid sinuses (80%) occurred. a poor correlation was found between cultures of the nasopharynx  and maxillary (45%) and ethmoid sinuses (49%). all seven patients who had both maxillary and ethmoid sinus cultures showed the same organisms in both sinuses. only 41% of organisms were found on both sides when procedures were performed bilaterally. cultures of the middle meatus appear to be sensitive and specific for organisms within sinuses. the presence of predominantly nonvirulent organisms in low titers suggests that additional factors other than bacterial overgrowth contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic sinusitis in children.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis c104: a 600-mhz nmr study.
AB  == specific lectin-carbohydrate interactions between certain oral streptococci and actinomyces contribute to the microbial colonization of teeth. the receptor molecules of streptococcus oralis, 34, atcc 10557, and streptococcus mitis j22 for the galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine reactive fimbrial lectins of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii are antigenically distinct polysaccharides, each formed by a different phosphodiester-linked oligosaccharide repeating unit. these streptococci all coaggregated strongly with both a. viscosus and a. naesludii strains, whereas s. oralis c104 interacted preferentially with certain strains of the latter species. receptor polysaccharide was isolated from s. oralis c104 cells and was shown to contain galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine, ribitol, and phosphate with molar ratios of 4:1:1:1. the 1h nmr spectrum of the polysaccharide shows that it contains a repeating structure. the individual sugars in the repeating unit were identified  by 1h coupling constants observed in e-cosy and dqf-cosy spectra. nmr methods included complete resonance assignments (1h and 13c) by various homonuclear and heteronuclear correlation experiments that utilize scalar couplings. sequence and linkage assignments were obtained from the heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation (hmbc) spectrum. this analysis shows that the receptor polysaccharide of s. oralis c104 is a ribitol teichoic acid polymer composed of a linear hexasaccharide repeating unit containing two residues each of galactopyranose and galactofuranose and a residue each of galnac and ribitol joined end to end by phosphodiester linkages with the following structure.

TI  == complete structure of the cell surface polysaccharide of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557: a receptor for lectin-mediated interbacterial adherence.
AB  == lectin-carbohydrate binding is known to play an important role in a number of different cell-cell interactions including those between certain species of oral  streptococci and actinomyces that colonize teeth. the cell wall polysaccharides of streptococcus oralis atcc 10557, s. oralis 34, and streptococcus mitis j22, although not identical antigenically, each function as a receptor molecule for the galactose and n-acetylgalactosamine reactive fimbrial lectins of actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. carbohydrate analysis of the receptor polysaccharide isolated from s. oralis atcc 10557 shows galactose (3 mol), glucose (1 mol), galnac (1 mol), and rhamnose (1 mol). 1h nmr spectra of the polysaccharide show that is is partially o-acetylated. analysis of the 1h nmr spectrum of the de-o-acetylated polysaccharide shows that it is composed of repeating subunits containing six monosaccharides and that the subunits are joined by a phosphodiester linkage. the 1h and 13c nmr spectra were completely assigned by two-dimensional homonuclear correlation methods and by 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-quantum correlation (1h[13c]hmqc). the linkage of the component monosaccharides in the polymer, deduced from two-dimensional 1h-detected heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation spectra (1h[13c]hmbc), shows  that the repeating unit of the de-o-acetylated polymer is a linear hexasaccharide with no branch points. the complete 1h and 13c assignment of the native polysaccharide was carried out by the same techniques augmented by a 13c-coupled  hybrid hmqc-cosy method, which is shown to be especially useful for carbohydrates in which strong coupling and overlapping peaks in the 1h spectrum pose difficulties. the fully assigned spectra of the native polymer show that each of  two different positions is acetylated in one-third of the repeating subunits and  that the acetylation is randomly distributed along the polymer. the exact positions of acetylation were assigned by a carbonyl-selective hmbc method that unambiguously defines the positions of o-acetylation. the complete structure of the native polysaccharide in s. oralis atcc 10557 is [formula: see text] comparison of this structure with those previously determined for the polysaccharides of strains 34 and j22 suggests that the similar lectin receptor activities of these molecules may depend on internal galactofuranose linked (beta 1----6)- to gal(beta 1----3)galnac(alpha) or galnac(beta 1----3)gal(alpha).

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 2.9-kb streptococcal dna fragment which codes for two proteins with mrs of 36,000 (streptococcus sanguis adhesin b [ssab]) and 20,000 has been determined. the ssab gene is 927 bp and codes for a 34,684-da protein. the open reading frame coding for the 20-kda protein is 489 bp and codes for a protein of 17,885 da. the ssab protein has a putative hydrophobic 19-amino-acid signal sequence resulting in a 32,620-mr secreted protein, whereas  the 20-kda protein has no signal sequence. both proteins are hydrophilic, and neither appears to have a hydrophobic membrane anchor sequence in the carboxy-terminal region. a dna sequence homology of 73% exists between the cloned fragment containing the ssab gene from s. sanguis 12 and the cloned fragment containing the type 1 fimbrial gene of s. sanguis fw213 (j.c. fenno, d.j. leblanc, and p. fives-taylor, infect. immun. 57:3527-3533, 1989). amino acid comparisons of the ssab and type 1 fimbrial proteins show 87% homology, indicating a close similarity of the two proteins. antiserum raised against the cloned ssab protein cross-reacts with a 38-kda protein identified from streptococcus gordonii (s. sanguis) pk488 which was proposed to mediate coaggregation with actinomyces naeslundii pk606 (p.e. kolenbrander and r.n. andersen, infect. immun. 58:3064-3072, 1990). the ssab adhesion may play a role in oral colonization by binding either to a receptor on saliva or to a receptor on actinomyces.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == effects of chlorhexidine on proteolytic and glycosidic enzyme activities of dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == chlorhexidine was tested for its ability to inhibit a wide range of glycosidic and proteolytic enzyme activities produced by treponema denticola, porphyromonas  gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, actinobacillus actinomycemcomitans, capnocytophaga sputigena, capnocytophaga gingivalis, capnocytophaga orchracea, capnocytophaga sp., actinomyces viscosus, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus oralis and streptococcus sanguis. the enzymes produced by capnocytophaga spp. were the most resistant to inhibition by chlorhexidine while  the hydrolysis of proteolytic substrates by all the other species was markedly susceptible to inhibition with less than 0.125 mm chlorhexidine inhibiting enzyme activities by greater than or equal to 50%. glycosidase activities, of all species, were generally more resistant to inhibition, especially neuraminidase activity. chlorhexidine at less than 0.032 mm inhibited the degradation of bovine serum albumin by suspensions of dental plaque bacteria. these observations support an hypothesis that chlorhexidine exerts a bacteristatic effect in vivo, in part, by reducing the ability of dental plaque bacteria to degrade host-derived proteins and glycoproteins which normally provide essential nutrients for growth.

TI  == effects of fluoride and chlorhexidine on the microflora of dental root surfaces and progression of root-surface caries.
AB  == the effects of fluoride and chlorhexidine varnishes on the microflora of dental root surfaces and on the progression of root-surface caries were studied. forty-four patients, surgically treated for advanced periodontal disease, were distributed at random among three groups. all patients received a standardized preventive treatment. furthermore, the dentition of the patients in the two experimental groups was treated, at three-month intervals, with chlorhexidine and fluoride varnish, respectively. patients in the control group received no additional treatment. in the experimental groups, plaque samples were collected from selected sound and carious root surfaces at baseline and at three, six, and  nine months after the onset of the study. the presence of root-surface caries was scored at baseline and after one year. in addition, the texture, depth, and color of the root-surface lesions were monitored. mutans streptococci on root surfaces  were suppressed significantly (p less than 0.05) during the whole experimental period in the chlorhexidine varnish group, but not in the fluoride varnish group. a non-significant increase in the number of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii was noted after treatment with chlorhexidine and fluoride varnish. the increase in the number of decayed and filled root surfaces after one year was significantly lower in the experimental groups than in the control group. after treatment with  chlorhexidine varnish, significantly more initial root-surface lesions had hardened than in the other groups.

TI  == [bacteriological study on juvenile periodontitis].
AB  == the predominant cultivable microflora of 23 pockets in 15 juvenile periodontitis  (jp) patients was studied for the first time in china using the current anaerobic methodology. samples were taken with sterile paper points and dispersed on a vortex mixer. then the diluted samples were plated on the non-selective blood agar plates and selective mgb medium which favors the growth of actinobacillus actimycetemcomitans (aa) and incubated in anaerobic chamber for 5 days. from each sample 15 or more isolated colonies were picked in sequence without selection and subcultured. the isolates were identified mainly by schrechenberger's 4 hour rapid methods for biochemical and fermentative tests and the chromatographic analysis of acid end products using ion-chromatography. the results were as follows: 1. the microflora of healthy sulci of 7 healthy young subjects was significantly different from that in the pocket of jp patients. the predominant species in healthy sulci were streptococcus spp and capnocytophaga gingivalis. 2. the species increased significantly in jp patients in prevalence and proportions  was eubacterium. other species in high proportions were bacteroides oris, b. melaninogenicus, b. gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, and actinomyces meyeri, etc. 3. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was not detected in any of the samples.

TI  == comparison of the plaque microflora from natural and appliance-borne enamel surfaces.
AB  == human enamel sections and slabs, mounted on a mandibular removable appliance, were worn by 5 adult subjects for a 1-week period. plaque was allowed to accumulate on the in situ test sites and on the adjacent natural dentition. at the end of the experimental period, the plaque microflora associated with (1) the enamel sections, (2) the enamel slabs, and (3) the acrylic base of the appliance  test site was compared with that obtained from lingual and interproximal areas of the lower molar teeth. in addition, the acid anion and ph profiles of plaque obtained from both the exogenous and natural tooth surfaces were also determined. although some quantitative differences were found between the proportions of isolates obtained from the different enamel surfaces, qualitatively the microflora was very similar, and no significant differences were found in the plaque lactate/acetate ratios or ph measurements following a sucrose mouthrinse.  thus, human tooth specimens mounted on the intra-oral device produced a plaque ecosystem similar to that present on the adjacent natural dentition, suggesting that the model is suitable for studies on early plaque development and the microbiology of enamel demineralization.

TI  == effect of nutrients on defined bacterial plaques and streptococcus mutans c67-1 implantation in a model mouth.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, streptococcus oralis lpa-1 and veillonella dispar omz 193 were cocultured on teeth in a model mouth for 66 h. synthetic saliva containing bovine salivary glycoprotein supported bacterial growth, although the  delivery of an intermittent nutrient supplement, containing 1% (w/v) glucose or sucrose, gave greater bacterial cell and viable counts. when streptococcus mutans c67-1 was super-inoculated onto 24-hour mixed plaques, it became established under all regimens, but there was pronounced colonization resistance. with saliva only, the proportion of s. mutans at 66 h was less than 0.5% of the total cultivable microflora. when a glucose supplement was delivered for 1 h every 6 h, s. mutans attained a final proportion of 2.4%. with sucrose, both s. mutans c67-1 and its non-cariogenic glucan-deficient mutant, c67-25, attained similar proportions of 15-20%. these experiments indicate how this model can be used to study the factors influencing colonizing ability and microbial interactions in biofilms under controlled conditions.

TI  == microbiological studies of carious dentine from human teeth with irreversible pulpitis.
AB  == aerobic and anaerobic cultures were made from 29 extracted teeth with irreversible pulpitis to identify the predominant flora in different parts of deep carious lesions. most isolates were gram-positive rods, in which lactobacilli were the most frequent organisms, then other gram-positive, non-branching rods. gram-positive cocci were the next most common; only a low number of streptococcus mutans was recovered. two types of carious lesions were found, one with high numbers of lactobacilli, the other with low. in the 15 lesions with high numbers, lactobacilli constituted 91.9% of the total flora at the pulpal site and gradually decreased in number as the sampling moved away from the pulp. strep. mutans and alpha-haemolytic streptococci were not recovered from pulpal or deep carious sites in this group. in the 14 lesions with low numbers of lactobacilli, the flora was diverse. gram-positive cocci, anaerobic gram-positive non-branching rods, branching rods and/or bacteroides were the main isolates in a few of this group.

TI  == microbiological and immunological aspects of experimental periodontal disease in  rats: a review article.
AB  == animal models in which microbiological and immunological aspects of periodontal disease can be studied prospectively seem well warranted. the rat bears much resemblance to man with respect to periodontal anatomy, development and composition of dental plaque, histopathology of periodontal lesions, and basic immunobiology. furthermore, reproducible methods are available for assessment of  periodontal disease in rats, and detectable periodontal destruction can be induced in a few weeks in these animals without traumatizing periodontal tissues  with ligatures. experimental periodontitis studies in germ-free rats have confirmed the pathogenicity of several suspected periodontal pathogens (actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, and fusobacterium nucleatum). the studies also suggest that the number of periodontal pathogens may be higher than generally believed, since species like streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus are  associated with periodontal bone loss in rats. studies in rats with congenital or induced immune defects indicate that generalized or selective immunosuppression at the time of infection with periodontal pathogens may aggravate periodontal disease. studies in immunized rats indicate that periodontal disease can be prevented by immunization against periodontal pathogens. however, it is also possible by immunization to induce periodontal destruction; i.e., the immune system has a destructive potential which should not be overlooked. in the future, the rat model may prove valuable for initial screening of antigen preparations and immunization regimens in the search for a periodontitis vaccine.

TI  == effects of an acidic calcium phosphate solution and the intraoral fluoride-releasing device on dental caries and fluoride uptake in rats.
AB  == this investigation comprised two studies evaluating the effects of an acidic calcium phosphate solution (cps) on fluoride uptake in the enamel, glycolysis of  dental plaque, the incidence of dental caries and urinary fluoride concentrations of rats wearing an intraoral fluoride-releasing device (ifrd). in the first study, cps-fluoride treatment preceded the cariogenic challenge. in the second study, the cariogenic challenge preceded the treatments. in the first study, cps  treatments increased the ability of enamel to bind fluoride. however, the enamel-bound fluoride exerted a negligible effect on plaque glycolysis as measured by the ph decrease after sucrose challenge. in the second study cps augmented the caries inhibition for both the sulcal-morsal and buccal-lingual surfaces. in both studies the ifrd significantly restricted the development of carious enamel on the sulcal-morsal surfaces and caused elevated concentrations of fluoride in the urine independent of cps treatments.

TI  == factors in virulence expression and their role in periodontal disease pathogenesis.
AB  == the classic progression of the development of periodontitis with its associated formation of an inflammatory lesion is characterized by a highly reproducible microbiological progression of a gram-positive microbiota to a highly pathogenic  gram-negative one. while this gram-negative microbiota is estimated to consist of at least 300 different microbial species, it appears to consist of a very limited number of microbial species that are involved in the destruction of periodontal diseases. among these "putative periodontopathic species" are members of the genera porphyromonas, bacteroides, fusobacterium, wolinella, actinobacillus, capnocytophaga, and eikenella. while members of the genera actinomyces and streptococcus may not be directly involved in the microbial progression, these species do appear to be essential to the construction of the network of microbial species that comprise both the subgingival plaque matrix. the temporal fluctuation (emergence/disappearance) of members of this microbiota from the developing lesion appears to depend upon the physical interaction of the periodontal pocket inhabitants, as well as the utilization of the metabolic end-products of the respective species intimately involved in the disease progression. a concerted action of the end-products of prokaryotic metabolism and the destruction of host tissues through the action of a large number of excreted  proteolytic enzymes from several of these periodontopathogens contribute directly to the periodontal disease process.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == sanguinaria extract, which contains benzophenanthridine alkaloids, has been used  as a folk medicine for many years. minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mic and mbc values) for sanguinarine were determined for common and etiologically important plaque bacteria. because the efficacy of sanguinarine is believed to be enhanced by zinc, isobolograms were assessed to determine their mode(s) of interaction. hydrogen ion concentration influenced the inhibitory activity of both sanguinarine and zinc. for sanguinarine, at the optimum ph (6.5), mic values were 4 or 8 micrograms/ml for streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. mic values were 0.125-0.50 mmol zn/ml. mbc values ranged  from 1 to 8 mmol zn/ml at ph 5.5. isobologram data revealed that sanguinarine and zinc interacted synergistically. viadent oral rinse, which contained 300 micrograms sanguinaria extract/ml and 0.2% zinc chloride (14.9 mmol zn/l), was inhibitory to all strains tested. mic values were 1 or 2% (ml viadent oral rinse/100 ml aqueous solution) for all strains except a. viscosus for which the mic value was 12% (vol/vol).

TI  == insertional inactivation of the gene encoding a 76-kilodalton cell surface polypeptide in streptococcus gordonii challis has a pleiotropic effect on cell surface composition and properties.
AB  == a library of streptococcus gordonii dl1-challis dna was constructed in lambda gt11. phage plaques were screened for production of antigens that reacted with antiserum to s. gordonii cell surface proteins. a recombinant phage denoted lambda gt11-cp2 was isolated that carried 1.85 kb of s. gordonii dna and that expressed an antigen with a molecular mass of 29 kda in escherichia coli. antibodies that reacted with the expression product were affinity purified and were shown to react with a single polypeptide antigen with a molecular mass of 76 kda in s. gordonii dl1-challis. a segment (0.85 kb) of the cloned dna within the  transcription unit was ligated into a nonreplicative plasmid carrying an erythromycin resistance determinant and transformed into s. gordonii dl1-challis. the plasmid integrated onto the chromosome, and expression of the 76-kda polypeptide antigen was abolished. the gene inactivation had no obvious effect on bacterial growth or on a number of phenotypic properties, including hydrophobicity and adherence. however, it abolished serum-induced cell aggregation, mutant cells had reduced aggregation titers in saliva and in colostrum immunoglobulin a, and it also reduced coaggregation with some actinomyces species. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis profiles of cell envelope proteins from wild-type and mutant strains showed that  as well as lacking the surface-exposed 76-kda polypeptide, mutant cell envelopes  were deficient in several other polypeptides, including those that bound to immunoglobulin a. expression of the gene encoding the 76-kda polypeptide in s. gordonii appeared to be critical for functional conformation of the cell surface.

TI  == studies of the subgingival microflora in patients with acquired immunodeficiency  syndrome.
AB  == two unique forms of periodontal disease, hiv-gingivitis and hiv-periodontitis, have been described in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (aids). in order to determine the bacterial species associated with periodontitis in aids patients, the predominant cultivable microflora was examined in 21 subgingival plaque samples from 11 aids patients with periodontitis. the presence of putative periodontal pathogens including actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides intermedius, porphyromonas gingivalis (formerly b. gingivalis), and wolinella recta was examined by immunofluorescence in 128 subgingival dental plaque samples from 50 aids patients including 32 patients with periodontitis. of 666 bacterial  strains isolated from the 21 subgingival plaque samples, streptococcus sanguis ii was the most frequently recovered species comprising 18.5% of the total number of isolates followed by lactobacillus acidophilus (12.2%), porphyromonas gingivalis  (12%), fusobacterium nucleatum (11.4%), staphylococcus epidermidis (8.7%), actinomyces naeslundii (7.5%), and actinomyces viscosus (4.7%). fusobacterium nucleatum was the most prevalent species and was found in 76% of the sites and 91% of the patients. enteric species including enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecalis, clostridium clostridiiforme and clostridium difficle as well as klebsiella pneumoniae also were recovered. immunofluorescence assays detected similar carriage rates of a. actinomycetemcomitans, b. intermedius, and  p. gingivalis in both gingivitis patients and periodontitis patients, while four  times more periodontitis patients demonstrated w. recta. subgingival yeast was a  frequent finding in these aids patients, present in 62% of the subjects and 55% of the sites. this study indicates that subgingival plaque in aids patients with  periodontitis can harbor high proportions of the same periodontal pathogens as are associated with periodontitis in non-hiv infected subjects as well as high proportions of opportunistic pathogens.

TI  == localization and identification of root canal bacteria in clinically asymptomatic periapical pathosis.
AB  == twenty-one teeth with clinically asymptomatic periapical pathosis (class 3) were  extracted and the isolation, identification, and localization of bacteria in the  root apex were examined. mixtures involving several bacteria were isolated from more than 60% of the cases. scanning electron microscopy revealed bacterial masses to be associated with the apical part of the root canal, but not with the  area of apical foramen or on the surface of root apex. our results indicate that  the bacteria in class 3 cases may be derived from organisms which colonized before or during endodontic treatment, but not from anachoresis. the bacteria-positive cases of asymptomatic periapical pathosis have the potential to progress to symptomatic periapical pathosis.

TI  == aggregation of oral bacteria by human salivary mucins in comparison to salivary and gastric mucins of animal origin.
AB  == seventeen strains of oral bacteria of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (9) were tested for aggregation by the human whole salivary mucin fraction (hwsm) in comparison to three types of animal mucin preparations from submandibular glands of cow (bsm) and sheep (osm), and from the stomach of pig (pgm). considerable variation was seen with respect to the rate and titer of aggregation induced by these mucins. the aggregating activity of hwsm varied widely among the different bacterial strains. the bacteroides group showed hardly any induced aggregation, whereas the final aggregation titers varied for s. sanguis (3 strains) between 12 and 48, for s. oralis (3 strains) between 6 and 48, for the s. mutans group (3 strains) between 6 and 96, and for the five actinomyces strains even between 6 and 192. for a particular strain, similar differences in titer were seen between the four mucins. for a human salivary mucin (mg-2) it has been described that sialic acid in the sequence neuac (alpha 2,3)gal(beta 1,3)galnac- was specifically involved in the interaction with s. sanguis strains, in contrast to s. rattus bht. our results, however, indicate that this sugar sequence is not a prerequisite for the aggregation of s. sanguis, as animal mucins, devoid of this structure, were equally well or even better capable of inducing aggregation. on the other hand, desialization of bsm and osm largely abolished their aggregating capability towards s. rattus bht. moreover, it was found that bsm and osm, which are comparable with respect to their major oligosaccharide structure, show considerable differences in aggregating activity towards the same bacterial strain.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == characterization of haptoglobin-binding properties of streptococci of serological group g.
AB  == two group g streptococcal cultures (g 10187, g 11122) with surface antigen t4 possess surface receptors for human haptoglobin (hp). g 10187 additionally interacted with immunoglobulin g and albumin, g 11122 with fibrinogen and fibronectin. binding of 125i-hp 2-1 was time-dependent, saturable, reversible in  the presence of unlabelled hp and could be inhibited by unlabelled human-hp 2-1,  -hp 2-2, -hp 1-1, hp-hemoglobin complexes and by hp preparations from pigs, horses and rabbits. the hp binding sites could be destroyed by heat treatment (95 degrees c) and by proteolytic treatment of the bacteria. hp binding sites were solubilized from group g streptococcal surface by heat treatment of the bacteria  at acid ph and subsequently isolated by affinity chromatography on hp 2-1 sepharose. sds-page and western blotting of the hp binding proteins revealed numerous protein bands with 125i-hp 2-1 binding activity. specific antibodies against g streptococcal binding proteins prepared in chickens inhibited binding of 125i-hp to group g and group a streptococci, but not to actinomyces pyogenes.

TI  == cerebral botryomycosis: case study.
AB  == after oral surgery, a 32-year-old man developed a brain abscess. actinomycosis was suspected due to history, clinical findings, response to penicillin therapy,  and demonstration of "sulfur granules" in the surgical specimen, but anaerobic cultures were negative for actinomyces. aerobic cultures yielded streptococcus sanguis and pseudomonas cepacia. coccoid organisms demonstrated histologically reacted positively with periodic acid-schiff, gomori's methenamine silver, and brown and brenn stains, were ziehl-neelsen-negative, and did not include branching filaments. fluorescent antibody assay for actinomyces israelii was also negative. electron microscopy revealed cell wall morphology and pattern of cell division characteristic of gram-positive cocci. these findings led to a final diagnosis of botromycosis due to s. sanguis. this third report of cerebral botryomycosis emphasizes the differential diagnosis with actinomycosis, the association with intermittently treated jaw disease, and identification of the causative agent by histologic, immunologic, and electron microscopic methods.

AB  == intergeneric coaggregation of streptococcus gordonii (s. sanguis) pk488 and actinomyces naeslundii pk606 was studied by using coaggregation-defective (cog-)  mutants of both strains. a streptococcal protein of 38 kilodaltons was identified with anti-s. gordonii serum absorbed with cog- cells of the streptococcus. absorbed immunoglobulin g specifically blocked coaggregation of the streptococcus-actinomyces pair but did not affect the coaggregation of the streptococcus with other coaggregation partners. the 38-kilodalton protein was found in the supernatant of mild sonicated cell suspensions and was extracted from whole cells with sodium barbital or with 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)-dimethylammonio]-1-propanesulfonate (chaps). an immunoreactive protein of the same size was found in sonicated cell supernatants  of several other oral streptococci that also coaggregated with a. naeslundii pk606. inhibition of s. gordonii pk488-a. naeslundii pk606 coaggregation was not  observed with any of 16 different sugars tested. we propose that a functionally similar adhesin that mediates coaggregations with a. naeslundii pk606 is expressed by several species of the genus streptococcus.

TI  == microbiological and clinical effects of a dentifrice containing zinc citrate and  triclosan in the human experimental gingivitis model.
AB  == a partial mouth experimental gingivitis model was employed to establish the effect of a dentifrice containing 0.2% triclosan and 0.5% zinc citrate on the development of chronic gingivitis. in addition, changes in the plaque flora associated with the developing gingivitis have been monitored. following a period of stringent oral hygiene, volunteers were allocated to 1 of 2 treatment groups.  a toothshield was constructed to fit 4 posterior mandibular teeth. during the 21-day experimental period test or placebo dentifrice was applied to the experimental teeth via the tooth shield. the toothshield also prevented plaque removal from those teeth during habitual brushing of the remaining dentition. supragingival plaque was collected at baseline and day 21 for analysis of the total bacterial flora. at the end of the experimental period, plaque and gingivitis had developed in both groups. however, the test group had significantly less plaque and gingivitis than the placebo group. the microbiological data demonstrated that plaque from the test group contained significantly lower numbers of anaerobes compared to plaque from the placebo group. this was considered particularly significant as these bacteria are generally associated with chronic inflammatory periodontal disease. there was also a trend for the numbers of actinomyces to decrease in plaque from the test group but not in the placebo group.

AB  == eighty-one human subjects completed a double-blind study which examined the effects of a 0.3% triclosan/2% gantrez copolymer/0.243% sodium fluoride dentifrice on the microflora of supragingival dental plaque. subjects were divided into an experimental group which performed normal oral hygiene with the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice and a control group which also performed  normal oral hygiene with the same dentifrice minus the triclosan/copolymer. at baseline, 10 weeks, and 28 weeks, supragingival dental plaque was collected from  buccal and lingual surfaces of the four first molar teeth and assayed for: 1) bacterial morphotypes by phase contrast microscopy, 2) actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, actinomyces species, bacteroides forsythus, bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and wolinella recta by immunofluorescence microscopy, and 3) lactobacillus, yeast, enterics, staphylococcus, aerobes and anaerobes by bacterial culture. after 28 weeks' use of their respective dentifrices, changes in the supragingival plaque microflora of the subjects were similar between the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group and the control dentifrice group, except for statistically significant reductions in fusiforms, spirochetes and staphylococci and significant increases in s. sanguis in the triclosan/copolymer/fluoride dentifrice group, as compared to the control dentifrice group. the subject population was unusual in the presence of enteric species and anaerobes found in supragingival plaque sites. this study indicates that the use of a dentifrice containing 0.3% triclosan and 2% gantrez copolymer over an extended period of time (28 weeks) does not result in shifts in the microflora of supragingival plaque favoring the growth of either opportunistic or pathogenic bacterial species.

TI  == the effects of sucralose on coronal and root-surface caries.
AB  == sucralose is an intensely sweet, chlorinated carbohydrate structurally similar to sucrose; thus, its cariogenic potential is of great interest. four groups of 12 sprague-dawley rats were infected with streptococcus mutans (sobrinus), caged in  a konig-hofer programmed feeding machine, and fed diet 2000 or modified diet to contain sucralose at various concentrations instead of sucrose. rats fed sucralose diet developed significantly fewer lesions than did the rats fed regular diet 2000. animals fed diet 2000 also harbored more s. mutans (sobrinus)  than did the other groups of animals. in a concurrent study, desalivated rats were inoculated with s. mutans (sobrinus) and actinomyces viscosus. they were fed (ad libitum) either diet 2000 (contains 56% sucrose) or diet 2000 minus sucrose plus 93 mg% sucralose. the severity of caries lesions in the sucralose-fed rats after 35 days was significantly less than those in the sucrose-fed rats. the amount of root exposure was the same in both groups. however, root-surface caries did not develop in the sucralose-fed rats. these results show that sucralose is non-cariogenic in rats.

TI  == association of the microbial flora of dental plaque and saliva with human root-surface caries.
AB  == dental plaque was obtained from one or two sound root surfaces of subjects with different degrees of root-surface caries experience. from subjects with root-surface caries, plaque samples were also obtained from either one incipient  or one more advanced lesion. proportions of the total flora were determined for total streptococci and different streptococcal species, total and different actinomyces species, and lactobacilli. a sample of saliva was obtained from about one-third of the subjects for determination of the concentrations of mutans streptococci and lactobacilli. the main observations were: (1) subjects without root-surface caries or restorations (group i), as compared with subjects with root-surface caries with or without restorations (group ii), were characterized by having a lower prevalence and proportion of mutans streptococci and a higher prevalence and proportion of a. naeslundii in plaque on sound root surfaces; (2)  subjects in group i also tended to have a lower salivary concentration of mutans  streptococci and lactobacilli than subjects in group ii; (3) dental plaque on sound surfaces in group ii subjects contained a lower proportion of mutans streptococci than plaque associated with incipient or advanced lesions; and (4) the prevalence and proportion of lactobacilli in plaque associated with sound as  well as carious root surfaces were very low. the data reinforce findings from other studies and indicate that, as for coronal caries, the plaque and saliva populations of mutans streptococci specifically are correlated positively with the presence of root-surface caries.

TI  == effect of culture medium on acid production from sorbitol by oral bacteria.
AB  == the fermentation of sorbitol or glucose and the acid production by strains belonging to the genera actinomyces, lactobacillus, and streptococcus isolated from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora were studied in cultures in complex or defined bacteriologic broths and in saliva-based broth. the growth yields of lactobacillus and streptococcus in the saliva-based media and of actinomyces in the defined broth were poor. addition of fermentable carbohydrate to the saliva-based broth favored the growth of streptococcus and lactobacillus but not that of actinomyces. the results showed obvious differences in the capacity of oral bacteria to ferment sorbitol between cultures in saliva-based and bacteriologic broths. lactobacillus failed to utilize sorbitol when saliva was the only source of nutrients. lower proportions of lactic and formic acids were formed from sorbitol by actinomyces and lactobacillus in the saliva-based than in the bacteriologic media. the findings illustrate some mechanisms possibly involved in the interactions between sorbitol and dental plaque flora.

TI  == the influence of sucralose on bacterial metabolism.
AB  == sucralose (1',4',6' trideoxy-trichloro-galactosucrose) is a nontoxic, intensely sweet sucrose derivative that has been shown to be non-cariogenic in experimental animals. the purpose of this study was to determine whether certain oral bacteria could utilize sucralose. sucralose, as a sole carbon source, was unable to support growth of ten strains of oral bacteria and dental plaque. when sucrolose  was incorporated into a liquid medium containing glucose or sucrose, all organisms tested displayed similar ph falls, compared with controls. the incorporation of 126 mmol/l sucralose into glucose agar medium caused total inhibition of growth of streptococcus sobrinus 6715-17, streptococcus sanguis 10904, streptococcus sanguis challis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus wvu627. sucralose had no effect on ips production. sucralose was not bound to, nor taken up by, cells. sucralose inhibited the formation of glucan and fructan polymers in proportion to the sucralose-to-enzyme ratio, but independent  of the sucrose concentration in the assay mixture. no radioactive polymer was formed from 14c-u-sucralose added to mixtures containing glucosyltransferase (gtf) or fructosyl-transferase (ftf). inhibition of gtf and ftf by sucralose was  removed following dialysis of the enzyme/sucralose mixture. these results show that sucralose was not utilized by the oral bacteria tested and that the inhibitory effect of sucralose on gtf and ftf was non-competitive and reversible. the results further support the concept that sucralose is non-cariogenic.

TI  == microflora associated with experimental root surface caries in humans.
AB  == this study describes the microflora from actively progressing root surface caries lesions, in which mineral loss had been determined by quantitative microradiography. the caries lesions were produced experimentally in root surface specimens from human molars inserted in lower partial dentures carried for 3 months by six elderly individuals. a total of 780 bacterial isolates were identified from 13 plaque samples, collected with a punch technique, and six dentin samples. the composition of the microflora showed distinct individual differences. the microflora from plaque samples associated with the highest mineral loss was dominated by either actinomyces viscosus or a combination of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and f) and lactobacillus species (l. casei and l. brevis). plaque from root surfaces with less pronounced mineral loss harbored a more complex microflora comprising gram-positive rods, mutans streptococci, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, veillonella spp., gram-negative rods, and low numbers of lactobacilli. in the latter samples, individual variations in  the proportions of mutans streptococci (serotypes c, d, and g), actinomyces species (a. viscosus and a. naeslundii), and veillonella parvula biotypes were observed. these findings suggest that certain species or combinations of species  are more cariogenic than others and that dominance of single acidogenic species in particular is conducive to high caries activity.

TI  == effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius.
AB  == the effect of ph on the growth and proteolytic activity of the type strain and fresh isolates of porphyromonas gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius was investigated. b. intermedius strains grew with and without glucose at a ph as low as 5.0. these bacteria grew almost as well as streptococcus mutans at ph 5.0 and  better than actinomyces viscosus at ph 5.5 and 5.0. some b. intermedius strains raised the culture ph when grown at a low ph without glucose. in contrast, p. gingivalis strains grew only at ph 6.5 to 7.0. the p. gingivalis strains had proteolytic activities against azocoll, azocasein, and azoalbumin, while the b. intermedius strains degraded azocasein and azoalbumin, but not azocoll. b. intermedius showed maximum proteolytic activity at ph 7.0, and high activity over a wide ph range. in contrast, the optimum ph of proteolytic activity in p. gingivalis was ph 7.5 to 8.0. the p. gingivalis activities were more sensitive than those of b. intermedius to low ph. the capacity of b. intermedius to degrade proteins to more readily metabolizable substrates at low ph might explain the growth of this bacterium in an acidic environment. these differences between b. intermedius and p. gingivalis could explain their capacity to survive at different sites in the oral cavity and indicate how b. intermedius might positively influence the growth of p. gingivalis in subgingival plaque.

AB  == in vivo plaque formation on implant materials was studied. when different implant materials were set on the gingiva, the number of adhering viable bacteria depended on material surface properties 4 hours after setting, but not 48 hours after setting. the formation of pellicle-like thin layers and subsequent covering by lamellarly formed plaque were observed on the surfaces of all materials. streptococcus species were predominant at the 4-hour setting time but anaerobes increased at the 48-hour setting time; this was common to all materials. the results indicate that surface properties of the implants influence early bacterial adherence, but do not influence bacterial flora or plaque maturation. the subgingival microflora at the neck of implants with clinically normal peri-implant tissues was compared with that at the neck of natural teeth. the bacterial isolates were classified based on their biochemical characteristics. for the spirochaetes, the number was counted directly under light microscopic observation. the most predominant bacterial species was streptococcus, followed by actinomyces, neisseria and then capnocytophaga at both sites. the ratio of spirochaetes in the microflora was extremely low for both the implant and natural tooth. such a bacterial distribution pattern closely resembled the hitherto-reported distribution of bacteria existing in a healthy gingival crevicular. this suggested that the microflora in plaque at the neck of a normal  implant is basically similar to that at the neck of a natural tooth. in conclusion, plaque formation on implant materials was not influenced by their surface properties in actual oral cavity.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == a multicentre study to evaluate the effect of sulbactam/ampicillin combination on anaerobic micro-organisms.
AB  == ampicillin combined with the beta-lactamase inhibitor sulbactam was compared with ampicillin alone, cefoxitin and metronidazole against 569 clinical strains of anaerobic organisms. the strains included 289 species of bacteroides, 160 strains of clostridium and 120 strains of various species of streptococcus/peptostreptococus, fusobacterium, veillonella, eubacterium, bifidobacterium, actinomyces and propionibacterium. sulbactam/ampicillin was as effective as cefoxitin and metronidazole against all anaerobic species tested, inhibiting more than 90% of strains at the breakpoints (16, 32 and 32 mg/l, respectively). sulbactam/ampicillin was also significantly more active than ampicillin against strains of bacteroides, the minimal inhibitory concentration being at least four-fold lower. in contrast, the activity of the combination did  not differ from that of ampicillin alone against fusobacterium species and gram-positive rods and cocci.

TI  == microbiology of root surface caries in humans.
AB  == studies on the microbiology of root surface caries between 1970 and 1975 placed emphasis on gram-positive pleomorphic filamentous rods, particularly actinomyces  viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. both of these species had been shown to produce root surface caries in experimental animals. since this time, studies have placed more emphasis on streptococcus mutans, and s. mutans and lactobacillus are significant in prediction of root surface caries risk in patients. subsequent studies confirmed an association between s. mutans and 'soft' or 'initial' root lesions. thus, it is important when determining the microflora of root surface lesions to make careful characterization of the state  of the lesion. a second important aspect of the analysis of bacterial communities associated with root surface caries is better definition of the organisms. most studies have concentrated on 'target organisms' s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, lactobacillus, and veillonella. however, it has been known for 17 years that the actinomyces associated with the lesions may be variants of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii. such strains (intermediate strains) have been described in taxonomic studies of actinomyces, yet little is known of the differences in physiology of these strains or their relationship to root surface caries. a similar situation exists with oral streptococcus where new taxonomic divisions are being proposed. recognition of the potential diversity within the 'target' genera of root surface caries could yield valuable data. recent studies suggest that this is so, since samples from root surface lesions which contain s. mutans and lactobacillus show a high isolation of s. mitis 1 and no isolations of a. naeslundii. careful definition of the lesions of root surface caries and the flora will allow analysis to relate a specific bacterial community to the state fo the lesion and assist in monitoring the control of the lesion through fluoride and antibacterials.

TI  == selective modulation of bacterial attachment to oral epithelial cells by enzyme activities associated with poor oral hygiene.
AB  == the present investigation explored the hypothesis that elevated levels of certain enzymes in the gingival crevicular environment of individuals with poor oral hygiene and/or gingival inflammation may modify the surfaces of epithelial cells  and thereby modulate the types of bacteria which attach and colonize. buccal epithelial cells treated with neuraminidase and certain proteases were used as a  model for study. bacteria studied included streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis which have been associated with gingival health, actinomyces  species which are increased in plaque associated with developing gingivitis, and  bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides intermedius, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans which are associated with destructive periodontal diseases. treatment of epithelial cells with the enzymes studied produced selective effects on their receptivity for bacteria. neuraminidase treatment of epithelial cells greatly reduced the attachment of all strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis studied. in contrast, the number of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and a. israelii cells which attached was significantly increased. neuraminidase treatment also appeared to enhance attachment of b. intermedius and b. gingivalis. treatment of  buccal cells with trypsin, chymotrypsin or papain also selectively affected bacterial attachment. such protease treatment greatly reduced the numbers of streptococci and a. viscosus cells which attached, while the numbers of b. gingivalis and b. intermedius were significantly increased. treatment of epithelial cells with preparations of lysosomal enzymes derived from human pmns produced similar selective effects. the changes in bacterial adhesion observed by the enzyme treatments studied are consistent with the shifts in the composition of the gingival crevice flora which occur when oral hygiene is terminated and gingivitis develops.

(2) five of the bacteria were gram positive and three were gram negative. the morphological characteristic suggested the presence of actinomyces in the case of gram positive rods; fusobacterium in the case of gram  negative rods; neisseria and veillonella in the of gram negative cocci and streptococci for the rest of the colonies. the biochemical characterization of the bacteria suggested the absence of streptococcus mutans in the dental plaque of this animals.

TI  == ph regulation of urease levels in streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == potential mechanisms for regulation of urease levels in streptococcus salivarius  were examined, including: induction by urea, nitrogen or carbon source repression, and effects of ph and co2 (because co2 enrichment enhanced urease detection on urea agar plates). regulation by either ph or co2 was confirmed by comparison of the urease accumulation pattern during anaerobic growth under co2 with that under n2. under co2, there was an initial buffering plateau at ph 6.2 and a rate of streptococcus salivarius urease accumulation three-fold that under  n2, with a ph 7.6 plateau. with both gas phases there was also an increase in the rate of urease appearance coincident with the decrease in medium ph following the ph plateau. the effects of ph, co2, and hco3- on urease levels and on growth were separately assessed by culture in media containing 0, 25, 100 mmol/l khco3 buffered at different ph levels. there was an inverse relationship between the logarithm of the urease level after 24-hour growth and the ph during growth-the urease specific activity was 100-fold higher at ph 5.5, compared with ph 7.0 and  above. hco3-/co2 (100 mmol/l) had little effect on urease levels, but was essential for growth at ph 5.5. there was no significant urease induction by urea, or repression by ammonia or glucose. there was also evidence of ph regulation of urease levels in some staphylococci, klebsiella pneumonia, and corynebacterium renale, but not in actinomyces naeslundii and several other species. we conclude that the external ph is a major factor regulating urease levels in s. salivarius and possibly some other species-a mechanism equivalent to urease repression by oh-.

AB  == thirty strains from the streptococcus milleri (anginosus) group (smg) obtained from various sources were tested for a range of characters that could be associated with pathogenicity and the results were compared with those for type strains of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. pyogenes. the smg strains were heterogeneous in all tests. most (18) belonged to one of the lancefield groups with group f predominating. adherence of strains isolated from abscesses to buccal epithelial cells was greater than that of other strains (p = 0.033). compared with strains of s. sanguis, smg strains were generally not aggregated by human saliva. they differed from the type strain of s. pyogenes in their relative ability to bind fibrinogen and fibronectin; they were less effective in binding fibrinogen (0.33-4.28% cf. 22% for s. pyogenes) and generally more effective in binding fibronectin (0.49-12.37% cf. 0.95%). strains isolated from infections were statistically better at binding fibronectin than other strains (p less than  0.001). the ability of strains to adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) varied 10-fold, from 0.16-16.35%. the amount of fibronectin bound by smg strains  correlated with their ability to adhere to sha (p less than 0.001). the hydrophobicity of the strains, as measured in the hexadecane partition assay, ranged from 0.0% to 99.0%. some strains carried both positive and negative cell-surface charges and some strains with a highly hydrophobic cell surface also possessed a relatively high cell-surface charge. a minority of strains possessed  a net positive cell-surface charge. neither hydrophobicity nor cell-surface charge was related to the capacity of strains to adhere to sha. strains of smg co-aggregated weakly with strains of veillonella parvula, v. dispar, actinomyces  viscosus and a. naeslundii.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of selected veterinary bacterial pathogens to ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin and norfloxacin.
AB  == the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and norfloxacin were tested for approximately ten clinical isolates of each of actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinobacillus suis, actinomyces pyogenes, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, haemophilus parasuis, haemophilus somnus, pasteurella haemolytica, pasteurella multocida, rhodococcus equi, streptococcus equi, streptococcus suis and streptococcus zooepidemicus. ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin had similar activity and were more  active than norfloxacin. all isolates had an mic of 1.0 microgram/ml or less for  ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin, and these drugs had particularly marked activity  against the gram-negative bacteria tested.

TI  == streptococcus suis infection in swine. a sixteen month study.
AB  == a total of 349 isolates of streptococcus suis retrieved from different tissues from diseased pigs were examined in this study. only 48% of them could be categorized as one of serotypes 1 to 8 and 1/2. among typable isolates, serotype  2 was the most prevalent (23%), followed by serotype 3 (10%). the majority of all isolates originated from lungs, meninges/brain, and multiple tissues. forty-one percent of typable isolates and 33% of untypable isolates were retrieved in pure  culture. other isolates were found in conjunction with pasteurella multocida, escherichia coli, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, actinomyces pyogenes, and other streptococci. typable s. suis isolates were more frequently isolated from pigs between five and ten weeks of age, while untypable isolates were mostly found in animals aged more than 24 weeks. no obvious monthly and/or seasonal variation of the prevalence of isolation of s. suis could be detected.

TI  == cellular coaggregation of oral streptococcus milleri with actinomyces.
AB  == oral isolates of streptococcus milleri were examined for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces. of the 68 s. milleri strains tested, including 3 reference strains, 40 strains coaggregated with actinomyces naeslundii wvu45 (actinomyces coaggregation group b) and 36 strains coaggregated with actinomyces  viscosus t14v (actinomyces coaggregation group a). all s. milleri strains of serotypes b (4 strains), e (2 strains), and f (24 strains) coaggregated with both of the actinomyces. the coaggregation reactions between the s. milleri cells and  a. naeslundii wvu45 cells were optimal at about ph 7.0 and were ca2+ or mg2+ dependent, but they were not inhibited by the presence of simple sugars or amino  sugars, including lactose (up to 0.5 m). treatment of the s. milleri cells with heat (100 degrees c, 3 min) or proteases (trypsin, 1.0 mg/ml; pronase, 0.25 mg/ml; 37 degrees c; 3 h) and of the actinomyces cells with periodate (0.01 m, 4  degrees c, 16 h) destroyed their coaggregating abilities. the coaggregations between cells of the s. milleri strains, we well as cells of the streptococcus sanguis h1 (reference strain for streptococcus coaggregation group 2) and the actinomyces strains (wvu45 and t14v), were inhibited by afh1 (a carbohydrate receptor on t14v cells for a lectin on h1 cells). these interactions were also inhibited by anti-afh1 immunoglobulin g (igg) and by anti-b, anti-e, and anti-f s. milleri igg or anti-f igg fab fragments. these results suggest that s. milleri, at least strains of serotypes b, e, and f, belongs to streptococcus coaggregation group 2.

TI  == effect of dental plaque age and bacterial composition on the ph of artificial fissures in human volunteers.
AB  == changes in sucrose-induced plaque ph profiles and the microbial composition of occlusal tooth surface fissures were analyzed using wire telemetry and bacterial  culturing techniques. four human volunteers wore appliances containing artificial fissures constructed with ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (isfet) electrodes for 1, 2 and 4 days; 1 subject kept the electrode for 3 weeks. after monitoring the plaque ph response at the base of the fissure to a 10% (w/v) sucrose rinse the plaque was removed and analyzed for total viable bacteria, total and specific streptococci, lactobacilli and actinomyces spp. one-day-old plaque showed a rapid drop in plaque ph to a minimum of 4.8 +/- 0.2, with 2-day-old plaque showing the most acidogenic ph profile (minimum ph 4.6 +/- 0.2). the 4-day-old plaque response was less acidogenic (minimum ph 5.0 +/- 0.3) than the results from days 1 and 2. responses from 13- and 21-day-old fissure plaques  showed greatly decreased acidogenic responses (day 21 minimum ph 5.7). viable bacteria recovered from the fissure increased from approximately 4 x 10(6) colony-forming units on day 1 to 1.2 x 10(7) on days 2 and 4 and 1.7 x 10(7) on day 21. streptococci (greater than 50%) and actinomyces (greater than 10%) dominated in the fissure plaques and their levels were related to minimum ph. since fissure plaque of all ages tested contained high concentrations of acidogenic bacteria, the decreased acidogenic response at the base of fissures with increasing plaque age suggests that maturing fissure plaques provide an increasingly greater diffusion barrier to fermentable carbohydrates.

AB  == the supplementary effect of chlorhexidine varnish and resin on the reappearance of mutans streptococci and actinomyces spp. on root surfaces after chlorhexidine  gel treatment was studied. in 8 subjects with many restored tooth and exposed root surfaces, highly colonized with mutans streptococci, chlorhexidine varnish and resin were applied to the teeth on one side of the mouth and resin alone to the other side. this treatment significantly prolonged the time period of reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci when added to a preceding period of chlorhexidine gel treatment. in 3 of the 8 subjects, mutans streptococci were undetected for more than 4 weeks after treatment. there was a significant difference between the chlorhexidine varnish/resin side and the resin side for 5  weeks with regard to the mean numbers of mutans streptococci in root surface plaque, whereas for the actinomyces spp. no significant differences were found. in 2 subjects harboring both streptococcus mutans and s. sobrinus, the population of s. sobrinus reappeared more readily in saliva and plaque than s. mutans. the chlorhexidine treatment was less effective in suppressing the population of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii than the mutans streptococci.

TI  == [significance of the bacterial flora in the etiology of apical periodontitis. qualitative, quantitative and topographical aspects].
AB  == in the international literature it is shown the central role of root canal infection in the etiology of periapical lesions. as a matter of fact it has been  proved (13) that sterile necrotic pulp tissue is completely unable to cause inflammatory reactions at the periapex. infection of endodontic origin extends to the supporting tissues of the tooth only in the case of their acute inflammation  (e.g. acute apical periodontitis, acute alveolar abscess, phoenix abscess). on the other hand in chronic inflammation bacteria remain confined in the endodontic space. only few exceptions to this general rule have been experimentally proved.  in endodontics we deal with a mixed infection which is composed by obligate anaerobes and by facultative anaerobes. the most frequently found obligate anaerobes are bacteroides sp. and fusobacterium sp. (gram- rods) anaerobic diphtheroides (gram+ rods) peptostreptococcus sp. (gram+ cocci) and veilonella sp. (gram- cocci). actinomyces sp., lactobacillus sp., streptococcus sp., and staphilococcus sp. are the facultative anaerobes most frequently found.

TI  == genetic approaches to the study of oral microflora: a review.
AB  == as the study of oral microorganisms intensified almost 2 decades ago, the application of genetic techniques resulted in important contributions to the understanding of this clinically and ecologically important group of bacteria. the isolation and characterization of mutants of cariogenic streptococci helped to focus attention on traits that were important in colonization and virulence. such classic genetic approaches gave way to molecular genetic techniques, including recombinant dna methodology in the late 1970s. gene cloning systems and methods to move dna into cells have been developed for oral streptococci. many streptococcal genes thought to be important in colonization and virulence have since been cloned and their nucleotide sequence determined. mutant strains have been constructed using defective copies of cloned genes in order to create specific genetic lesions on the bacterial chromosome. by testing such mutants in  animal models, a picture of the cellular and molecular basis of dental caries is  beginning to emerge. these modern genetic methodologies also are being employed to develop novel and efficacious cell-free or whole cell vaccines against this infection. genetic approaches and analyses are now being used to dissect microorganisms important in periodontal disease as well. such systems should be able to exploit advances made in genetically manipulating related anaerobes, such as the intestinal bacteroides. gene cloning techniques in oral anaerobes, actinomyces and actinobacillus, are already beginning to pay dividends in helping understand gene structure and expression. additional effort is needed to develop  facile systems for genetic manipulation of these important groups of microorganisms.

TI  == influence of sweetening agents in solution on dental caries in desalivated rats.
AB  == sucralose (trichlorogalactosucrose), sorbitol and aspartame in drinking water induced little or no caries in desalivated rats infected with streptococcus sobrinus and actinomyces viscosus and receiving their essential nutrition by gastric gavage. in contrast, sucrose and fructose induced extensive decay. only sucrose could sustain implantation of strep. sobrinus in these animals. the populations of a. viscosus were sparse (0.3-0.5%) in the animals given fructose and sucrose. large populations of a. viscosus occurred in the controls and in those given sucralose, sorbitol and aspartame. in a second experiment, where animals were also desalivated and receive diet 2000 ad libitum, sucrose in solution promoted caries whereas sucralose, aspartame and saccharin were without  effect. addition of 10 parts/10(6) f overcame the caries-promoting effect of sucrose in solution. there was no interaction between fluoride and other sweetening agents that affected the incidence of caries.

TI  == effect of ph on acid production from sorbitol in washed cell suspensions of oral  bacteria.
AB  == the acid production from sorbitol and glucose was studied under anaerobic conditions in resting cell suspensions of bacteria from the predominant sorbitol-fermenting human dental plaque flora, belonging to the genera streptococcus, lactobacillus and actinomyces. the acid production activity of the bacterial cells was followed by titration with alkali, at environmental ph 7.0, 6.0 and 5.0 after addition of carbohydrate solution. the metabolic end products formed in the suspensions were analyzed thereafter by isotachophoretic and enzymatic methods. the results showed that sorbitol was fermented at a slower rate than glucose. lowering the environmental ph decreased the acid production activity from the two carbohydrates. compared with glucose, the catabolism of sorbitol was affected to greater extent by the ph conditions. the total amount of acids formed from sorbitol was considerably less than from glucose. lactic acid,  which was the major end product in glucose-challenged suspensions, was produced only in low concentrations from sorbitol by all strains tested. the ratio strong  (formic + lactic)/weak acids was moreover lower for sorbitol than for glucose. the present results further illustrate some of the mechanisms behind the low cariogenic potential of this sugar substitute.

AB  == selective media were used to isolate a wide range of bacteria from sixty human dental plaques. glucanase activities of the isolates were determined on dextran-  and starch-containing media. all sixty samples of dental plaque yielded some colonies showing amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. the glucanase-producing organisms comprised 20% of the isolates. of these 38% were gram-positive rods, 27% gram-positive cocci, 28% gram-negative rods and 7% were gram-negative cocci.  the cultural groups most commonly represented among the glucanase-producing isolates were actinomycetaceae, streptococci, haemophili and gram-negative anaerobes. species prominent among these isolates included streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema  matruchotii, bifidobacterium sp. and bacteroides sp. no isolates capable of degrading starch or dextran were identified as streptococcus milleri, rothia dentocariosa or fusobacterium sp. this study has shown that a wide range of bacterial species commonly isolated from human dental plaques exhibit both amylolytic and dextranolytic activities. in order to understand glucan metabolism in human dental plaques further investigation of these catabolic activities is necessary.

TI  == effects of varnishes containing chlorhexidine on the human dental plaque flora.
AB  == this study describes the effects of varnishes containing 0%, 10%, 20%, or 40% chlorhexidine diacetate on the microflora of human fissure dental plaque. sandarac, a natural resin, was used as the varnish base. ten subjects, each with  at least four sound fissures harboring high levels of streptococcus mutans, participated in the study. the fissures in each of the individuals were randomly  assigned to four experimental groups, in each of which one of the varnishes was tested. the varnish treatment consisted of a single application of a small amount of varnish onto the fissures. apart from the selected fissures, the rest of the dentition was left untreated. all chlorhexidine-containing varnishes selectively  suppressed s. mutans in fissure plaque, and had no effect on total viable counts  or on the numbers of actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis beyond one week. the extent of the suppression depended upon the concentration of chlorhexidine in the varnish, 40% chlorhexidine varnish giving the greatest suppression of s. mutans. at 22 weeks, after a single treatment with varnish containing 40% chlorhexidine, mean s. mutans counts were more than ten times lower than in the control or 10%-chlorhexidine varnish group. at that time, s. mutans was still undetectable in five out of ten experimental fissures in this group. the results suggested that sandarac varnishes containing high concentrations of chlorhexidine can be used successfully for long-term suppression of s. mutans in dental fissures.

AB  == twenty-eight strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and 41 selenomonas strains, including s. sputigena (24 strains), s. flueggei (10 strains), s. infelix (5 strains), and s. noxia (2 strains), were tested for their ability to coaggregate  with each other and with 49 other strains of oral bacteria representing actinobacillus, actinomyces, bacteroides, capnocytophaga, gemella, peptostreptococcus, porphyromonas, propionibacterium, rothia, streptococcus, and  veillonella species. selenomonads coaggregated with fusobacteria and with actinomyces naeslundii pk984 but not with any of the other bacteria, including other selenomonads. in contrast, fusobacteria coaggregated with members of all genera, although not with all strains of each species tested. each fusobacterium  strain appeared to have its own set of partners and coaggregation properties, unlike their partners, whose coaggregation properties in earlier surveys delineated distinct coaggregation groups. coaggregations of fusobacteria with the 63 gram-negative strains were usually inhibited by edta, whereas those with the 27 gram-positive strains were usually not inhibited. likewise, lactose-inhibitable coaggregations were common among some strains of fusobacteria and some strains from each of the genera containing gram-negative partners but were rarely observed with gram-positive partners. heating the fusobacteria at 85  degrees c for 30 min completely prevented coaggregation with most partners, suggesting the involvement of a protein on the fusobacteria. heat treatment of many of the gram-negative partners not only enhanced their coaggregation with the fusobacteria but also changed lactose-sensitive coaggregations to lactose-insensitive coaggregations. although fusobacteria coaggregated with a broader variety of oral partner strains than any other group of oral bacteria tested to date, each fusobacterium exhibited coaggregation with only a certain set of partner strains, and none of the fusobacteria adhered to other strains of  fusobacteria, indicating that recognition of partner cell surfaces is selective.  the strains of f. nucleatum are heterogeneous and cannot be clustered into distinct coaggregation groups. collectively, these results indicate that coaggregation between fusobacteria and many gram-negative partners is significantly different from their coaggregation with gram-positive partners. the contrasting variety of partners for fusobacteria and selenomonads supports the concept of coaggregation partner specificity that has been observed with every genus of oral bacteria so far examined.

TI  == [chemiluminescence response and phagocytic activity of murine polymorphonuclear leukocytes to various species of oral bacteria].
AB  == polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) are predominant cells in the gingival crevice  and saliva, and may play an important role in oral bacteria. murine peritoneal pmn was used and stimulated with 9 genera, 17 species of oral bacteria, including cariogenic and periodontal pathogens. the pmn response to the bacteria was measured by the luminol mediated chemiluminescence (cl) response and phagocytic activities, and the activities of lysozyme in the reaction medium after the cl response were also measured. the bacteria which could induce a high level of cl response of pmn were fusobacterium nucleatum, treponema denticola and bacteroides gingivalis; middle grade were staphylococcus subsp. and actinomyces subsp.; low levels were lactobacillus subsp., all 5 species of streptococci and enterococcus  faecalis. phagocytic indexes of pmn to various kind of bacteria were distributed  from 8 to 40% and the bacterial numbers in 100 pmn were 27 to 301. there was no correlation between cl values and phagocytic indexes or between cl values and the bacterial number in 100 pmn by limiting the data on staphylococcus, streptococcus subsp. and lactobacillus subsp., the correlation efficiency which was obtained between their values was r = 0.91 or 0.86. there was only a little in the lysozyme activities released from pmn by stimulation of various kind of bacteria, and the maximum difference corresponded to only 2.8% of the whole lysozyme activity of pmn. either catalase activities or sod activities were measured by h2o2 decomposition or the inhibition of xanthine oxidase activity using the intact bacteria. neither of the enzyme activities of bacteria were closely related to the level of cl response.

TI  == characterization of salivary alpha-amylase binding to streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to identify the major salivary components which interact with oral bacteria and to determine the mechanism(s) responsible for their binding to the bacterial surface. strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and actinomyces viscosus were incubated for 2 h in freshly collected human submandibular-sublingual saliva (hsmsl) or parotid saliva (hps), and bound salivary components were eluted with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate. by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western transfer, alpha-amylase (ec 3.2.1.1) was the prominent salivary component eluted from s. sanguis. studies with 125i-labeled hsmsl or 125i-labeled hps also demonstrated a component with an electrophoretic mobility identical to that of alpha-amylase which bound to s. sanguis. purified alpha-amylase from human parotid saliva was radiolabeled and found to bind to strains of s. sanguis genotypes 1 and 3 and s. mitis genotype 2, but not to strains of other species of oral bacteria. binding of [125i]alpha-amylase to streptococci was saturable, calcium independent, and inhibitable by excess unlabeled alpha-amylases from a variety of sources, but not by secretory immunoglobulin a and the proline-rich glycoprotein from hps. reduced and alkylated alpha-amylase lost enzymatic and bacterial binding activities. binding  was inhibited by incubation with maltotriose, maltooligosaccharides, limit dextrins, and starch.

TI  == antibacterial properties of five dental amalgams: an in vitro study.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of five commercially available amalgams (cupromuc, dispersalloy, fluoralloy, predalloy, and synalloy) against two bacterial species  frequently isolated from dental plaque and caries (actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans) was studied by use of a modification of the method of orstavik (1985). all amalgams displayed some antibacterial properties. this antibacterial activity was amalgam- and bacteria-dependent. cupromuc and fluoralloy were the most active, and the non-gamma 2 amalgams showed intermediate activity. combined with mechanical and biological properties, these differences should be taken into account when one is choosing an amalgam for clinical use.

TI  == the complete structure of the capsular polysaccharide from streptococcus sanguis  34.
AB  == a complete structure for the capsular polysaccharide of streptococcus sanguis 34, which is responsible for coaggregation of this bacterium with actinomyces viscosus t14v, an important step in the formation of dental plaque, is proposed,  based partly on the 1h-n.m.r. spectrum, which was assigned by 2-dimensional cosy, homonuclear hartmann-hahn spectroscopy, and nuclear overhauser effects. a phosphoric diester linkage was identified from the 31p-n.m.r. spectrum, and the linkage was determined from long range 1h-31p correlation spectroscopy. the proposed structure is supported both by methylation analysis before and after dephosphorylation and by g.l.c.-m.s. of the phosphorylated monosaccharides as their trimethylsilyl derivatives, isolated by partial hydrolysis of the polysaccharide. the structure is composed of repeating linear hexasaccharide units joined by a phosphoric diester linkage, i.e., [----po4(-)----6)-alpha-d-galpnac-(1----3)-beta-l-rhap-(1----4)-be ta -d-glcp- (1----6)-beta-d-galf-(1----6)-beta-d-galpnac-(1----3)-alpha-d-galp -(1----]n.

TI  == influence of age and immunization on development of gingivitis in rats.
AB  == to study the effect of age and antigenic priming on the development of gingivitis, 33 healthy rats were placed in contact with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, fusobacterium nucleatum, and bacteroides gingivalis. on days 0, 3, 7, and 14 after inoculation, the gingival condition was judged clinically and histologically, and serum antibody titers against the bacteria were measured. the rats were divided into three groups: 1 month old, 3 months old, and 3 months old immunized. none of the young rats developed gingivitis during the experiment, whereas half of the adult and all of the adult immunized rats bled on probing on days 7 and 14. in general, antibody titers against the bacteria were low in young rats, moderate in adult rats, and high in adult immunized rats. these results indicate that adult rats react stronger to plaque antigens than young rats and that previous contact with the antigens increases the reaction.

AB  == we compared the use of a rotary electric toothbrush with conventional toothbrushing for their effectiveness in modulating the subgingival microbiota. forty subjects who had received periodontal treatment for moderate to advanced periodontitis and were on 3-month periodontal maintenance were divided into two equal groups matched for age and sex. one group used only the rotary tooth cleaner and the other group used conventional toothbrushing, dental floss, and toothpicks for 12 months. subgingival plaque samples (two sites per patient) were taken from 10 subjects per group at baseline, 6 months, and 12 months and analyzed for percentage of obligate anaerobes and colony-forming units of black-pigmented bacteroides, fusobacterium, actinomyces, streptococcus, and veillonella spp. the percentage of spirochetes and motile rods was determined by  darkfield microscopy. results showed that levels of obligate anaerobes, fusobacterium, and actinomyces and percentage of spirochetes and motile rods decreased significantly (p less than 0.05), while levels of streptococcus spp. increased (p less than 0.05) for both groups. however, there was no significant difference between the two groups, indicating that the rotary tooth cleaner and conventional toothbrushing are equally effective in controlling gingivitis and fostering a less pathogenic microflora.

TI  == a microbiological study of early caries of approximal surfaces in schoolchildren.
AB  == a cross-sectional epidemiological study has been undertaken to relate the bacterial composition of approximal dental plaque with the earliest stages of caries development in schoolchildren. small samples of plaque were removed from multiple sites around the contact areas of 42 premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons from 29 schoolchildren (mean age = 13.5 yr). caries diagnosis was based on polarized light microscopy and contact microradiography of thin sections cut through the sample sites. fifty-seven percent of sites (37/60) showed histological evidence of demineralization. both the isolation frequency and the mean percentage viable count of mutans streptococci and actinomyces viscosus were higher at sites with early caries, although mutans streptococci could not be detected at 37% of sites with early caries. at these latter sites, the proportions of veillonella were markedly reduced. lactobacilli were rarely isolated and were never recovered from caries-free surfaces. analysis of the data shows that the relationship between plaque bacteria and enamel is neither merely  passive nor indifferent, and that particular stages of lesion formation may be associated with different combinations of bacteria.

TI  == enhancement of the infectivity of fusobacterium necrophorum by other bacteria.
AB  == necrobacillosis is caused by fusobacterium necrophorum (fn), but other organisms  are often present in the lesions. their possible role was studied in experiments  made with a virulent fn strain which, by itself, produced fatal necrobacillosis in mice provided that large doses (greater than 10(6) organisms, subcutaneously)  were given. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with fn suspended in sub-lethal doses (0.1 ml) of undiluted or diluted broth cultures of other bacteria. undiluted culture of a strain of escherichia coli reduced the infective dose of fn to less than 10 organisms; in the necrobacillosis lesions that developed, fusobacteria greatly outnumbered e. coli. a heat-killed preparation or sterile filtrate of e. coli culture had little if any effect on fn. citrobacter freundii  and comparatively small numbers of corynebacterium (actinomyces) pyogenes produced effects similar to that of e. coli. an alpha-haemolytic streptococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacteroides fragilis and fusobacterium nucleatum also enhanced the infectivity of fn, though less strikingly than e. coli. fn increased the persistence in vivo of the alpha-haemolytic streptococcus and b. fragilis, and enabled the latter to multiply profusely.

TI  == fast elisa for measuring serum antibody responses.
AB  == a method which speeds up the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) is described. the procedure uses a modified falcon fast assay screening system (becton dickinson labware, lincoln park, nj) and falcon round-bottom 96-well plates. antigen is adsorbed onto beads which extend from a lid and fit into 96-well plates. the beads are washed in a trough and reacted to antibody in the round-bottom plate. the labor required to wash the plates after coating with antigen, antibody or conjugate is thereby reduced. greater flexibility and accuracy result, especially with the use of more than one 96-well plate. in this  study, naturally occurring human igg antibody responses to two isolated bacterial antigens were measured in over 200 subjects. it was found that numerical taxonomy could be used to split out the high igg responders. the igm response to one of the antigens was less variable and not significantly related to the igg response. the fast elisa is as useful to operate as the standard elisa, but less stressful  on the operator and more rapid.

TI  == bacterial adhesion to oral tissues: a model for infectious diseases.
AB  == the majority of bacteria which colonize humans display sharp host and tissue tropisms; consequently, relatively little is known about how they initiate colonization on mucosal surfaces. the mouth has a variety of features which have  enabled it to serve as a useful model for the discovery of basic principles of host-parasite interactions occurring in mucosal environments. early studies demonstrated that indigenous bacteria attach to surfaces of the mouth in a highly selective manner; attachment was often observed to correlate with colonization. these studies led to the recognition that bacterial attachment is an essential step for colonization in environments which contain surfaces exposed to a fluid flow. bacterial adhesion has subsequently grown into a major area of infectious disease research. many bacteria have been found to possess proteinaceous components, called "adhesins", on their surfaces which bind in a stereochemically specific manner to complementary molecules, or "receptors", on the tissue surface. adhesins are often lectins which bind to saccharide receptors, but some  adhesins are thought to bind to proteinaceous receptors. studies of components of human saliva, which adsorb to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces similar to those of teeth, and promote the attachment of prominent plaque bacteria, have revealed that the acidic proline-rich proteins (prps) promote the attachment of several important bacteria. these include strains of actinomyces viscosus, bacteroides gingivalis, some strains of streptococcus mutans, and others. the salivary prp's  are a unique family of molecules. however, segments of prps are structurally related to collagen. this may be significant, since b. gingivalis and certain cariogenic streptococci bind to collagenous substrata, and such interactions may  facilitate their invasion into gingival tissues, or into dentin or cementum, respectively. another unexpected observation was that although a. viscosus and other bacteria bind avidly to prps adsorbed onto apatitic surfaces, they do not interact with prps in solution. prp molecules evidently undergo a conformational  change when they adsorb to ha, and adhesins of a. viscosus recognize cryptic segments which are only exposed in adsorbed molecules. this provides the bacteria with a mechanism for efficiently attaching to teeth while suspended in saliva. it also offers a molecular explanation for their sharp tropisms for human teeth. it  has proven convenient to refer to such hidden receptors for bacterial adhesins as "cryptitopes" (from cryptic, meaning hidden, and topo, meaning place).(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == detachment of oral bacteria from saliva-coated hydroxyapatite by human polymorphonuclear leukocytes.
AB  == human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmn) demonstrated the ability to detach actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis from saliva-coated  hydroxyapatite beads (sha). between 60 to 80% of bacteria were detached within 1  hour at pmn-to-bacteria ratios between 1:10 to 1:22. detachment was enhanced by treating bacteria with fresh but not heat-inactivated normal human serum. detachment of serum-treated a. viscosus was inhibited by cytochalasin b, l-1-tosylamide-2-phenylethylchloromethyl ketone (tpck), and deoxyglucose but not  colchicine, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (pmsf), n-carbobenzoxy-l-phenylalanine  chloromethyl ketone (zpck), and sodium azide. in the absence of serum treatment,  the detachment of a. viscosus was insensitive to lactose, galactose, and mannose. we conclude that pmn can efficiently detach bacteria from sha, this detachment is enhanced by serum, and this enhancement is probably dependent upon complement. additionally, detachment of a. viscosus bound to sha by pmn (1) does not appear to involve bacterial lectin activity, (2) seems to be dependent upon glycolytic metabolism, microfilament formation, and the activity of a tpck-sensitive serine  protease, and (3) is not sensitive to inhibitors of tubulin polymerization or heme-protein activity.

TI  == aggregation of 27 oral bacteria by human whole saliva. influence of culture medium, calcium, and bacterial cell concentration, and interference by autoaggregation.
AB  == twenty-seven oral strains of the genera actinomyces (5), bacteroides (3), and streptococcus (19) were tested for aggregation by human whole saliva, as well as  the effect of culture medium, ca-ions, and bacteria concentration thereupon. of the media tested, gf-broth gave rise to less interference by autoaggregation or higher aggregation titers than bhi and tsb, and was used throughout this study. in most cases, ca-ions (1 mm) only enhanced the rate of induced aggregation, whereas raising the bacteria concentration increased the rate of both induced- and autoaggregation. the final titers, ranging from 1-64, were hardly affected by these parameters, except those of s. rattus hg 59 and s. mutans hg 199, which were respectively increased and decreased by ca-ions. saliva-induced aggregation  was observed for 21 strains of a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. israelii, b. gingivalis, b. intermedius, s. cricetus, s. mutans, s. rattus, s. sanguis, and s. sobrinus, mostly within 15 min to 3 h. seventeen of these strains also showed autoaggregation, usually well after the onset of induced aggregation. any potential induced aggregation of b. gingivalis hg 91 was always masked by autoaggregation, as well as that of the s. mutans strains under a particular set  of conditions. the aggregation rate and titer varied considerably in a mutually unrelated and strain-dependent way. these microtiterplate data were matched by the 5 spectrophotometric patterns observed for saliva-bacterial interaction, which moreover, gave the better differentiation between induced and autoaggregation. in conclusion, most strains tested can show rapid saliva-induced aggregation in a strain-dependent way, yet strongly affected by the experimental  conditions and interference from autoaggregation.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effect on the human dental plaque flora of a varnish containing chlorhexidine diacetate. the in vitro release of chlorhexidine acetate from the varnish preparation was relatively fast on the first day, followed by a substantial decline in the subsequent three days. in a clinical experiment, 26 volunteers were randomly distributed over four experimental groups. after a dental prophylaxis, the subjects were treated with a single application of a placebo varnish (group i), a fluoride varnish (group ii), a chlorhexidine varnish (group iii), or a fluoride-plus-chlorhexidine varnish (group iv). saliva and pooled plaque samples from approximal surfaces were taken  before (baseline) and one, two, three, four, and six weeks after the treatments.  no suppression was found of total cultivable flora or s. sanguis after the experimental treatments. application of the fluoride varnish did not suppress the a. viscosus/naeslundii or s. mutans levels in the dental plaque. chlorhexidine suppressed a. viscosus/naeslundii until two weeks after the treatment. s. mutans  was significantly suppressed until four weeks after a single chlorhexidine application. while in some subjects s. mutans was effectively suppressed over the whole experimental period, in others s. mutans recovered quickly. in five subjects in whom s. mutans recovered quickly, the dentition was treated twice with chlorhexidine varnish, with an interval of one week between the treatments.  after two chlorhexidine treatments, s. mutans in saliva and on the teeth was suppressed more strongly than after a single treatment. however, the second chlorhexidine treatment could not prevent the return of s. mutans in the approximal areas to its original level.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

TI  == cariological assessment of leucrose [d-glucopyranosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] as a sugar substitute.
AB  == leucrose [d-glucosyl-alpha(1----5)-d-fructopyranose] prepared by microbial-enzymatic transglycosidation from sucrose, is the first alpha(1----5)-linked disaccharide which possesses excellent nutritional properties with regard to metabolic utilization and is well tolerated. the aim of the present work was to assess its cariogenic potential. yeast invertase was shown to be inhibited by leucrose in a noncompetitive way, while hydrogenated leucrose (leucritol) acted as an activator. plaque polysaccharide forming glucosyltransferases from streptococcus cricetus aht were not influenced by leucrose, but by leucritol. essentially no acid formation was observed after incubation of leucrose with suspensions of human dental plaque, s. mutans nctc 10449, lactobacillus casei lsb 132 and actinomyces viscosus ny 1 no. 30. leucrose was a competitive inhibitor of the acid formation from sucrose by s. mutans nctc  10449 at neutral ph. furthermore, leucrose inhibited at neutral ph considerably the uptake of sucrose by s. mutans nctc 10449. the uptake of fructose and maltose was also inhibited but that of glucose not at all. in cara rats as the animal model, leucrose was compared to sucrose and to corn starch for its cariogenic potential. in sharp contrast to the group fed with 30% sucrose, caries scores of  the 30% leucrose group were not significantly different from the starch group. ph telemetry with an indwelling electrode in man proved lueucrose to be 'safe for teeth' since plaque ph did not drop below ph 5.7. leucrose is a novel noncariogenic disaccharide and thus represents a highly promising sugar substitute for caries prevention.

TI  == surface structures, co-aggregation and adherence phenomena of streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == seven strains of streptococcus oralis were found to possess surface structures. four strains possessed long fimbriae which ranged in length from 266-366 nm, while the remaining three strains possessed shorter peritrichously distributed fibrils which ranged in length from 80-197 nm. the fibrillar strains were morphologically similar to strains of streptococcus sanguis i and ii and streptococcus mitis. no strain of s. oralis produced tufts of fibrils like certain strains of s. sanguis i. strains of streptococcus milleri produced peritrichously distributed fimbriae which were morphologically dissimilar to the  fimbriae produced by s. oralis strains. s. oralis strains were moderately to highly hydrophobic, but hydrophobicity could not be related to adhesion parameters or type or length or density of surface structures. furthermore, there appeared to be no correlation between type of surface structures and adhesion parameters. two of the three fibrillar strains of s. oralis and the peritrichously fibrillar strains of s. sanguis, together with one strain of s. milleri, were able to co-aggregate with actinomycetes.

TI  == effect of zeta potential and surface energy on bacterial adhesion to uncoated and saliva-coated human enamel and dentin.
AB  == physicochemical surface characteristics of early plaque-forming bacteria and of human tooth surfaces were measured to establish their role in bacterial adhesion  to intact dental tissue slabs. in addition, the influence of an experimental salivary pellicle was evaluated. strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, a. viscosus, and a. odontolyticus showed relatively high surface free energies (range, 99-128 mj.m-2) and carried a negative surface charge, at both physiological (mu = 0.057) and low (mu = 0.020) ionic strengths of the medium. very large differences in hydrophobicity were detected when the hexadecane adsorption test was used for measurement. powdered enamel and dentin were also negatively charged at low ionic strength but were slightly positively charged in  the physiological buffer. the surface free energy of enamel and dentin increased  upon saliva coating, whereas the surface charge was always negative. the adhesion experiments showed: (1) large differences in the binding of various bacteria to the same surface; (2) an up to 20-fold difference in the binding of the same bacterium to different surfaces, although the binding of some strains was relatively independent of the type of surface or presence of a salivary pellicle; (3) a significant decrease in adhesion when the ionic strength of the medium was  lowered, due to increased electrostatic repulsion (however, the adhesion of some  bacteria was independent of the ionic strength of the medium); (4) different time-dependent adherence kinetics, depending on both the bacteria and nature of the solid surface; and (5) a propensity for plaque streptococci to bind to uncoated dentin.

TI  == specific and nonspecific inhibition of adhesion of oral actinomyces and streptococci to erythrocytes and polystyrene by caseinoglycopeptide derivatives.
AB  == various caseinoglycopeptide derivatives prepared from mammalian milk were evaluated as inhibitors of hemagglutinations mediated by actinomyces viscosus ny1, streptococcus sanguis omz9, and, for comparative purposes, plant lectins from arachis hypogaea and bauhinia purpurea. it was found that recognition of the beta-d-galactose-(1----3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactose carbohydrate chain by actinomyces viscosus ny1 organisms and arachis hypogaea and b. purpurea agglutinins had similar structural requirements; in all cases, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide, on which several units of the above mentioned disaccharide are clustered, behaved as the most potent hemagglutination inhibitor. by contrast, none of the preparations tested inhibited erythrocyte agglutination by s. sanguis omz9. thus, the desialylated bovine caseinoglycomacropeptide acts as a potent and specific inhibitor of oral actinomyces adhesion to cell membranes (a soft surface) and could be used as a probe for the study of recognition mechanisms mediated by actinomyces galactose-binding lectins. during the present study, both native and desialylated variants of the same bovine glycomacropeptide also totally prevented the adhesion of actinomyces viscosus ny1, s. sanguis omz9, and s. mutans omz176 to polystyrene surfaces. comparative evaluations of various structurally different compounds gave the following results. neither mono- nor disaccharides related to caseinoglycopeptide carbohydrates prevented adhesion; highly positively or negatively charged polypeptides and polysaccharides were either not or only moderately active. besides these glycomacropeptides, an inhibitory activity was also exhibited by other mucin-type glycoproteins carrying short o-linked carbohydrate chains (including bovine submaxillary mucin), polyethylene glycol, and bovine serum albumin. consequently, caseinoglycopeptide prevention of oral bacterial adhesion to polystyrene tubes (a hard surface) takes place with no species specificity and can be compared to nonspecific inhibition exhibited by various polymers with very different structural characteristics.

TI  == the comparative cytotoxicity of periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the direct cytotoxicity of sonic extracts (se) from nine periodontal bacteria for human gingival fibroblasts (hgf) was compared. equivalent dosages (in terms of protein concentration) of se were used to challenge hgf cultures. the cytotoxic potential of each se was assessed by its ability to (1) inhibit hgf proliferation, as measured by direct cell counts; (2) inhibit 3h-thymidine incorporation in hgf cultures; or (3) cause morphological alterations of the cells in challenged cultures. the highest concentration (500 micrograms se protein/ml) of any of the ses used to challenge the cells was found to be markedly inhibitory to the hgfs by all three of the criteria of cytotoxicity. at  the lowest dosage tested (50 micrograms se protein/ml); only se from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides gingivalis, and fusobacterium nucleatum caused a significant effect (greater than 90% inhibition or overt morphological abnormalities) in the hgfs as determined by any of the criteria employed. se from capnocytophaga sputigena, eikenella corrodens, or wolinella recta also inhibited cell proliferation and thymidine incorporation at this dosage; however, the degree of inhibition (5-50%) was consistently, clearly less  than that of the first group of three organisms named above. the se of the three  other organisms tested (actinomyces odontolyticus, bacteroides intermedius, and streptococcus sanguis) had little or no effect (0-10% inhibition) at this concentration. the data suggest that the outcome of the interaction between bacterial components and normal resident cells of the periodontium is, at least in part, a function of the bacterial species.

TI  == mutants of actinomyces viscosus t14v lacking type 1, type 2, or both types of fimbriae.
AB  == mutants of actinomyces viscosus t14v lacking type 1 or type 2 fimbriae or both were selected by their failure to react with rabbit antibodies against either or  both fimbrial antigens. immunospecific double labeling with iron dextran and ferritin-conjugated antibodies showed two types of fimbriae on individual cells of the parent organism, a single type on mutant strains with type 1+2- and type 1-2+ fimbriae and no labeled or unlabeled fimbriae on a type 1-2- fimbria-deficient strain. the mutational loss of one fimbrial antigen did not appear to affect expression of the other, since bacteria with one or two types of fimbriae bound similar amounts of a monoclonal antibody directed against the fimbrial antigen present on both bacterial phenotypes. the strong adsorption of strains with type 1+2+ or 1+2- fimbriae to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite and weak adsorption of those with type 1-2+ or no fimbriae was consistent with the known involvement of type 1 fimbriae in this attachment process. similarly, the a. viscosus lectin was clearly associated with the expression of type 2 fimbriae, since only the strains with type 1+2+ or 1-2+ fimbriae participated in lactose-sensitive coaggregations with streptococcus sanguis 34. further studies using the fimbria-deficient mutant strains showed that aggregation of a. viscosus t14v in the presence of sialidase-treated human saliva involved both types of fimbriae, whereas neither type was required for the lactose-resistant coaggregation of the organism with certain streptococcal strains.

(cluster x) or the combination of s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, v. parvula and s. intermedius (cluster ii) were made up of sites which exhibited less active disease and responded more  favorably to therapy. sites in other clusters exhibited moderate levels of prior  destructive disease and disease activity status closer to the mean values for all 250 sites.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == coaggregation properties of human oral veillonella spp.: relationship to colonization site and oral ecology.
AB  == the primary habitats of oral veillonellae are the tongue, dental plaque, and the  buccal mucosa. isolates were obtained from each habitat and tested for coaggregation with a battery of other oral bacterial strains. all 59 tongue isolates tested for coaggregation were veillonella atypica or veillonella dispar. all but one of them coaggregated with strains of streptococcus salivarius, a predominant inhabitant of the tongue surface but not subgingival dental plaque. these tongue isolates were unable to coaggregate with most normal members of the  subgingival flora such as actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces israelii, and streptococcus sanguis. in contrast, 24 of 29 veillonella isolates, of which 20 were veillonella parvula from subgingival dental plaque samples, coaggregated strongly with the three species of actinomyces, s. sanguis, and other bacteria usually present in subgingival plaque, but they did not coaggregate with s. salivarius. the majority of isolates from the buccal mucosa (42 of 55) has coaggregation properties like those from the tongue. these results indicate that the three human oral veillonella species  are distributed on oral surfaces that are also occupied by their coaggregation partners and thus provide strong evidence that coaggregation plays a critical role in the bacterial ecology of the oral cavity.

TI  == a polysaccharide from streptococcus sanguis 34 that inhibits coaggregation of s.  sanguis 34 with actinomyces viscosus t14v.
AB  == coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34 depends on interaction of a lectin on a. viscosus t14v with a cell surface carbohydrate on s. sanguis 34. this carbohydrate was isolated, and its chemical makeup was established. the carbohydrate remained attached to s. sanguis 34 cells through extraction with triton x-100 and treatment with pronase. it was cleaved from the cell residue by autoclaving and purified by differential centrifugation  and column chromatography on deae-sephacel and sephadex g-75. the polysaccharide  contained phosphate which was neither inorganic nor monoester. treatment with naoh-nabh4, followed by escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase, or with 48% hf at  4 degrees c, followed by nabh4, yielded inorganic phosphate and oligosaccharide alditols. therefore, the polysaccharide is composed of oligosaccharide units joined together by phosphodiester bridges. the structure and stereochemistry of the main oligosaccharide alditol was established previously (f. c. mcintire, c. a. bush, s.-s. wu, s.-c. li, y.-t. li, m. mcneil, s. tjoa, and p. v. fennessey, carbohydr. res. 166:133-143). permethylation analysis, 1h and 31p nuclear magnetic resonance studies on the whole polysaccharide revealed the position of the phosphodiester linkages. the polysaccharide is mainly a polymer of (6) galnac(alpha 1-3)rha(beta 1-4)glc(beta 1-6)galf(beta 1-6)galnac(beta 1- 3)gal(alpha 1)-opo3. it reacted as a single antigen with antiserum to s. sanguis  34 cells and was a potent inhibitor of coaggregation between a. viscosus t14v and s. sanguis 34. quantitative inhibition of precipitation assays with oligosaccharides, o-allyl n-acetylgalactosaminides, and simple sugars indicated that specific antibodies were directed to the galnac end of the hexasaccharide unit. in contrast, coaggregation was inhibited much more effectively by saccharides containing betagalnac. thus, the specificity of the a. viscosus t14v  lectin is strikingly different from that of antibodies directed against the s. sanguis 34 polysaccharide.

TI  == intergeneric rosettes: sequestered surface recognition among human periodontal bacteria.
AB  == the human oral bacteria, streptococcus sanguis and bacteroides loescheii, when mixed in equal numbers in vitro, formed large settling coaggregates. as the relative number of each cell type was changed, coaggregates became smaller until  at cell-type ratios of 10 to 1, rosettes formed. rosettes consisting of a streptococcal cell in the center surrounded by bacteroides cells exhibited surface recognition properties of only the bacteroides, which coaggregated with many other cell types such as actinomyces naeslundii, and formed large settling multigeneric aggregates. the ecological significance of these results derives from the following: (i) the direct demonstration that intergeneric coaggregates can protect the central cell from or prevent its access to other cells in the environment, and (ii) the potential for these effects to occur during bacterial succession of various cell types observed in progressively more severe stages of  human periodontal disease.

TI  == the effect of desalivation on coronal and root surface caries in rats.
AB  == although the presence of coronal caries is declining in much of the western hemisphere, the prevalence of root surface caries is likely to increase as teeth  are retained longer than heretofore. at the same time, an increasing number of the population suffer from dry mouth as a result of taking prescription drugs, with an apparent concomitant increased susceptibility to root surface caries. this study attempted to develop an animal model which would aid in the exploration of the effects of desalivation and the development of root surface caries. animals were desalivated, infected with actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans (sobrinus) 6715, and fed a cariogenic diet. coronal caries developed rapidly in the animals; sufficient disease was present after two weeks  to permit evaluation of potential therapeutic agents. alveolar bone loss and root surface lesions developed in three to four weeks. s. mutans (sobrinus) and a. viscosus established readily in all animals; however, as the investigation progressed, populations of the latter declined, possibly because of the highly acidogenic environment. this model will facilitate investigation of the influence of hyposalivation and help in the exploration of agents to alleviate the adverse  effects of salivary gland dysfunction.

TI  == the synergistic effect of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the synergistic interaction of cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime against 187 clinically significant anaerobic organisms was investigated. fusobacterium nucleatum, actinomyces odontolyticus, propionibacteria, lactobacilli, peptostreptococci, streptococcus intermedius and veillonella were sensitive to cefotaxime. both eubacterium lentum and streptococcus morbillorum were resistant. the susceptibility of the clostridia varied from 0.125 to greater than 256 mg/l;  only 20% of species demonstrated synergy between cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of cefotaxime against members of the genus bacteroides ranged from 0.0625 to greater than 256 mg/l. the mic50 of cefotaxime to bacteroides fragilis and b. vulgatus was lowered from 6 and 4 mg/l, respectively, to 2 and 1 mg/l, respectively, when 4 mg/l desacetylcefotaxime was added to the medium. full or partial synergy was demonstrated by 50.7% of the bacteroides species tested. while cefotaxime and desacetylcefotaxime act synergistically against many members of the genus bacteroides, the mic of at least 10% of strains is not affected by this combination.

TI  == use of lytic bacteriophage for actinomyces viscosus t14v as a probe for cell surface components mediating intergeneric coaggregation.
AB  == a lytic bacteriophage for actinomyces viscosus t14v (the reference strain for actinomyces coaggregation group a) was isolated from raw sewage. this phage, designated bf307, also lysed the t14v-derived nonfimbriated mutant pk455-2 as well as a. viscosus mg-1 and t14av but not the other serotype 2 or serotype 1 strains of this species that were tested or any of nine actinomyces naeslundii isolates. phages bf307 belonged to bradley morphological group c and was similar  in appearance to the a. viscosus mg-1 phages av-1 and av-3, which do not productively infect a. viscosus t14v. a. viscosus mg-1 mutants selected for resistance to phage bf307, av-3, or ct7 (a human dental plaque isolate with the same host range as bf307) were coresistant to the other two phages but sensitive  to av-1. these results indicate that the receptors on a. viscosus mg-1 for phages bf307, av-3, and ct7 are identical or share a common precursor and that the receptor for phage av-1 is distinct. comparison of the genomes of bf307, av-3, and ct7 revealed that their dnas were similar in size but distinguishable by restriction analysis. two altered coaggregation phenotypes were identified among  the phage bf307-resistant mutants of strains mg-1, t14v, t14av, and pk455-2. class i mutants had lost the ability to interact with coaggregation group 1 streptococci, and class ii mutants did not coaggregate with either group 1 or group 2 streptococci. these results are consistent with the proposal that the phage bf307 receptor on these a. viscosus strains is related to one of the structures that mediates coaggregation with oral streptococci. a model to delineate the various coaggregation mediators on the surface of actinomyces coaggregation group a cells is presented, and the use of these phages to probe surface components of human oral actinomyces strains is discussed.

AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == microbial caries induction in the roots of human teeth in vitro.
AB  == streptococcus mutans gs5, lactobacillus casei dsm20011 and actinomyces viscosus t14 produce artificial caries in the roots of extracted teeth. roots were coated  with wax leaving an 8 mm2 window exposed on the buccal surfaces, and then incubated for 8 days in the presence of the test organism, the synthetic medium being changed each day. samples were then examined by sem, or microradiographs were obtained from 120 microns sections. the ph at the root surface at the end of the induction averaged 4.43, 5.00 and 5.20, and the lesion depths measured on the microradiographs averaged 121, 83 and 34 microns, for strep. mutans, l. casei and a. viscosus respectively. this relationship between ph and lesion depth confirms  earlier findings. as all of these organisms can produce lesions in tooth structure, elimination of one type would probably not eliminate caries.

AB  == bacteroides loescheii pk1295 fimbriae, which mediate the lactose-sensitive coaggregation with streptococcus sanguis 34 and the lactose-insensitive coaggregation with actinomyces israelii pk14, were injected into mice to raise adhesin-specific monoclonal antibodies (mabs). supernatants of hybridomas were screened for the capacity to inhibit coaggregation and agglutinate intact bacteria. of the 10 mabs that were isolated, 4 were specific and potent inhibitors of the coaggregation between b. loescheii and s. sanguis and two other mabs specifically inhibited the b. loescheii-a. israelii interaction. none of the six mabs which inhibited adherence were capable of agglutinating whole cells of b. loescheii, whereas the four remaining mabs agglutinated whole cells but had no effect on coaggregation. fab fragments of two mabs, one that inhibited the coaggregation with s. sanguis and another that inhibited the interaction with a.  israelii, also were shown to inhibit the respective coaggregation interactions, suggesting that each of the immunoglobulins recognized its adhesin molecule at or near the active sites. by immunoblotting or immunoprecipitation, the s. sanguis adhesin-specific mabs reacted with a 75-kilodalton polypeptide present in fimbria-enriched preparations, whereas the a. israelii adhesin-specific mabs recognized a 45-kilodalton polypeptide in the same preparations. by screening hybridoma supernatants directly for their capacity to block coaggregation, we isolated mabs which were used to establish that the b. loescheii-s. sanguis and the b. loescheii-a. israelii interactions were mediated by different adhesins.

TI  == attachment of oral bacteria to a basement-membrane-like matrix and to purified matrix proteins.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to investigate the adherence of oral bacteria to an in vitro basement-membrane-like matrix and to selected individual macromolecular  constituents of this matrix. radiolabeled bacteria were incubated with basement-membrane-like matrices isolated from pf hr-9 cells. bacteroides gingivalis 33277, fusobacterium nucleatum fn-2, and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans ga3(a) bound to the matrix in the range of 44 to 70%, considerably higher than the ranges of a. actinomycetemcomitans ga3(na) and suny  ab67 (range, 20 to 25%). the attachment of selected strains of gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus and actinomyces spp. was much less frequent (range, 6 to 25%). competitive inhibition studies demonstrated that preincubating the bacteria with fibronectin significantly decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 51% but increased the binding of other gram-negative and gram-positive organisms tested. similarly, preincubating the matrices with antifibronectin antibodies decreased the binding of b. gingivalis by 31%, whereas the other bacteria tested were either unaffected or binding was increased. the adherence of bacteria to purified basement membrane proteins was also investigated. strain and species differences were seen in binding, but no clear relationship emerged between binding to an intact matrix and binding to isolated  matrix proteins. the results of this study suggest that some gram-negative oral bacteria commonly associated with periodontal disease, such as b. gingivalis, a.  actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum, bound in high numbers to basement-membrane-like matrices in vitro. on the other hand, the gram-positive strains tested bound in much fewer numbers. the results suggest that further studies with this in vitro model may aid in understanding the mechanisms by which oral bacteria adhere to basement membranes.

TI  == intergeneric bacterial coaggregations involving mutans streptococci and oral actinomyces.
AB  == mutans streptococci (ms) representing eight different serotypes were tested for their ability to coaggregate in vitro with oral actinomyces and other streptococcal species. of the mutans streptococci tested, only strains of s. cricetus (formerly s. mutans serotype a) displayed pronounced coaggregations and  only with certain strains of actinomyces. s. cricetus coaggregated, by lactose nonreversible mechanisms, with serotype 4 actinomyces naeslundii wvu963 and wvu924 and with serotype 2 actinomyces odontolyticus wvu758. the first pair was disaggregated by protein denaturants (e.g., sodium dodecyl sulfate and urea) and  edta. this coaggregation was inhibited when the streptococcal, but not the actinomyces, partner was pretreated with either heat or protease, suggesting the  presence of a protein mediator on only the streptococcal cell surface. the s. cricetus-a. odontolyticus coaggregation appeared to involve protein components on each cell, as shown by the lack of coaggregation after pretreatment of either cell type with heat or proteases. this coaggregation was also reversed by sodium  dodecyl sulfate and urea, as well as by sodium deoxycholate, but not by edta. the data indicate that different mechanisms may be involved in each of these coaggregations.

TI  == microbial aspects of preventive regimes in patients with overdentures.
AB  == the aim of this study was to test effects of preventive regimes using fluoride and chlorhexidine to prevent caries and periodontal diseases in 34 patients with  overdentures. the patients, who were treated with immediate overdentures, were distributed at random into three experimental groups. in these groups, different  gels--a placebo, a fluoride, and a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel--were tested by daily application. supragingival plaque samples from selected surfaces of two abutment teeth were taken at one week, and at one, three, and six months after initial insertion of the overdenture. the placebo and fluoride gel influenced neither total cfu nor s. sanguis and a. viscosus/naeslundii counts. in the placebo group, but not in the fluoride group, s. mutans levels increased significantly, indicating the caries risk involved in overdentures. the use of chlorhexidine-fluoride gel resulted in a long-term suppression of total cfu. further, s. mutans was found to be selectively suppressed to below detection level. a. viscosus/naeslundii was initially strongly suppressed, but after three  months a partial return of the population was noticed. s. sanguis was relatively  insensitive to the chlorhexidine-fluoride gel. it is concluded that a daily application of a chlorhexidine-fluoride gel is effective against plaque formation and s. mutans on abutment teeth in overdentures.

TI  == relationship between dental plaque indices and bacteria in dental plaque and those in saliva.
AB  == a variety of indices has been developed for the quantitation of dental plaque. the aim of this study was to determine the correlation between the loe plaque index and the number of bacteria on the same tooth. furthermore, the effect of plaque accumulation on the salivary counts of some dental plaque organisms was estimated. twenty volunteers were asked to abstain from all oral hygiene for a one-week period. clinical indices and bacteriological samples were taken at the start and at the end of the experimental period. after an interval of seven days, the experiment was repeated. the relationship between the loe plaque index and the total bacterial counts on the same area of the tooth was found to be highly significant. after seven days without oral hygiene, the total counts and the actinomyces viscosus/naeslundii and streptococcus sanguis counts in dental plaque had increased by approximately two log units, while the streptococcus mutans counts had increased by more than one log unit. the large increase in the number  of bacteria on the teeth was reflected in the salivary counts of the actinomyces  species, but not in the s. sanguis or s. mutans counts. this was due to differences in ecological habitats of these species in the mouth. highly significant correlations were found between the s. mutans level in dental plaque  and the salivary level, and between the s. mutans counts of the subjects in the first and second trials of the experiment.

TI  == molecular basis of bacterial adhesion in the oral cavity.
AB  == the two varieties of fimbriae identified on oral strains of actinomyces have distinct functional properties. the type 1 fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus t14v  mediate attachment to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite. type 2 fimbriae--on a. viscosus and the only fimbriae detected on a. naeslundii wvu45--are associated with lectin activity. interaction of these fimbriae with complementary receptors  initiates bacterial attachment to streptococcus sanguis 34 and sialidase-treated  epithelial cells and the killing of actinomyces by polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns). galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac), and related oligosaccharides inhibit these processes, and mutants lacking type 2 fimbriae do not participate in them. the actinomyces lectin is similar to lectins from ricinus communis and bauhinia purpurea that agglutinate certain strains of oral streptococci, block attachment of actinomyces to epithelial cells, and inhibit killing of actinomyces by pmns. the s. sanguis receptor for the actinomyces lectin comprises repeating hexasaccharide units with galnac termini. used as probes, the peanut agglutinin,  with specificity for gal(beta-3)galnac, and the lectin from b. purpurea detect a  160-kilodalton (kdal) band in sds-page-separated epithelial cell extracts and a 100-kdal band in pmn extracts. these may be receptors for type 2 fimbriae. a. viscosus genes encoding subunits of types 1 and 2 fimbriae have been cloned in escherichia coli; the type 1 subunit is 65 kdal and the type 2 subunit is 59 kdal. submandibular immunization of mice with a mixture of type 1 and type 2 fimbriae evokes the production of iga and igg antibodies in serum and saliva that inhibit in vitro adsorption of a. viscosus to sha. these antibodies may modulate  colonization of teeth by this organism.

AB  == local irritation of gingival tissue by plaque is among the factors which affect development of gingival overgrowth in patients undergoing chronic phenytoin (pht) therapy. variability in the cytotoxicity of plaque components or of plaque substances plus pht and/or its metabolites toward gingival fibroblasts may relate to whether gingival overgrowth forms in a particular patient. fibroblasts from healthy and overgrown gingivae were incubated with (a) pht and its major human metabolite, 5-(p-hydroxyphenyl)-5-phenylhydantoin (hpph), (b) microbial and "amplified" plaque extracts, and (c) microbial and "amplified" plaque extracts plus pht and hpph. cell numbers and cell-associated protein were determined for each incubation preparation. a wide range in cytotoxic response to a particular microbial or plaque extract occurred among cell strains. plaque extracts from different subjects had variable cytotoxicity toward a cell strain. the differences among fibroblast strains in response to an extract and the variability in cytotoxicity of different plaque extracts toward a cell strain were not related to their source from normal or overgrown gingivae. cell numbers  and cell-associated protein were similar for incubation mixtures containing extracts with and without pht and hpph. these data do not show differences among  cytotoxicity levels of plaque extracts, the response of particular gingival fibroblast strains to plaque components, or interaction between drugs and certain plaque samples which explain development of gingival overgrowth in some subjects  receiving chronic pht therapy.

AB  == a mixed-culture chemostat system, composed of nine bacterial species representative of plaque in health and disease, has been assessed as an improved  laboratory method of evaluating the likely in vivo effects of antimicrobial agents used in dentistry. the advantages of the system include reproducibility, the long-term stable cultivation of bacteria under controllable conditions, and repeated sampling, for bacteriological and biochemical studies, without disrupting the stability of the community. the effects of (i) the continuous provision of chlorhexidine (chx) and (ii) three pulses of chx (final concentration in both experiments = 0.24 mmol/l) on the composition of the chemostat communities were monitored. only l. casei survived the continuous provision of chx; the other bacteria were killed and were lost at different rates which generally corresponded to their known sensitivities to chx. after each chx  pulse, the numbers of bacteria fell markedly. again, l. casei was least affected, while a. viscosus, b. intermedius, and f. nucleatum were temporarily undetectable but returned to their original levels within 2-4 generation times. counts of s. mutans were affected more by chx than those of s. sanguis or s. mitior. the effect of successive pulses of chx on the viability of some bacteria and on acid  production (as measured by ph-fall experiments) decreased, suggesting that adaptation to chx had occurred. the fact that the in vitro observations paralleled previous clinical findings suggests that the mixed-culture system could be used as a predictive model of the probable effect on the oral flora of new anti-microbial agents prior to expensive trials in animals or human volunteers.

AB  == mutants of streptococcus sanguis resistant to novobiocin (novr-mutants) were isolated after mutagenesis of strain challis with ethyl methanesulphonate. the resistance phenotype was transferred by dna-mediated transformation back into the parent strain at high frequency suggesting resistance was due to mutation(s) in a single gene or in closely-linked genes. cells of novr-mutants had normal morphology and secreted similar proteins to the wild-type strain. however, mutant cultures had slower growth rates, the mutant cells had reduced hydrophobicity, and they showed a reduced degree of coaggregation with actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. cell envelopes prepared from novr-mutants differed from wild-type cell envelopes in that they (a) were impaired in ability to coaggregate with a. viscosus cells, and (b) had altered protein composition as detected by sds-page. the results suggest that hydrophobic proteins in the cell envelope of s. sanguis may be necessary for coaggregation of this bacterium with actinomycetes.

AB  == we assayed chlorhexidine and a series of its analogues, in which the chlorophenyl terminal substituents were replaced with alkyl chains, for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative and gram-positive oral bacteria. changes in antimicrobial activity were correlated with changes in agent structure for identification of structural criteria which may be important in the optimization of agent activity. chlorhexidine showed substantial antimicrobial activity against the gram-negative as well as the gram-positive oral bacteria. the alkyl agents were comparable with chlorhexidine in their activity against bacteroides gingivalis and bacteroides intermedius, black-pigmented gram-negative obligate anaerobes associated with periodontal disease in adults. alkyl agents alexidine, heptihexidine (1,6-bis-n-heptylbiguanidohexane), hexoctidine (1,8-bis-n-hexylbiguanidoctane), and hexhexidine (1,6-bis-n-hexylbiguanidohexane), as well as chlorhexidine, were active against actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a gram-negative organism associated with localized juvenile periodontitis. hexidecidine (1,10-bis-n-hexylbiguanidodecane)  and heptoctidine (1,8-bis-n-heptylbiguanidooctane) were more active, and hexhexidine was as active as chlorhexidine against fusobacterium nucleatum, also  associated with periodontal disease. seven of the agents were more active than chlorhexidine against actinomyces species. all test agents were active against streptococcus mutans, a gram-positive coccus associated with dental caries. hexidecidine had activity equal to that of chlorhexidine when evaluated against the entire battery of organisms. analysis of structure-activity relationships revealed that alkyl chains could replace chlorophenyl groups with retention or improvement of antimicrobial activity.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the interactions between capnocytophaga ochracea atcc 33596 and streptococcus sanguis h1, actinomyces naeslundii pk984, or actinomyces israelii pk16 are dependent on specific recognitions between heat-sensitive adhesins on c. ochracea and heat-stable structures (probably carbohydrate-containing receptors) on the surfaces of these gram-positive coaggregation partners. the coaggregation of c. ochracea with each of these three organisms was inhibited by l-rhamnose and d-fucose and to a lesser extent by beta-methyl-galactoside. the reaction with s.  sanguis was the most sensitive, while the coaggregation with a. israelii was the  least sensitive and was only partially inhibited by each of the sugars that were  considered to be effective inhibitors. a more effective inhibition of the coaggregation between c. ochracea and a. israelii was achieved by adding a combination of the 6-deoxysugars and n-acetylneuraminic acid. to further characterize the coaggregations, naturally occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of c. ochracea were obtained from several different selections. three phenotypically distinct groups of mutants were were isolated. type 1 mutants failed to coaggregate with s. sanguis only. type 2 mutants lost ability to interact with both s. sanguis and a. naeslundii. type 3 mutants failed to coaggregate with all three coaggregation partners. characterization of the cog- mutants by sugar inhibition studies made it possible to distinguish three classes of adhesin activity.

AB  == positive cultures were obtained from 60 equine orthopedic cases during a 12 year  period (1974-1985). these cases consisted of 34 long or cuboidal bone fractures,  13 arthrotomy/arthroscopy procedures for removal or internal fixation of a fracture, 7 proximal splint bone fractures, and 6 facial or mandibular fractures. excluding the 13 arthrotomies, only 10 (21%) of the 47 were open fractures. multiple organisms were isolated from 36 cases (20 long or cuboidal bone fractures, 7 splint bone fractures, 5 mandibular fractures, and 4 intra-articular fractures). of the 142 isolates, 35 (24%) were members of the family enterobacteriaceae, 33 (23%) streptococcus spp., and 25 (18%) staphylococcus spp. with the majority being coagulase positive (65%). other organisms isolated were pseudomonas spp. (16, 11%), obligate anaerobes (11, 7%), and actinobacillus spp.  (7, 5%). the remaining 10% consisted of pasteurella spp., bacillus spp., corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp., and actinomyces spp. when comparing results between two time periods (1974-1979 and 1980-1985) there was an increase  in the percentage of coagulase positive staphylococci isolates resistant to all antimicrobics tested except oxacillin and amikacin, and escherichia coli isolates were resistant to all but amikacin. for pseudomonas spp., resistance to gentamicin increased in the second time period (1980-1986). during the initial time period (1974-1979) culture tests for obligate anerobes were not conducted until 1975. no anerobes were cultured during those initial 5 years; however, one  third of those isolated after 1980 were resistant to penicillin and ampicillin.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the incidence of streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli and actinomyces was examined  in root surface dental plaque from 24 subjects with root surface caries and in 24 subjects with exposed root surfaces as a consequence of periodontitis but without root surface caries. plaque was collected from the most posterior teeth in each quadrant: in the caries group from carious lesions and in the periodontitis group from buccal root surfaces. there were significantly higher proportions of s. mutans and lactobacilli in dental plaque samples taken from subjects suffering from root surface caries than in samples from subjects without root surface caries. the level of the group a. viscosus/naeslundii in the periodontitis group  was higher than that found in the root surface caries group, but the difference was not statistically significant.

TI  == metabolism of glycosylsucrose by oral microorganisms and its hydrolysis by streptococcus salivarius fructosyltransferase.
AB  == resting-cell suspensions of oral microorganisms grown in sucrose were studied for the production of acid from glucosylsucrose and maltosylsucrose. most oral microorganisms fermented these sugars to only a limited extent. streptococcus salivarius, however, metabolized glucosylsucrose as well as sucrose. we therefore looked for a specific enzyme in s. salivarius which was capable of hydrolyzing glucosylsucrose. fructosyltransferase and invertase were purified from s. salivarius 13419, and the substrate specificities and hydrolytic activities of these enzymes were determined. purified fructosyltransferase catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose, whereas purified invertase barely hydrolyzed these sugars. these results suggest that the high fermentative  efficiency of glycosylsucrose by s. salivarius is due to the hydrolysis of these  sugars by fructosyltransferase, but not by invertase. the partially purified fructosyltransferases of actinomyces viscosus ny1 and streptococcus mutans ncib 11723 catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose. the fructosyltransferases of these oral microorganisms are also responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosylsucrose.

TI  == a bacteriocin of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  == an inhibitory factor from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 was isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin (actinobacillicin). the bacteriocin was active against streptococcus sanguis strains, streptococcus uberis (fdc1), and actinomyces viscosus t14 as well as other strains of a. actinomycetemcomitans, but not against other crevicular bacteria, including other streptococci and actinomycetes. the activity of this bacteriocin was inhibited by pronase, trypsin, and heat (45 min at 56 degrees c) but not by dnase, rnase, phospholipase, exposure to uv light, or low ph (1.0 to 6.5). although actinobacillicin markedly inhibited glycolysis in s. sanguis, the primary mechanism of its bactericidal action appears to be alterations in cell permeability, with the resultant leakage of rna, dna, and other essential intracellular macromolecules. these findings provide an ecologic explanation for  the reciprocal growth relationship between a. actinomycetemcomitans and s. sanguis/actinomyces viscosus observed in localized juvenile periodontitis.

TI  == in vitro caries-like lesion production by streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus using sucrose and starch.
AB  == we investigated the formation of caries-like lesions on root and enamel sections  by s. mutans and a. viscosus when grown in four different carbohydrate substrates. the substrates were: sucrose, starch + alpha-amylase, and a combination of starch and sucrose with and without alpha-amylase. twenty-four sections with exposed windows on both the root and enamel surfaces were exposed to the individual bacterial species in each of the four substrates for three weeks. at three weeks, the sections were removed and lesion depths measured. when grown in sucrose alone, s. mutans produced significantly deeper lesions in both root and enamel surfaces when compared with a. viscosus. however, s. mutans failed to produce lesions when grown in "limited" sucrose with starch added, whereas a. viscosus in this same substrate produced lesions in the enamel and root surfaces. a viscosus also produced either similar or significantly deeper lesions in both root and enamel surfaces, when compared with s. mutans grown in the two substrates with amylase. thus, under these in vitro conditions, it was demonstrated that a. viscosus could utilize starch, whereas utilization of starch by s. mutans was alpha-amylase-dependent.

TI  == a bacteriological study of rampant caries in children.
AB  == we undertook a microbiological study, in children, of dental plaque from sound surfaces or associated with rampant caries, both black-colored and unstained. improved selective media allowed for the enumeration of bacteria belonging to specific genera or species present in plaque samples. a nearly similar bacterial  distribution was found in both types of rampant caries. aciduric flora, streptococcus mutans, veillonella, and lactobacillus predominated in plaque over  the lesions, whereas extracellular polysaccharide-producing streptococci other than s. mutans, as well as actinomyces, were more abundant in plaque from sound surfaces. however, more lactobacilli and actinomyces were recovered from pigmented lesions than from the unstained ones. these findings suggest that the microbial flora associated with black-pigmented lesions did not strongly differ from that observed over unstained caries lesions.

TI  == interbacterial adhesion between pseudomonas aeruginosa and indigenous oral bacteria isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == interbacterial adhesion between strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa and strains of  indigenous oral bacteria, both of which were isolated from the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, was investigated by the phenomenon of the coaggregation reaction. a total of 22 strains of p. aeruginosa were isolated from the oral cavity of 17 patients and examined for their abilities to coaggregate with 5 strains each of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii. coaggregation reactions were common between these oral bacteria and both the mucoid and nonmucoid variants of p. aeruginosa. all strains of p. aeruginosa were also able to agglutinate neuraminidase-treated or untreated human erythrocytes of blood types a, b, and o. positive coaggregation reactions were further characterized by determining the effects of several sugars, and of heat and protease treatments of the bacteria. none of the coaggregtion reactions were inhibited by 0.05 m lactose, galactose, glucose, fucose, or mannose. all coaggregation reactions were dependent upon heat- and protease-sensitive components of the pseudomonas. thus, the interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa and the oral bacteria studied appears to involve  adhesins on the pseudomonas cell, which bind to complementary receptors, on the cell surfaces of oral bacteria. the apparent prevalence and diversity of interbacterial adhesions between p. aeruginosa strains originating from the oral  cavity of cystic fibrosis patients and strains of the indigenous oral bacteria suggest that some of these reactions may affect the extent to which p. aeruginosa colonizes in the oral cavity of cystic fibrosis patients, and thereby, influence  susceptibility of the host to infection.

TI  == multigeneric aggregations among oral bacteria: a network of independent cell-to-cell interactions.
AB  == a radioactivity-based assay was developed to define the participation of radioactively labeled cell types within the milieu of unlabeled partners in multigeneric aggregates. the cell types in these multigeneric aggregations consisted of various combinations of 21 strains representing five genera of human oral bacteria. the coaggregation properties of each cell type, when paired individually with various strains, were delineated and were unchanged when the microbes took part in the more complex multigeneric aggregations. competition between homologous labeled and unlabeled cells for binding to a partner cell type was achieved only when the homologous cells were mixed together before the addition of their partner cells. attempts to displace a labeled cell type from an aggregate by subsequent addition of a large excess of the same unlabeled cell type were unsuccessful, which suggested that the forces that bound different cell types together were very strong and the cell-to-cell interactions were stable. however, a cell type that exhibited only lactose-reversible coaggregations with partners was easily and selectively released by the addition of lactose to multigeneric aggregates otherwise consisting solely of lactose-nonreversible cell-to-cell interactions. this not only indicates the independent nature of individual coaggregations but also suggests the involvement of lectinlike adhesins in these sugar-inhibitable coaggregations. although the molecular mechanisms responsible for multigeneric aggregations are unknown, the principle of a common partner cell type serving as a bridge between two otherwise noncoaggregating cell types was firmly established by the observation of sequential addition of one cell type to another. thus, competition, bridging, coaggregate stability, independent nature of interactions, and partner specificity are the key principles of adherence that form the framework for continued studies of multigeneric aggregates. while the human oral cavity is a prime example of a complex microbial community, collectively the community appears to consist of simple and testable individual interactions.

TI  == arylaminopeptidase activities of oral bacteria.
AB  == protease and peptidase enzymes are thought to play a role in the virulence of many oral organisms, especially those associated with periodontal diseases. in order to evaluate the peptidases of periodontopathogens, we compared the arylaminopeptidase activities of bacteroides gingivalis with those of other oral  and non-oral bacteria. sixty-three bacterial strains representing the prominent cultivable organisms in human periodontal pockets were tested, including representatives of the black-pigmented bacteroides, actinobacillus, actinomyces,  campylobacter, capnocytophaga, eikenella, fusobacterium, haemophilus, lactobacillus, streptococcus, and veillonella species. each micro-organism was examined for its ability to hydrolyze 18 synthetic substrates of beta-naphthylamide derivatives of amino acids, dipeptides, and tripeptides. quantitation of the enzyme activity was accomplished by colorimetric measurement  of the amounts of released beta-naphthylamines. n-cbz-glycyl-glycyl-l-arginine-beta-naphthylamide was readily cleaved by b. gingivalis, but slightly or not at all by the other oral strains tested. l-arginine-beta-naphthylamide was cleaved by b. gingivalis, capnocytophaga species, and streptococcus species, but not readily by the other bacteroides strains. some dipeptide substrates tested, such as glycyl-l-arginine- and glycyl-l-proline-beta-naphthylamide, were strongly cleaved by b. gingivalis and weakly cleaved by other bacteroides strains. since high levels of n-cbz-glycyl-glycyl-l-arginyl-aminopeptidase activity are characteristic of b. gingivalis, its measurement may be valuable in the identification of this organism in clinical samples as an aid in diagnosis and monitoring of periodontal infections. furthermore, this and other aminopeptidases produced by b. gingivalis and other oral organisms may play a role in the tissue destruction seen in periodontal disease.

AB  == human parotid agglutinins from three individuals were isolated by adsorption to and desorption from strains of streptococcus mutans belonging to serotypes a, b,  c, d, and e and strains of lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis. the desorption was achieved by suspending centrifuged saliva-coated microorganisms in 10 mm phosphate buffer (ph 6.8) containing 0.154  m sodium chloride. after another centrifugation, agglutinin activity was recovered in the supernatants. the l. casei strain was not agglutinated by any of the agglutinin extracts or by saliva, but all the other strains were agglutinated to a variable extent. however, all strains, including the nonagglutinating l. casei strain, adsorbed and desorbed agglutinins active for other strains. the agglutinin extracts from s. mutans serotype c, s. sanguis, and a. viscosus were purified and characterized by electrophoretic and immunological techniques. the purified preparations were positively stained for protein and carbohydrate, and the molecular weights were estimated to be 440,000. all agglutinin extracts needed calcium in the range of 0.1 to 0.5 mm to be active, and for a single strain, all agglutinins gave the same degree of agglutination, indicating that the isolated agglutinins may be of the same molecular species, a hypothesis that  was also confirmed by the preliminary characterization of the purified agglutinins. this type of agglutinin, which seems to exert its activity among various bacterial species, could be important in mediating bacterial coaggregation and thus may add to the effect of specific agglutinins in the clearance of bacteria from the human mouth.

TI  == estimation of growth parameters for some oral bacteria grown in continuous culture under glucose-limiting conditions.
AB  == the coexistence of bacteria in natural environments can often be explained in terms of competition for a growth-limiting substrate(s), and the outcome of such  competition depends upon relevant growth parameters such as substrate affinity and yield. dental plaque bacteria are frequently carbon and energy limited. growth parameters for seven oral streptococcus species and one actinomyces viscosus strain were estimated under glucose-limited conditions in continuous culture. in all strains, mixed-acid fermentation occurred at low growth rates, while amounts of lactate increased at higher growth rates. two important growth parameters, mumax and y glucose, were very similar in the two serotype c streptococcus mutans strains (t8 and ingbritt), one of the serotype d/g streptococcus mutans strains (omz65), and the two streptococcus milleri strains (699b3 and b448). two other serotype d/g s. mutans strains (kir and b13) were divergent from this group and had lower mumax values and a lower y glucose. the maintenance energy coefficients were lower in the s. mutans serotype c strains, and the highest values were observed in the s. milleri strains. while a. viscosus had a lower mumax, its lower maintenance rate and significantly higher yield indicate that it deals much more efficiently with glucose than do the streptococci. the most striking feature of amino acid utilization was that arginine was completely consumed by s. milleri strains; similarly, a. viscosus used up all available asparagine as did one of the s. milleri strains at faster growth rates. it is suggested that the ability of strains of s. milleri and s. sanguis to utilize arginine in addition to carbohydrate as a source of energy may explain why such organisms increase in proportion in the plaque of subjects consuming diets almost devoid of fermentable carbohydrate.

TI  == gingivitis.
AB  == gingivitis is caused by substances derived from microbial plaque accumulating at  or near the gingival sulcus; all other suspected local and systemic etiologic factors either enhance plaque accumulation or retention, or enhance the susceptibility of the gingival tissue to microbial attack. microbial species specifically associated with gingival health include streptococcus sanguis 1, s.  d-7, and fusobacterium naviforme. bacteria involved in the etiology of gingivitis include specific species of streptococcus, fusobacterium, actinomyces, veillonella, and treponema and possibly bacteroides, capnocytophaga, and eikenella. microbial colonization and participation is sequential, with the complexity of the associated flora increasing with time. the pathogenesis has been separated into the initial, early, and established stages, each with characteristic features. the initial lesion is an acute inflammation which can be induced experimentally by application of extracts of plaque bacteria to normal gingiva. the early lesion is characterized by a lymphoid cell infiltrate predominated by t lymphocytes, characteristic of lesions seen at sites of cell-mediated hypersensitivity reactions. the early lesion can be induced by application of purified contact antigens to the gingival tissues of previously sensitized animals. as the clinical condition worsens, the established lesion appears, predominated by b lymphocytes and plasma cells. established lesions may  remain stable for indefinite periods of time, they may revert, or they may progress. periodontal destruction does not result from the conversion of a predominantly t cell to a predominantly b cell lesion as has been suggested, but  rather from episodes of acute inflammation. clinical manifestations of gingivitis are episodic phenomena characterized by discontinuous bursts of acute inflammation. most lesions are transient or persistent but not progressive. attachment loss may precede alveolar bone loss and may occur without the manifestations of a concurrent or a precursor gingivitis. on the other hand, the  evidence indicates that a portion of gingivitis lesions can and does progress to  periodontitis. gingivitis and the periodontal microflora differ in children and adults. clinical signs of gingivitis either do not appear as plaque accumulates,  or they are greatly delayed in children, and the inflammatory infiltrate consists mostly of t lymphocytes. the conversion to a b cell lesion does not appear to occur. the evidence supports the conclusion that gingivitis is a disease, and that control and prevention is a worthwhile goal and a health benefit.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the effect of lowering the ph on the composition and metabolism of a community of nine oral bacteria grown in a chemostat.
AB  == nine oral bacteria, associated with both healthy and diseased sites in the mouth, were grown at d = 0.05 h-1 (mean generation time 13.9 h) in a glucose-limited chemostat. after an initial period of steady-state growth at ph 7.0, ph control was discontinued. the ph then decreased until it stabilized at ph 4.1 after 9 d (16 generations), while the eh rose from -165 mv to +160 mv. the lowering in ph resulted in the composition and metabolism of the flora being altered and in increased bacterial aggregation. at ph 7.0, 'streptococcus mitior', veillonella alcalescens and s. sanguis were most numerous while at ph 4.1 the counts of all bacteria fell except for lactobacillus casei, which became predominant. the proportions of s. mutans within the community also increased while s. sanguis was recovered only occasionally and bacteroides intermedius was not detected below ph 4.6. the survival at ph 4.1 of several other species would not have been predicted from earlier pure culture studies. relative to ph 7.0, the community growing at ph 4.1 produced more lactic acid, washed cells had a greater glycolytic activity over a wider ph range but amino acid metabolism decreased. in general, when ph control was restored, so were the original patterns of metabolism and bacterial counts, except for b. intermedius, which was still not detected. the inverse relationship between s. sanguis and s. mutans, and the increase in proportions of l. casei and s. mutans during growth in a low ph environment parallel observations made in vivo and suggest that the chemostat can be used as a model for microbial behaviour in dental plaque.

AB  == the role of saliva in supporting the growth of dental plaque has scarcely been investigated. we have studied the growth and recovery of micro-organisms from dental plaque samples on saliva-agar plates, prepared from filter-sterilized wax-stimulated whole saliva. under optimal conditions, the mean recovery of plaque samples on saliva agar was about 50% (range, 22-77) of the recovery on blood agar. addition of 2.5 mmol/l dithiothreitol (dtt) strongly facilitated filter-sterilization of saliva, but dtt concentrations higher than 1 mmol/l reduced the recovery of plaque micro-organisms on saliva agar. catalase (100 u/ml) offered protection against the inhibitory effect of dtt. addition of glucose (1-5 mmol/l) increased only slightly the recovery of plaque micro-organisms on saliva agar. when supragingival plaque was plated on saliva- and blood-agar plates, the composition of the microflora isolated from saliva agar strongly resembled that isolated from blood agar. the predominant species--i.e., streptococcus and actinomyces--all grew on saliva agar though usually in numbers somewhat lower than those on blood agar. in addition, most species normally found only in low proportions in supragingival dental plaque were also found to grow on saliva agar. collectively, the results lead to the conclusion that the supragingival microflora can utilize saliva as a complete source of nutrients.

TI  == 5-(alkylsulfonyl)salicylanilides as potential dental antiplaque agents.
AB  == a series of 22 5-(alkylsulfonyl)salicylanilides was synthesized and evaluated for in vitro antibacterial and antiplaque activity against actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans, adherent microorganisms implicated in periodontal disease and dental caries. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of 25 salicylanilides (including 5-acyl-, 5-alkyl-, and 5-(alkylsulfonyl)-4'-bromo- and -4'-(trifluoromethyl)salicylanilides) were found to correlate (r = 0.94) with estimated log d values. several salicylanilides, such as 5-(decylsulfonyl)- and 5-(dodecylsulfonyl)-4'-(trifluoromethyl)salicylanilides (15 and 19) were found to exhibit high levels of in vitro antibacterial and antiplaque activity against a.  viscosus and s. mutans.

TI  == agar medium for gas-liquid chromatography of anaerobes.
AB  == this study evaluates a method of performing gas-liquid chromatography (glc) by direct extraction of fatty acids from agar for identification of clinically significant anaerobic bacteria. the potential use of agar cultures for glc was studied by comparing chromatograms of 117 clinically isolated anaerobes grown in  peptone yeast glucose broth and chopped meat carbohydrate broth, and on enriched  brucella blood agar. for 98 of 117 anaerobes, fatty acid patterns from agar cultures were similar to those in broth. significant differences were only found  with streptococcus intermedius, clostridium perfringens, clostridium tertium, and actinomyces species, which produced less of certain fatty acids on agar than in broth. results of this study indicate that glc of short chain fatty acids produced on agar medium by anaerobes, combined with simple tests such as gram's stain and colonial morphology, may allow fir direct presumptive genus identification from an initial pure agar culture.

TI  == the growth of bacteria and the production of exoglycosidic enzymes in the dental  plaque of macaque monkeys.
AB  == the rate of growth of the predominant bacterial strains of plaque from the developmental grooves of first deciduous molar teeth was determined. median doubling times were 3.32, 3.45, 2.88 and 4.54 h for streptococci, lactobacilli, actinomyces and neisseria mucosa respectively. withdrawal of dietary food did not greatly influence the number of bacteria found in the grooves 18 h after they had been cleaned when compared to the number in fed monkeys; exceptions were significant increases in streptococcus mitior and n. mucosa. addition of 0.5 per  cent (w/v) glucose to the drinking water of fasted monkeys also did not influence the size of this bacterial population 18 h after cleaning, so bacteria growing in cleaned grooves must gain a major part of their nutritional needs from their immediate environment, most likely salivary constituents. the ability of oral bacteria to use the oligosaccharide side-chains of salivary glycoproteins was then explored. exoglycosidases for the preferred anomeric linkages of the principal monosaccharide units of salivary glycoproteins were produced both by oral bacteria in vitro and by dental plaque in vivo. thus plaque flora has the potential to degrade glycoproteins and this may explain how bacteria in the grooves grow in the absence of dietary food.

TI  == metabolic differences between saliva from caries-active and caries- and restoration-free children.
AB  == sucrose consumption and lactic-acid production by saliva, and the effects of ph,  were first evaluated by radio-isotope techniques in populations of caries- and restoration-free (cf), and caries-active from sucrose than saliva from ca subjects. sucrose consumption also was significantly greater in saliva of cf subjects. these results occurred at ph 7.2 but not at ph 6.0 and 5.0. lactic acid, total volatile products and carbon-dioxide (co2) production by saliva were  then evaluated in different cf and ca populations of children. metabolic parameters in the presence and absence of salivary supernatant (ss) also were determined. saliva of these cf subjects also formed significantly more lactic acid from sucrose than did ca subjects. the presence of ss increased lactic-acid  formation in this saliva; the increase was significant in cf subjects. total volatile products and co2 were greater in saliva of cf subjects but were not affected by ss. partial microbial characterization of each salivary specimen was  conducted in both series of experiments. cf subjects harboured less streptococcus mutans (parts i and ii), total lactobacilli (parts i and ii) and actinomyces species (part ii) than ca subjects. differences for lactobacilli in the first population and actinomyces species in the second were significant.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

AB  == bovine enamel blocks were covered by a bacterial cell mass and held in the mouths of human volunteers by a palatal appliance, to study the effects of acid production from endogenous bacterial substrate on the ph of the mass and on enamel demineralization. variables were cells with and without endogenous substrate, rinsing with 10 per cent glucose or sucrose solution, or no rinsing and the type of organism. acid production from endogenous substrate by streptococcus mutans strain ib-1600, due, at least in part, to intracellular glycogen degradation, caused a marked and prolonged ph drop and significant enamel demineralization. a similar but less marked effect was obtained with a strain of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguis and actinomyces viscosus. thus acid production from endogenous sources by plaque bacteria may be of importance in the aetiology of dental caries.

TI  == effects of highly concentrated stannous fluoride and chlorhexidine regimes on human dental plaque flora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the effect of an intensive antimicrobial treatment on the number of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus/actinomyces naeslundii, and the total colony-forming units (cfu) in plaque. the dentition of human volunteers was treated in a dental office with either chlorhexidine (5%) or stannous fluoride (8%). following the office treatment with chlorhexidine, selected volunteers rinsed daily at home for seven  or 49 days with chlorhexidine solution (0.2%), while another group flossed daily  at home for seven days with dental floss impregnated with chlorhexidine. on days  one, seven, 21, 35, and 49 after the local applications, we took saliva samples and plaque samples from fissures, smooth surfaces, and approximal areas. chlorhexidine and stannous fluoride suppressed s. mutans and the actinomyces species on all surfaces and in saliva. s. mutans on tooth surfaces was suppressed for approximately seven days and returned to the baseline level at day 21. a. viscosus/naeslundii was suppressed for more than seven days on the teeth. s. sanguis and the total cfu returned to the baseline level within seven days on all surfaces and in saliva. rinsing or flossing with chlorhexidine suppressed s. mutans during the period of time that these supplements were used. brushing for seven days with chlorhexidine gel (1%) without a preceding intensive chlorhexidine treatment had virtually no effect on s. mutans in approximal areas  and in saliva, but suppressed s. mutans in fissures and on smooth surfaces.

TI  == immunological study of lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans and evidence of common antigenic domains with lactate dehydrogenases from lactic bacteria.
AB  == rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against purified streptococcus mutans l-(+)-lactate dehydrogenase reacted with the purified enzyme, giving a marked deviation of its kinetic parameters. the enzyme affinity for pyruvate or nadh decreased in the presence of antibody, the affinity for fructose 1,6-diphosphate  (fdp) appeared to be slightly affected, and the cooperativity of the ligand binding was lowered. a partial protective effect was observed when the enzyme was preincubated with fdp prior to the antibody adjunction. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed detection of a 30% decrease in enzyme-antibody fixation when fdp was added. the protective effect observed with fdp could be correlated with a conformational change induced by the activator. a decrease of antibody binding in the presence of fdp was also obtained with s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and lactobacillus casei lactate dehydrogenases, which reflects a similar mechanism of activation among lactic bacteria. nadh did not offer any protection against antibody inhibition or fixation, and the coenzyme affinity decrease could be attributed to an indirect mechanism. on the contrary,  pyruvate and the immunoglobulins apparently could compete for specific binding sites. a decrease of antibody binding was also obtained with three heterologous lactic bacterial lactate dehydrogenases, indicating a conservation of antigenic determinants implicated in the substrate binding.

TI  == nonbactericidal approach to reduce colonization of plaque microflora on teeth in  vitro and in vivo.
AB  == a non-antibacterial, surface-modifying, perfluorosulfonamidoalkyl ester of phosphorous acid (psaep, 1) was adsorbed to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite disks in vitro. pretreatment of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads with different concentrations of 1 markedly reduced the adherence of radiolabeled streptococcus  mutans or actinomyces viscosus when compared with the buffer-treated controls. pretreatment of the cells with the compound also significantly impaired their subsequent attachment to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite. in a low surface-to-volume ratio adsorption model, i.e., saliva-coated hydroxapatite disks, pretreatment with 1 for 1 min markedly reduced the adsorption of a. viscosus to the disks. a 1% solution applied topically twice a day significantly (alpha = 0.05) reduced s. mutans-induced smooth and fissure caries in rats. the effect of 0.05% 1 in a rinse was also evaluated on experimental gingivitis in beagle dogs for 6 weeks. a topical application twice a day significantly (alpha = 0.05) reduced plaque-induced gingivitis when compared to that achieved with the placebo. microbial analyses of the plaque adjacent to gingiva indicated reduction in filamentous medium and large spirochetes as compared with that seen in the pretreatment phase. collectively, the results show that it is possible to reduce  dental caries and gingivitis via an interference with the specific adsorption of  organisms to teeth.

TI  == the establishment of reproducible, complex communities of oral bacteria in the chemostat using defined inocula.
AB  == nine commonly isolated oral bacterial populations were inoculated into a glucose-limited and a glucose-excess (amino acid-limited) chemostat maintained at a constant ph 7.0 and a mean community generation time of 13.9 h. the bacterial populations were streptococcus mutans atcc 2-27351, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitior ef 186, actinomyces viscosus wvu 627, lactobacillus casei ac 413, neisseria sp. a1078, veillonella alkalescens atcc 17745, bacteroides intermedius  t 588 and fusobacterium nucleatum nctc 10593. all nine populations became established in the glucose-limited chemostat although strep. sanguis and neisseria sp. were present only after a second and third inoculation, respectively. in contrast, even following repeated inoculations, strep. mutans, b. intermedius and neisseria sp. could not be maintained under glucose-excess conditions. a more extensive pattern of fermentation products and amino acid catabolism occurred under glucose-limited growth; this simultaneous utilization of mixed substrates also contributed to the higher yields (y molar glucose) and greater species diversity of these communities. microscopic and biochemical evidence suggested that cell-to-cell interactions and food chains were occurring  among community members. to compare the reproductibility of this system, communities were established on three occasions under glucose-limitation and twice under glucose-excess conditions. the bacterial composition of the steady-state communities and their metabolic behaviour were similar when grown under identical conditions but varied in a consistent manner according to the nutrient responsible for limiting growth. although a direct simulation of the oral cavity was not attempted, the results show that the chemostat could be used  as an environmentally-related model to grow complex but reproducible communities  of oral bacteria for long periods from a defined inoculum.

TI  == bacterial profiles of subgingival plaques in periodontitis.
AB  == in this report over 400 subgingival plaque samples taken from over 110 patients were examined microscopically and culturally for 30 bacterial parameters. the patients could be placed into six disease categories based upon clinical criteria. the bacterial profile of each clinical category was generally distinctive of that category. periodontal patients who had been successfully treated and maintained had plaques that were populated by significantly higher proportions of streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, a. odontolyticus and  s. mutans and significantly lower proportions of b. gingivalis and spirochetes compared to the five untreated disease categories. the spirochetes were the overwhelming microbial type in the plaques of adult periodontitis (ap) patients,  averaging about 45% of the microscopic count. the bacteriological results could not distinguish between ada type iii and iv periodontitis, suggesting that the same type of infection was occurring in an active site in any ap patient. the patients designated as early onset periodontitis (eop) differed from the other patients by their relative youth and by their significantly higher proportions of bacteroides gingivalis and/or b. intermedius. two types of eop were recognized in which the most diseased variant was characterized by having an average of 49% spirochetes in the plaque. four localized juvenile periodontitis (ljp) patients were notable in not having detectable a. actinomycetemcomitans. the data indicate that the various types of periodontitis, with the possible exception of ljp are specific anaerobic infections involving spirochetes and to a lesser extent b. gingivalis and b. intermedius.

TI  == isolation of actinomyces bacteriophage from human dental plaque.
AB  == human dental plaque samples were screened for the presence of bacteriophage for actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus sanguis. none of the 336 samples yielded phage for s. sanguis, but 10 contained virulent actinomyces phage. a high host cell specificity was observed in that one phage isolate infected only a. viscosus t14v, eight phage isolates infected only a. viscosus mg-1, and one infected both  strains. none was capable of productively infecting various other actinomyces strains that represented the six actinomyces coaggregation groups. because phage-containing samples occurred randomly in this survey, no correlation between the individual collecting the samples, dental clinic, or type of patient and the  presence of phage in the sample was noted. examination of one of the samples that yielded phage for the presence of a natural host strain for that particular phage resulted in the isolation of two strains which were identified as a. viscosus serotype ii and actinomyces naeslundii serotype i. this is the first report of an a. naeslundii host strain and actinomyces bacteriophage of human dental plaque origin. the finding of both phage and host strains in the same dental plaque sample along with the observation of high host cell specificity by these phage provide indicators that support an active role for actinomyces bacteriophage in oral microbial ecology. the use of these freshly isolated phage as probes to study actinomyces coaggregation properties is discussed.

TI  == coaggregation of oral bacteroides species with other bacteria: central role in coaggregation bridges and competitions.
AB  == seventy-three freshly isolated oral strains representing 10 bacteroides spp. were tested for their ability to coaggregate with other oral gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. none coaggregated with any of the gram-negative strains tested, which included capnocytophaga gingivalis, c. ochracea, c. sputigena, and  actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. strains of bacteroides buccae, b. melaninogenicus, b. oralis, and b. gingivalis failed to coaggregate with any of the gram-positive strains tested. however, six bacteroides spp. coaggregated with one or more species of gram-positive bacteria. most isolates of b. buccalis, b. denticola, b. intermedius, b. loescheii, b. oris, and b. veroralis coaggregated with strains of actinomyces israelii, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, a. odontolyticus, rothia dentocariosa, or streptococcus sanguis. the strongest coaggregations involved b. denticola, b. loescheii, or b. oris; 22 of 25 strains  coaggregated with a. israelii. only b. loescheii interacted with certain strains  of s. sanguis; these coaggregations were lactose inhibitable and were like coaggregations between a. viscosus and the same strains of s. sanguis. in fact, b. loescheii and a. viscosus were competitors for binding to s. sanguis. many bacteroides also acted as coaggregation bridges by mediating coaggregations between two noncoaggregating cell types (e.g., s. sanguis and a. israelii). evidence for binding-site competition and coaggregation bridging involving noncoaggregating cell types from three different genera provides support for the  hypothesis that these intergeneric cell-to-cell interactions have an active role  in bacterial colonization of the oral cavity.

TI  == microbiological aspects of some caloric sugar substitutes.
AB  == several caloric sugar substitutes are available today, e.g. maltitol, lycasin, sorbitol, xylitol, palatinit, sorbose, coupling sugar, palatinose, fructose and invert sugar. when evaluating the cariogenicity of these sugar substitutes from a bacteriological point of view, different analytical procedures should be considered. in vitro studies on the capacity of pure oral bacterial strains and dental plaque material to decompose the substitute to acid. studies on the catabolism of the substitute. possible adaptation of the oral microflora to metabolize the substitute in vivo as well as in vitro. studies on any inhibitory  effect of the substitute on the microbial activities in dental plaque and on the  oral microflora. the capacity of oral bacteria, e.g. streptococcus mutans, to induce caries in animal experiments should also be considered. results from such  microbiological studies make it possible to classify the caloric sugar substitutes into different groups. the first, most suitable, group seems to consist of xylitol and sorbose. these substitutes are fermented by few oral bacteria and no negative adaptation of the oral flora has been observed. a reducing effect upon dental plaque formation and on acid production from glucose  has been reported. a second group consists of maltitol, palatinite, palatinose, sorbitol and lycasin. these substitutes are fermented by certain groups of organisms within the oral genera actinomyces, lactobacillus and streptococcus. adaptation of oral bacteria to palatinose and to sorbitol, resulting in a more pronounced acid production, has been observed. no inhibitory effects have been reported. the results from experimental studies suggest that these sugar substitutes have no or little cariogenic action in rodents inoculated with s. mutans.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == lactate dehydrogenase from streptococcus mutans: purification, characterization,  and crossed antigenicity with lactate dehydrogenases from lactobacillus casei, actinomyces viscosus, and streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == a cytoplasmic fructose-1,6-diphosphate-dependent lactate dehydrogenase (ldh; ec 1.1.1.27) from streptococcus mutans omz175 was purified to homogeneity as judged  by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis. the purification consisted of ammonium sulfate precipitation of the cytoplasmic fraction, deae-sephacel and blue-sepharose cl.6b chromatography, and sephacryl s200 gel permeation. the catalytic activity of the purified enzyme required the presence of fructose-1,6-diphosphate with a broad optimum between ph 5 and 6.2. the concentration of fructose-1,6-diphosphate required for half-maximal velocity was  around 0.02 mm and was affected by the pyruvate concentration. the enzyme seemed  to have at least two binding sites for the activator which interact in a cooperative manner. increasing concentrations of fructose-1,6-diphosphate up to 2 mm enhanced the relative affinity of the enzyme for pyruvate and modified the pyruvate saturation curve from sigmoidal to hyperbolic. the enzyme activity showed also a sigmoidal response to nadh, exhibiting two binding sites for the cofactor with a hill coefficient of about 1.9. the molecular weight of the native enzyme was 150,000 as determined by gel permeation on sephacryl s200. monomers (38,000 daltons) and dimers (85,000 daltons) were observed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-gel electrophoresis; the latter form was dissociated after reduction with 2-mercaptoethanol, and the enzyme could be considered a tetramer. antibodies obtained against the purified s. mutans omz175 ldh cross-reacted with the sodium  dodecyl sulfate-dissociated forms of ldhs from different s. mutans serotypes, streptococcus sanguis omz9, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, and actinomyces viscosus ny 1. a competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay allowed us to detect a very close relationship between the native states of l-ldhs from s. mutans serotypes and s. sanguis. cross-reactions were also observed with the ldhs from a. viscosus and l. casei, the latter being the least related. a very weak immunological relationship was obtained between the l-ldh from s. mutans omz175 and the d-ldh from lactobacillus leichmannii, whereas no cross-reaction could be  detected with mammal ldhs.

TI  == surface structures (peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils) found on streptococcus sanguis strains may be related to their ability to coaggregate with other oral genera.
AB  == we screened 36 strains of streptococcus sanguis biotype i and 8 strains of s. sanguis biotype ii for the presence of surface structures and for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, and fusobacterium nucleatum. negative staining under an electron microscope revealed  detectable surface structures on all s. sanguis strains. the majority of strains  (38 of 44) carried peritrichous fibrils, which have an irregular profile and no distinct width. they usually appeared as a fringe with a constant width around the cell. strains selected for measurement had a fringe with an average length of 72.4 +/- 8.5 nm on biotype i strains and 51.6 +/- 3.3 nm on biotype ii strains. some fibrillar biotype i strains carried an additional, longer (158.7 +/- 33.1 nm) type of fibril projecting through the shorter fibrils. fibrillar density was  characteristic for each strain, ranging from very dense on all cells in a population to very sparse on a few cells in a population. a small group of six strains carried tufts of fibrils in a lateral or polar position on the cell. either one or two lengths of fibril were present in the tuft depending on the strain. one strain carried both peritrichous fibrils and fimbriae. fimbriae are flexible structures with a constant width (4.5 to 5.0 nm) all along their length  but very variable lengths (less than or equal to 0.7 micron) on each cell. s. sanguis i and ii both included strains with peritrichous fibrils and tufts of fibrils, but the mixed morphotype strain was confined to biotype ii. fibrils were present on cells at all stages throughout the growth cycle for the strains tested. freshly isolated fibrillar strains coaggregated consistently well with a. viscosus and a. naeslundii, although some fibrillar reference strains lacked the  ability. in addition, all tufted strains could not coaggregate, but the strains with the mixed morphotype coaggregated well. coaggregation with f. nucleatum was  very strong for the fibrillar strains, but less strong for the tufted strains. we discuss the possible correlation between s. sanguis surface structure and ability to coaggregate.

AB  == antigens in coccidioidin were compared with purified subfractions via tandem immunoelectrophoresis (iep) and by a combination of advancing line and crossed iep. rocket iep was suitable for titrating the reactions and showing the relationship between column fractions. these techniques required multicomponent antisera produced by hyperimmunization over many months and by the use of known standard migration pairs. the iep variations were used to chart the development of antisera against coccidioidin factors, to monitor antigen purifications, and to test the immunochemical homogeneity of an isolated antigen. mannose-based heteroglycans of cryptococcus neoformans were recovered from the culture filtrate. after precipitation of the major viscous glucuronoxylomannan (gxm) with ethanol or cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, the supernate is reserved because it contains a galactoxylomannan (galxm). after removal of glucuronic acid from the gxm, the resulting xylomannan of serotype a was amenable to 13c-nuclear magnetic  resonance (nmr) spectrometry; it revealed nonreducing xylose, alpha-1,3-mannose,  and alpha-1,2/1,3 disubstituted mannose, thus confirming by an independent means  what was previously known. the characterization sequence of galxm included: (1) gas-liquid chromatography (glc) of neutral sugars as peracetylated aldononitriles; (2) methylation-fragmentation glc mass spectrometry to determine  the glycosidic linkages; and (3) 13c-nmr showing similarities to mannan of saccharomyces cerevisiae. affinity chromatography of the galxm on concanavalin a  separated the galactoxylo component from an adsorbed mannoprotein. selection of monoclonal antibodies (mabs) relies on presumptive enzyme immunoassays (eias) or  radioimmunoassays for rapid screening of clones and for determination of isotypes; however, higher resolution confirmatory tests are needed to obtain mabs of desired specificity. mabs against candida tropicalis mannan were labeled with  horseradish peroxidase to use for detecting mannan in serum. mabs against the partially purified "m" factor of histoplasmin were characterized by the enzyme-linked immunoelectro-transfer blot technique (eitb), revealing unsuspected complexity in the antigen. secreted proteins of nocardia asteroides were isoelectrically focused; three proteins, identified by eitb as promising to be specific for that actinomycete, were cut out of gels and used to immunize mice for production of mabs. the fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii that mediate lactose-reversible coagglutination with streptococcus sanguis have been used to evoke mabs.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == the association between dietary sucrose consumption and microbial population shifts at six oral sites in man.
AB  == sucrose-related microbial population shifts were evaluated at 6 oral sites in 22  volunteers, who consumed high-sucrose diets for 21 days followed by low-sucrose diets for 21 days. culturing was performed at 0, 12, 21, 33 and 42 days of the 6-week experiment. over 50,000 microbial isolates were characterized and analysed. analysis of initial cultures showed the following site-specific microbial characteristics of the 6 sites evaluated: (1) molar fissures harboured  higher levels of neisseria species and showed the highest facultative-to-anaerobic ratio; (2) molar fissures and cervical buccal sites showed high streptococcus sanguis levels and total gram-positive cocci and fewer  gram-negative bacilli; (3) the tongue and saliva gave high concentrations of streptococcus salivarius and veillonella sp. sucrose intake was positively related to concentrations of yeasts and streptococcus mutans in the molar fissures; actinomyces viscosus in the mandibular approximal site; strep. mutans,  veillonella sp. and lactobacillus sp. in the maxillary approximal site and strep. salivarius on the tongue and in saliva. sucrose intake was negatively related to  concentrations of neisseria sp. on the tongue and total gram-positive bacilli in  saliva. a definite ecological effect of sucrose on the oral microflora was confirmed. the high inter-subject and site variations of target bacteria and the  generally low magnitude of shifts, however, discourage implementation of microbiological criteria in dietary assessments.

TI  == inhibition by cocoa extracts of biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharide by human oral bacteria.
AB  == extracts of defatted cocoa inhibited the biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharide by both cell-free and cell-associated streptococcal glucosyltransferases, but did not affect growth or acid production. both water-insoluble and water-soluble polysaccharide syntheses were inhibited, and the net result was a shift away from adherence-supportive polysaccharide. inhibition was non-competitive with respect to sucrose. the inhibition of polysaccharide biosynthesis was observed also with actinomyces species. the findings suggest that the inhibitory effects of cocoa on plaque accumulation and  caries formation are due to inhibition of bacterial polysaccharide production.

TI  == longitudinal investigation of bacteriology of human fissure decay: epidemiological studies in molars shortly after eruption.
AB  == in the present investigation, the proportions of streptococcus mutans, lactobacilli, streptococcus sanguis, veillonellae, and an unidentified actinomyces-like organism in dental plaque on occlusal fissures of first mandibular molars were monitored at 6-month intervals over a 3-year period in 368 children who were initially in grades 1 or 2. teeth destined to become decayed exhibited a significant increase in the proportions of s. mutans from 6 to 24 months before the diagnosis of dental decay. lactobacilli were sporadically detected but when present were associated with dental decay. children whose teeth exhibited the greatest number of decayed surfaces had, at all time periods, significantly higher proportions of s. mutans than did children who were caries free. many teeth had high proportions of s. mutans at their entry into the study. about 10% of the monitored teeth erupted during the period of observation, and in these teeth both s. mutans and lactobacilli could be significantly associated with decay. in these newly erupted teeth s. mutans outnumbered lactobacilli by ca. 20 to 1. s. sanguis, veillonellae, and the unidentified actinomyces-like organism could not be associated with the development of decay. these findings strongly implicate s. mutans and possibly lactobacilli as dental pathogens and suggest that if decay is to be controlled by strategies based upon a s. mutans infection, then the various tactics used probably will have to be performed on primary teeth, as these teeth are the most likely sources of infection for the permanent teeth.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == a-16686, a new glycoproteide antibiotic from actinoplanes sp., was evaluated as a potential antiplaque agent in comparison with chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, and cetylpyridinium chloride. a-16686 had good activity against gram-positive organisms associated with dental plaque (various streptococci, streptococcus mutans in particular, lactobacilli, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii); most of the strains tested were clinical isolates. it was bactericidal for streptococci (mbc/mic ratio of less than or equal to 8 for 92% of the strains) and for growing cells of s. mutans briefly exposed to antibiotic (99.9% killing within 5 min of contact with 200 micrograms of a-16686  per ml). it also inhibited the in vitro plaque formation by s. mutans and had good activity against preformed plaques. for most cases, its activity was comparable to those of chlorhexidine, benzalkonium chloride, and cetylpyridinium  chloride. a-16686 appears to be a promising antiplaque agent because of the following attributes: narrow spectrum of activity, rapid bactericidal action, lack of selection of resistant mutants, absence of cross-resistance with clinically used antibiotics, nonabsorption by oral route, good tolerability by the oral mucosa (rats and dogs), and physical characteristics (white powder, soluble in water).

TI  == human neutrophil migration under agarose to bacteria associated with the development of gingivitis.
AB  == in clinically healthy gingiva and increasingly with the development of inflammation, neutrophils are found in the gingival tissues and sulcus. this study evaluated the relative ability of bacteria associated with gingival health  and developing inflammation to stimulate this increase in neutrophil accumulation. dialyzed bacterial sonic extracts (be) in buffer and pooled human serum (phs) from pure cultures of streptococcus sanguis. actinomyces viscosus, a  naeslundii, bacteroides intermedius, fusobacterium sp and veillonella sp were tested for stimulation of human neutrophil migration under agarose. in addition,  fractions of s sanguis culture fluids (cfs) from sephadex g-10 chromatography were evaluated. all be solutions were incubated for 1 hour at 37 degrees c and heat-inactivated prior to testing. all bes in buffer attracted neutrophils, with  the greatest responses seen to s sanguis and b intermedius followed by a viscosus. migration to all bes in phs was greater than in buffer, suggesting that all bes are capable of generating serum chemoattractants. a viscosus be activated serum attractants to the greatest degree. cfs of s sanguis, a viscosus, and to a  lesser degree, fusobacterium sp, also attracted neutrophils. evidence from [3h]fmlp competitive ligand-binding assays indicated that s sanguis cfs contained low molecular weight (less than 700) chemoattractants, which were probably formylmethionyl oligopeptide-like materials. of the bacteria associated with health, s sanguis and a viscosus appeared at least as able to generate chemoattractants during growth or with exposure to serum as bacteria associated with gingivitis. this observation suggests that these "healthy" bacteria, which are found in greater numbers with developing inflammation, may mediate increased  neutrophil transmigration in early disease.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo studies of cellular lysis of oral bacteria by a lysozyme-protease-inorganic monovalent anion antibacterial system.
AB  == compared with anion-activated cell lysis of oral bacteria damaged with either lysozyme or trypsin, cells which were treated with both of these enzymes showed a far greater degree of lysis. this was true regardless of whether turbidimetric, dna release, or electron microscopic assays were used to monitor the lytic process. at an acidic ph of 5.2 and an nahco3 concentration of 100 mm, the kinetics of lysis for two different serotype c strains of streptococcus mutans were similar. at 0 to 100 mm bicarbonate, however, differences in the lytic susceptibilities of the two strains were evident. at ph 5.2, nahco3, but not nascn, nacl, or naf, was effective in promoting cell lysis of the oral bacteria.  at apparent sublytic concentrations of nahco3, lysis was achieved by adding appropriate concentrations of nascn, nacl, or naf to the lysozyme-protease-damaged cells. in in vivo studies, hamsters given a combination of nahco3, nacl, and nascn were found to have significantly reduced levels of s.  mutans on their molar teeth compared with that found in controls or animals exposed to any one of the salts alone or to a combination of chloride and thiocyanate only. the results suggest that bicarbonate is an essential anion which, together with the other major salivary inorganic monovalent anions, plays  an active role in the lysis and ultimate elimination of cariogenic bacteria.

AB  == nine caries-active children, each from six to nine years old, wore small removable enamel implants intra-orally for four weeks as part of an effort to develop removable model systems for studying dental plaque in fissures. the implants, consisting of two enamel cubes arranged to simulate a fissural space, were cemented in box preparations in stainless steel crowns on pulpotomized primary molars. upon removal, the fissural spaces were opened to facilitate plaque harvesting. the plaque samples were cultured, and enamel decalcification of the plaque-exposed surfaces was measured. quantitative microbial values were compared with those of natural fissure plaque samples from both caries-active (ca) and caries-and restoration-free (cf) children, also from six to nine years old. streptococcus mutans and s. sanguis levels of fissural insert plaque (fi) and natural fissural plaque from (ca) were similar. both contained higher s. mutans levels than did plaque from (cf). fi harbored higher concentrations of lactobacillus and actinomyces species and lower concentrations of neisseria species. otherwise, fi plaque resembled natural fissure plaque. microhardness of  fi plaque-exposed enamel decreased significantly compared with pre-experimental values and showed a significant negative correlation with values for total lactobacilli on selective media, and for s. mutans on non-selective media.

TI  == a possible mechanism for the cellular coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus  atcc 19246 and streptococcus sanguis atcc 10557.
AB  == the cells of actinomyces viscosus atcc 19246 (av19246) and streptococcus sanguis  atcc 10557 (ss10557) coaggregated immediately after mixing in 40 mm-tris/hcl buffer. optimal conditions were ph 7.5 in the presence of ca2+ at 0.1 mm or higher. na2 edta and its analogues, na2mgedta and na2mnedta at 7.5 mm inhibited the coaggregation. trypsin and heat treatment impaired the reactive site on av19246 cells, but not on ss10557 cells. the coaggregates, once formed, dissociated gradually during extended incubation at 37 degrees c; this was prevented by addition of sufficient ca2+. the disaggregation appears to be a spontaneous denaturation of the proteinaceous reactive site on av19246 cell surface. thus, the coaggregation involves the interaction of a lectin-like substance on the surface of av19246 with a carbohydrate site on ss10557. native ss10557 cell walls possessed reactivity with av19246 cells but 5% (w/v) tca-extracted cell wall residues did not. a carbohydrate moiety extracted from ss10557 exhibited a high potency in blocking coaggregation, and coaggregates were dissociated upon addition of the carbohydrate. lactose, galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine (the latter two are major constituents of the antigen extract) also significantly inhibited the coaggregation, but the other antigen components, glucose and rhamnose, did not. relative inhibitory activity, expressed as molar potency, of carbohydrate antigen, lactose, galactose and n-acetyl-d-galactosamine respectively, was approximately 26 x 10(3):16:4:1. ss10557 cells and cell walls reacted only with a ricinus communis (castor bean) agglutinin-120 but not with glycine max (soybean) agglutinin, arachis hypogaea (peanut) agglutinin or phaseolus vulgaris agglutinin (phytohaemagglutinin).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == colonization of the subgingival area by bacteroides gingivalis.
AB  == the initial event in colonization of the subgingival area by b. gingivalis is its attachment to host cells and gram-positive bacteria in pre-formed plaque. the level of b. gingivalis is partly governed by products of other plaque bacteria, especially by sanguicin. once b. gingivalis resides in its nidus and starts to proliferate, expulsion of pre-existing residents may occur, especially of attached gram-positive bacteria, through the inhibitory action of the b. gingivalis product, hematin. the bacteriocin produced by black-pigmented bacteroides also seems to play an important role in their establishment. melaninogenicus possessed strong inhibitory activity against actinomyces species. this was not completely confirmed with fresh isolates of b. gingivalis from advanced periodontitis patients. various factors other than inhibitory substances produced by b. gingivalis and related bacteria can also affect the colonization of this species. since the crevice area is influenced by gingival fluid, the nature of specific antibody and the other affecting components should be considered collectively with the interaction between new predominant colonizers and other pre-existing residents.

AB  == one of the most important questions in ecology is how to explain the co-existence of the variety of physiologically related organisms in the same habitat. a model  is presented for the co-existence of streptococcus species and actinomyces species in dental plaque. the hypothesis is that these organisms co-exist because they simultaneously utilize several carbon and energy substrates. the hypothesis  follows from the observation that the growth yield of oral streptococci and actinomyces in saliva is limited by carbohydrate. preliminary experiments were undertaken to test the hypothesis using mixed chemostat cultures and gnotobiotic  rats. competition between s. mutans k1r and a. viscosus ut2 in mixed chemostat cultures on glucose and asparagine was hampered by the early appearance of high-glucose-affinity variants of a. viscosus. from the physiological characteristics of s. sanguis and s. milleri, it might be predicted that simultaneous utilization of carbohydrate and arginine would enable these organisms to co-exist with s. mutans in an ecosystem. to test this mechanism under natural conditions, germ-free rats were inoculated with a combination of s. mutans k1r and s. sanguis p4a7 or the combination s. mutans k1r and s. milleri b448. the rats were fed on three different diets: (1) 58% cornstarch; (2) 48% cornstarch and 10% sucrose; and (3) 53% cornstarch and 5% arginine. the results of this experiment demonstrated that dietary arginine caused a significant decrease of the ratios k1r/p4a7 and k1r/b448 in dental plaque.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == five successive experiments, with rats fed ad libitum on diets containing sucrose or lycasin 80/55, were carried out. in experiment i, the rats were inoculated with streptococcus mutans alone or with strep. mutans in combination with actinomyces viscosus. in three successive transmission experiments (ii, iii, iv), the rats were inoculated with plaque of the rats of the preceding experiment. the rats of experiment v were inoculated with the original strains or with plaque derived from experiment iv. after five successive transmissions of the plaque flora, no alterations were demonstrated in the numbers and percentages of strep.  mutans and a. viscosus or in the fermentation rate of lycasin by the plaque flora in vitro. lycasin 80/55 was virtually non-cariogenic compared with sucrose (p less than 0.001) irrespective of whether the rats were inoculated with strep. mutans alone or in combination with a. viscosus, with the original strains or with plaque from the preceding experiments with rats on a lycasin 80/55-containing diet.

TI  == a simple method for extracting human lymphocyte stimulants from human dental plaque bacteria of the genus actinomyces.
AB  == the effect of acid concentration on the hot-acid extraction of antigens from actinomyces viscosus that stimulate human peripheral blood lymphocytes in vitro was tested. the optimum ph for release of these antigens in a soluble low molecular-weight form was ph 2.3. preliminary purification on sepharose 4b demonstrated that most of the lympho-stimulatory material (about 90 per cent) had a mol. wt of about 100,000. this partially-purified antigenic material was mainly protein. the ph 2.3 hot-acid extraction was also suitable for extracting antigens that stimulate cellular immune responses from three strains of actinomyces naeslundii and 1 strain of actinomyces israelii, but did not release lympho-stimulatory material from streptococcus sanguis which is a poor human peripheral-blood lymphocyte-stimulant and was used to demonstrate that the hot-acid extraction is not simply extracting a mitogenic macromolecule common to  all bacteria. as good yields of soluble, biologically-active antigens were obtained from all of the actinomyces, the procedure described will facilitate the purification and characterization of these antigens.

TI  == growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

TI  == the effects of mutual interaction and host diet on the growth rates of the bacteria actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans during colonization of tooth surfaces in di-associated gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the bacteria were simultaneously inoculated into the mouths of germ-free rats. the maximum growth rates attained by strep. mutans (doubling time td = 1.4 h) or  a. viscosus (td = 2.7 h) were approximately the same as in mono-associated gnotobiotic rats [td = 1.1 and 2.8 h, respectively (beckers and van der hoeven, 1982a)]. the presence of glucose or sucrose did not affect the maximum growth rates. in starved rats, the accumulation of microorganisms tended to decline sooner, suggesting that the growth was limited by the availability of nutrients.  no interaction between the two organisms was detected at the stage of initial adherence to the tooth surfaces or during the first 24 h of growth. after that, the increase of a. viscosus was retarded in the presence of strep. mutans t2, but not with strep. mutans omz176. the retardation was more pronounced in the rats fed on glucose than on sucrose. yet, at 24 days after inoculation. a. viscosus had increased in the glucose more than in the sucrose group. hence sucrose did not stimulate the accumulation of strep. mutans more than glucose.

TI  == human serum precipitins to oral bacteria related to dental caries.
AB  == adults aged 20-38 years were classified by a positive (+) or negative (-) precipitating serum antibody response to d-alanyl glycerol teichoic acid (s), or  an antigen from actinomyces spp. (a). culture filtrates of streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus were used to detect the respective specific antibodies by immunoelectrophoresis and immunodiffusion when present in serum at a concentration of more than 0.05 mg/ml. among subjects who had grown up in fluoridated areas, a+ subjects exhibited significantly fewer decayed, missing and filled teeth or teeth surfaces compared to a- subjects (p less than 0.02). for the whole population examined, caries severity increased with age and decreased with length of residence in a fluoridated area (p less than 0.01). when classified by a and s antibody response, only s-subjects showed a significant increase in caries score with age (p less than 0.02) and only a+s+ subjects a significant decrease in score with length of exposure to fluoridated water (p less than 0.05). it is concluded that the severity of caries in relation to age and fluoride exposure may differ in subjects with the different antibody specificities.

TI  == measurement of microbial alpha-amylases with p-nitrophenyl glycosides as the substrate complex.

TI  == pathogenic synergy: mixed infections in the oral cavity.
AB  == in almost all infections in the oral cavity, mixed populations of bacteria are present. however, recent evidence points to a certain specificity in these infections: streptococcus mutans is related to caries and black-pigmented bacteroides species are suspected pathogens in periodontal disease. periodontal diseases, endodontic infections and submucous abscesses in the oral cavity are probably mixed infections in which anaerobic bacteria together with facultatives  or other anaerobes are present. in experimental mixed anaerobic infections black-pigmented bacteroides strains have been shown to play a key role. little is known about the pathogenic synergy between the bacteria involved in mixed infections. important mechanisms could be nutritional interrelationships and interactions with the host defense. within the group of black-pigmented bacteroides b. gingivalis seems to be the most virulent species. these bacteria possess a great number of virulence factors, which might be important in the pathogenesis of oral infections.

AB  == the predominance of anaerobic bacteria in subgingival plaque samples suggests that the pocket environment is anaerobic. in the present investigation, a small oxygen tension (po2) electrode was inserted into the base of the pocket and the po2 was recorded. in addition, the plaque in these pockets was examined culturally and microscopically. the oxygen tension at the bottom of 36 pockets (5 to 10 mm in depth) ranged from 5 to 27 mmhg (1 mmhg congruent to 133.3 pa) with a mean value of 13.3 mmhg. moderate pockets (5 and 6 mm) exhibited a mean po2 of 15.7 mmhg, which was significantly higher than the 12.0 mmhg found in the deeper  pockets. the deep pockets had higher percentages of spirochetes and bacteroides intermedius, whereas the moderate pockets had elevated proportions of actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. the sites with oxygen tensions equal to or less than 15 mmhg had significantly higher percentages of spirochetes, whereas the microaerophilic capnocytophaga species were found in pockets with a po2 greater than 15 mmhg. the presence of bleeding in the pocket was associated with  higher proportions of b. intermedius, capnocytophaga sp., and a. naeslundii. these po2 readings of periodontal pockets indicated that there is a spectrum of po2 values which seem to define, in a general way, the microbiological composition of the pocket.

TI  == carbohydrate metabolism by actinomyces viscosus growing in continuous culture.
AB  == a human oral strain of actinomyces viscosus, gn431/75, was grown anaerobically in a defined medium in continuous culture with a glucose limitation at dilution rates (d) between 0.025 and 0.2 h-1 and with a nitrogen limitation at d = 0.005 and 0.1 h-1. with 5 mg of glucose per ml, the culture was limited for carbon at d = 0.025 and 0.05 h-1, but became nitrogen limited (asparagine) at d = 0.1 and 0.2 h-1. the molar growth yield (yglucose) decreased from 50.0 to 40.9 g of cells per mol of glucose as the dilution rate was increased from 0.025 to 0.2 h-1, reflecting the limitation of asparagine. with high glucose and low amino acid concentrations (nitrogen limited), the cell yields at d = 0.05 and 0.1 h-1 were 37 to 33% lower than in the glucose-limited culture. the major products of metabolism were succinic and lactic acids with lesser amounts of acetic and formic acids and ethanol. the rate of glucose fermentation by resting cells removed from the glucose-limited culture and assayed in a ph stat increased with  the dilution rate and was always higher than that for the fermentation of sucrose (60%) and fructose (40%). activity for the glucose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system was observed in whole homogenates, with the highest activity evident at d = 0.1 h-1 with the glucose-limited culture. the observed activity was significantly lower than the rate of glucose metabolism at each dilution rate, suggesting that glucose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system was underestimated or that an additional transport system exists in the organism. the glucose-limited culture showed considerable ability to synthesize glycogen during the transition from carbon to nitrogen limitation, when 35% of the cell mass was present at this polymer. the organism was shown to possess the glycogen  synthetic enzymes adp glucose synthase and adp glucose transferase, as well as the degradative enzyme maltodextrin phosphorylase. washed cells of a. viscosus gn431/75 were shown to be relatively insensitive to the inhibiting actions of naf in ph-fall and constant-ph experiments at all dilution rates. at ph 7.0, 25 mm naf was required to completely inhibit glycolysis by glucose-limited cells at d = 0.05 h-1, whereas a concentration of only 11 mm naf was required with cells of streptococcus mutans grown and incubated under identical conditions. an interesting feature of the growth of a. viscosus gn431/75 in the chemostat was the shift from individual nonadherent cells at the low dilution rates to the appearance at d = 0.2 h-1 of large cell aggregates forming tenacious adherent films reminiscent of its characteristics in the oral cavity.

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

TI  == bacterial adherence in the mouth.
AB  == studies of the adherence of bacteria indigenous to the human mouth have contributed greatly to our understanding of oral bacterial ecology. bacterial adhesion to teeth and oral epithelial surfaces seems to be indispensable for the  formation of dental plaque and for the persistent colonization of mucosal surfaces. the strength of adhesion to various oral surfaces differs widely among  oral bacteria and is a major reason for their different intraoral localization. considerable evidence suggests that the adhesion of different bacteria to the acquired pellicle on teeth or to mucosal surfaces as well as the adhesive processes involved in plaque accumulation entail different, specific interactions that are mediated by receptors on the bacterial cell surface, on the oral surfaces, and on plaque matrix components. some of these interactions may involve lectin-like binding. knowledge of the mechanisms by which suspected odontopathogens such as streptococcus mutans and certain actinomyces species may  adhere to oral surfaces has been discussed. successful methods for interfering with bacterial adhesion to human oral surfaces have not been developed yet.

AB  == the coaggregation properties of recent human oral streptococcal and actinomyces isolates from the same site were determined and compared with the coaggregation properties of well-characterized stock strains of these two kinds of bacteria. streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, and phenotypically similar strains of actinomyces were isolated from subgingival samples from periodontally healthy older individuals, from persons participating  in an experimental gingivitis study, and from young persons with localized (juvenile) and generalized (severe) periodontitis. all 34 of the actinomyces isolates coaggregated with reagent strains of s. sanguis that represented the four streptococcal coaggregation groups. most of these actinomyces exhibited coaggregations identical to those of actinomyces stock strains. however, five isolates of an actinomyces wva-963 serovar exhibited a coaggregation pattern different from any previously described, which was used to define coaggregation group f. all coaggregations with members of this group were lactose inhibitable.  only 57% (8 of 14) of the recent s. sanguis isolates coaggregated with actinomyces reagent strains. but when the nonreactive streptococcal isolates were tested for their ability to coaggregate with actinomyces from the same patient, a new, highly specific coaggregation pattern (group 6) for s. sanguis was discovered. coaggregation of these streptococci was observed only with certain isolates of a. naeslundii (members of coaggregation group d) from the same site,  and none of these coaggregations were inhibited by lactose. subsequent testing revealed that streptococci of group 6 coaggregated with group d actinomyces from  other sources but not with actinomyces of other coaggregation groups. only two strains of s. sanguis failed to coaggregate with any strain of actinomyces tested. these results indicate that nearly all fresh isolates of these species obtained from both diseased and healthy sites exhibit specific, nonrandom patterns of coaggregation and suggest the widespread occurrence of in vivo cell-to-cell recognition between oral actinomyces and streptococci.

AB  == the binding of 18f to isolated cell membranes and cell walls of streptococcus mutans gs-5 or other bacteria was assayed. the attachment of 18f to these cell envelopes proceeded slowly and reached equilibrium within 60 min. 18f binding was stimulated by ca2+ (1 mm). the binding of 18f to cellular components was dependent upon the ph, as well as the amount of 18f and dose of the binder employed. the binding of 18f by cell walls prepared from fluoride-sensitive and fluoride-resistant cells of s. salivarius and s. mutans did not differ significantly. the pretreatment of cell walls or cell membranes for 60 min at 30  degrees c with 1 mg of rnase, dnase, or trypsin per ml did not influence the binding of 18f by the walls and membranes of s. mutans gs-5. however, prior exposure of cell membranes to sodium dodecyl sulfate caused a significant reduction in the number of 18f atoms bound by the membranes. in saturated assay systems, cell membranes of s. mutans gs-5 bound 10(15) to 10(16) atoms of 18f per mg (dry weight), whereas cell walls from s. mutans gs-5, fa-1, and hs-6 or actinomyces viscosus t14v and t14av bound 10(12) to 10(13) atoms of 18f per mg (dry weight). 18f in this quantity (10(12) to 10(13) atoms) cannot be detected with the fluoride electrode. the data provide, for the first time, a demonstration of 18f binding by cell membranes and walls of oral flora.

TI  == copper-inhibition of the growth of oral streptococci and actinomyces.
AB  == copper ions were found to inhibit the rate of growth in broth culture of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarious, streptococcus sanguis, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii. in all cases, 10(-3) m copper inhibited the rate of growth, whereas 10(-4) m and lower concentrations had little or no effect. at the concentrations used in mouthwashes one mode of action of copper ions is to reduce the rate of growth of oral bacteria in vitro.

TI  == common antigens of streptococcal and nonstreptococcal oral bacteria: characterization of wall-associated protein and comparison with extracellular protein antigen.
AB  == a soluble wall-associated common protein (wap) has been isolated from cell wall-extracted antigens of exponentially growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz9, two serotypes (a and e), of streptococcus mutans and actinomyces viscosus omz104. the wap antigens from the different strains were obtained by chromatography on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column of sodium dodecyl sulfate-dissociated immunoprecipitates. the affinity-isolated wap antigens from the different oral bacteria were identical, as demonstrated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (showing an apparent molecular weight  of 80,000) and amino acid and sugar compositions. this wap antigen, common to all bacterial strains tested, consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar. a comparison of the chemical properties of this wap antigen and of the soluble extracellular common protein antigen showed that, although having similar amino acid and sugar  compositions, the two proteins are different. electron micrographs developed after immunocytological labeling of the wap antigen on whole cells confirmed that it is located on the cell wall.

TI  == a factor from actinomyces viscosus t14v that specifically aggregates streptococcus sanguis h1.
AB  == a highly specific aggregation factor for streptococcus sanguis h1 (afh1) was obtained by lysozyme treatment of actinomyces viscosus t14v. at 1 micrograms/ml,  afh1 aggregated a suspension of s. sanguis h1, with which a. viscosus t14v coaggregates by a mechanism not inhibited by lactose: even at much higher levels  afh1 caused little or no aggregation of streptococci from other coaggregation groups (j. o. cisar et al., infect. immun. 24:742-752, 1979). the most active fraction of afh1 obtained by gel chromatography (near the void volume of bio-gel  a1.5 m) reacted as a single antigen with anti-a. viscosus t14v serum and was unrelated to the fimbrial antigens of a. viscosus t14v. smaller molecular fractions, at high levels, inhibited aggregation of s. sanguis h1 by high-molecular-weight afh1 as well as coaggregation of s. sanguis h1 with a. viscosus t14v. the afh1 fraction with high aggregating activity was composed of approximately 53% cell wall components (alanine, glutamine, lysine, n-acetylglucosamine, and n-acetylmuramic acid). 40% polysaccharide (n-acetylgalactosamine, rhamnose, and 6-deoxytalose), and 7% protein; teichoic acid was not detected. the fraction which inhibited aggregation and coaggregation contained much less of the cell wall constituents and more of the polysaccharide  than the fraction with potent aggregating activity. aggregation was completely prevented either by treating afh1 with 0.01 m periodate at 25 degrees c for 4 h or by treating s. sanguis h1 with heat or pronase. a role for electrostatic forces in the aggregation was indicated by: (i) nacl inhibition of aggregation, and (ii) a great decrease in aggregation potency as a result of chemical modification of either cationic or anionic groups of afh1. on the other hand, nacl reversed the aggregation only very weakly. the overall data suggest that a carbohydrate-protein interaction may be dominant in the aggregation of s. sanguis h1 by afh1 and in the coaggregation of s. sanguis h1 with a. viscosus t14v.

TI  == coaggregation of human oral cytophaga species and actinomyces israelii.

TI  == fibrinogenolytic and fibrinolytic activity in oral microorganisms.
AB  == samples were taken from blood accumulated in dental alveoli after surgical removal of mandibular third molars, from subgingival plaque of teeth with advanced periodontal destructions, from teeth with infected necrotic pulps, and from subjects suffering from angular cheilitis. of the microorganisms subcultured from these samples, 116 strains were assayed for enzymes degrading fibrinogen and fibrin. enzymes degrading fibrinogen were assayed with the thin-layer enzyme assay cultivation technique. this assay involves the cultivation of microorganisms on culture agars applied over fibrinogen-coated polystyrene surfaces. enzymes degrading fibrin were assayed with both a plate assay and a tube assay, in which fibrin was mixed with a microbial culture medium. microorganisms degrading fibrinogen or fibrin or both were isolated from all sampling sites. activity was mainly detected in strains of actinomyces, bacteroides, fusobacterium, peptococcus, propionibacterium, and staphylococcus aureus. most fusobacterium strains degraded fibrinogen only. enzymes degrading fibrinogen as well as enzymes degrading fibrin via activation of plasminogen were revealed in strains of clostridium, s. aureus, and streptococcus pyogenes. it was generally found that fibrinogen was degraded by more strains than was fibrin, which indicates that different proteases may be involved.

AB  == an extracellular bactericidal substance was isolated from the supernatant of streptococcus mutans rm-10 culture fluid and partially purified with 60% ammonium sulfate precipitation, differential centrifugation, and gel filtration on sephadex g-200. there was a good correlation of the sensitivity profiles of indicator strains whether assayed on solid medium or with purified material from  cell-free culture fluid, indicating that the same inhibitory substance is produced on solid medium and in broth. vapor from organic solvents such as chloroform, acetone, ethanol, and ether as well as heat treatment at 100 degrees  c for 30 min had little effect on the bactericidal factor. it was sensitive to trypsin and pronase and resistant to deoxyribonuclease, ribonuclease, lysozyme, and phospholipase c. the inhibitor was not infective, and electron microscopic studies failed to reveal phage or phage-like particles in concentrated solutions  of the bactericidal material. the results indicate that the extracellular bactericidal substance is indeed a bacteriocin. activity in broth cultures reached a maximum only after exponential growth had ceased. it was active against other streptococcal strains as well as strains of actinomyces naeslundii, a. viscosus, bacillus subtilis and staphylococcus aureus, but not against strains of fusobacterium nucleatum and escherichia coli.

AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.

AB  == peptidoglycans and cells walls from actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus,  and group a streptococcus were compared for their relative abilities to activate  the alternate complement pathway (acp). on the dry-weight basis, the peptidoglycan from a. viscosus was 3.5 times more active than group a streptococcal peptidoglycan and 15.6 times more active than staph. aureus peptidoglycan in activating the acp. consequently a. viscosus peptidoglycan is one of the most potent acp-activators reported to date. for both a. viscosus and  group a streptococcus, the peptidoglycan was a better acp activator than cell walls from the same organism (125- and 52-fold, respectively) indicating that the peptidoglycan is probably the most important subcellular acp-activator in these microorganisms. in contrast, cell walls from staph, aureus were 9 times more active than peptidoglycan from staph. aureus in activating the acp, presumably because teichoic acids are the most important subcellular acp activator in this microorganism.

TI  == glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, and actinomyces viscosus in the presence of human saliva.
AB  == glucose uptake was examined by using whole-cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans (strains bht, ingbritt, and gs-5), streptococcus mitis (strains 9811 and 72x41), and actinomyces viscosus (strains t6 and wvu626) incubated for up to 90 min in 0 to 82% (vol/vol) human whole salivary supernatant. glucose uptake by the s. mutans strains was completely inhibited at all saliva concentrations. dithiothreitol (dtt), present during saliva incubation, prevented saliva inhibition. glucose uptake was also restored when saliva-inhibited cells were subsequently exposed to dtt. the inclusion of catalase in the saliva incubation mixtures resulted in protection equal to that obtained with dtt. the s. mitis strains were also inhibited by saliva but to a far lesser extent that s. mutans.  dtt and catalase also protected s. mitis from saliva inhibition. both a. viscosus strains were completely refractory to saliva inhibition of glucose uptake. based  on (i) the sensitivity of the catalase-negative streptococci and the resistance of catalase-positive actinomyces to saliva inhibition and (ii) the equal and complete protection to saliva inhibition afforded by dtt and catalase, we conclude that the lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in saliva was the only antibacterial system expressed under our experimental conditions. the relative resistance of s. mitis 9811 (compared with s. mutans bht) to saliva inhibition was shown not to result from poor h(2)o(2) production in either glucose-supplemented buffer or saliva solutions. s. mitis produced inhibitory quantities of h(2)o(2) that equaled or exceeded s. mutans h(2)o(2) accumulation.  it is suggested that s. mitis might possess a greater ability to repair lactoperoxidase-mediated damage than does s. mutans. every organism studied exhibited a saliva concentration-dependent, cell growth-independent stimulation of glucose uptake after 60 to 90 min of incubation. the a. viscosus and s. mitis  strains showed saliva stimulation (or stabilization) of glucose uptake with unsupplemented saliva. in the case of s. mutans, saliva stimulation was only observed when dtt was present. the possible role of salivary lactoperoxidase as a modulator of the intraoral site specificities exhibited by s. mutans is discussed.

TI  == characterization of a galactose-specific lectin from actinomyces viscosus by a model aggregation system.
AB  == a simple model system has been developed in which lectin-mediated aggregation of  glycoprotein-coated beads can be monitored by following the decrease in light scattering at 650 nm. aggregation has been characterized with the lectin of actinomyces viscosus t14v. its dependence on ph, temperature, and stirring rate was examined, and the number of bacterial cells in relation to the number of latex beads resulting in optimal aggregation was established. this system has the advantage of permitting the study of a single ligand of defined structure. the ligand density was determined with radiolabeled glycoproteins. under the conditions of the assay, ligand leakage was less than 3%, and ligands were not displaced from the beads by various proteins, glycoproteins, or by other components present in the assay mixture. latex beads coated with asialofetuin aggregate upon the addition of a. viscosus t14v cells. by contrast, when asialofetuin was first extensively treated with purified galactose oxidase, no aggregation occurred. only after reduction with nabh(4) was aggregation restored, demonstrating that galactose termini of asialofetuin are essential for the binding of a. viscosus lectin. an absolute requirement for calcium was also demonstrated. various sugars inhibited aggregation in the following order, starting with the most effective: lactose, methyl-beta-d-galactopyranoside, galactose, n-acetylgalactosamine, methyl-alpha-d-galactopyranoside. beads coated  with fimbriae from a. viscosus coaggregated with neuraminidase-treated human erythrocytes and with streptococcus sanguis cells. in each instance the aggregation was inhibited by lactose, indicating that the a. viscosus lectin is located in the fimbriae. cells grown under different conditions differed in their effectiveness in aggregating glycoprotein-coated beads, suggesting differences in lectin density or accessibility. two different experimental designs were used to  establish the minimum ligand density for aggregation to occur. in one type of experiment, a threshold concentration was found for asialo alpha(1)-acid glycoprotein, but not for asialofetuin. with an alternate approach in which a different population of galactose residues was exposed, a threshold phenomenon was also demonstrated for asialofetuin. the importance of structural ligand features in the aggregation assay is discussed in view of these findings.

AB  == spontaneously occurring coaggregation-defective (cog-) mutants of oral actinomycetes and streptococci were isolated and used to study interactions between cells of these two kinds of bacteria. cog- mutants of each kind of bacteria were isolated by a simple enrichment scheme. parent strains were mixed with a coaggregating partner strain, coaggregated cells were removed by low-speed centrifugation, and non-coaggregated cells were recycled by the addition of more  partner strain cells. cog- mutants constituted up to 10% of the parent strain cell type in the final enriched cell suspension. unlike their respective parent strains, cog- mutants of actinomyces viscosus t14v and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 12104, and a. naeslundii i exhibited no lactose-reversible coaggregation with certain oral streptococcus sanguis strains. however, these cog- mutants were not altered in their coaggregations with another s. sanguis strain, h1, a member  of a streptococcal coaggregation group that exhibits only lactose-nonreversible coaggregations with oral actinomycetes. although all coaggregations between s. sanguis h1 and these actinomycetes appear to be alike, examination of a cog- mutant of s. sanguis h1 revealed that, like its parent, it coaggregated with a. viscosus t14v and its cog- mutants, but unlike its parent, it did not coaggregate with the two a. naeslundii strains or their cog- mutants. thus, it was concluded  that at least two types of surface components are important in mediating coaggregation between s. sanguis h1 and actinomycetes. the cog- mutant of s. sanguis allowed detection of these components, which were indistinguishable in previous studies.

TI  == common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: isolation and biochemical characterization of the extracellular protein antigen.
AB  == an extracellular soluble common protein (ecp) has been purified from extracellular soluble fractions of exponential phase cultures of streptococcus sanguis omz9, of a representative strain of each of bratthall's seven serological groups of streptococcus mutans, and of one strain each of lactobacillus salivarius and actinomyces viscosus. the ecp antigens from the different strains  were prepared from sds-dissociated immunoprecipitates by affinity chromatography  on an anti-rabbit immunoglobulin column. the identity of such purified ecp antigens was demonstrated by their behaviour in immunodiffusion analysis, in sds-page, in which an identical molecular weight (60000) was found, and by virtue of their similar amino acid and sugar compositions. this common antigen (ecp) consisted of 90% protein and 10% sugar.

TI  == inhibition of neutrophil chemotaxis by soluble bacterial products.
AB  == bacterial-neutrophil interactions may be critical determinants of virulence in periodontal diseases. this study was undertaken to examine the ability of major bacterial species from the human oral cavity to inhibit (1) peripheral blood neutrophil chemotaxis, (2) chemotactic formylmethionyl peptide binding, and (3) phagocytosis. included were cultured supernatants and sonic extracts obtained from strains of capnocytophaga, bacteroides gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum,  bacteroides asaccharolyticus, capnocytophaga species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, neisseria, actinomyces viscosus, bacterionema matruchotii, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sanguis. chemotaxis  was measured using boyden chambers; phagocytosis was determined using staphylococcus aureus as the indicator organism and radioactive chemotactic peptide binding was assessed by a rapid filtration assay. none of the test organisms were cytotoxic to neutrophils or inhibited neutrophil phagocytosis. capnocytophaga species., bacteroides species., a. actinomycetemcomitans, and f. nucleatum produced factors which specifically inhibited neutrophil chemotaxis. activity was lost after dialysis. extracts of bacteroides species, a. actinomycetemcomitans and f. nucleatum, which were not chemotactic by themselves, inhibited binding of chemotactic peptide suggesting that in vitro chemotaxis inhibition was mediated by nonchemotactic components that compete for the chemotactic factor receptor on the neutrophil. the exception was capnocytophaga which appeared to inhibit chemotaxis by inhibition of a post-binding event. such  chemotactic inhibitors from periodontopathic organisms that inhibit neutrophil function may be important determinants of virulence.

TI  == predominant cultivable microflora of human dental fissure plaque.
AB  == plaque developed in 10 occlusal fissures from unerupted third molars during implantation for 200 to 270 days in lower molars of dental students was studied.  to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 592 isolates (51 to 67 from each fissure) were subcultured from anaerobic roll tubes. twenty-eight of the isolates were lost. streptococci constituted 8 to 86% (median, 45%) of the isolates, streptococcus mutans constituted 0 to 86% (median, 25%) and s. sanguis  constituted 0 to 15% (median, 1%). a few isolates of "s. mitior" and "s. milleri" were found, but no s. salivarius. staphylococci made up 0 to 23% (median, 9%). gram-positive rods constituted 6 to 59% (median, 35%). of these, 0 to 46% (median, 18%) were actinomyces naeslundii and a. viscosus, but no anaerobic actinomyces were isolated. arachnia and propionibacteria made up small proportions, lactobacilli were isolated from two fissures, constituting 10 and 29%, and eubacteria were isolated from one fissure (27%). gram-negative cocci made up 0 to 46% (media, 4%). only two isolates of gram-negative rods were found, both facultative anaerobes. although 8 of the 10 fissures had large proportions of s. mutans, lactobacilli, or both, no caries was found even with microradiography. the large individual variation probably reflects differences in initial colonization from saliva and in growth conditions in each fissure.

AB  == experimental infections in root canals with streptococcus faecalis ss. liquefaciens (strep-mc4). actinomyces bovis (act-mc6) and bacteroides oralis (bact-mc3) were studied in four immunized and five nonimmunized monkeys. the immunization was performed using antigens of the homologous strains. the antibody level was checked by gel diffusion. in 56 root canals of the immunized animals and 60 root canals of the nonimmunized animals, viable cells of the three bacterial strains were enclosed in equal amounts of various combinations. after 6 months, samples from the root canals were subjected to qualitative and quantitative bacteriologic analyses and the apical area was radiographically and  histologically examined. the analyses revealed no significant difference between  the two groups of monkeys, although the viable cell recovery was slightly higher  in most of the root canals of nonimmunized monkeys. the cell proportion of the strains within the different bacterial combinations was equal in root canals of the two groups of animals. the radiographic and histologic examinations revealed  no significant difference between the two groups of animals regarding the number  of teeth with periapical lesions. the radiographic examination, however, showed a more distinct limitation of the process in the immunized than in the nonimmunized monkeys. histologically the lesions were more encapsulated and had a sparser cell infiltration in immunized than in nonimmunized monkeys. in the latter, inflammatory cells had often infiltrated the bone. mixed infections gave a more severe periapical reaction than single strain infections in both animal groups.

TI  == antibodies against the ag2 fimbriae of actinomyces viscosus t14v inhibit lactose-sensitive bacterial adherence.
AB  == monospecific antisera against the ag1 and ag2 fimbrial components of actinomyces  viscosus t14v were produced by immunizing rabbits with immune precipitates of each antigen harvested from crossed-immunoelectrophoresis plates. the fab fragments prepared from these sera were used as specific reagents in immunoelectron microscopy to identify each fimbrial component on the bacterial surface and also were assayed for their abilities to prevent the coaggregation of a. viscosus t14v with streptococcus sanguis 34, an interaction that is lactose sensitive. each fab preparation appeared to react with different fibrillar structures present on the actinomycete, and only the ag2-specific fabs blocked coaggregation. these results provide strong support for the presence of distinct  types of fimbriae on a. viscosus t14v and indicate the exclusive involvement of ag2 fimbriae in lactose-sensitive adherence.

TI  == inhibitors of coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34: beta-galactosides, related sugars, and anionic amphipathic compounds.
AB  == coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus t14v (t14v) and streptococcus sanguis  34 (ss34) depends upon specific reaction between lectin on t14v and carbohydrate  on ss34. studies on coaggregation inhibition by sugars related to d-galactose, beta-galactosides, and amphipathic molecules revealed: (i) d-fucose, d-talose approximately equal to d-galactose, which was 0.2 potency of lactose. no other hexoses or pentoses inhibited at 0.1 m. (ii) gal beta (1 leads to 3)galnac alpha  och2c6h5 was the most potent beta-galactoside inhibitor; it had 20 times the potency of lactose. (iii) anionic nonaromatic amphipathic compounds were good inhibitors; sodium deoxycholate (i) was equal to lactose; sodium dodecyl sulfate  (ii) had 15 times the potency of lactose; there was 90 to 100% irreversible inhibition when t14v was treated with 0.005 m (ii). treatment of ss34 with ii had no effect. (iv) synergism of inhibition was observed between lactose and i or lactose and ii, e.g., inhibition by 0.01 m lactose = 5%; inhibition by 0.01 m i = 9%; inhibition by 0.01 m lactose + 0.01 m i = 87%. (v) the irreversible inhibition by ii was prevented when 0.25 m lactose or 0.25 m i was present during treatment of t14v with 0.005 m ii. (vi) synergism and prevention by lactose or by i of irreversible inhibition by ii suggest that all three react at the same site  on t14v lectin. we hypothesize that the t14v lectin combining site for ss34 carbohydrate has specific affinity for beta-galactosides and for anionic nonaromatic amphipathic molecules. this site can be saturated by either kind of reagent to exclude the other reagent or to inhibit coaggregation.

TI  == microbial populations growing in the presence of fluoride at low ph isolated from dental plaque of children living in an area with fluoridated water.
AB  == longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml)  at ph levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both ph and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. strains of streptococcus and neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at ph levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. the most commonly isolated streptococci were streptococcus mitior and s. salivarius. s. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at ph 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at ph 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. despite their known fluoride resistance, actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. the ph of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at ph 6.0 was only 30% of that at ph 7.0. representative strains of s. mutans, s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the ph and fluoride levels of the  medium on which they were initially isolated. fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount  of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. the isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the ph range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric s. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. in the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may  permit s. mitior to compete with s. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == enzymatic modification of bacterial receptors on saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == certain properties of experimental pellicles formed by the adsorption of salivary components on hydroxyapatite surfaces change over time. to determine whether enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment could induce such changes, pellicles were treated with saliva which had been incubated for 18 h at 35 degrees c to promote the elaboration of microbial enzymes. this treatment markedly reduced the numbers of streptococcus mutans mt3 and jbp and s. sanguis fc-1 and c5 cells which attached, but it had little or no effect on the attachment of s. mitis re7, actinomyces viscosus ly7 and ck-8, bacteroides gingivalis 381, or b. melaninogenicus subsp. intermedius 581. heating the incubated saliva at 60 degrees c for 30 min partially reduced its pellicle-modifying activity, whereas heating at 80 degrees c for 30 min or 100 degrees c for 15 min completely eliminated such activity. this indicated that the saliva contained heat-labile substances, presumably enzymes, which could affect the pellicle receptors involved in the attachment of s. mutans and s. sanguis. treatment of saliva-treated hydroxyapatite with commercially obtained enzyme preparations also affected bacterial attachment. thus, treatment with galactose oxidase reduced the numbers of the s. mutans strains which attached, whereas treatment with neuraminidase reduced the adsorption of s. sanguis fc-1 but not that of s. sanguis c5. treatment with beta-glucosidase preparations derived from  almonds significantly reduced the attachment of all of the streptococcal strains  studied, but, when subjected to isoelectric fractionation, the adherence-inhibiting activity did not correlate directly with beta-glucosidase activity. treatment of the pellicles with trypsin or eight other glycosidases did not affect streptococcal attachment. exposure of the enzymatically modified pellicles to fresh saliva did not restore the streptococcal receptors. collectively, the data suggest that some bacterial receptors in the pellicle coating of teeth can be modified by enzymes likely to be present in the oral environment, and these interactions may affect oral bacterial ecology.

AB  == freshly isolated strains of oral actinomycetes were obtained from human dental plaque and were tested for the ability to coaggregate with common laboratory stock strains of streptococcus sanguis. strains belonging to the genera actinomyces, arachnia, bifidobacterium, and bacterionema were isolated. only members of the genus actinomyces coaggregated with the streptococci, and only actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii exhibited lactose-reversible interactions. a total of 61 strains, consisting of all of the a. viscosus isolates and 86% of the a. naeslundii isolates, coaggregated; 87% inhibited lactose-reversible coaggregation. on the basis of this property and the altered ability of strains to coaggregate after heat treatment of the cells, we delineated four coaggregation groups. the other 13% of the strains constituted a  fifth group, which was characterized by a pattern of closely related interactions that were not reversed by lactose. compared with previously characterized coaggregation properties determined with stock culture strains of actinomycetes,  more than 80% of these fresh isolates exhibited identical coaggregation properties. thus, most of the coaggregation between freshly isolated oral actinomycetes and streptococci involves lactose-reversible cell-cell interactions, which suggests that such coaggregation is mediated by a network of  lectin-carbohydrate interactions between complementary cell surface structures on the two cell types.

TI  == bacteriocin-like activity within the genus actinomyces.
AB  == actinomyces strains were tested for evidence of bacteriocin-like antagonism. prevalence of inter-strain antagonism was low, and, when present, zones of inhibition were generally small and poorly defined. strains of a. viscosus were very susceptible to bacteriocin-like inhibition by s. mutans. prevalence of inhibition was high, and zones of inhibition tended to be large and well defined. inhibitors produced by s. mutans were generally heat stable, nondialyzable, and sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. individual strains of a. viscosus could be differentiated on the basis of sensitivity patterns to a battery of s. mutans strains.

TI  == influence of growth medium on adsorption of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the influence of the growth medium on the ability of strains of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii to attach to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) surfaces was studied. preliminary experiments indicated that cells of each species harvested in lag, log, and early stationary phases of  growth adsorbed comparably to s-ha; thus, early stationary phase cells were used  in all subsequent assays. strains were grown in chemically defined medium (cdm),  in cdm supplemented with gastric mucin or with filter-sterilized or (60)co-irradiated saliva from human donors of blood types a, b, or o, and in trypticase soy broth (bbl microbiology systems) and todd-hewitt broth. adherence  of s. mutans h12 to s-ha tended to vary when the streptococci were grown in saliva-supplemented cdm, but the number of cells which attached was generally within twofold of that of cdm-grown cells. attachment of a. viscosus s2 and ly7 and of a. naeslundii s4 and l13 was generally similar when grown in cdm or in cdm supplemented with saliva, but it tended to increase for organisms grown in cdm supplemented with gastric mucin. none of the strains studied appeared to destroy  the blood group reactivity of the added salivary components, and they attached equally well to ha treated with homologous or heterogous saliva from that present in the medium in which they were grown. the a. viscosus strains adsorbed in 25 to 40% higher numbers to ha treated with blood type b saliva than with type a saliva, irrespective of the medium used for growth. s. mutans h12 cells displayed alpha- and beta-glucosidase and alpha-galactosidase activity; the actinomyces strains exhibited these activities plus beta-galactosidase when grown in all media. however, the levels of these glycoside hydrolases did not correlate with cell adsorption to s-ha. the apparent weak influence of the growth medium on attachment of s. mutans was studied further. strains of s. mutans isolated from the saliva of five human donors were made resistant to streptomycin, grown in cdm, and then added to new saliva samples from the respective donors from which they were obtained. the in vitro-grown cells were found to attach to s-ha comparably to s. mutans cells present naturally in the saliva.

TI  == bacteriology of intracranial abscess in children.
AB  == the bacteriological and clinical findings in 19 pediatric patients with intracranial abscess are presented. ten children presented with subdural empyema  and nine had brain abscess. sinusitis was present in 14 children, and dental abscess in two. the abscess was located in the frontal and parietal area in seven instances each, and in the temporal area in five. anaerobic organisms alone were  recovered in 12 (63%) of the patients (including eight with subdural empyema and  four with brain abscess), aerobic bacteria alone were present in two children (11%), and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were present in five (26%) patients. there were 43 anaerobic isolates (2.3 per specimen). the predominant anaerobes were anaerobic gram-positive cocci (16 isolates); bacteroides sp. (10,  including two b. fragilis); fusobacterium sp. (nine isolates); and actinomyces sp. (five isolates). a total of eight aerobic isolates (0.4 per specimen), including five gram-positive cocci and three haemophilus sp., were recovered. antimicrobial therapy was administered to all patients. five patients, four with  sinusitis and subdural empyema and one with sinusitis and brain abscess, did not  respond to antimicrobial therapy and aspiration of the abscess, and required surgical drainage of their inflamed sinuses. these findings indicate the major role of anaerobic organisms in the polymicrobial etiology of intracranial abscess in children.

TI  == lectin-like constituents of foods which react with components of serum, saliva, and streptococcus mutans.
AB  == hot and cold aqueous extracts were prepared from 22 commonly ingested fruits, vegetables, and seeds. when tested by agar diffusion, extracts from 13 and 10 of  the foods formed precipitin bands with samples of normal rabbit serum and human saliva, respectively; extracts from four of the foods also reacted with antigen extracts of strains of streptococcus mutans. when added to rabbit antiserum, extracts from 18 of 21 foods tested inhibited reactivity with antigen extracts derived from s. mutans mt3. extracts from 16 foods agglutinated whole s. mutans cells, whereas those from 10 foods agglutinated human erythrocytes of blood types a and b. the lectin-like activities of extracts which reacted with human saliva were studied further. pretreatment of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) beads with extracts of bananas, coconuts, carrots, alfalfa, and sunflower seeds markedly reduced the subsequent adsorption of s. mutans mt3. pretreatment of s-ha with banana extract also strongly inhibited adsorption of s. mutans h12 and s. sanguis c1, but it had little effect on attachment of actinomyces naeslundii l13  or a. viscosus ly7. absorption experiments indicated that the component(s) in banana extract responsible for inhibiting streptococcal adsorption to s-ha was identical to that which bound to human erythrocytes. the banana hemagglutinin exhibited highest activity between ph 7 and 8, and it was inhibited by high concentrations of glucosamine, galactosamine, and, to a lesser extent, mannosamine. other sugars tested had no effect. the selective bacterial adsorption-inhibiting effect noted for banana extract was also observed in studies with purified lectins. thus, pretreating s-ha with wheat germ agglutinin  and concanavalin a inhibited adsorption of s. mutans mt3 cells, whereas peanut agglutinin, ulex agglutinin, dolichos agglutinin, and soybean agglutinin had little effect; none of these lectins affected attachment of a. viscosus ly7. collectively, the observations suggest that many foods contain lectins which can  interact with components of human saliva and s. mutans cells. because of their potential to influence host-parasite interactions in the mouth and elsewhere in the gastrointestinal canal, these reactions warrant further study.

TI  == effect of bacterial aggregation on the adherence of oral streptococci to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == several in vitro assay systems to measure the adherence of human dental plaque bacteria to solid surfaces such as teeth, glass, and hydroxyapatite have been published. in many studies a variety of macromolecular solutes have been used to  study the adherence process. often these solutes are able to aggregate the test bacterial and thus may alter the outcome of adherence experiments. in this study, the effects of the aggregation of streptococcus sanguis on adherence to spheroidal hydroxyapatite is described. adherence of preformed aggregates and of  bacteria which were aggregating during the adherence reaction was examined. bacteria were aggregated with whole saliva, concanavalin a, and wheat germ lectin. further effects of the coaggregation of s. mitis and actinomyces viscosus to saliva-coated spheroidal hydroxyapatite are presented. these studies suggest that formation of large aggregates resulted in a decrease in the numbers of organisms which adhered. in contrast, the formation of small aggregates actually  increased the numbers of bacteria that adhered. all increases in adherent bacteria occurred at low concentrations of aggregating substance in which visible bacterial aggregation was not evident. the data indicate that adequate dose-response experiments must be performed to ensure that solutes used as probes to study adherence mechanisms do not affect the adherence simply as a result of aggregation of the test microorganisms.

TI  == interference of secretory immunoglobulin a with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the potential of secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (ha) beads. the importance of specific s-iga antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral s-iga, polymeric myeloma iga, or preabsorbed s-iga. specific antibody molecules bound at the ha surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two streptococcus sanguis strains. in contrast, ha-bound s-iga antibodies inhibited the sorption of streptococcus mitior and streptococcus salivarius. the same was true for streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to ha. comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of iga or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with s-iga or myeloma iga added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarius, and glucose-grown s. mutans was partly attributable to functions of s-iga antibodies. under the in vitro conditions of the study, s-iga antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown s. mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii to ha. the results indicated that s-iga can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to ha by several different functions.

TI  == effect of human saliva on glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == we examined the effects of human whole salivary supernatant and parotid fluid on  glucose uptake by streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. the following three effects of saliva were observed: (i) inhibition of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), (ii) promotion of a transient, rapid (0 to 30 s) burst of glucose uptake (s. mutans, s. sanguis), and (iii) enhancement of glucose uptake (s. mitis, a. viscosus, s. aureus, e. coli). we observed no differences between the effects of whole salivary supernatant and the effects of parotid fluid. heat treatment (80 degrees c, 10 min) of saliva or the addition of dithiothreitol abolished inhibition of glucose uptake. supplementation of saliva  with h(2)o(2) potentiated inhibition of glucose uptake. s. mitis and a. viscosus, which were stimulated by saliva alone, were inhibited by h(2)o(2)-supplemented saliva; 50% inhibition of glucose uptake by s. mutans and s. mitis required ca. 10 mum h(2)o(2) in 50% (vol/vol) saliva. loss of the inhibitory action of saliva  occurred at about 5% (vol/vol) saliva. supplementation of saliva dilutions with scn(-) and h(2)o(2) extended the inhibitory activity to solutions containing ca.  0.2% (vol/vol) saliva. we suggest that the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system is responsible for the inhibitory activity of saliva reported here. furthermore, we concluded that lactoperoxidase and scn(-) are present in saliva specimens in concentrations that exceed minimal inhibitory levels by factors of ca. 500 and 10 to 20, respectively. the resistance of a. viscosus, s. aureus, and e. coli to the inhibitory potential of  saliva alone was probably due to the production of catalase by these organisms. the resistance of s. mitis may have been due to special effects of saliva on h(2)o(2) accumulation by this organism compared with s. mutans and s. sanguis. the basis of saliva-dependent enhancement of glucose uptake and the basis of promotion of a transient, rapid burst of glucose uptake are unknown. the role of  the salivary lactoperoxidase-scn(-)-h(2)o(2) system in the oral microbial ecosystem is discussed.

TI  == differences in the adsorptive behavior of human strains of actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces naeslundii to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == human strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii differ in the time of their appearance and in their patterns of colonization in the mouth. strains of these organisms were found to differ in their abilities to adsorb to saliva-treated hydroxyapatite (s-ha) surfaces, thought to mimic the teeth, and these differences parallel their patterns of colonizing the dentition. thus, strains of a. viscosus tended to adsorb in higher numbers to hydroxyapatite (ha)  treated with saliva of older children and adults than with saliva of younger children (ages 6 to 11). these salivary changes may account for the increased frequency with which this organism can be isolated from the mouths of children as they grow older. in contrast, strains of a. naeslundii and streptococcus mutans did not show a preference for attaching to either type of s-ha. strains of a. viscosus also generally adsorbed in higher numbers than a. naeslundii to ha treated with adult saliva; this may explain why higher proportions of a. viscosus are usually recoverable from the teeth of adults, even though a. naeslundii is generally present in higher proportions in saliva. significant variation was noted between strains and between saliva samples collected from different donors. the differences in adsorptive behavior of strains of these species suggests that  they are binding to different receptors in the salivary glycoprotein coating on ha surfaces. adsorption of a. naeslundii atcc 12104 was enhanced when s-ha was pretreated with neuraminidase, but this had little effect upon the adsorption of  other actinomyces strains tested. adsorption of strain atcc 12104 to s-ha was also strongly inhibited by fructose and sucrose and weakly inhibited by glucose,  maltose, galactose, and lactose. however, other strains of a. naeslundii tested were affected less, or not at all, by these sugars. adsorption of two strains of  a. viscosus was not affected by any of the sugars or amines tested.

AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == method for the lysis of gram-positive, asporogenous bacteria with lysozyme.
AB  == a method developed for the lysis of oral streptococci that employed the action of lysozyme suspended in dilute tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane-hydrochloride buffer containing polyethylene glycol has been adapted for use with lactobacilli, actinomycetes, propionibacteria, and pediococci. most of the cellular deoxyribonucleic acid was liberated from many strains of bacteria usually thought to be lysozyme resistant. the major observations were as follows: (i) supplementation of the growth medium with l-threonine, l-lysine, or both frequently produced cells that were more susceptible to lysis by lysozyme; (ii) glucose-containing media produced cells that were more easily lysed than those from cultures grown on other substrates; (iii) polyethylene glycol not only served as an osmotic stabilizer, it also enhanced the extent of lysis; and (iv) dilute tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane buffer was superior to the buffer systems  most commonly employed in published muramidase-based lysis techniques. stationary-phase cells of lactobacillus casei and streptococcus mutans were more  easily lysed than those isolated from log-phase cultures. the method as detailed  in this report should be generally applicable for the lysis of gram-positive, asporogenous bacteria.

AB  == the changes induced in the bacteriology of the gingival sulcus were evaluated as  part of a study considering the keratinizing potential of the sulcular epithelium when bacterial plaque was essentially eliminated. two rhesus monkeys were scaled  and placed on a daily therapeutic regimen which included a prophylaxis, systemic  tetracycline, and topical chlorhexidine. over the 40 day experimental period and  74 days post-therapy, subgingival plaque samples were taken periodically. the plaque samples were cultured anaerobically and aerobically to determine the predominant bacterial flora. the total cultivable bacterial flora decreased from  initial levels by greater than 99.9% with the antibacterial therapy. the flora shifted with therapy from one dominated by anaerobic organisms, including bacteroides melaninogenicus (18%) and fusobacterium species (13.9%), to a flora dominated by organisms growing aerobically. during treatment b. melaninogenicus and fusobacterium species were not detected in any sample. after cessation of all therapy the anaerobes increased to dominance again, but b. melaninogenicus remained undetectable through 74 days post-therapy.

TI  == relationship between host age and susceptibility to oral colonization by actinomyces viscosus in sprague-dawley rats.
AB  == the colonization of actinomyces viscosus strain ny-1r on the molar teeth of conventional and ex-germfree rats of various ages fed either a high-sucrose diet, a high-glucose diet, or laboratory chow was studied. conventional rats directly after weaning and up to 30 days of age are less susceptible to experimental infection by strain ny-1r than are older rats regardless of the test diet. the relationship between host age and susceptibility to infection is also demonstrable in ex-germfree rats fed a high-sucose diet. host factors responsible for the differences in susceptibility were investigated. the results from these studies do not implicate host antibodies, host indigenous flora, or host saliva.  in other studies, it was demonstrated that within the mouths of rats, strain ny-1r preferentially colonizes in the pits and fissures of the molar teeth rather than on the dorsum of the tongue or on the vestibular mucosa. in short-term experiments, it was found that strain ny-1r attaches to the first molars of 40-day-old conventional rats to a greater extent than it attaches to the first molars of 20-day-old rats. the differences in attachment and subsequent colonization of strain ny-1r in 20- and 40-day-old rats may be related to the varying amounts of the reduced enamel epithelium and connective tissue present in the fissures of the molar teeth.

TI  == periodontal therapy in humans. i. microbiological and clinical effects of a single course of periodontal scaling and root planing, and of adjunctive tetracycline therapy.
AB  == the present results showed that maarked and long-lasting changes in the subgingival microflora associated with periodontal disease could be achieved by a single course of periodontal treatment. immediately following therapy, the total  number of subgingival organisms decreased 10- to 100-fold and the proportions of  cultivable gram negative organisms and anaerobic organisms generally decreased 3- to 4-fold or more. after treatment, most periodontal pockets were populated by a  scant microflora predominated by facultative actinomyces and streptococcus species. the kinetics of the subgingival bacterial recolonization revealed that the total cell counts and the proportions of spirochetes and capnocytophaga species did not reach their pretreatment levels even after 6 months. other gram negative anaerobic species returned to pretreatment proportions after 3 to 6 months. several gram positive species exhibited higher posttreatment than pretreatment proportions throughout the 6 months study. the microbiological shifts paralleled significant changes in the clinical status of the periodontal tissues. following therapy, the periodontal pocket depths decreased generally 1 to 4 mm, the gingival inflammatory index, the gingival fluid flow, and the suppurative index were generally lower, and nine of 33 test pockets examined showed apposition of alveolar bone. the microbiological and clinical changes described were exhibited by two patients treated with periodontal scaling and root planing alone and by two patients treated with the adjunctive use of systemic tetracycline therapy. in two other patients, mechanical periodontal therapy only slightly reduced the total number of subgingival organisms and the proportions of spirochetes and other gram negative anaerobic rods. a shift in the subgingival microbial composition was achieved in these two patients after tetracycline therapy. the following model for treatment of periodontal disease is proposed: (1) conventional therapy including thorough periodontal scaling and root planing; (2) monitoring the subgingival flora and the clinical course; and (3) use of antimicrobial therapy in refractory cases. further studies are needed  to develop means for rapid identification of refractory patients, and to determine the optimal antimicrobial agent, the optimal route of administration, and the optimal dosage regime.

TI  == subgingival microflora of periodontal patients on tetracycline therapy.
AB  == samples of subgingival plaque were collected from periodontal patients receiving  two different tetracycline treatment regimens following conventional periodontal  therapy. four patients had received an oral dose of 1000 mg/day for 2 weeks and nine had received 1000 mg/day for 1 week followed by 250 mg/day for extended time periods. the latter regimen is similar so that commonly prescribed for the chronic skin disease, acne vulgaris. taxonomic characterization of plaque isolates indicated that the predominant organisms cultured from both treatment groups were species of streptococcus and the branching, filamentous gram-positive rods, actinomyces and rothia. a much greater microbial complexity was observed among the flora isolated from patients taking 250 mg/day. the latter group harbored many of the fastidious gram-negative organisms presently implicated in the etiology of periodontal disease. all bacterial strains isolated were tested for resistance to tetracycline by replica-plating cultures on an agar medium containing two-fold dilutions of the antibiotic. streptococcus, veillonella and neisseria were the bacterial genera found to be consistently resistant to tetracycline, with minimum inhibitory concentrations as high as 128 micrograms/ml. among the actinomyces, selection for antibiotic resistance was common only within a single species, a. odontolyticus. however, a viscosus strains isolated at 54% of the subgingival flora from one patient did demonstrate an intermediate resistance level, growing on concentrations up to 8 micrograms/ml. tetracycline resistance was shown by a variety of gram-negative rods isolated from the low dosage group. although a minimum number of patients were studied, extensive microbial analyses of the predominating subgingival bacteria indicated that the goal of tetracycline therapy was achieved during the  2-week therapy period at 1000 mg/day.

TI  == specificity of coaggregation reactions between human oral streptococci and strains of actinomyces viscosus or actinomyces naeslundii.
AB  == coaggregation reactions between actinomycete and streptococcal cells occurred frequently when human strains of actinomyces viscosus or a. naeslundii were mixed with human isolates of streptococcus sanguis or s. mitis, but were infrequent with other oral actinomycetes and streptococci. two groups of actinomycetes and four groups of streptococci were defined by the patterns of their coaggregation reactions and by the ability of beta-linked galactosides (i.e., lactose) to reverse these reactions. coaggregations occurred by one of the following three kinds to cell-cell interactions: (i) coaggregation that was blocked by heating the streptococcus but not the actinomycete and was not reversed by lactose; (ii)  coaggregation that was blocked by heating the actinomycete but not the streptococcus and was reversed by lactose; and (iii) coaggregation that was blocked only by heating both cell types. the latter reaction was a combination of the first two since lactose reversed coaggregation between heated streptococci and unheated actinomycetes but did not reverse coaggregations between unheated streptococci and heated actinomycetes. cells that could be heat inactivated also  were inactivated by amino group acetylation or protease digestion, whereas cells  that were unaffected by heat were not inactivated by these treatments. coaggregation reactions of each kind were ca2+ dependent and insensitive to dextranase treatment. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that human strains of a. viscosus and a. naeslundii coaggregate with strains of s. sanguis and s. mitis by a system of specific cell surface interactions between protein or glycoprotein receptors on one cell type and carbohydrates on the other type.

TI  == stability of the resident microflora and the bacteriocinogeny of streptococcus mutans as factors affecting its establishment in specific pathogen-free rats.
AB  == the outcome of the experimental implantation of streptococcus mutans strains in humans and animals is unpredictable, and neither success nor failure can be explained. it seems logical to assume that, apart from dietary and host factors,  the characteristics of the s. mutans strain involved and those of the resident plaque microflora are important in colonization. for example, previous work in this laboratory suggested that bacteriocin production accounts at least in part for the establishment of an invading bacterium in a microbial ecosystem. in the present study, a complex specific pathogen-free ny plaque ecosystem was obtained  by the inoculation of specific pathogen-free rats with actinomyces viscosus ny1 and s. sanguis ny101, and the establishment of s. mutans in such rats was then examined. it was found that bacteriocinogenic (bac(+)) strains generally colonized in much higher proportions than non-bacteriocinogenic (bac(-)) strains. moreover, the longer the delay in introducing s. mutans, the poorer was its establishment. shortly after inoculation of strains ny1 and ny101, there is probably a transient state in which microbial equilibrium has not been reached, but later the specific pathogen-free ny system attains a stable climax community  which more strongly resists invaders. the ability of a number of s. mutans strains to establish in such a climax community was then examined, and it was found that bac(+) strains generally established at a higher level than did bac(-) strains. in summary, it was concluded that, although the bac(+) state is an important property in the successful invasion of a plaque by s. mutans, the stability of the resident microflora is also an important factor.

AB  == strains of streptococcus mutans of four genetic groups and five serotypes, and strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, and a. viscosus, were found to bind blood group-reactive (bgr) mucin isolated from whole human saliva. the bacteria studied bound mucins with blood type a or b reactivity to a similar extent, suggesting that the carbohydrate moieties responsible for the a and b antigenic determinants were not involved. the organisms studied appeared to bind different fractions of bgr mucin molecules because preparations  absorbed with cells of a given oral species no longer contained bgr molecules which bound to homologous organisms but still possessed bgr components which bound to varying degrees to other bacteria. differences were even noted among s.  mutans strains belonging to different genetic groups and serological types. immunoglobulins could not be detected in the mucin preparations, and addition of  anti-human immunoglobulin a (iga), igg, or igm serum to reaction mixtures did not affect binding. mucin pretreated with periodate or iodoacetate no longer bound to s. mutans h12 cells, suggesting that carbohydrate moieties and sulfhydryl groups  played an essential role. active cell metabolism was not required for bgr mucin binding; however, pretreatment of h12 cells with periodate or heat (100 degrees c for 15 min) reduced binding. mucin labeled with [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate appeared to bind to s. mutans h12 cells comparably to untreated mucin; the binding also appeared to be specific because less than 15% of the labeled material became bound when incubated with an excess of streptococci. binding of [(14)c]phenyl isothiocyanate-labeled mucin was not affected by neutral sugars tested or by preparations of c antigen, glycerol teichoic acid, dextran, or crude glucosyltransferase. however, binding was inhibited by several amines. bgr salivary mucins are present in the acquired pellicle covering teeth; the ability  of bacteria to selectively bind such components suggest that they may serve as receptor molecules involved in the attachment of bacteria to teeth.

TI  == bacteriology of human experimental gingivitis: effect of plaque and gingivitis score.
AB  == the plaque flora isolated from discrete dentogingival sites during a human gingivitis experiment was analyzed as a function of the plaque score and of the gingivitis score. when the gingivitis score was plotted as a function of the plaque score, a nonbleeding gingivitis was associated with a proportional increase in the actinomyces sp. at the expense of the streptococcus sp. in particular, the percentage of actinomyces israelii increased significantly, while the percent streptococcus sanguis decreased significantly. a. israelii also increased significantly when a bleeding gingivitis developed. when the plaque score was plotted as a function of the gingivitis score, a. israelii increased significantly as the nonbleeding gingivitis developed, but a. viscosus and bacteroides melaninogenicus increased significantly when the bleeding gingivitis  developed. the availability of a sufficient number of plaques with a plaque score of 2.0 permitted the examination of the interrelationship of gingivitis and flora minus the effect of plaque biomass. the bacteriological profile showed that when  bleeding occurred, the levels and proportions of a. viscosus and b. melaninogenicus increased significantly. these findings raise the possibility that proportional changes in the gingival plaque flora may uniquely contribute to the development of gingival inflammation in this experimental model.

AB  == several cationic, mixed and amphoteric surfactants were tested for their antimicrobial activity and ability to inhibit the formation of in vitro plaque by oral microorganisms. all had antimicrobial activity against actinomyces viscosus. actinomyces naeslundii and streptococcus mutans. cationic surfactants were comparable to chlorhexidine in antimicrobial activity but were less effective in  inhibiting plaque formation. amphoteric surfactants were less effective than other detergents in antibacterial activity and had very limited capacity for the  inhibition of plaque formation. comparison of drug structure provides evidence that surfactant substantivity to saliva-coated enamel is a cation active process. saliva was found to have an antagonistic effect on the activity of cetylpyridinium chloride but not on triburon.

TI  == mechanism of coaggregation between actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v and streptococcus sanguis 34 coaggregate by a mechanism which is not inhibited by 1 m nacl, is dextran independent, requires calcium, is  ph dependent with an optimum at ph 8.0 to 8.5, and appears to require the interaction of a protein or glycoprotein on a. viscosus with a carbohydrate on s. sanguis. the coaggregation is inhibited more than 80% by 0.01 m lactose, 0.02 m beta-methyl-d-galactoside, or 0.05 m d-galactose; inhibition of coaggregation was less than 10% in 0.1 m alpha-methyl-d-galactoside, melibiose, maltose, cellobiose, sucrose, and a number of monosaccharides. at very high concentrations of enzyme, protease from s. griseus destroyed the reactive site on a. viscosus but not on s. sanguis. both were totally resistant to dextranase. periodate (0.01 m; ph 4) inactivated both bacteria. the ability of s. sanguis to coaggregate with a. viscosus was not destroyed by phenol-water extraction at 65 degrees c for 15 min. when the bacteria were cultured under specified conditions, the coaggregation was highly reproducible. under the same conditions, t14av, the avirulent mutant of a. viscosus t14v, did not coaggregate with s. sanguis 34. electron microscopic studies of coaggregates, labeled immunochemically with antibody to a. viscosus, indicated that fibrils on a. viscosus may be involved in the coaggregation.

TI  == factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii during growth and in  washed cell suspensions.
AB  == various factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. when the ph of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. when the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture ph values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. adjusting the final ph of these cultures to below 5.5 with hcl caused the cells to aggregate. cells from unsupplemented cultures with final ph values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at ph values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees c) occurred rapidly at ph values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher ph values. aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low ph and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. low ph values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.

TI  == inhibitory effects of extracellular products from oral bacteria on human fibroblasts and stimulated lymphocytes.
AB  == extracellular products of 12 strains of streptococcus mutans and 5 additional species of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation of fibroblastoid cells (hela and av3) and blast transformation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal individuals. products from s. mutans strains aht and bht, streptococcus intermedius, and actinomyces viscosus inhibited [3h]thymidine uptake by fibroblastoid cells and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. products from s. mutans e49, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces naeslundii inhibited blast transformation of human lymphocytes but did not significantly inhibit the growth  of fibroblastoid cells. preparations from s. intermedius gave the greatest inhibitory activity against both target cell types; initial characterization of this preparation suggested a single factor active in both assays, in that the heat lability and sephadex g-200 elution profile were similar for the inhibitory  activity seen with the two cell types. the molecular weight of the inhibitor, estimated by gel filtration on sephadex g-200 and ultragel aca34, was approximately 160,000. the results strongly suggest that oral bacteria produce heat-labile substances that interfere with fibroblast proliferation and alter the lymphocytic immunological response.

TI  == binding of glucosyltransferase and glucan synthesis by streptococcus mutans and other bacteria.
AB  == lyophilized and heat-treated cells from the seven serotypes of streptococcus mutans were examined for their ability to bind added insoluble-product glucosyl-transferase (gtase) and to synthesize cell-associated glucan from [(14)c]sucrose. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g did not synthesize any more additional glucan than did the controls after exposure to gtase. these cells, however, synthesized four- to eightfold-greater quantities of glucan than  did the cells of the remaining serotypes. lyophilized cells of serotypes b, c, d, e, and f synthesized two- to threefold-greater quantities of glucan after exposure to gtase than did the controls without added enzyme. lyophilized cells of serotypes a and g synthesized 6- to 10-fold-greater quantities of glucan than  did heat-treated cells of the same strain after binding of gtase. lyophilized cells of the remaining serotypes synthesized only 1.6- to 3.3-fold-greater quantities of glucan than did the heat-treated cells. these results demonstrate that heat treatment to inactivate cell-associated gtase does not create additional gtase binding sites in s. mutans and that serotypes a and g are considerably more active in cell-associated glucan synthesis than cells of the other five serotypes. ten species of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from five genera which do not produce in vitro plaque synthesized 10- to 100-fold-less glucan than did the s. mutans strains after exposure to gtase. of these species, s. sanguis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii synthesized the largest quantities of glucan. three mutant strains of s. mutans which possess a reduced ability for in vitro adherence but do agglutinate with glucan or dextran synthesized only one-third as much glucan after binding of gtase as the control. these results are discussed in relation to in vitro and in vivo plaque development and the agglutination of s. mutans. the results support earlier findings which indicate that the presence of bacterial species other than s. mutans in smooth-surface dental plaque is due in part to contact of the cells with glucan in the developing plaque and not to the binding of cell-free gtase and the in situ synthesis of glucan. the results obtained with these representative strains of the seven serotypes of s. mutans may not apply to the same extent to other strains within the serotypes.

(1) the enzyme with pi 10.2 seems to be a specific glucosidase; it possesses a high activity of the cell wall lysis and lacks a proteolytic activity. (2) the enzymes with pi 9.2 and 9.0 are, apparently, specific lytic proteases; they display both lytic and proteolytic activities. (3) the enzymes with pi 10.0, 9.5, 5.7 and 4.2 are, presumably, non-specific lytic proteases; they have a low lytic activity and a high proteolytic activity.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

AB  == a study on the predominant cultivable microorganisms harbored in the base of deep periodontal pockets of eight patients aged 34-48 years was carried out using the  roll tube culture technique. from a total of 475 isolates, 425 (89.5%) were obligate anaerobes, 356(74.9%) were gram-negative, and 441(92.8%) were categorized as rods. bacteroides melaninogenicus and fusobacterium nucleatum constituted the majority of the isolates in seven samples, but their mutual proportions differed considerably between the samples. one sample was dominated by actinomyces species. some periodontopathic potentials of the predominating gram-negative rods are summarized.

TI  == interaction of inflammatory cells and oral microorganisms. iii. modulation of rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocyte hydrolase release response to actinomyces viscosus and streptococcus mutans by immunoglobulins and complement.
AB  == in the absence of antiserum, rabbit polymorphonuclear leukocytes (pmns) released  lysosomal enzymes in response to actinomyces viscosus (19246) but not to streptococcus mutans (6715). antibodies had a marked modulating influence on these reactions. pmn hydrolase release was significantly enhanced to both organisms when specific rabbit antiserum and isolated immunoglobulin g (igg) were included in the incubations. immune complex f(ab')2 fragments of igg directed against s. mutans agglutinated bacteria. immune complexes consisting of s. mutans and f(ab')2 fragments of igg directed against this organism were not effective as bacteria-igg complexes in stimulating pmn release. the intensity of the release response to bacteria-igg complexes was also diminished when pmns were preincubated with isolated fc fragments derived from igg. fresh serum as a source of complement components had no demonstrable effect on pmn release either alone or in conjuction with antiserum in these experiments. these data may be relevant  to the mechanisms and consequences of the interaction of pmns and plaque bacteria in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease.

TI  == initial colonization of teeth in monkeys as related to diet.
AB  == the initial phases of plaque development on nonretentive tooth surfaces were studied bacteriologically in macaca irus monkeys fed by stomach tube and provided with various oral supplements. except for the oral implantation of streptococcus  mutans in some of the animals, the oral flora was not changed prior to the studies. dental plaque was allowed to develop on initially cleaned tooth surfaces for 3 to 5 h. plaque samples were collected and cultured on a number of selective and nonselective agar media, and several hundred isolates from each sample were isolated and identified. the numerically predominant organisms in initial plaque  were s. mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and actinomyces viscosus. additional organisms regularly found, but usually in smaller numbers, were streptococcus mitior and a group of fastidious gram-negative rods including haemophilus species, eikenella corrodens, and actinobacillus actinomycetem-comitans. the colonization of s. mutans was dependent on sucrose and occurred at the expense of s. sanguis. in these experiments s. mutans accounted for 25 to 65% of the primary plaque formers. all other species encountered colonized the teeth irrespective of the diet. it is postulated that the early sucrose-dependent establishment of s. mutans directly on the enamel pellicle plays a key role in the development of a cariogenic plaque.

TI  == susceptibility of some plaque microorganisms to chemotherapeutic agents.
AB  == investigators have used chemotherapeutic agents topically for plaque control without knowing the drug concentration necessary to inhibit the growth of odontopathic microorganisms. s mutans, s sanguis, a viscosus and a naeslundii are important components of the plaque flora. the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic) and minimal bactericidal concentrations (mbc) of niddamycin, vancomycin, bacitracin, and kanamycin were determined for each organism in liquid culture. these antibiotics were selected because of their low absorption from the gastrointestinal tract. niddamycin, vancomycin, and bacitracin had the lowest mic, from 0.2 to 10 units/ml. kanamycin was inhibitory only at much higher concentrations (130 to 500 units/ml). the corresponding mbc was generally higher  than the mic. a viscosus was the most resistant organism tested. these data are important in designing controlled release devices for delivering a suitable antibiotic on a continuous basis intraorally.

TI  == dextran-mediated interbacterial aggregation between dextran-synthesizing streptococci and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans bind to the surface of actinomyces viscosus, producing large microbial aggregates. aggregates form rapidly and are not easily dissociated by vigorous mixing. the binding is mediated by dextran. glucose-grown streptococci will not aggregate unless they are first mixed with high-molecular-weight dextran. aggregation is induced with dextrans isolated from leuconostoc, s. sanguis, or s. mutans. sucrose-grown streptococci will adhere to  a. viscosus without the addition of an exogenous source of dextran. a. viscosus will bind dextran and then bind glucose-grown streptococci. aggregation occurs over a wide ph range and is dependent on cations. the aggregating activity of a.  viscosus is both protease and heat sensitive. the aggregating activity of s. sanguis is heat stable but sensitive to dextranase.

TI  == dextranases from oral bacteria: inhibition of water-insoluble glucan production and adherence to smooth surfaces by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the effect of dextranases (ec 3.2.1.11) from the oral isolates actinomyces israelii and bacteroides ochraceus on water-insoluble glucan production by the streptococcus mutans dextransucrase (ec 2.4.1.5) and sucrose-dependent adherence  to smooth glass surfaces by s. mutans was studied. collection on membrane filters of water-insoluble polysaccharides synthesized from radioactive sucrose was used  to demonstrate the marked sensitivity of insoluble glucan formation to the presence of dextranase. concentrations of a. israelii dextranase as low as 0.002  u/ml inhibited insoluble glucan formation by 60%. similar results were obtained the the b. ochraceus enzyme. an assay for sucrose-stimulated adherence of s. mutans to smooth surfaces involved attachment of radioactively labeled nongrowing cells to the bottom of glass scintillation vials. this facile and sensitive assay was utilized to demonstrate that sucrose-dependent adherence was affected by low  levels of dextranase from either a. israelii or b. ochraceus. enzyme at 0.005 u/ml reduced adherence of s. mutans by 80%. treatment of s. mutans cells previously attached to glass with low concentrations of the dextranases resulted  in removal of 50% to 60% of the bacteria. the results indicate that dextranase-producing oral bacteria may affect sucrose-dependent colonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface and offer a possible explanation for both the difficulties involved in implanting this bacterium into the human mouth and the limited intraoral transmission of s. mutans from one tooth surface to another.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == interdental localization of streptococcus mutans as related to dental caries experience.
AB  == the consistency of colonization of tooth surfaces by streptococcus mutans was studied by sampling four approximal molar surfaces of 9- to 13-year-old children  at weekly intervals. it was found that surfaces which harbored detectable levels  of the organism tended to be consistently positive, whereas surfaces which were free of detectable levels of the organism also tended to remain that way. of the  total surfaces studied, 81.7% were either consistently positive or consistently negative throughout five consecutive weekly samplings. these data indicate that s. mutans does not uniformly colonize the surfaces of teeth. the consistent localized patterns of colonization observed suggest that s. mutans is not readily transmitted from one tooth surface to another within the mouth. scanning electron microscope observations revealed that s. mutans colonized the teeth of monoinfected gnotobiotic rats as discrete localized colonies, whereas strains of  actinomyces naeslundii colonized in a more generalized manner. efforts to sterilize tooth surfaces by application of iodine solution indicated that the populations of s. mutans on some surfaces could be affected for at least 11 to 13 weeks after treatment. the number of tooth surfaces colonized by detectable proportions of s. mutans was found to be far lower in a group of 18 children from charlotte, n.c., with a low past caries experience than in 20 children from danvers, mass., with a high caries experience. the number of tooth surfaces infected with s. mutans therefore strongly paralleled the caries experience of these populations.

AB  == the indirect fluorescent-antibody technique was employed in an attempt to develop a rapid method of identification of corynebacterium vaginale. six reference strains and ten clinical isolates selected on the basis of morphology and conventional biochemical tests were compared. antisera were prepared in rabbits against the six reference strains. the most satisfactory antiserum was that prepared using strain 14018 grown diphasically (14018 di) as the antigen. certain of the antisera did exhibit a cross-reacting titer when reacted against corynebacterium diptheriae, corynebacterium xerosis, or lactobacillus acidophilus. however, antisera adsorbed with these bacteria did not exhibit a significant decrease in titer when reacted against the homologous strain. various other species of corynebacterium as well as species of nocardia, actinomyces, hemophilus, and streptococcus did not fluoresce with the antisera. a specific antiserum was prepared by adsorbing anti-14018 di with l. acidophilus. the adsorption removed the cross-reacting antibody but did not affect the staining reaction with c. vaginale strains. all reference strains and clinical isolates characterized as c. vaginale gave a definite positive reaction with the adsorbed  anti-14018 di. the specificity of the reactions was assessed by adsorbing the antiserum with the homologous strain. the data suggest that the indirect staining method will be of value in the rapid presumptive identification of c. vaginale.

TI  == method for preclinical evaluation of antiplaque agents.
AB  == a preclinical method for the evaluation of antibacterial agents for use against dental plaques associated with caries and periodontal disease is proposed. the method is applicable to screening agents and to defining, in vitro, the minimal conditions required for maximal antiplaque effect. as a model of antiplaque agents, chlorhexidine was assessed in vitro against preformed plaques of microorganisms conducive to dental caries and periodontal disease. the agent was  bactericidal to plaques of nine strains of streptococcus mutans and one strain of actinomyces viscosus when used in a single treatment for 20 min at 2 x 10(-1)%, in two 2-min treatments on the same day, or in daily 2-min treatments at this same concentration. using the last of these experimental conditions, we then tested chlorhexidine in vivo by topical application to the maxillary teeth of infected hamsters and found it to be effective in controlling plaques of s. mutans and a. viscosus.

TI  == rapid method for characterization of actinomycetes by cell wall composition.
AB  == to achieve a rapid identification of the cell wall components of actinomycetes, several modifications of the procedure of cummins and harris were developed. purified cell walls were prepared by extraction of whole cells with 0.1 n naoh. a 2-hr 2 n hcl hydrolysate was prepared for identification of sugars. a 2-hr 6 n hcl hydrolysate was prepared for amino acid analysis. two-dimensional paper chromatography was run on 19-cm papers. total time required for a single analysis was approximately 24 hr. this procedure gave qualitative results which were completely satisfactory for differentiation of certain species in the genus actinomyces and in related genera.

TI  == toxic properties of the cell wall of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the biological activity of odontomyces viscosus, which has been reported to cause periodontal disease in hamsters, was examined. the microorganism was cultured anaerobically in brain heart infusion broth, and the cells were harvested. the washed cells were injected intradermally into the abdomen of rabbits. after 72 hr, a well-defined, firm, raised nodule (about 1.0 by 1.5 cm) with an erythematous border was seen at the injection site. suspensions of cell wall and  cytoplasmic material were injected intradermally, and the lesions appeared only at the site of cell wall injection. the cell walls, which were then treated with  trypsin, pepsin, and ribonuclease, again produced the characteristic lesion. these nodular dermal lesions persisted for a minimal time of 10 days. the enzymatically treated cell walls were then hydrolyzed with 1 n hcl, and such hydrolysis up to 1 hr failed to alter the toxic activity of the cell walls. similar dermal nodular lesions were obtained by injection of enzymatically treated cell walls of strains of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus groups b, c, e, f, k, lactobacillus casei, and actinomyces israelii. treatment with hot and cold trichloroacetic acid solutions and proteolytic enzymes, or with formamide, yielded insoluble fractions which produced the characteristic nodular lesions. the size of the lesion resulting from injection of these fractions was proportional to the amount of the injected material. the active fraction, which does not appear susceptible to hydrolysis by lysozyme, is thought to be cell wall mucopeptide. histological studies showed skin abscesses due to the toxic reaction; however, in addition to the acute inflammatory reaction, there was local eosinophilia.

TI  == unmineralized fossil bacteria.
AB  == unmineralized bacterial cells, mostly micrococcus sp., but including also streptococcus sp. and actinomyces sp., were found in enormous numbers in lake beds of the newark canyon formation of early cretaceous age, eureka county, nevada. the micrococci are black, and have an average diameter about 0.5 micro. similar black micrococci (0.4 to 0.7 micro) were found in profusion in the bottom mud of green lake, new york. about 80 percent of this mud consists of minute idiomorphic calcite crystals and about 20 percent of these contain enormous numbers of the black micrococci. it is suggested that the early cretaceous bacterial cells owe their preservation to occlusion in calcite crystals that grew in a black, bacterial mud in a meromictic lake in which part of the newark canyon formation accumulated.
