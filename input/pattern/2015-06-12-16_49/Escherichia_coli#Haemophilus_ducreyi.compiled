TI  - Development and Validation of a High-throughput Cell-based Screen to Identify Activators of a Bacterial Two-component Signal Transduction System.
AB  - CpxRA is a two-component signal transduction system (2CSTS) found in many drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. In response to periplasmic stress, CpxA auto-phosphorylates and donates a phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator, CpxR. Phosphorylated CpxR (CpxR-P) upregulates genes involved in membrane repair and downregulates multiple genes that encode virulence factors, which are trafficked across the cell membrane. Mutants that constitutively activate CpxRA in Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium and Haemophilus ducreyi are avirulent in mice and humans, respectively. Thus, activation of CpxRA has high potential as a novel antimicrobial/antivirulence strategy. Using a series of Escherichia coli strains containing a CpxR-P-responsive lacZ reporter and deletions in genes encoding CpxRA system components, we developed and validated a novel cell-based high-throughput screen (HTS) for CpxRA activators. A screen of 36,000 compounds yielded one hit compound that increased reporter activity in wild-type cells. This is the first report of a compound that activates, rather than inhibits, a 2CSTS. The activity profile of the compound against CpxRA pathway mutants in the presence of glucose suggested that the compound inhibits CpxA phosphatase activity. We confirmed that the compound induced accumulation of CpxR-P in treated cells. Although the hit compound contained a nitro group, a derivative lacking this group retained activity in serum and had lower cytotoxicity than the initial hit. This HTS is amenable for screening of larger libraries to find compounds that activate CpxRA by other mechanisms and could be adapted to find activators of other two-component systems.
TI  - Structure of BamA, an essential factor in outer membrane protein biogenesis.
AB  - Outer membrane protein (OMP) biogenesis is an essential process for maintaining the bacterial cell envelope and involves the beta-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) for OMP recognition, folding and assembly. In Escherichia coli this function is orchestrated by five proteins: the integral outer membrane protein BamA of the Omp85 superfamily and four associated lipoproteins. To unravel the mechanism underlying OMP folding and insertion, the structure of the E. coli BamA beta-barrel and P5 domain was determined at 3 A resolution. These data add information beyond that provided in the recently published crystal structures of BamA from Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and are a valuable basis for the interpretation of pertinent functional studies. In an `open' conformation, E. coli BamA displays a significant degree of flexibility between P5 and the barrel domain, which is indicative of a multi-state function in substrate transfer. E. coli BamA is characterized by a discontinuous beta-barrel with impaired beta1-beta16 strand interactions denoted by only two connecting hydrogen bonds and a disordered C-terminus. The 16-stranded barrel surrounds a large cavity which implies a function in OMP substrate binding and partial folding. These findings strongly support a mechanism of OMP biogenesis in which substrates are partially folded inside the barrel cavity and are subsequently released laterally into the lipid bilayer.
TI  - A (p)ppGpp-null mutant of Haemophilus ducreyi is partially attenuated in humans due to multiple conflicting phenotypes.
AB  - (p)ppGpp responds to nutrient limitation through a global change in gene regulation patterns to increase survival. The stringent response has been implicated in the virulence of several pathogenic bacterial species. Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of chancroid, has homologs of both relA and spoT, which primarily synthesize and hydrolyze (p)ppGpp in Escherichia coli. We constructed relA and relA spoT deletion mutants to assess the contribution of (p)ppGpp to H. ducreyi pathogenesis. Both the relA single mutant and the relA spoT double mutant failed to synthesize (p)ppGpp, suggesting that relA is the primary synthetase of (p)ppGpp in H. ducreyi. Compared to the parent strain, the double mutant was partially attenuated for pustule formation in human volunteers. The double mutant had several phenotypes that favored attenuation, including increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. The increased sensitivity to oxidative stress could be complemented in trans. However, the double mutant also exhibited phenotypes that favored virulence. When grown to the mid-log phase, the double mutant was significantly more resistant than its parent to being taken up by human macrophages and exhibited increased transcription of lspB, which is involved in resistance to phagocytosis. Additionally, compared to the parent, the double mutant also exhibited prolonged survival in the stationary phase. In E. coli, overexpression of DksA compensates for the loss of (p)ppGpp; the H. ducreyi double mutant expressed higher transcript levels of dksA than the parent strain. These data suggest that the partial attenuation of the double mutant is likely the net result of multiple conflicting phenotypes.
TI  - Structural insight into the biogenesis of beta-barrel membrane proteins.
AB  - beta-barrel membrane proteins are essential for nutrient import, signalling, motility and survival. In Gram-negative bacteria, the beta-barrel assembly machinery (BAM) complex is responsible for the biogenesis of beta-barrel membrane proteins, with homologous complexes found in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Here we describe the structure of BamA, the central and essential component of the BAM complex, from two species of bacteria: Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi. BamA consists of a large periplasmic domain attached to a 16-strand transmembrane beta-barrel domain. Three structural features shed light on the mechanism by which BamA catalyses beta-barrel assembly. First, the interior cavity is accessible in one BamA structure and conformationally closed in the other. Second, an exterior rim of the beta-barrel has a distinctly narrowed hydrophobic surface, locally destabilizing the outer membrane. And third, the beta-barrel can undergo lateral opening, suggesting a route from the interior cavity in BamA into the outer membrane.
TI  - Cellular interactions of the cytolethal distending toxins from Escherichia coli and Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) compose a subclass of intracellularly acting genotoxins produced by many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria that disrupt the normal progression of the eukaryotic cell cycle. Here, the intoxication mechanisms of CDTs from Escherichia coli (Ec-CDT) and Haemophilus ducreyi (Hd-CDT), which share limited amino acid sequence homology, were directly compared. Ec-CDT and Hd-CDT shared comparable in vitro DNase activities of the CdtB subunits, saturable cell surface binding with comparable affinities, and the requirement for an intact Golgi complex to induce cell cycle arrest. In contrast, disruption of endosome acidification blocked Hd-CDT-mediated cell cycle arrest and toxin transport to the endoplasmic reticulum and nucleus, while having no effects on Ec-CDT. Phosphorylation of the histone protein H2AX, as well as nuclear localization, was inhibited for Hd-CdtB, but not Ec-CdtB, in cells expressing dominant negative Rab7 (T22N), suggesting that Hd-CDT, but not Ec-CDT, is trafficked through late endosomal vesicles. In support of this idea, significantly more Hd-CdtB than Ec-CdtB co-localized with Rab9, which is enriched in late endosomal compartments. Competitive binding studies suggested that Ec-CDT and Hd-CDT bind to discrete cell surface determinants. These results suggest that Ec-CDT and Hd-CDT are transported within cells by distinct pathways, possibly mediated by their interaction with different receptors at the cell surface.
TI  - Electrotransformation of Haemophilus parasuis with in vitro modified DNA based on a novel shuttle vector.
AB  - The objective of the present study was to establish a valid transformation method of Haemophilus parasuis, the causative agent of Glasser's disease in pigs, using a novel H. parasuis-Escherichia coli shuttle vector. A 4.2kb endogenous plasmid pYC93 was extracted from an H. parasuis field isolate and completely sequenced. Analysis of pYC93 revealed a region approximately 800bp showing high homology with the defined replication origin oriV of pLS88, a native plasmid identified in Haemophilus ducreyi. Based on the origin region of pYC93, E. coli cloning vector pBluescript SK(+) and the Tn903 derived kanamycin cassette, a shuttle vector pSHK4 was constructed by overlapping PCR strategy. When electroporation of the 15 H. parasuis serovar reference strains and one clinical isolate SH0165 with pSHK4 was performed, only one of these strains yielded transformants with an efficiency of 8.5x10(2)CFU/mug of DNA. Transformation efficiency was notably increased (1.3x10(5)CFU/mug of DNA) with vector DNA reisolated from the homologous transformants. This demonstrated that restriction-modification systems were involved in the barrier to transformation of H. parasuis. By utilizing an in vitro DNA modification method with cell-free extracts of the host H. parasuis strains, 15 out of 16 strains were transformable. The novel shuttle vector pSHK4 and the established electrotransformation method constitute useful tools for the genetic manipulation of H. parasuis to gain a better understanding of the pathogen.
TI  - Identification and characterization of a heme periplasmic-binding protein in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, a gram-negative and heme-dependent bacterium, is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer sexually transmitted infection. Heme acquisition in H. ducreyi proceeds via a receptor mediated process in which the initial event involves binding of hemoglobin and heme to their cognate outer membrane proteins, HgbA and TdhA, respectively. Following this specific interaction, the fate of the periplasmic deposited heme is unclear. Using protein expression profiling of the H. ducreyi periplasmic proteome, a periplasmic-binding protein, termed hHbp, was identified whose expression was enhanced under heme-limited conditions. The gene encoding this protein was situated in a locus displaying genetic characteristics of an ABC transporter. The purified protein bound heme in a dose-dependent and saturable manner and this binding was specifically competitively inhibited by heme. The hhbp gene functionally complemented an Escherichia coli heme uptake mutant. Expression of the heme periplasmic-binding protein was detected in a limited survey of H. ducreyi and H. influenzae clinical strains. These results indicate that the passage of heme into the cytoplasm of H. ducreyi involves a heme dedicated ABC transporter.
TI  - Characterization of the CpxRA regulon in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The Haemophilus ducreyi 35000HP genome encodes a homolog of the CpxRA two-component cell envelope stress response system originally characterized in Escherichia coli. CpxR, the cytoplasmic response regulator, was shown previously to be involved in repression of the expression of the lspB-lspA2 operon (M. Labandeira-Rey, J. R. Mock, and E. J. Hansen, Infect. Immun. 77:3402-3411, 2009). In the present study, the H. ducreyi CpxR and CpxA proteins were shown to closely resemble those of other well-studied bacterial species. A cpxA deletion mutant and a CpxR-overexpressing strain were used to explore the extent of the CpxRA regulon. DNA microarray and real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) PCR analyses indicated several potential regulatory targets for the H. ducreyi CpxRA two-component regulatory system. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) were used to prove that H. ducreyi CpxR interacted with the promoter regions of genes encoding both known and putative virulence factors of H. ducreyi, including the lspB-lspA2 operon, the flp operon, and dsrA. Interestingly, the use of EMSAs also indicated that H. ducreyi CpxR did not bind to the promoter regions of several genes predicted to encode factors involved in the cell envelope stress response. Taken together, these data suggest that the CpxRA system in H. ducreyi, in contrast to that in E. coli, may be involved primarily in controlling expression of genes not involved in the cell envelope stress response.
TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxins (CDTs) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by  a diverse group of pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria. Based on their ability to induce DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, CDTs are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. Despite the widespread distribution of CDTs among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. Here we demonstrate that CDTs from Haemophilus ducreyi, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Escherichia coli, and Campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in CDT binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. The absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four CDTs tested. Surprisingly, fucosylated N-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in CDT-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the CDTs tested. Finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in CDT binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of CDTs tested. The findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of CDT-host interactions.
TI  - Bacterial CMP-sialic acid synthetases: production, properties, and applications.
AB  - Sialic acids are abundant nine-carbon sugars expressed terminally on glycoconjugates of eukaryotic cells and are crucial for a variety of cell biological functions such as cell-cell adhesion, intracellular signaling, and in regulation of glycoproteins stability. In bacteria, N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) polymers are important virulence factors. Cytidine 5'-monophosphate (CMP)-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase (CSS; EC 2.7.7.43), the key enzyme that synthesizes CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid, the donor molecule for numerous sialyltransferase reactions, is present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotic systems. Herein, we emphasize the source, function, and biotechnological applications of CSS enzymes from bacterial sources. To date, only a few CSS from pathogenic bacterial species such as Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli, group B streptococci, Haemophilus ducreyi, and Pasteurella hemolytica and an enzyme from nonpathogenic bacterium, Clostridium thermocellum, have been described. Overall, the enzymes from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria share common catalytic properties such as their dependency on divalent cation, temperature and pH profiles, and catalytic mechanisms. The enzymes, however, can be categorized as smaller and larger enzymes depending on their molecular weight. The larger enzymes in some cases are bifunctional; they have exhibited acetylhydrolase activity in addition to their sugar nucleotidyltransferase activity. The CSSs are important enzymes for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of various sialooligosaccharides of significance in biotechnology.
TI  - Ultrafast heme-residue bond formation in six-coordinate heme proteins: implications for functional ligand exchange.
AB  - A survey is presented of picosecond kinetics of heme-residue bond formation after photolysis of histidine, methionine, or cysteine, in a broad range of ferrous six-coordinate heme proteins. These include human neuroglobin, a bacterial heme-binding superoxide dismutase (SOD), plant cytochrome b 559, the insect nuclear receptor E75, horse heart cytochrome c and the heme domain of the bacterial sensor protein Dos. We demonstrate that the fastest and dominant phase of binding of amino acid residues to domed heme invariably takes place with a time constant in the narrow range of 5-7 ps. Remarkably, this is also the case in the heme-binding SOD, where the heme is solvent-exposed. We reason that this fast phase corresponds to barrierless formation of the heme-residue bond from a configuration close to the bound state. Only in proteins where functional ligand exchange occurs, additional slower rebinding takes place on the time scale of tens of picoseconds after residue dissociation. We propose that the presence of these slower phases reflects flexibility in the heme environment that allows external ligands (O2, CO, NO, . . .) to functionally replace the internal residue after thermal dissociation of the heme-residue bond.
TI  - Haemophilus ducreyi is resistant to human antimicrobial peptides.
AB  - We examined the susceptibility of Haemophilus ducreyi to antimicrobial peptides likely to be encountered in vivo during human infection. H. ducreyi was significantly more resistant than Escherichia coli to the bactericidal effects of all peptides tested. Class I and II H. ducreyi strains exhibited similar levels of resistance to antimicrobial peptides.
TI  - The contribution of cytolethal distending toxin to bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial toxin that initiates a eukaryotic cell cycle block at the G2 stage prior to mitosis. CDT is produced by a number of bacterial pathogens including: Campylobacter species, Escherichia coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Shigella dystenteriae, enterohepatic Helicobacter species, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (the cause of aggressive periodontitis), and Haemophilus ducreyi (the cause of chancroid). The functional toxin is composed of three proteins; CdtB potentiates a cascade leading to cell cycle block, and CdtA and CdtC function as dimeric subunits, which bind CdtB and delivers it to the mammalian cell interior. Once inside the cell, CdtB enters the nucleus and exhibits a DNase I-like activity that results in DNA double-strand breaks. The eukaryotic cell responds to the DNA double-strand breaks by initiating a regulatory cascade that results in cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and cell death. Mutations in CdtABC that cause any of the three subunits to lose function prevent the bacterial cell from inducing cytotoxicity. The result of CDT activity can differ somewhat depending on the eukaryotic cell types affected. Epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes undergo G2 cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and death; fibroblasts undergo G1 and G2 arrest, cellular distension, and death; and immune cells undergo G2 arrest followed by apoptosis. CDT contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting both cellular and humoral immunity via apoptosis of immune response cells, and by generating necrosis of epithelial-type cells and fibroblasts involved in the repair of lesions produced by pathogens resulting in slow healing and production of disease symptoms. Thus, CDT may function as a virulence factor in pathogens that produce the toxin.
TI  - Role of N-acetylglucosamine within core lipopolysaccharide of several species of  gram-negative bacteria in targeting the DC-SIGN (CD209).
AB  - Our recent studies have shown that the dendritic cell-specific ICAM nonintegrin CD209 (DC-SIGN) specifically binds to the core LPS of Escherichia coli K12 (E. coli), promoting bacterial adherence and phagocytosis. In this current study, we attempted to map the sites within the core LPS that are directly involved in LPS-DC-SIGN interaction. We took advantage of four sets of well-defined core LPS mutants, which are derived from E. coli, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Haemophilus ducreyi and determined interaction of each of these four sets with DC-SIGN. Our results demonstrated that N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) sugar residues within the core LPS in these bacteria play an essential role in targeting the DC-SIGN receptor. Our results also imply that DC-SIGN is an innate immune receptor and the interaction of bacterial core LPS and DC-SIGN may represent a primeval interaction between Gram-negative bacteria and host phagocytic cells.
TI  - Expression of Haemophilus ducreyi collagen binding outer membrane protein NcaA is required for virulence in swine and human challenge models of chancroid.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease chancroid, has been shown to associate with dermal collagen fibers within infected skin lesions. Here we describe NcaA, a previously uncharacterized outer membrane protein that is important for H. ducreyi collagen binding and host colonization. An H. ducreyi strain lacking the ncaA gene was impaired in adherence to type I collagen but not fibronectin (plasma or cellular form) or heparin. The mutation had no effect on serum resistance or binding to HaCaT keratinocytes or human foreskin fibroblasts in vitro. Escherichia coli expressing H. ducreyi NcaA bound to type I collagen, demonstrating that NcaA is sufficient to confer collagen attachment. The importance of NcaA in H. ducreyi pathogenesis was assessed using both swine and human experimental models of chancroid. In the swine model, 20% of lesions from sites inoculated with the ncaA mutant were culture positive for H. ducreyi 7 days after inoculation, compared to 73% of wild-type-inoculated sites. The average number of CFU recovered from mutant-inoculated lesions was also significantly reduced compared to that recovered from wild-type-inoculated sites at both 2 and 7 days after inoculation. In the human challenge model, 8 of 30 sites inoculated with wild-type H. ducreyi progressed to the pustular stage, compared to 0 of 30 sites inoculated with the ncaA mutant. Together these results demonstrate that the collagen binding protein NcaA is required for H. ducreyi infection.
TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin generates cell death by inducing a bottleneck in the  cell cycle.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) is a bacterial protein that is widely distributed among gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, Campylobacter spp., enterohepatic Helicobacter spp., Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Haemophilus ducreyi. In vitro studies demonstrated that it is able to stop proliferation of various cell lines. The toxin is composed of three subunits designated CDTs A, B and C. The B subunit targets the eukaryotic DNA and triggers a signalling pathway involving different protein kinases which results in a cell block before entering into mitosis. To date, the individual role of the A and C subunits has not been totally elucidated. There are indications that the CDT is also produced in vivo. Its exact role in pathogenesis is not yet clear, but possible actions include inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis of immune cells and inhibition of a fibrotic response.
TI  - Tol-Pal proteins are critical cell envelope components of Erwinia chrysanthemi affecting cell morphology and virulence.
AB  - The tol-pal genes are necessary for maintaining the outer-membrane integrity of Gram-negative bacteria. These genes were first described in Escherichia coli, and more recently in several other species. They are involved in the pathogenesis of E. coli, Haemophilus ducreyi, Vibrio cholerae and Salmonella enterica. The role of the tol-pal genes in bacterial pathogenesis was investigated in the phytopathogenic enterobacterium Erwinia chrysanthemi, assuming that this organism might be a good model for such a study. The whole Er. chrysanthemi tol-pal region was characterized. Tol-Pal proteins, except TolA, showed high identity scores with their E. coli homologues. Er. chrysanthemi mutants were constructed by introducing a uidA-kan cassette in the ybgC, tolQ, tolA, tolB, pal and ybgF genes. All the mutants were hypersensitive to bile salts. Mutations in tolQ, tolA, tolB and pal were deleterious for the bacteria, which required high concentrations of sugars or osmoprotectants for their viability. Consistent with this observation, they were greatly impaired in their cell morphology and division, which was evidenced by observations of cell filaments, spherical forms, membrane blebbing and mislocalized bacterial septa. Moreover, tol-pal mutants showed a reduced virulence in a potato tuber model and on chicory leaves. This could be explained by a combination of impaired phenotypes in the tol-pal mutants, such as reduced growth and motility and a decreased production of pectate lyases, the major virulence factor of Er. chrysanthemi.
TI  - Cytolethal distending toxin: a bacterial bullet targeted to nucleus.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) is a newly added member of bacterial protein toxins that hijack the control system of eukaryotic cells. Cdts are produced by several pathogenic bacteria causing chronic infectious diseases. They are composed of three subunits, CdtA, CdtB and CdtC, which together form a ternary complex. CdtB is the active component, and CdtA and CdtC are involved in delivering the CdtB into the cells. The sophisticated strategy of Cdt to control host cells is CdtB-mediated limited DNA damage of the host cell chromosome, which triggers the response of the cell cycle checkpoint and results in G2 arrest in the cells. Cdt also induces apoptotic cell death of lymphocytes, which may be relevant to onset or persistence of chronic infection by the producing bacteria. The study of this toxin is expected to provide us information on a novel strategy by which bacteria interact with host cells.
TI  - A CdtA-CdtC complex can block killing of HeLa cells by Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  - The cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of Haemophilus ducreyi is comprised of the  CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins, with the CdtB protein having demonstrated enzymatic (i.e., DNase) activity. Using a single recombinant Escherichia coli strain with two plasmids individually containing the H. ducreyi cdtA and cdtC genes, we purified a noncovalent CdtA-CdtC complex. Incubation of this CdtA-CdtC complex with HeLa cells blocked killing of these cells by CDT holotoxin. Furthermore, the addition of purified recombinant CdtB to HeLa cells preincubated with the CdtA-CdtC complex resulted in the killing of these human epithelial cells.
TI  - Cloning and characterisation of type 4 fimbrial genes from Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae.
AB  - Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is the cause of porcine pleuropneumoniae. Little  is known about the mechanisms by which A. pleuropneumoniae colonises the respiratory tract. Fimbriae are common mediators of bacterial adherence to mucosal epithelia and have been observed on the surface of A. pleuropneumoniae cells. Here we report the identification and characterisation of the type 4 fimbrial structural gene (apfA) from A. pleuropneumoniae. In addition a number of open reading frames were identified in A. pleuropneumoniae that have significant homology to type 4 fimbrial biogenesis genes from other species, including a putative leader specific peptidase (apfD). A. pleuropneumoniae apfA codes for a predicted polypeptide of approximately 16kDa, removal of the leader sequence at the predicted cleavage site would yield a 14.5kDa polypeptide. The first 30 residues of the mature polypeptide are well conserved with other members of the group A type 4 fimbriae family. The signal sequence of ApfA is 13 amino acids in length and, unusually, the residue that precedes the cleavage site is alanine rather than glycine which is found in most other type 4 fimbriae. The C-terminus of ApfA possesses cysteine residues that are conserved in type 4 fimbriae of many species. In other type 4 fimbriae the distal C-terminal cysteines form a disulphide bond that produces a loop, which is important for the function of fimbriae and also comprises a major antigenic determinant. A motif within the predicted loop in ApfA was found to be highly conserved in type 4 fimbriae of other HAP organisms (Haemophilus, Actinobacillus, Pasteurella). The A. pleuropneumoniae type 4 fimbrial biogenesis genes showed the strongest homology to putative type 4 fimbrial genes of Haemophilus ducreyi. A. pleuropneumoniae apfA gene was shown to be present and highly conserved in different serotypes of A. pleuropneumoniae. Recombinant ApfA was produced and used to raise anti-ApfA antisera.
TI  - The Haemophilus ducreyi serum resistance antigen DsrA confers attachment to human keratinocytes.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease chancroid. H. ducreyi serum resistance protein A (DsrA) is a member of a family of multifunctional outer membrane proteins that are involved in resistance to killing by human serum complement. The members of this family include YadA of Yersinia species, the UspA proteins of Moraxella catarrhalis, and the Eib proteins of Escherichia coli. The role of YadA, UspA1, and UspA2H as eukaryotic cell adhesins and the function of UspA2 as a vitronectin binder led to our investigation of the cell adhesion and vitronectin binding properties of DsrA. We found that DsrA was a keratinocyte-specific adhesin as it was necessary and sufficient for attachment to HaCaT cells, a keratinocyte cell line, but was not required for attachment to HS27 cells, a fibroblast cell line. We also found that DsrA was specifically responsible for the ability of H. ducreyi to bind vitronectin. We then theorized that DsrA might use vitronectin as a bridge to bind to human cells, but this hypothesis proved to be untrue as eliminating HaCaT cell binding of vitronectin with a monoclonal antibody specific to integrin alpha(v)beta(5) did not affect the attachment of H. ducreyi to HaCaT cells. Finally, we wanted to examine the importance of keratinocyte adhesion in chancroid pathogenesis so we tested the wild-type and dsrA mutant strains of H. ducreyi in our swine models of chancroid pathogenesis. The dsrA mutant was less virulent than the wild type in both the normal and immune cell-depleted swine models of chancroid infection.
TI  - Toxicity and immunogenicity of purified Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal distending toxin in a rabbit model.
AB  - The cytolethal distending toxin of Haemophilus ducreyi (HdCDT) is a three-component toxin that induces the arrest of the mammalian cell cycle in the G2 phase. All of the individual gene products, CdtA, CdtB and CdtC, are required for toxic activity on cultured mammalian cells. The CdtB component alone exerts nuclease activity. The individual HdCDT components were purified by affinity chromatography or ion-exchange chromatography followed by gel-filtration. HdCDT was reconstituted and purified by the immobilization of a GST-CdtB fusion on a GSTrap column and the subsequent addition of cell sonicates from Escherichia coli recombinants that produced CdtA and CdtC. The purified HdCDT preparation contained all three CDT proteins, as detected by immuno-blotting, and had high cytotoxic activity (10(6)CPU/ml). Immunization of rabbits with the HdCDT complex and with the individual CdtA, CdtB and CdtC proteins elicited high titres of antibodies, as detected by ELISA. All of the immune sera had toxin-neutralizing activities. The pathological effects of the HdCDT complex were investigated in rabbits, since the proliferation of two rabbit cell lines, SIRC and RK-13, was inhibited by HdCDT. Intradermal injection of HdCDT (1, 10, 50 and 100microg protein) into naive rabbits resulted in dose-dependent skin reactions (erythema) about 24h after injection. Similar effects were not observed when the individual HdCDT proteins were injected. HdCDT injection into immune rabbits resulted in dose-dependent skin responses that were characterized by both erythema and oedema. Histological evaluation of the 24-h lesions in naive rabbits that were injected with HdCDT, revealed moderate levels of inflammatory cells, which were mainly granulocytes and macrophages, and dilatation of blood vessels. The skin reactions in HdCDT-injected immunized rabbits showed pronounced vascular changes and extensive infiltration of inflammatory cells, including eosinophils. All of the pathological changes healed after 3 days. In conclusion, purified HdCDT holotoxin is a complex of all three CDT proteins and all three components induce neutralizing antibodies when injected in rabbits. HdCDT causes dose-dependent pathologic skin reactions in both naive and immune rabbits, which is characterized by increased inflammatory responsiveness after each immunization.
TI  - The activity of p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate against Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, and other microorganisms.
AB  - p-Methoxybenzylisothiocyanate was isolated from Lepidium bonariense and found to  be responsible for the plants antimicrobial and STD activity. MIC determinations were conducted for p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate on Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrheae, Candida albicans, Bacillus subtilus, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Psuedomanas aeruginosa. An in vitro cellular toxicity assay showed that at 100 microM (17,9 microg/mL) p-methoxybenzylisothiocyanate is not toxic to living cells.
TI  - A superoxide dismutase C mutant of Haemophilus ducreyi is virulent in human volunteers.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi produces a periplasmic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn SOD), which is thought to protect the organism from exogenous reactive oxygen species generated by neutrophils during an inflammatory response. We had previously identified the gene, sodC, responsible for the production and secretion of Cu-Zn SOD and constructed an isogenic H. ducreyi strain with a mutation in the sodC gene (35000HP-sodC-cat). Compared to the parent, the mutant does not survive in the presence of exogenous superoxide (L. R. San Mateo, M. Hobbs, and T. H. Kawula, Mol. Microbiol. 27:391-404, 1998) and is impaired in the swine model of H. ducreyi infection (L. R. San Mateo, K. L. Toffer, P. E. Orndorff, and T. H. Kawula, Infect. Immun. 67:5345-5351, 1999). To test whether Cu-Zn SOD is important for bacterial survival in vivo, six human volunteers were experimentally infected with 35000HP and 35000HP-sodC-cat and observed for papule and pustule formation. Papules developed at similar rates at sites inoculated with the mutant or parent. The pustule formation rates were 75% (95% confidence intervals [CI], 43 to 95%) at 12 parent-inoculated sites and 67% (95% CI, 41 to 88%) at 18 mutant-inoculated sites (P = 0.47). There was no significant difference in levels of H. ducreyi recovery from mutant- and parent-inoculated biopsy sites. These results suggest that expression of Cu-Zn SOD does not play a major role in the survival of this pathogen in the initial stages of experimental infection of humans.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo interactions of Haemophilus ducreyi with host phagocytes.
AB  - We investigated the phagocytosis of Haemophilus ducreyi both in vitro and in vivo. Human granulocyte and monocyte phagocytosis of opsonized and nonopsonized, fluorescence-labeled H. ducreyi was assessed by flow cytometry. Both Escherichia coli and noncapsulated H. influenzae were included as controls. The maximal percentage of granulocytes taken up by H. ducreyi was 35% after 90 min. In contrast, 95% of H. influenzae bacteria were phagocytosed by granulocytes after 30 min. These results indicated that H. ducreyi phagocytosis was slow and inefficient. Bacterial opsonization by using specific antibodies increased the percentage of granulocytes phagocytosing H. ducreyi from 24 to 49%. The nonphagocytosed bacteria were completely resistant to phagocytosis even when reexposed to granulocytes, indicating that the H. ducreyi culture comprised a mixture of phenotypes. The intracellular survival of H. ducreyi in granulocytes, in monocytes/macrophages, and in a monocyte cell line (THP-1) was quantified after application of gentamicin treatment to kill extracellular bacteria. H. ducreyi survival within phagocytes was poor; approximately 11 and <0.1% of the added bacteria survived intracellularly after 2 and 20 h of incubation, respectively, while no intracellular H. influenzae bacteria were recovered after 2 h of incubation with phagocytes. The role of phagocytes in the development of skin lesions due to H. ducreyi was also studied in vivo. Mice that were depleted of granulocytes and/or monocytes and SCID mice, which lacked T and B cells, were injected intradermally with approximately 10(6) CFU of H. ducreyi. Within 4 days of inoculation, the granulocyte-depleted mice developed lesions that persisted throughout the experimental period. This result reinforces the importance of granulocytes in the early innate defense against H. ducreyi infection. In conclusion, H. ducreyi is insufficiently phagocytosed to achieve complete eradication of the bacteria. Indeed, H. ducreyi has the ability to survive intracellularly for short periods within phagocytic cells in vitro. Since granulocytes play a major role in the innate defense against H. ducreyi infection in vivo, bacterial resistance to phagocytosis probably plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.
TI  - Nonimmune binding of human immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG Fc by distinct sequence segments of the EibF cell surface protein of Escherichia coli.
AB  - The eib genes of Escherichia coli encode surface-exposed proteins which bind immunoglobulins (Ig) such as the Fc fragment of human IgG (IgG Fc) in a nonimmune manner. The Eib proteins belong to a family which includes YadA of Yersinia, UspA2 of Moraxella, and DsrA of Haemophilus ducreyi. This family of surface-exposed proteins shares several features, such as the ability to impart resistance to human serum complement and a tendency to exist as stable multimers. Four genes, eibA, eibC, eibD and eibE, were previously identified and cloned from ECOR-9, a strain from the E. coli reference collection. EibC, -D, and -E bind human serum IgA in addition to IgG, but no IgA binding has been observed for EibA. Here, we report the cloning of a new eib gene, eibF, from a second strain of E. coli, ECOR-2. The product, EibF, has a relatively strong preference for IgA. Like the other eib genes, eibF attenuates serum sensitivity, occurs as a stable multimer, and is associated with a prophage. By subcloning portions of the eibA and eibF genes, we have identified distinct sequence segments sufficient to cause Ig binding, multimerization, and discrimination between IgA and IgG. The ability to multimerize is associated with a sequence close to the C terminus that is homologous to other family members such as YadA. Binding of IgG Fc is associated with a sequence that is highly conserved among all Eib proteins but otherwise unique. Binding of IgA is associated with a sequence of EibF that is not similar to any EibA sequence.
TI  - Purification and characterization of a beta-lactamase from Haemophilus ducreyi in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A pCb plasmid encoding a beta-lactamase from Haemophilus ducreyi was transferred  to Escherichia coli, purified, and characterized. The beta-lactamase could be isolated from a culture filtrate and further purified by ammonium sulfate and chelating Sepharose fast flow loaded with Zn(2+). The purified enzyme resulted in a major band at approximately 30-kDa on SDS-PAGE and its pI was determined to be 5.4. The beta-lactamase could hydrolyze both penicillin antibiotics including ampicillin, benzylpenicillin, and carbenicillin as well as cephalosporin antibiotics including nitrocefin, cephalothin, cephaloridine, and cefoperazone. However, benzylpenicillin was the best substrate. The enzyme activity was inhibited by clavulanic acid but not by boric acid, cefotaxime, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, or phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. The sequence of the beta-lactamase gene was also determined. It confirmed that the enzyme belonged to a class A beta-lactamase which had 99% identity to the ampicillin resistance transposon Tn3 of pBR322. Two nucleotides were different between the E. coli (Tn3) and H. ducreyi (pCb) genes that affected the amino-acid sequence. The valine at position 82 (ABL 84) was changed to isoleucine and the alanine at position 182 (ABL 184) was changed to valine. Genetic homogeneity among beta-lactamases is remarkable. Amino acid sequencing of some beta-lactamases has shown that substitution of only a few amino acids in the bla gene leads to high-level resistance against specific cephalosporins.
TI  - Multiple origins and replication proteins influence biological properties of beta-lactamase-producing plasmids from Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - The beta-lactamase-producing Asia-type plasmid pJD4 of Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a 7.4-kb, broad-host-range plasmid. It is part of a family of plasmids which are structurally related yet vary in size, found in both N. gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus ducreyi. Branch-point analysis by electron microscopy indicates that pJD4 carries three clustered but distinguishable origins of replication, which we named ori1, ori2, and ori3. Although pJD4 belongs to incompatibility (Inc) group W, it also carries a silent IncFII determinant which is expressed when ori2 and ori3 are absent. The Africa-type plasmid pJD5, a naturally occurring deletion derivative of pJD4, carries only ori1, belongs to the IncFII group, and, in contrast to pJD4, requires DNA polymerase I (Pol I) for replication. Plasmids constructed from pJD4 which lack ori1 but carry ori2 and ori3 do not require Pol I and are incompatible with IncW plasmids, suggesting that the ori2 or ori3 region contains the IncW determinant. We have cloned a replication initiation protein (RepB) that is necessary for ori2 and ori3 to function. This Rep protein is distinct from RepA, which is necessary for ori1. Thus, pJD4 is unique because it is the smallest plasmid characterized containing three origins of replication and two unique Rep proteins.
TI  - Characterization of Haemophilus ducreyi cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC mutants in in vitro  and in vivo systems.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi expresses a soluble cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that is encoded by the cdtABC gene cluster and can be detected in culture supernatant fluid by its ability to kill HeLa cells. The cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC genes of H. ducreyi were cloned independently into plasmid vectors, and their encoded proteins expressed singly or in various combinations in an Escherichia coli background. All three gene products had to be expressed in order for E. coli-derived culture supernatant fluids to demonstrate cytotoxicity for HeLa cells. Isogenic H. ducreyi cdtA and cdtB mutants were constructed and used in combination with the wild-type parent strain and a previously described H. ducreyi cdtC mutant (M. K. Stevens, J. L. Latimer, S. R. Lumbley, C. K. Ward, L. D. Cope, T. Lagergard, and E. J. Hansen, Infect. Immun. 67:3900-3908, 1999) to determine the relative contributions of the CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins to CDT activity. Expression of CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC appeared necessary for H. ducreyi-derived culture supernatant fluid to exhibit cytotoxicity for HeLa cells. Whole-cell sonicates and periplasmic extracts from the cdtB and cdtC mutants had no effect on HeLa cells, whereas these same fractions from a cdtA mutant had a very modest cytotoxic effect on these same human cells. CdtA appeared to be primarily associated with the H. ducreyi cell envelope, whereas both CdtB and CdtC were present primarily in the soluble fraction from sonicated cells. Both the cdtA mutant and the cdtB mutant were found to be fully virulent in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid.
TI  - Investigation of the interaction among the components of the cytolethal distending toxin of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of Haemophilus ducreyi is encoded by the cdtABC genes, but the composition of active CDT is not known. Both immunoaffinity and metal affinity chromatographic methods were used to purify H. ducreyi CDT from recombinant Escherichia coli strains bearing wild-type or mutated H. ducreyi cdtABC genes. Both affinity-purified preparations contained CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins. These purification efforts also revealed that the formation of a noncovalent CdtB-CdtC complex and production of a fully active CDT complex required the presence of a functional CdtA protein. When purified recombinant CdtB and CdtC proteins were mixed, only very slight CDT activity was detected. In contrast, when a bacterial cell extract containing CdtA was mixed with purified preparations of both CdtB and CdtC, full CDT activity was reconstituted in vitro. These results indicate that CdtA is essential for normal H. ducreyi CDT activity and that CdtA likely modifies or alters either CdtB or CdtC or both to form the active CDT complex.
TI  - Cloning, overexpression, purification, and immunobiology of an 85-kilodalton outer membrane protein from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We have identified an 85-kDa outer membrane protein that is expressed by all tested strains of Haemophilus ducreyi. Studies of related proteins from other pathogenic bacteria, including Haemophilus influenzae, Pasteurella multocida, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Shigella dysenteriae, suggested a role for these proteins in pathogenesis and immunity. In keeping with the first such described protein from Haemophilus influenzae type B, we termed the H. ducreyi protein D15. The gene encoding the H. ducreyi D15 protein was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence was found to be most similar to sequences of the D15-related proteins from other Pasteurella spp. The arrangement of the flanking genes was similar to that of H. influenzae Rd and suggested that D15 was part of a multigene operon. Attempts to make a null mutation of the D15 gene were unsuccessful, paralleling results in other D15 gene studies. Overexpression of H. ducreyi D15 in Escherichia coli resulted in a source of recombinant D15 (rD15) from which it was readily purified. rD15 was immunogenic, and it was found that immunization of rabbits with an rD15 vaccine preparation conferred partial protection against a virulent challenge infection. Antisera to an N-terminal peptide recognized all tested strains of H. ducreyi.
TI  - The role of different protein components from the Haemophilus ducreyi cytolethal  distending toxin in the generation of cell toxicity.
AB  - Cytolethal distending toxin of Haemophilus ducreyi (HdCDT) is a multicomponent toxin, encoded by an operon consisting of three genes, cdtABC. To investigate the role of the individual products in generation of toxicity, recombinant plasmids were constructed allowing expression of each of the genes individually or in different combinations in Escherichia coli and Vibrio cholerae. Expression of all three genes (cdtABC) was necessary to generate toxicity on cells, and no activity was obtained using combinations in which only one or two of the genes were expressed. Of the individual gene products, the CdtA was shown to exist in two forms with an MW of 23 and 17 kDa, respectively. The CdtB protein alone resulted in DNase activity. CdtC purified from both toxic and non-toxic extracts (from strains expressing cdtCAB and cdtC, respectively) had a molecular weight of about 20 kDa and reacted with a CdtC-specific monoclonal antibody. However, the protein isoelectric point (pI) of CdtC from toxic preparations was about 1.5 pH units more basic than from non-toxic ones. Both forms were immunogenic giving rise to toxin-neutralizing antibodies. Toxicity was reconstructed by combining non-toxic cell sonicates from E. coli, expressing CdtA, CdtB and CdtC proteins individually. Only combinations including all three products gave toxicity, indicating that all are actively involved in the generation of toxic activity on cells. The reconstruction resulted in a 1.5 pH unit shift in the PI of CdtC, making it identical to that of the protein isolated from bacteria expressing cdtABC. The results showed that the CdtB component produces DNase activity, but cell toxicity depends on the involvement of the other two components of CDT and is associated with absorption of all three proteins by HEp-2 cells.
TI  - A novel heme protein, the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent of the genital ulcerative disease known  as chancroid, is unable to synthesize heme, which it acquires from humans, its only known host. Here we provide evidence that the periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from this organism is a heme-binding protein, unlike all the other known Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutases from bacterial and eukaryotic species. When the H. ducreyi enzyme was expressed in Escherichia coli cells grown in standard LB medium, it contained only limited amounts of heme covalently bound to the polypeptide but was able efficiently to bind exogenously added hemin. Resonance Raman and electronic spectra at neutral pH indicate that H. ducreyi Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase contains a 6-coordinated low spin heme, with two histidines as the most likely axial ligands. By site-directed mutagenesis and analysis of a structural model of the enzyme, we identified as a putative axial ligand a histidine residue (His-64) that is present only in the H. ducreyi enzyme and that was located at the bottom of the dimer interface. The introduction of a histidine residue in the corresponding position of the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase from Haemophilus parainfluenzae was not sufficient to confer the ability to bind heme, indicating that other residues neighboring His-64 are involved in the formation of the heme-binding pocket. Our results suggest that periplasmic Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase plays a role in heme metabolism of H. ducreyi and provide further evidence for the structural flexibility of bacterial enzymes of this class.
TI  - Identification of a plasmid-encoded gene from Haemophilus ducreyi which confers NAD independence.
AB  - Members of the family Pasteurellaceae are classified in part by whether or not they require an NAD supplement for growth on laboratory media. In this study, we demonstrate that this phenotype can be determined by a single gene, nadV, whose presence allows NAD-independent growth of Haemophilus influenzae and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. This gene was cloned from a 5.2-kb plasmid which was previously shown to be responsible for NAD independence in Haemophilus ducreyi. When transformed into A. pleuropneumoniae, this cloned gene allowed NAD-independent growth on complex media and allowed the utilization of nicotinamide in place of NAD on defined media. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame of 1,482 bp that is predicted to encode a protein with a molecular mass of 55,619 Da. Compared with the sequence databases, NadV was found to have significant sequence homology to the human pre-B-cell colony-enhancing factor PBEF and to predicted proteins of unknown function identified in the bacterial species Mycoplasma genitalium, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Shewanella putrefaciens, Synechocystis sp., Deinococcus radiodurans, Pasteurella multocida, and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. P. multocida and A. actinomycetemcomitans are among the NAD-independent members of the Pasteurellaceae. Homologues of NadV were not found in the sequenced genome of H. influenzae, an NAD-dependent member of the Pasteurellaceae, or in species known to utilize a different pathway for synthesis of NAD, such as Escherichia coli. Sequence alignment of these nine homologues revealed regions and residues of complete conservation that may be directly involved in the enzymatic activity. Identification of a function for this gene in the Pasteurellaceae should help to elucidate the role of its homologues in other species.
TI  - Expression of peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein is required for virulence in the human model of Haemophilus ducreyi infection.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi expresses a peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein (PAL) that exhibits extensive homology to Haemophilus influenzae protein 6. We constructed an isogenic PAL mutant (35000HP-SMS4) by the use of a suicide vector that contains lacZ as a counterselectable marker. H. ducreyi 35000HP-SMS4 and its parent, 35000HP, had similar growth rates in broth and similar lipooligosaccharide profiles. 35000HP-SMS4 formed smaller, more transparent colonies than 35000HP and, unlike its parent, was hypersensitive to antibiotics. Complementation of the mutant in trans restored the parental phenotypes. To test whether expression of PAL is required for virulence, nine human volunteers were experimentally infected. Each subject was inoculated with two doses (41 to 89 CFU) of live 35000HP and one dose of heat-killed bacteria on one arm and with three doses (ranging from 28 to 800 CFU) of live 35000HP-SMS4 on the other arm. Papules developed at similar rates at sites inoculated with the mutant or parent but were significantly smaller at mutant-inoculated sites than at parent-inoculated sites. The pustule formation rate was 72% (95% confidence interval [CI], 46.5 to 90.3%) at 18 parent sites and 11% (95% CI, 2.4 to 29.2%) at 27 mutant sites (P < 0.0001). The rates of recovery of H. ducreyi from surface cultures were 8% (n = 130; 95% CI, 4.3 to 14.6%) for parent-inoculated sites and 0% (n = 120; 95% CI, 0.0 to 2.5%) for mutant-inoculated sites (P < 0.001). H. ducreyi was recovered from six of seven biopsied parent-inoculated sites and from one of three biopsied mutant-inoculated sites. Confocal microscopy confirmed that the bacteria present in a mutant inoculation site pustule lacked a PAL-specific epitope. Although biosafety regulations precluded our testing the complemented mutant in humans, these results suggest that expression of PAL facilitates the ability of H. ducreyi to progress to the pustular stage of disease.
TI  - Episome profiles and mobilizable beta-lactamase plasmid in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi has been described as a significantly predisposing factor of HIV heterosexual transmission in an endemic region of both diseases. The fastidious, H. ducreyi has been reported world wide with various antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. A high tendency of drug resistances has generally been found among isolates derived in Thailand. In this study, the plasmids of H. ducreyi were isolated and analysed from 63 clinically derived organisms. Twenty-nine out of 63 isolates (46%) revealed the same plasmid profiles. Plasmid DNA was further cloned into Escherichia coli and transformants were selected. A 3.6 kb plasmid (pCb) carrying ampicillin resistance was subsequently identified. The pCb conferred resistance to various beta-lactam antibiotics including penicillin G, carbenicillin, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoperazone, ampicillin-sulbactam, and amoxicillin-clavulanate but not to cefoxitin. Co-resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline was not detected. Beta-lactamase gene was located on the major pCb fragment of EcoRI and AatII cutting.
TI  - Characterization and expression of HmuR, a TonB-dependent hemoglobin receptor of  Porphyromonas gingivalis.
AB  - The gram-negative pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis requires hemin for growth. Hemoglobin bound to haptoglobin and hemin complexed to hemopexin can be used as heme sources, indicating that P. gingivalis must have a means to remove the hemin from these host iron-binding proteins. However, the specific mechanisms utilized by P. gingivalis for the extraction of heme from heme-binding proteins and for iron transport are poorly understood. In this study we have determined that a newly identified TonB-dependent hemoglobin-hemin receptor (HmuR) is involved in hemoglobin binding and utilization in P. gingivalis A7436. HmuR shares amino acid homology with TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors of gram-negative bacteria involved in the acquisition of iron from hemin and hemoglobin, including HemR of Yersinia enterocolitica, ShuA of Shigella dysenteriae, HpuB of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and N. meningitidis, HmbR of N. meningitidis, HgbA of Haemophilus ducreyi, and HgpB of H. influenzae. Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of the hmuR gene and revealed genetic variability in the carboxy terminus of hmuR in P. gingivalis strains 33277, 381, W50, and 53977. We also identified directly upstream of the hmuR gene a gene which we designated hmuY. Upstream of the hmuY start codon, a region with homology to the Fur binding consensus sequence was identified. Reverse transcription-PCR analysis revealed that hmuR and hmuY were cotranscribed and that transcription was negatively regulated by iron. Inactivation of hmuR resulted in a decreased ability of P. gingivalis to bind hemoglobin and to grow with hemoglobin or hemin as sole iron sources. Escherichia coli cells expressing recombinant HmuR were shown to bind hemoglobin and hemin. Furthermore, purified recombinant HmuR was demonstrated to bind hemoglobin. Taken together, these results indicate that HmuR serves as the major TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor involved in the utilization of both hemin and hemoglobin in P. gingivalis.
TI  - Expression of the cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt) operon in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: evidence that the CdtB protein is responsible for G2 arrest of the cell cycle in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtB gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt) expressed by several gram-negative bacteria. In this study, we report that the cdt locus in A. actinomycetemcomitans is composed of five open reading frames, designated orf1, orf2, cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. The deduced amino acid sequences of the five open reading frames are highly conserved among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains 652, Y4, 29522, and HK1651. There is also strong homology with the Cdt proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi (87-91%), but only partial homology with that of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli (29-48%). Analysis of A. actinomycetemcomitans mRNA by RT-PCR suggests that the two small open reading frames upstream of cdtA are coexpressed with cdtA, cdtB, and cdtC. We next utilized a series of plasmids that express various combinations of the cdt genes to determine their requirement for expression of immunoinhibitory activity. Cell extracts of E. coli transformed with each of the plasmids were tested for their capacity to induce G2 arrest in the cell cycle of PHA-activated human T cells. These experiments suggest that expression of cdtB alone is sufficient to induce G2 arrest in human T cells, but do not exclude the possibility that cdtC also contributes to cell cycle arrest. The implications of our results with respect to the function of the individual Cdt proteins are discussed.
TI  - Identification of cdtB homologues and cytolethal distending toxin activity in enterohepatic Helicobacter spp.
AB  - A bacterial toxin that causes progressive distension and death of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and HeLa cells, termed cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt), has been identified in several diarrhoeagenic bacteria, including Campylobacter spp. (C. jejuni and Cq coli), some pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli and Shigella spp. Genes encoding this toxin were identified as a cluster of three adjacent genes cdtA, cdtB and cdtC. Homologues of cdtB from five species of enterohepatic helicobacters (Helicobacter hepaticus, H. bilis, H. canis and two novel Helicobacter spp. isolated from mice and woodchuck, respectively) were identified by means of degenerative PCR primers, cloned and sequenced. The similarities of these partial cdtB nucleotide sequences from these Helicobacter spp. to those of cdtB genes known to be present in other bacteria were: C. jejuni, 58.3-64.8%; E. coli, 52.3-57.8%, Haemophilus ducreyi, 53.4-58.4% and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, 52.7-58.1%. Bacterial lysates from four of these helicobacters caused characteristic cytolethal distension of HeLa cells. Cdt caused cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase as measured by flow cytometry. The results demonstrated the presence of a toxin in these Helicobacter spp. belonging to the family of Cdt.
TI  - Construction and characterization of Haemophilus ducreyi lipooligosaccharide (LOS) mutants defective in expression of heptosyltransferase III and beta1,4-glucosyltransferase: identification of LOS glycoforms containing lactosamine repeats.
AB  - To begin to understand the role of the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) molecule in chancroid infections, we constructed mutants defective in expression of glycosyltransferase genes. Pyocin lysis and immunoscreening was used to identify a LOS mutant of Haemophilus ducreyi 35000. This mutant, HD35000R, produced a LOS molecule that lacked the monoclonal antibody 3F11 epitope and migrated with an increased mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Structural studies indicated that the principal LOS glycoform contains lipid A, Kdo, and two of the three core heptose residues. HD35000R was transformed with a plasmid library of H. ducreyi 35000 DNA, and a clone producing the wild-type LOS was identified. Sequence analysis of the plasmid insert revealed one open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a protein with homology to the WaaQ (heptosyltransferase III) of Escherichia coli. A second ORF had homology to the LgtF (glucosyltransferase) of Neisseria meningitidis. Individual isogenic mutants lacking expression of the putative H. ducreyi heptosyltransferase III, the putative glucosyltransferase, and both glycosyltransferases were constructed and characterized. Each mutant was complemented with the representative wild-type genes in trans to restore expression of parental LOS and confirm the function of each enzyme. Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization mass spectrometry and SDS-PAGE analysis identified several unique LOS glycoforms containing di-, tri-, and poly-N-acetyllactosamine repeats added to the terminal region of the main LOS branch synthesized by the heptosyltransferase III mutant. These novel H. ducreyi mutants provide important tools for studying the regulation of LOS assembly and biosynthesis.
TI  - Development of a serological test for Haemophilus ducreyi for seroprevalence studies.
AB  - We developed a new enzyme immunoassay (rpEIA) for use in determining the seroprevalence of chancroid. Three highly conserved outer membrane proteins from Haemophilus ducreyi strain 35000 were cloned, overexpressed, and purified from Escherichia coli for use as antigens in the rpEIA. Serum specimens from patients with and without chancroid were assayed to determine optimum sensitivity and specificity and to establish cutoff values. On the basis of these data, rpEIA was found to be both sensitive and specific when used to test a variety of serum specimens from patients with genital ulcers and urethritis and from healthy blood donors.
TI  - Stable shuttle vectors for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus spp. and other bacteria based on a single origin of replication.
AB  - An origin of replication (ori) was obtained from a naturally occurring beta-lactamase-producing plasmid isolated from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and used to construct shuttle vectors capable of replicating in N. gonorrhoeae, Haemophilus ducreyi, Haemophilus influenzae and Escherichia coli. Using the gonococcal proAB genes, we complemented proline-requiring N. gonorrhoeae F62 and E. coli HB101 in trans. The first demonstration of the expression of the green fluorescent protein (GFP) in either N. gonorrhoeae or H. ducreyi was shown using this vector, indicating that GFP may be a useful tool in the analysis of these organisms. This is the first report of a gonococcal vector based on a broad host range, genetically defined ori, and should facilitate the molecular analysis of gonococcal and Haemophilus genes.
TI  - Etiology of genital ulcer disease in Dakar, Senegal, and comparison of PCR and serologic assays for detection of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We used PCR assays to determine the etiology of genital ulcers in patients presenting to a sexually transmitted disease clinic in Dakar, Senegal, and evaluated the ability of two PCR tests (groEL and recD) and two serological tests (adsorption enzyme immunoassay [EIA] and lipooligosaccharide [LOS] EIA) to detect current Haemophilus ducreyi infection. We found that in this population, H. ducreyi, T. pallidum, and herpes simplex virus HSV DNA were detected in 56, 15, and 13% of 39 genital ulcer specimens, respectively, and H. ducreyi DNA was detected in 60% (3 of 5) of samples from ulcerated bubos. Among 40 consecutive patients with genital ulcer disease and with sufficient sample for both PCR assays, the recD and groEL H. ducreyi PCR assays were 83% concordant, with the recD PCR assay detecting six (15%) additional positive specimens and the groEL assay detecting one (3%) additional positive specimen. Compared to PCR, the adsorption EIA and LOS EIA tests had sensitivities of 71 and 59% and specificities of 57 and 90%, respectively, for the diagnosis of current H. ducreyi infection. While these differences in specificity could be due either to previous infection with H. ducreyi or to the detection of cross-reacting antibodies, only 6% of patients from a nearby family planning clinic gave a positive reaction in both the adsorption EIA and LOS EIA assays, indicating that cross-reacting antibodies are not prevalent among clinic attendees in this city. Our studies indicate that the adsorption EIA detects both current and past infection, while the LOS EIA assay is more specific for current infection with H. ducreyi in this population.
TI  - Examination of early interactions between Haemophilus ducreyi and host cells by using cocultured HaCaT keratinocytes and foreskin fibroblasts.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of chancroid, a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease. Keratinocytes are likely the first cell type encountered by H. ducreyi upon infection of human skin; thus, the interaction between H. ducreyi and keratinocytes is probably important for the ability of H. ducreyi to establish infection. We have used the HaCaT keratinocyte cell line grown in monolayers and in cocultures with HS27 fibroblasts to investigate H. ducreyi interactions with keratinocytes and the host-cell response to H. ducreyi infection. Using quantitative adherence and gentamicin protection assays, we determined that approximately 13% of H. ducreyi adhered to HaCaT cell monolayers, while only a small proportion (0.0052%) was intracellular. By transmission electron microscopy, we observed numerous H. ducreyi organisms adherent to but rarely within HaCaT cells cocultured with fibroblasts. Both live H. ducreyi and purified H. ducreyi lipooligosaccharide (LOS) induced significant interleukin 8 (IL-8) expression from HaCaT cell-HS27 cell cocultures. However, the level of IL-8 expression in response to LOS alone was not as pronounced. H. ducreyi LOS was a more potent inducer of IL-8 from cocultures than Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) at the same concentration, suggesting a unique effect of H. ducreyi LOS on cocultures. Neither live H. ducreyi nor purified H. ducreyi LOS or E. coli LPS induced tumor necrosis factor alpha expression from cocultures. H. ducreyi induced drastically different cytokine profiles from cocultures than from HS27 or HaCaT cells cultured separately. IL-8 expression by skin cells in response to H. ducreyi infection in vivo may be responsible for the massive influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other inflammatory cells to the site of infection. This influx of inflammatory cells may be partly responsible for the tissue destruction characteristic of chancroid.
TI  - Identification of the znuA-encoded periplasmic zinc transport protein of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The znuA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi encodes a 32-kDa (mature) protein that has homology to both the ZnuA protein of Escherichia coli and the Pzp1 protein of H. influenzae; both of these latter proteins are members of a growing family of prokaryotic zinc transporters. Inactivation of the H. ducreyi 35000 znuA gene by insertional mutagenesis resulted in a mutant that grew more slowly than the wild-type parent strain in vitro unless ZnCl(2) was provided at a final concentration of 100 microM. Other cations tested did not restore growth of this H. ducreyi mutant to wild-type levels. The H. ducreyi ZnuA protein was localized to the periplasm, where it is believed to function as the binding component of a zinc transport system. Complementation of the znuA mutation with the wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene provided in trans restored the ability of this H. ducreyi mutant to grow normally in the absence of exogenously added ZnCl2. The wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene was also able to complement a H. influenzae pzp1 mutation. The H. ducreyi znuA isogenic mutant exhibited significantly decreased virulence (P = 0.0001) when tested in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid. This decreased virulence was not observed when the znuA mutant was complemented with the wild-type H. ducreyi znuA gene provided in trans.
TI  - Characterization of a Haemophilus ducreyi mutant deficient in expression of cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi expresses a soluble cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) that kills HeLa, HEp-2, and other human epithelial cells in vitro. H. ducreyi CDT activity is encoded by a three-gene cluster (cdtABC), and antibody to the cdtC gene product can neutralize CDT activity in vitro (L. D. Cope, S. R. Lumbley, J. L. Latimer, J. Klesney-Tait, M. K. Stevens, L. S. Johnson, M. Purven, R. S. Munson, Jr., T. Lagergard, J. D. Radolf, and E. J. Hansen, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94:4056-4061, 1997). Culture supernatant fluid from a recombinant Escherichia coli strain containing the H. ducreyi cdtABC gene cluster readily killed both HeLa cells and HaCaT keratinocytes and had a modest inhibitory effect on the growth of human foreskin fibroblasts. Insertional inactivation of the cdtC gene in this recombinant E. coli strain eliminated the ability of this strain to kill HeLa cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. This mutated H. ducreyi cdtABC gene cluster was used to construct an isogenic H. ducreyi cdtC mutant. Monoclonal antibodies against the H. ducreyi CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins were used to characterize protein expression by this cdtC mutant. Culture supernatant fluid from this H. ducreyi cdtC mutant did not detectably affect any of the human cells used in this study. The presence of the wild-type H. ducreyi cdtC gene in trans in this H. ducreyi mutant restored its ability to express a CDT that killed both HeLa cells and HaCaT keratinocytes. The isogenic H. ducreyi cdtC mutant was shown to be as virulent as its wild-type parent strain in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for experimental chancroid. Lack of expression of the H. ducreyi CdtC protein also did not affect the ability of this H. ducreyi mutant to survive in the skin of rabbits.
TI  - The dnaK/dnaJ operon of Haemophilus ducreyi contains a unique combination of regulatory elements.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, which causes the genital ulcer disease chancroid, requires high basal levels of the 60-kDa heat-shock (hs) protein GroEL in order to survive and adhere to host cells in the presence of common environmental stresses. In contrast, the 70-kDa hs protein, DnaK, a negative modulator of the hs response in prokaryotes, is not produced at as high a level as GroEL. Because of these differences, we were interested in identifying regulatory elements affecting the expression of the H. ducreyi dnaK/dnaJ operon. First, the genes encoding H. ducreyi DnaK (Hsp70) and DnaJ (Hsp40) were sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences shared 82.8 and 63. 9% identity with the Escherichia coli DnaK and DnaJ homologs, respectively. Despite the presence of highly similar (but not identical) hs promoter sequences preceding both the H. ducreyi groES/groEL and dnaK/dnaJ operons, transcription levels for groEL were found to exceed that of dnaK. Subsequently, other genetic elements that could contribute to a lower basal expression of dnaK in H. ducreyi were identified. These elements include: (1) a complex promoter for dnaK consisting of four transcriptional start points (two for sigma32 and two for sigma70) identified by primer extension; (2) a putative binding site for Fur (a transcriptional repressor of iron-regulated genes) that overlaps the initiating AUG of dnaK; and (3) the potential for extensive secondary structure of the long leader sequences of the dnaK transcripts, which could interfere with efficient translation of DnaK. This unique combination of regulatory elements may be responsible for the relatively low-level expression of dnaK in this fastidious genital pathogen.
TI  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans immunosuppressive protein is a member of the family of cytolethal distending toxins capable of causing a G2 arrest in human T cells.
AB  - We have previously shown that Actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor (ISF) capable of impairing human lymphocyte function by perturbing cell cycle progression. We now report that ISF is the product of the cdtB gene, one of three genes encoding the family of cytolethal distending toxins (Cdt). The ISF polypeptide exhibits >/=95% identity with Hemophilus ducreyi CdtB protein and </=60% homology with Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni CdtB. Pretreatment of PHA-activated lymphocytes with 5-25 ng ISF results in G2 arrest of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Similarly, treatment of HeLa cells results in G2 arrest and cell elongation and distension. However, lymphocytes are at least 5 times more sensitive to ISF than HeLa cells and do not undergo the elongation and distension that characterizes interactions of Cdts with cell lines. ISF-treated lymphocytes express normal cyclin A and B1 levels, but contain reduced levels of cell cycle-dependent kinase-1 (Cdk1). Additionally, the majority of Cdk1 is in the hyperphosphorylated, inactive, form. In contrast, PHA-induced G2 cells contain elevated levels of the hypophosphorylated, active Cdk1. Failure of ISF-treated cells to dephosphorylate Cdk1 is not associated with decreased availability of Cdc25. These studies suggest that the CdtB protein alone is capable of inducing G2 arrest in lymphocytes and cell cycle arrest, elongation, and distension of HeLa cells. Our studies also suggest that lymphocytes may be primary targets for A. actinomycetemcomitans CdtB (ISF) and possibly for other Cdt family members as well. Thus, Cdts may function to impair host immunity and contribute to the pathogenesis of disease associated with Cdt-producing organisms.
TI  - Identification of a cytolethal distending toxin gene locus and features of a virulence-associated region in Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - A genetic locus for a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) was identified in a polymorphic region of the chromosome of Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, a predominant oral pathogen. The locus was comprised of three open reading frames (ORFs) that had significant amino acid sequence similarity and more than 90% sequence identity to the cdtABC genes of some pathogenic Escherichia coli strains and Haemophilus ducreyi, respectively. Sonic extracts from recombinant E. coli, containing the A. actinomycetemcomitans ORFs, caused the distension and killing of Chinese hamster ovary cells characteristic of a CDT. Monoclonal antibodies made reactive with the CdtA, CdtB, and CdtC proteins of H. ducreyi recognized the corresponding gene products from the recombinant strain. CDT-like activities were no longer expressed by the recombinant strain when an OmegaKan-2 interposon was inserted into the cdtA and cdtB genes. Expression of the CDT-like activities in A. actinomycetemcomitans was strain specific. Naturally occurring expression-negative strains had large deletions within the region of the cdt locus. The cdtABC genes were flanked by an ORF (virulence plasmid protein), a partial ORF (integrase), and DNA sequences (bacteriophage integration site) characteristic of virulence-associated regions. These results provide evidence for a functional CDT in a human oral pathogen.
TI  - Haemophilus ducreyi produces a novel sialyltransferase. Identification of the sialyltransferase gene and construction of mutants deficient in the production of the sialic acid-containing glycoform of the lipooligosaccharide.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, the cause of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid produces a lipooligosaccharide (LOS) containing a terminal sialyl N-acetyllactosamine trisaccharide. Previously, we reported the identification and characterization of the N-acetylneuraminic acid cytidylsynthetase gene (neuA). Forty-nine base pairs downstream of the synthetase gene is an open reading frame (ORF) encoding a protein with a predicted molecular weight of 34,646. This protein has weak homology to the polysialyltransferase of Escherichia coli K92. Downstream of this ORF is the gene encoding the H. ducreyi homologue of the Salmonella typhimurium rmlB gene. Mutations were constructed in the neuA gene and the gene encoding the second ORF by insertion of an Omega kanamycin cassette, and isogenic strains were constructed. LOS was isolated from each strain and characterized by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, carbohydrate, and mass spectrometric analysis. LOS isolated from strains containing a mutation in neuA or in the second ORF, designated lst, lacked the sialic acid-containing glycoform. Complementation studies were performed. The neuA gene and the lst gene were each cloned into the shuttle vector pLS88 after polymerase chain reaction amplification. Complementation of the mutation in the lst gene was observed, but we were unable to complement the neuA mutation. Since it is possible that transcription of the neuA gene and the lst gene were coupled, we constructed a nonpolar mutation in the neuA gene. In this construct, the neuA mutation was complemented, suggesting transcriptional coupling of the neuA gene and the lst gene. Sialyltransferase activity was detected by incorporation of 14C-labeled NeuAc from CMP-NeuAc into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material when the lst gene was overexpressed in the nonpolar neuA mutant. We conclude that the lst gene encodes the H. ducreyi sialyltransferase. Since the lst gene product has little, if any, structural relationship to other sialyltransferases, this protein represents a new class of sialyltransferase.
TI  - The cell cycle-specific growth-inhibitory factor produced by Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans is a cytolethal distending toxin.
AB  - Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans has been shown to produce a soluble cytotoxic factor(s) distinct from leukotoxin. We have identified in A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4 a cluster of genes encoding a cytolethal distending toxin (CDT). This new member of the CDT family is similar to the CDT produced by Haemophilus ducreyi. The CDT from A. actinomycetemcomitans was produced in Escherichia coli and was able to induce cell distension, growth arrest in G2/M phase, nucleus swelling, and chromatin fragmentation in HeLa cells. The three proteins, CDTA, -B and -C, encoded by the cdt locus were all required for toxin activity. Antiserum raised against recombinant CDTC completely inhibited the cytotoxic activity of culture supernatant and cell homogenate fractions of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. These results strongly suggest that the CDT is responsible for the cytotoxic activity present in the culture supernatant and cell homogenate fractions of A. actinomycetemcomitans Y4. This CDT is a new putative virulence factor of A. actinomycetemcomitans and may play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Involvement of the Haemophilus ducreyi gmhA gene product in lipooligosaccharide expression and virulence.
AB  - The lipooligosaccharide (LOS) present in the outer membrane of Haemophilus ducreyi is likely a virulence factor for this sexually transmitted pathogen. An open reading frame in H. ducreyi 35000 was found to encode a predicted protein that had 87% identity with the protein product of the gmhA (isn) gene of Haemophilus influenzae. In H. influenzae type b, inactivation of the gmhA gene caused the synthesis of a significantly truncated LOS which possessed only lipid A and a single 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid molecule (A. Preston, D. J. Maskell, A. Johnson, and E. R. Moxon, J. Bacteriol. 178:396-402, 1996). The H. ducreyi gmhA gene was able to complement a gmhA-deficient Escherichia coli strain, a result which confirmed the identity of this gene. When the gmhA gene of H. ducreyi was inactivated by insertion of a cat cartridge, the resultant H. ducreyi gmhA mutant, 35000.252, expressed a LOS that migrated much faster than wild-type LOS in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. When the wild-type H. ducreyi strain and its isogenic gmhA mutant were used in the temperature-dependent rabbit model for dermal lesion production by H. ducreyi, the gmhA mutant was found to be substantially less virulent than the wild-type parent strain. The H. ducreyi gmhA gene was amplified by PCR from the H. ducreyi chromosome and cloned into the pLS88 vector. When the H. ducreyi gmhA gene was present in trans in gmhA mutant 35000.252, expression of the gmhA gene product restored the virulence of this mutant to wild-type levels. These results indicate that the gmhA gene product of H. ducreyi is essential for the expression of wild-type LOS by this pathogen.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of tdhA, a locus encoding a TonB-dependent heme receptor from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is unable to synthesize heme and must acquire it from its only known host, humans. We cloned and sequenced a gene encoding an outer membrane receptor for heme. It was designated tdhA (for TonB-dependent heme receptor A) since it was related by sequence homology to the family of TonB-dependent receptors. TdhA was strikingly similar to open reading frame HI0113 from the genome of Haemophilus influenzae Rd and also shared homology with five other heme receptors, including HxuC, HemR, HmuR, ChuA, and ShuA, from gram-negative bacteria. An Escherichia coli hemA tonB mutant strongly expressing H. ducreyi tdhA grew on low levels of heme as a source of heme only when an intact H. ducreyi Ton system plasmid was present, formally demonstrating functional TonB dependence. tdhA was expressed poorly in vitro by H. ducreyi and only under conditions of heme limitation. A survey of H. ducreyi revealed that all tested strains but one synthesized small amounts of TdhA in vitro under heme-limiting conditions. Surprisingly, an isogenic mutant of tdhA as well as its parent, 35000, both required the same high levels of heme for growth (50 microgram/ml [77 microM] on agar medium). This result, together with previous findings, suggests that in vitro, the uptake of heme by H. ducreyi is mediated by a TonB- and TdhA-independent mechanism, possibly diffusion.
TI  - The sodA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi encodes a hydrogen peroxide-inhibitable superoxide dismutase.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is the etiologic agent of the sexually transmitted disease chancroid, an ulcerative condition implicated in increased HIV transmission. There is increasing evidence for the roles of oxidative stress proteins including superoxide dismutase enzymes in the survival and persistence of pathogenic organisms within the host. The sodA gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was isolated from a genomic plasmid library on the basis of its ability to rescue the hydrogen peroxide hypersensitivity of an Escherichia coli sodA sodB strain. The H. ducreyi SodA protein also complemented the aerobic growth defect of the E. coli sodA sodB strain in minimal medium. The deduced amino-acid sequence of the H. ducreyi sodA gene product is 74 and 70% identical to the Mn-SODs of Haemophilus influenzae and E. coli, respectively. However, unlike Mn-SODs, the H ducreyi SodA protein was inhibited by hydrogen peroxide in native gels stained for SOD activity.
TI  - Periplasmic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase protects Haemophilus ducreyi from exogenous superoxide.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi causes chancroid, a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease implicated in increased heterosexual transmission of HIV. As part of an effort to identify H. ducreyi gene products involved in virulence and pathogenesis, we created random TnphoA insertion mutations in an H. ducreyi 35000 library cloned in Escherichia coli. Inserts encoding exported or secreted PhoA fusion proteins were characterized by DNA sequencing. One such clone encoded a Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzyme. The Cu-Zn SOD was periplasmic in H. ducreyi and accounted for most of the detectable SOD activity in whole-cell lysates of H. ducreyi grown in vitro. To investigate the function of the Cu-Zn SOD, we created a Cu-Zn SOD-deficient H. ducreyi strain by inserting a cat cassette into the sodC gene. The wild-type and Cu-Zn SOD null mutant strains were equally resistant to excess cytoplasmic superoxide induced by paraquat, demonstrating that the Cu-Zn SOD did not function in the detoxification of cytoplasmic superoxide. However, the Cu-Zn SOD null strain was significantly more susceptible to killing by extracellular superoxide than the wild type. This result suggests that the H. ducreyi Cu-Zn SOD may play a role in bacterial defence against oxidative killing by host immune cells during infection.
TI  - Role of the Haemophilus ducreyi Ton system in internalization of heme from hemoglobin.
AB  - By cloning into Escherichia coli and construction of isogenic mutants of Haemophilus ducreyi, we showed that the hemoglobin receptor (HgbA) is TonB dependent. An E. coli hemA tonB mutant expressing H. ducreyi hgbA grew on low levels of hemoglobin as a source of heme only when an intact H. ducreyi Ton system plasmid was present. In contrast, growth on heme by the E. coli hemA tonB mutant expressing hgbA was observed only at high concentrations of heme, was TonB independent, and demonstrated that H. ducreyi HgbA was not sufficient to function as a typical TonB-dependent heme receptor in E. coli. Allelic replacement of the wild-type H. ducreyi exbB, exbD, and tonB loci with the exbB, exbD, and tonB deletion resulted in an H. ducreyi isogenic mutant unable to utilize hemoglobin but able to utilize hemin at the same levels as the parent strain to fulfill its heme requirement. This finding confirms the TonB dependence of HgbA-mediated hemoglobin utilization and suggests that uptake of hemin in H. ducreyi is TonB independent. Additionally, the H. ducreyi Ton system mutant synthesized increased amounts of HgbA and other heme-regulated outer membrane proteins, consistent with derepression of these proteins due to lower intracellular heme and/or iron concentrations in the mutant. Sequencing of the Ton system genes revealed that the arrangement of the genes was exbB exbD tonB. The proximity and structure of these genes suggested that they are transcribed as an operon. This arrangement, as well as the DNA and deduced amino acid sequences of these H. ducreyi genes, was most similar to those from other pasteurellae.
TI  - Characterization of a transposon Tn916-generated mutant of Haemophilus ducreyi 35000 defective in lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis.
AB  - To define the role of the surface lipooligosaccharide (LOS) of Haemophilus ducreyi in the pathogenesis of chancroid, Tn916 mutants of H. ducreyi 35000 defective in expression of the murine monoclonal antibody (MAb) 3F11 epitope on H. ducreyi LOS were identified by immunologic screening. One mutant, designated 1381, has an LOS which lacks the MAb 3F11 epitope and migrates with an increased mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The gene disrupted by the Tn916 element in strain 1381 was identified by cloning the sequences flanking the Tn916 element. The sequences were then used to probe a lambda DASHII genomic library. In strain 1381, Tn916 interrupts a gene which encodes an open reading frame (ORF) with an Mr of 40,246. This ORF has homology to the product of the rfaK gene of Escherichia coli. The major LOS glycoform produced by strain 1381 was analyzed by using a combination of mass spectrometry, linkage and composition analysis, and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The major LOS species was found to terminate in a single glucose attached to the heptose (L-glycero-D-manno-heptose, or Hep) trisaccharide core. In the wild-type strain 35000, glucose serves as the acceptor for the addition of the D-glycero-D-manno-heptose (or DDHep), which extends to form the mature branch of the H. ducreyi LOS. This mature oligosaccharide is in turn partially capped by the addition of sialic acid (NeuAc), i.e., NeuAc2 alpha-->3Gal beta1-->4GlcNAc beta1-->3Gal beta1-->4DDHep alpha1-->6Glc beta1 (W. Melaugh et al., Biochemistry 33:13070-13078, 1994). Since this LOS terminates prior to the addition of the branch DD-heptose, this gene is likely to encode the D-glycero-D-manno-heptosyltransferase. Strain 1381 exhibits a significant reduction in adherence to and invasion of primary human keratinocytes. This defect was complemented by the cloned heptosyltransferase gene, indicating that the terminal portion of the LOS oligosaccharide plays an important role in adherence to human keratinocytes.
TI  - Alterations in levels of DnaK and GroEL result in diminished survival and adherence of stressed Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi is a hemin-requiring bacterium causing the genital ulcer disease chancroid. Previously we demonstrated that the heat shock protein GroEL was immunogenic and possibly highly expressed in a mammalian host. The present study was initiated to (i) determine the relative amounts of GroEL expressed by H. ducreyi during in vitro exposure to stresses and (ii) evaluate whether a high level of GroEL is directly or indirectly required for survival and adherence of stressed H. ducreyi. Using scanning densitometry of sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis protein profiles, we found that H. ducreyi expressed high basal levels of GroEL, averaging fivefold greater than in Escherichia coli. These high GroEL levels increased up to twofold upon exposure of the organism to heat shock or high levels of hydrogen peroxide and during adherence to two human genital cell lines. Furthermore, when the gene for DnaK was present on a multicopy plasmid in H. ducreyi, a 1.8-fold increase in DnaK and a 2.3-fold reduction in GroEL were seen. These results suggest that DnaK serves as a negative modulator of H. ducreyi GroEL. Subsequently we found that H. ducreyi with lower GroEL had diminished ability to survive when challenged by heat and oxidative stresses. In addition, the long, parallel chains characteristic of virulent strains of H. ducreyi were absent when GroEL was lowered, so that fewer bacterial cells adhered to the human cells. These results suggest that the unusually high basal levels of GroEL are involved, either directly or indirectly, in the survival, chaining, and adherence of H. ducreyi in the presence of the combined stresses of the host environment.
TI  - Iron-regulated haemolysin gene from Edwardsiella tarda.
AB  - We have cloned and sequenced the haemolysin gene locus from Edwardsiella tarda (ETH). This region encoded two open reading frames, designated ethA and ethB. ethA is the haemolysin gene consisting of 4782bp encoding a product of 165.3 kDa and ethB is an activation/secretion protein gene of 1677bp that encodes a product of 61.9 kDa. There were two putative ferric uptake regulator (Fur) binding sites on the 5' upstream region of the ethB gene overlapping the promoter region and ribosome-binding site. The haemolysin produced by the cloned gene was secreted by Escherichia coli. The deduced amino acid sequences of the ethA and ethB genes were found to be homologous to those of the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi, Proteus mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens. E. coli carrying the ethA gene but not the ethB gene completely lost haemolytic activity, although the ethA gene was transcribed. The protein expressed by E. coli carrying a recombinant plasmid which encoded the ethA gene had haemagglutination activity. The EthB protein was necessary for activation of EthA protein (haemolysin). The ethA and ethB genes were very prevalent in haemolytic E. tarda strains isolated from diseased fish. Transcription of the ethB gene was regulated by iron. The ethA and ethB genes were transcribed independently.
TI  - A diffusible cytotoxin of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Little is known about the virulence mechanisms employed by Haemophilus ducreyi in the production of genital ulcers. This Gram-negative bacterium previously has been shown to produce a soluble cytotoxic activity that kills HeLa and HEp-2 cells. We have now identified a cluster of three H. ducreyi genes that encode this cytotoxic activity. The predicted proteins encoded by these genes are most similar to the products of the Escherichia coli cdtABC genes that comprise the cytolethal distending toxin (CDT) of this enteric pathogen. Eleven of 12 H. ducreyi strains were shown to possess this gene cluster and culture supernatants from these strains readily killed HeLa cells. The culture supernatant from a single strain of H. ducreyi that lacked these genes was unable to kill HeLa cells. When the H. ducreyi cdtABC gene cluster was cloned into E. coli, culture supernatant from the recombinant E. coli clone killed HeLa cells. A monoclonal antibody that neutralized this soluble cytotoxic activity of H. ducreyi was shown to bind to the H. ducreyi cdtC gene product. This soluble H. ducreyi cytotoxin may play a role in the development or persistence of the ulcerative lesions characteristic of chancroid.
TI  - The major outer membrane protein of Haemophilus ducreyi consists of two OmpA homologs.
AB  - The major outer membrane protein (MOMP) of Haemophilus ducreyi is an OmpA homolog that migrates on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels as three species with apparent molecular weights ranging from 37,000 to 43,000. Monoclonal antibodies directed against this macromolecule were used to identify recombinant clones containing fragments of the gene encoding this protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis of these fragments confirmed that the MOMP encoded by the intact gene (momp) was a member of the OmpA family of outer membrane proteins. Construction of an isogenic H. ducreyi mutant unable to express the MOMP led to the discovery of a second outer membrane protein which migrated at the same rate on SDS-PAGE gels as the MOMP. N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis of this second protein revealed that its N terminus was nearly identical to that of the MOMP and also had homology with members of the OmpA family. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the region downstream from the momp gene revealed the presence of a partial open reading frame encoding a predicted OmpA-like protein. A modification of anchored PCR technology was used to obtain the nucleotide sequence of this downstream gene which was shown to encode a second OmpA homolog (OmpA2). The N-terminal amino acid sequence of OmpA2 was identical to that of the OmpA-like protein detected in the momp mutant. The H. ducreyi MOMP and OmpA2 proteins, which comigrated on SDS-PAGE gels and which were encoded by the tandem arranged momp and ompA2 genes, were 72% identical.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the exbB-exbD-tonB locus of Pasteurella haemolytica A1.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid (pMG1) carrying Pasteurella haemolytica A1 DNA which complements a tonB mutation of Escherichia coli has been isolated. E. coli tonB metE which carries pMG1 exhibits growth kinetics in the presence of vitamin B12 similar to that of the wild-type host. In addition, the complemented E. coli is susceptible to killing by bacteriophage phi 80 and colicin B. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence in the complementing DNA showed that it codes for three genes in the order of exbB-exbD-tonB. This genetic organization has been reported in Haemophilus influenzae, H. ducreyi, Pseudomonas putida and Vibrio cholerae, and may represent a separate lineage of evolution from that of the Enterobacteriaceae in which tonB is unlinked with the accessory genes exbB and exbD. A comparison of the DNA flanking the exbB-exbD-tonB locus in P. haemolytica A1 and H. influenzae showed that the flanking regions are completely different between the two organisms.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of the gene encoding the Cu,Zn-superoxide dismutase of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The sodC gene of Haemophilus ducreyi was cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino  acid sequence of this protein exhibited 71.6% identity and 81.8% similarity to the H. influenzae and H. parainfluenzae copper (Cu), zinc (Zn)-superoxide dismutase (SOD) enzymes. This gene was localized to a 2.2-kb H. ducreyi chromosomal DNA insert in plasmid pHdSOD. SOD activity was expressed in cell-free extracts of Escherichia coli containing the recombinant plasmid pHdSOD and was localized to the periplasmic space. The Cu,Zn-SOD produced by the H. ducreyi sodC gene did not complement the aerobic growth defect of an E. coli SOD-deficient mutant.
TI  - Characterization of a novel lipoprotein expressed by Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Pooled sera from patients with chancroid contain antibodies to a Haemophilus ducreyi antigen with an approximate molecular weight of 28,000 (28K). Rabbit polyclonal serum that reacts to a 28K protein can be used to detect H. ducreyi in clinical samples. A monoclonal antibody, designated 5C9, bound to a 28K outer membrane protein and to 35 of 35 H. ducreyi isolates with diverse geographic origins and did not bind to many species of the families Pasteurellaceae, Neisseriaceae, and Enterobacteriaceae or to Corynebacterium and Candida species strains. A 5C9-reactive phage was recovered from a genomic library, and the gene encoding the 28K protein was localized to a 626-bp open reading frame, designated hlp, for H. ducreyi lipoprotein. Translation of hlp predicted a 23K polypeptide that contained a lipoprotein processing site. Escherichia coli transformed with a plasmid containing hlp expressed a novel, membrane-associated protein that could be labeled with [3H]palmitic acid. In H. ducreyi, processing of Hlp was inhibited by globomycin. Database searches found no homologies to hlp or to the predicted Hlp amino acid sequence. Restriction enzyme analysis indicated that hlp was conserved among H. ducreyi isolates. Serum samples from patients with chancroid and other genital ulcer diseases and from normal subjects contained antibodies that bound to purified, recombinant Hlp. Although monoclonal antibody 5C9 recognizes a species-specific epitope of a unique H. ducreyi lipoprotein, the presence of serum antibodies to Hlp may not indicate previous infection with H. ducreyi.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a Haemophilus ducreyi fur homolog.
AB  - Iron regulation in a growing number of bacterial species is being attributed to the presence of a fur (ferric uptake regulation) regulatory system. In the presence of iron, Fur acts as a classical negative regulator, binding conserved sequences within the promoter of iron-repressible genes and blocking transcription. Western blot analysis utilizing Escherichia coli Fur antisera detected a band of approximately 17 kDa in soluble extracts of Haemophilus ducreyi. Additionally, Southern blot hybridization of the H. ducreyi chromosome with a meningococcal fur probe indicated that H. ducreyi might contain a fur homolog. This putative fur homolog was cloned into the E. coli vector pACYC184. This clone was capable of repressing expression of a normally Furregulated lacZ fusion in the fur-background of E. coli strain H1780. The deduced amino acid sequence shows H. ducreyi fur to be 54% identical and 73% similar to E. coli fur, containing putative DNA-binding and metal-binding domains. These data demonstrate that H. ducreyi has a functional fur system.
TI  - Identification of an outer membrane protein involved in utilization of hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes by nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - A recombinant plasmid containing a 6.5-kb fragment of nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHI) chromosomal DNA was shown to confer a hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding phenotype on Escherichia coli. Use of a mini-Tn10kan transposon for random insertion mutagenesis of this recombinant plasmid allowed localization of the NTHI DNA responsible for this hemoglobin-haptoglobin-binding phenotype to a 3.5-kb PstI-XhoI fragment within the 6.5-kb NTHI DNA insert. When this mutagenized NTHI DNA fragment was used to transform the wild-type NTHI strain, the resultant kanamycin-resistant mutant exhibited significantly decreased abilities to bind hemoglobin-haptoglobin and utilize it as a source of heme for aerobic growth in vitro. This mutant also lacked expression of a 115-kDa outer membrane protein that was present in the wild-type parent strain. Transformation of this mutant with wild-type NTHI chromosomal DNA restored the abilities to bind and utilize hemoglobin-haptoglobin and to express the 115-kDa outer membrane protein. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the relevant NTHI DNA revealed the presence of a gene, designated hhuA, that encoded a predicted 117,145-Da protein. The HhuA protein exhibited features typical of a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor and had significant identity with the hemoglobin receptors of both Haemophilus ducreyi and Neisseria meningitidis.
TI  - Cloning of a DNA fragment encoding a heme-repressible hemoglobin-binding outer membrane protein from Haemophilus influenzae.
AB  - Haemophilus influenzae is able to use hemoglobin as a sole source of heme, and heme-repressible hemoglobin binding to the cell surface has been demonstrated. Using an affinity purification methodology, a hemoglobin-binding protein of approximately 120 kDa was isolated from H. influenzae type b strain HI689 grown in heme-restricted but not in heme-replete conditions. The isolated protein was subjected to N-terminal amino acid sequencing, and the derived amino acid sequence was used to design corresponding oligonucleotides. The oligonucleotides were used to probe a Southern blot of EcoRI-digested HI689 genomic DNA. A hybridizing band of approximately 4.2 kb was successfully cloned into pUC19. Using a 1.9-kb internal BglII fragment of the 4.2-kb clone as a probe, hybridization was seen in both typeable and nontypeable H. influenzae but not in other bacterial species tested. Following partial nucleotide sequencing of the 4.2-kb insert, a putative open reading frame was subcloned into an expression vector. The host Escherichia coli strain in which the cloned fragment was expressed bound biotinylated human hemoglobin, whereas binding of hemoglobin was not detected in E. coli with the vector alone. In conclusion, we hypothesize that the DNA fragment encoding an approximately 120-kDa heme-repressible hemoglobin-binding protein mediates one step in the acquisition of hemoglobin by H. influenzae in vivo.
TI  - Purification, cloning, and expression of a cytidine 5'-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - An N-acetylneuraminic acid cytidylyltransferase (EC 2.7.7.43) (CMP-NeuAc synthetase) was isolated from a Haemophilus ducreyi strain 35000 cell lysate and partially characterized. The enzyme catalyzes the reaction of CTP and NeuAc to form CMP-NeuAc, which is the nucleotide sugar donor used by sialyltransferases. Previous studies have shown that the outer membrane lipooligosaccharides of H. ducreyi contain terminal sialic acid attached to N-acetyllactosamine and that this modification is likely important to its pathogenesis. Therefore, to investigate the role of sialic acid in H. ducreyi pathogenesis, the gene encoding the CMP-NeuAc synthetase was cloned using degenerate oligonucleotide probes derived from NH2-terminal sequence data, and the nucleotide sequence was determined. The derived amino acid sequence of the CMP-NeuAc synthetase gene has homology to other CMP-NeuAc synthetases and to a lesser extent to CMP-2-keto-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid synthetases. The gene was cloned into a T7 expression vector, the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, and purified to apparent homogeneity by anion exchange, Green 19 dye, and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. The final step yielded 20 mg of pure protein/liter of culture. The protein has a predicted molecular mass of 25440.6 Da, which was confirmed by electrospray mass spectrometry (Mexpt = 25439.9 +/- 1.4 Da). The enzyme appears to exist as a dimer by size exclusion chromatography. In contrast to other bacterial CMP-NeuAc synthetases, the H. ducreyi enzyme exhibited a different substrate specificity, being capable of also using N-glycolylneuraminic acid as a substrate.
TI  - The conserved 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein of Haemophilus ducreyi has homology to PAL.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi expresses an 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein that contains a conserved surface-exposed epitope recognized by monoclonal antibody 3B9. Monoclonal antibody 3B9 cross-reacts with proteins of similar molecular weight found in many Haemophilus sp. strains, including P6, a candidate vaccine for Haemophilus influenzae. The gene encoding the 18,000-molecular-weight outer membrane protein was identified by screening a lambdagt11 genomic library with 3B9. The coding sequence of the gene was localized to a 471-bp open reading frame, designated pal (peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein). Translation of pal predicted a mature polypeptide with a molecular weight of 15,000 that had extensive homology with P6 and Escherichia coli PAL. The predicted signal peptide had features characteristic of a prokaryotic lipoprotein, and processing of PAL was sensitive to globomycin in H. ducreyi. The sequences encoding mature H. ducreyi PAL were subcloned into the vector pRSET B and expressed as a polyhistidine-containing fusion protein that bound 3B9. In Western blot (immunoblot) analysis, serum samples obtained from healthy subjects and patients with chancroid or other genital ulcer diseases contained antibodies to purified PAL. Antibodies that bound to PAL were removed by absorption with a lysate of Haemophilus sp. antigens, suggesting that patients with chancroid do not develop an H. ducreyi-specific antibody response to PAL.
TI  - Fine tangled pili expressed by Haemophilus ducreyi are a novel class of pili.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi synthesizes fine, tangled pili composed predominantly of a protein whose apparent molecular weight is 24,000 (24K). A hybridoma, 2D8, produced a monoclonal antibody (MAb) that bound to a 24K protein in H. ducreyi strains isolated from diverse geographic locations. A lambda gt11 H. ducreyi library was screened with MAb 2D8. A 3.5-kb chromosomal insert from one reactive plaque was amplified and ligated into the pCRII vector. The recombinant plasmid, designated pHD24, expressed a 24K protein in Escherichia coli INV alpha F that bound MAb 2D8. The coding sequence of the 24K gene was localized by exonuclease III digestion. The insert contained a 570-bp open reading frame, designated ftpA (fine, tangled pili). Translation of ftpA predicted a polypeptide with a molecular weight of 21.1K. The predicted N-terminal amino acid sequence of the polypeptide encoded by ftpA was identical to the N-terminal amino acid sequence of purified pilin and lacked a cleavable signal sequence. Primer extension analysis of ftpA confirmed the lack of a leader peptide. The predicted amino acid sequence lacked homology to known pilin sequences but shared homology with the sequences of E. coli Dps and Treponema pallidum antigen TpF1 or 4D, proteins which associate to form ordered rings. An isogenic pilin mutant, H. ducreyi 35000ftpA::mTn3(Cm), was constructed by shuttle mutagenesis and did not contain pili when examined by electron microscopy. We conclude that H. ducreyi synthesizes fine, tangled pili that are composed of a unique major subunit, which may be exported by a signal sequence independent mechanism.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of the genes encoding the hemolysin of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We previously identified a heat- and protease-labile haemolytic activity expressed by Haemophilus ducreyi. In order to characterize the haemolysin at the molecular level, genomic DNA from H. ducreyi was probed with haemolysin genes from other Gram-negative organisms. The haemolysin genes of Proteus mirabilis hybridized to H. ducreyi DNA suggesting that the haemolysin of H. ducreyi is related to the Proteus/Serratia pore-forming family of haemolysins. Tn916 mutagenesis was employed to isolate haemolysin-deficient mutants. Approximately 5000 Tn916 transposon mutants were screened for the loss of haemolytic activity and two mutants were identified. One mutant, designated 35,000-1, was further characterized. Sequences flanking the Tn916 element in strain 35,000-1 were employed to identify clones from a lambda DASHII library of H. ducreyi strain 35,000 DNA. A 13 kb insert from one lambda clone was selected for further study. This 13 kb fragment was able to both confer haemolytic activity to Escherichia coli and complement the haemolysin deficiency in strain 35,000-1. The haemolysin gene cluster was cloned from this 13 kb insert and two genes, designated hhdA and hhdB, were identified. The derived amino acid sequence of these genes demonstrated homology to the haemolysin and activation/secretion proteins of P. mirabilis and Serratia marcescens.
TI  - Laboratory diagnosis of chancroid using species-specific primers from Haemophilus ducreyi groEL and the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - To enhance laboratory identification of Haemophilus ducreyi, the causative agent  of the genital ulcer disease chancroid, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was developed using target DNA sequences from the essential H. ducreyi gene, groEL. Positive reactions were obtained in this PCR assay with 139 isolates of H. ducreyi from patients in worldwide locations from the 1940s to the 1990s. In contrast, 24 other bacterial species were negative. When genital ulcer specimens from 162 African patients with clinically diagnosed chancroid were evaluated, 66 were culture positive. The sensitivity of PCR as compared with culture was 89% (59 of 66), and specificity was 79% (76 of 96). However, representative samples of the 20 culture-negative, PCR-positive specimens were confirmed as positive by a second PCR assay using different H. ducreyi-specific primers. Thus, combined results of culture and PCR detected H. ducreyi in 86 specimens, with resolved sensitivities of 92% (79 of 86) for PCR, and 77% (66 of 86) for culture. These results suggest that PCR assays for H. ducreyi have great potential for augmenting or replacing problematic cultural techniques.
TI  - Characterization of the hemolytic activity of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - H. ducreyi is the causative agent of chancroid, a genital ulcer disease most prevalent in developing countries. Chancroid enhances the heterosexual transmission of human immunodeficiency virus and is identified in focal outbreaks in the United States, but little is known about its pathogenesis. We studied the hemolysin produced by H. ducreyi because this molecule might be an important virulence factor in the pathogenesis of chancroid. Ten strains of H. ducreyi were tested on newly devised blood agar plates and were found to have hemolytic activity. We examined the hemolytic activity of H. ducreyi 35000 further and found that it was heat labile, cell associated, greatest at pH 7.0, and produced in logarithmic- but not stationary-phase cultures. Using transposons Tn916 and Tn1545-delta 3, we have isolated three classes of transposon mutants of strain 35000: those with no detectable hemolytic activity, those with reduced hemolytic activity, and those with enhanced hemolytic activity. Transposon insertions in the nonhemolytic mutants were located in a DNA sequence which hybridized to the Proteus mirabilis hemolysin gene. Analysis of clones containing overlapping sections of this region served to further localize the H. ducreyi hemolysin gene and allow its expression in Escherichia coli and complementation of the nonhemolytic defect in an H. ducreyi mutant. These experiments indicate that H. ducreyi 35000 produces a hemolysin that is related to the calcium-independent hemolysin produced by P. mirabilis. Further experiments are needed to define the similarity of the H. ducreyi hemolysin to other calcium-independent hemolysins and to determine its role in the pathogenesis of chancroid.
TI  - Characterization of the hgbA locus encoding a hemoglobin receptor from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi can bind hemoglobin and use it as a source of heme, for which it has an obligate requirement. We previously identified and purified HgbA, a hemoglobin-binding outer membrane protein from H. ducreyi. In this report, we describe the molecular cloning, expression, DNA sequence, and mutagenesis of the structural gene for HgbA, hgbA. H. ducreyi and recombinant Escherichia coli expressing hgbA bound [125I]hemoglobin, establishing HgbA as a receptor. Insertions or deletions in the cloned hgbA gene abolished expression of HgbA and hemoglobin binding in E. coli. Mutagenesis of H. ducreyi by allelic exchange of insertions into hgbA abolished its ability to bind [125I]hemoglobin or utilize hemoglobin as a source of heme. The deduced protein sequence was similar to those of the TonB-dependent family of outer membrane receptors. The most similar member was HutA (heme receptor) from Vibrio cholerae. Tbp1 and Lbp1 (transferrin and lactoferrin receptors, respectively, from pathogenic Neisseria spp.) also showed very significant homology. Thus, by characterizing the hgbA locus, this work elucidates a potentially important role of HgbA in obtaining heme and/or iron from the host.
TI  - Haemophilus ducreyi adheres to human keratinocytes.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, Moraxella catarrhalis and a non-piliated Escherichia coli K-12 strain were studied for their ability to bind to human keratinocytes in vitro. Epidermal cells isolated from neonatal foreskins were grown to confluence in serum-free keratinocyte media. Probing of the monolayers with anti-cytokeratin antibody showed that 97% of cells were keratinocytes. Bacteria were grown to mid-log phase and seeded onto the monolayers. At various time-points monolayers were washed with PBS to remove non-adherent bacteria, and the monolayers were quantitatively cultured. After 120 min, 15 to 23% of the H. ducreyi inocula bound to the monolayer, while less than 1% of the M. catarrhalis or E. coli controls bound. Wet mounts of fixed monolayers observed with differential interference contrast microscopy confirmed the quantitative data. We conclude that H. ducreyi binds to keratinocytes and that this process may play a role in the initiation of chancroid.
TI  - Antigen detection and immunological typing of Haemophilus ducreyi with a specific rabbit polyclonal serum.
AB  - A rabbit polyclonal serum was raised against the 29-kDa species-specific marker,  as well as the 30- to 34-kDa immunotype-specific markers of Haemophilus ducreyi described elsewhere (E. Roggen, S. De Breucker, E. Van Dyck, and P. Piot, Infect. Immun. 60:590-595, 1992). These antigens were purified from a cocktail of H. ducreyi isolates by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The immune serum reacted in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) preferentially with H. ducreyi, at a titer as high as 50,000. To make it specific to H. ducreyi, nonspecific antibodies were removed by adsorption on a mixture of Haemophilus spp., Escherichia coli, Candida albicans, and Corynebacterium spp. In the 29- to 34-kDa region of immunoblot profiles from H. ducreyi isolates (n = 450), the adsorbed serum revealed essentially the same antigens as did a pool of well-characterized human sera. Yet, eight different immunotypes were observed. With this rabbit polyclonal serum, an ELISA-based antigen detection test was developed. The adsorbed serum reacted specifically with all H. ducreyi isolates tested (n = 450), but not with other bacterial species (n = 15). This test was evaluated with a limited number of clinical specimens from African patients with culture-proven chancroid and no evidence for any other ulcerating etiology (n = 10) and a number of chancroid-negative control patients from Belgium (n = 20). Within this context, the test yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 100%.
TI  - Investigation of the structural heterogeneity of lipooligosaccharides from pathogenic Haemophilus and Neisseria species and of R-type lipopolysaccharides from Salmonella typhimurium by electrospray mass spectrometry.
AB  - Heterogeneity in the lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of pathogenic Haemophilus and Neisseria species is evident from the multiplicity of components observed with electrophoretic analyses. Knowledge of the precise structures that make up these diverse LOS molecules is clearly the key to reaching an understanding of pathogenic processes such as phase variation and molecular mimicry. Except for a few cases, little is known about the specific structural features of LOS that underlie phase variation and molecular mimicry, partly because of the inherent difficulties in the structural elucidation of these complex glycolipids. In the lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli, rough, or R-type, mutants have been isolated that have provided insight into the biosynthetic pathways and associated genetics that control LPS expression. Nonetheless, recent work has shown that these R-type LPS are more complex than originally thought, and significant heterogeneity is still observed, primarily in their phosphorylation states. In order to investigate the structures of LPS and LOS in a more rapid fashion, we have determined the precise molecular weights of LOS (and LPS) preparations from various Haemophilus, Neisseria, and Salmonella species by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. The LOS (or LPS) were first O-deacylated under mild hydrazine conditions to remove O-linked esters primarily from the lipid A portion. Under negative-ion conditions, the O-deacylated LOS yield abundant multiply deprotonated molecular ions, (M-nH)n-, where n refers to the number of protons removed and therefore determines the absolute charge state, n = z. Mass spectra from different LOS and LPS preparations have provided detailed information concerning the structural basis for LOS (and LPS) heterogeneity and corresponding saccharide compositions. The identification of sialic acid in the LOS of Haemophilus and Neisseria species and the variable phosphorylation of the core of S. typhimurium LPS have afforded insights into the biosynthetic pathways used by these organisms. Information of this type is important for understanding the underlying genetic and environmental factors controlling LOS and LPS expression.
TI  - Non-radioactive ribotyping of Haemophilus ducreyi using a digoxigenin labelled cDNA probe.
AB  - Haemophilus ducreyi, the causal organism of chancroid, has increased in significance recently due to its association with HIV transmission. Most previous typing systems have exploited phenotypic characteristics. Detection of ribosomal RNA cistrons, ribotyping, was successfully developed to examine H. ducreyi, but required the use of 32P. We have used digoxigenin to define ribotypes from 30 strains of H. ducreyi from diverse geographical locations. This was achieved by agarose gel electrophoresis of restriction enzyme (RE) digested DNA extracts. These extracts were vacublotted onto nylon membrane and probed using digoxigenin labelled complementary DNA probe, prepared from Escherichia coli 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA. From 19 REs tested, Ava II, Hinc II, Bgl II and BstE II gave clear ribotypes. The ribotypes of BstE II and Bgl II used together gave the highest index of discrimination (D = 0.95), 16 types, and showed good reproducibility. This non-radioactive method demonstrates the three important features of a typing system; discrimination, typability and reproducibility.
TI  - In vitro model of Haemophilus ducreyi adherence to and entry into eukaryotic cells of genital origin.
AB  - Electron microscopy was used to examine Haemophilus ducreyi adherence to and entry into eukaryotic cells of genital origin. A clinical H. ducreyi isolate (90-244) adhered in snake-like whorls to the surfaces of cervical carcinoma cells (HeLa 229), endometrial adenocarcinoma cells (HEC-1-B), and human neonatal foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells. A prototype strain of H. ducreyi (CIP542) adhered in randomly organized clumps on the surfaces of HFF. Strain 90-244 entered HFF and HEC-1-B cells but did not enter HeLa cells. The H. ducreyi in the HFF cells at 2 h were partly surrounded by a membrane consistent with that of a phagocytic vacuole. At 2 h, strain CIP542 was found in interstitial spaces between the HFF cells and also in the cytoplasm of the cells. After 7 and 24 h, both strains of H. ducreyi were found in the large interstitial spaces between the HFF cells, in the cytoplasm, and extracellularly. This model of in vitro H. ducreyi infection of eukaryotic cells will allow for more specific study of factors that determine the virulence of H. ducreyi.
TI  - Molecular analysis of the Haemophilus ducreyi groE heat shock operon.
AB  - Chancroid is a sexually transmitted genital ulcer disease caused by Haemophilus ducreyi. Previously, we developed diagnostic DNA probes for H. ducreyi (L. M. Parsons, M. Shayegani, A. L. Waring, and L. H. Bopp, J. Clin. Microbiol. 27:1441-1445, 1989). In the present study, DNA sequencing of one of the diagnostic probes revealed two adjacent open reading frames (ORFs). These H. ducreyi ORFs and the encoded proteins show significant homology with the groE genes and GroES and GroEL heat shock proteins from several bacterial pathogens and with conserved eukaryotic 60-kDa heat shock proteins. The first H. ducreyi ORF (groES) is preceded by sequences similar to those of the Escherichia coli consensus heat shock promoters and is 288 nucleotides long and is capable of encoding a protein of 10.3 kDa. The second ORF (groEL) is 1,641 nucleotides long and is capable of encoding a protein of 57.8 kDa. Northern (RNA blot) analysis demonstrated the presence of a high level of groE mRNA in exponential-phase H. ducreyi grown in hemin broth at the organism's optimal growth temperature (33 degrees C), with increased levels seen following heat shock. Heat shock also increased the thermostability of the organisms, since stressed cells were more resistant to the lethal effects of rapid chilling. Electrophoretic analysis and immunoblots demonstrated that the predominant protein produced by exponential-phase H. ducreyi was a heat-inducible, immunoreactive protein of approximately 60 kDa (GroEL). Also, H. ducreyi groE mRNA and GroEL were expressed and inducible by heat in E. coli. This is the first report describing the cloning, sequencing, and expression of H. ducreyi protein-encoding genes.
TI  - Use of electroporation to construct isogenic mutants of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Little is known about the genetics of Haemophilus ducreyi, the etiologic agent of chancroid. To develop a method for constructing isogenic mutants of this organism that could be utilized in pathogenesis-related studies, electroporation techniques were evaluated as a means of introducing DNA into this organism. Electroporation of the plasmid shuttle vector pLS88 into H. ducreyi yielded approximately 10(6) antibiotic-resistant transformants per microgram of plasmid DNA. Studies of the feasibility of moving mutated genes into H. ducreyi were initiated by using NotI linker insertion and mini-Tn10kan mutagenesis techniques to introduce insertion mutations into cloned H. ducreyi genes encoding cell envelope antigens. In the former case, a gene encoding chloramphenicol acetyltransferase was then inserted into the NotI linker site created in the cloned H. ducreyi gene. The recombinant Escherichia coli strains containing these mutated plasmids no longer expressed the homologous H. ducreyi cell envelope antigens, as evidenced by their lack of reactivity with monoclonal antibody probes for these H. ducreyi proteins. Subsequent electroporation of both circular and linearized forms of plasmids carrying these mutated H. ducreyi genes into the homologous wild-type strain of H. ducreyi yielded antibiotic-resistant transformants which also lacked reactivity with the cell envelope antigen-specific monoclonal antibodies. Southern blot analysis confirmed that homologous recombination had occurred in these monoclonal antibody-unreactive transformants, resulting in the replacement of the wild-type allele with the mutated allele. Allelic exchange was most efficient when linear DNA molecules were used for electroporation. These results indicate that electroporation methods can be utilized to construct isogenic mutants of H. ducreyi.
TI  - Lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of some Haemophilus species mimic human glycosphingolipids, and some LOS are sialylated.
AB  - The lipooligosaccharides (LOS) of strains of Haemophilus ducreyi, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Neisseria lactamica contain epitopes that are antigenically and structurally similar to carbohydrates present in human glycosphingolipids. LOS from strains of Haemophilus influenzae and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius were tested for the binding of monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) that bind to human glycosphingolipids possessing Gal beta 1-4GlcNAc (MAb 3F11) and Gal alpha 1-4Gal beta 1-4Glc (MAb anti-Pk). In solid-phase radioimmunoassays, the LOS of 18 of 19 H. influenzae type b (Hib), 8 of 19 nontypeable H. influenzae, and 10 of 20 H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains bound MAb anti-Pk. The LOS of 13 of 19 Hib, 10 of 16 nontypeable H. influenzae, and 2 of 18 H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius strains bound MAb 3F11. Neuraminidase treatment of the strains increased the binding of MAb 3F11 by more than twofold in 47% of the H. influenzae strains, suggesting that sialic acid occluded the LOS structure recognized by MAb 3F11. The material released from neuraminidase-treated Hib LOS was confirmed to be sialic acid by high-performance anion-exchange chromatography. A recombinant plasmid containing genes involved in Hib LOS biosynthesis directed the expression (assembly) of the 3F11 epitope in Escherichia coli. These studies demonstrate that H. influenzae and H. influenzae biogroup aegyptius express at least two LOS epitopes that are similar to those present in human glycosphingolipids. Sialic acid was present on the LOS of some H. influenzae strains and prevented the binding of MAb 3F11 to its epitope. The oligosaccharide portion of sialylated LOS may also resemble sialylated oligosaccharides present in human glycosphingolipids (gangliosides).
TI  - Antigenic diversity in Haemophilus ducreyi as shown by western blot (immunoblot)  analysis.
AB  - The antigenic diversity within a panel of 63 Haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by Western blot (immunoblot) analysis with a pool of 238 well-characterized human antisera. When a serum pool adsorbed on a mixture of Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, and H. parahaemolyticus was used, the immunoprofiles suggested that prominent antigenic proteins involved in the human immune response have apparent molecular masses of 63, 42, 34 to 30, and 28.5 to 28 kDa. Preliminary subcellular localization revealed that these antigens are associated with the cellular membrane. Two subsets of antigens were discriminated by detergent extraction. There was no evidence that the antigen composition is altered by changing the growth conditions. With a serum pool adsorbed on the Haemophilus spp. mixture supplemented with Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Pasteurella ureae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Escherichia coli, antigenic determinants more specific for H. ducreyi were identified. An immunodominant 28.5- to 28-kDa protein was expressed by all H. ducreyi isolates. In the range from 34 to 30 kDa, 56 isolates revealed a dominant protein with variable molecular mass. By using both proteins (28.5 to 28 kDa and 34 to 30 kDa) as immunotypic markers, seven different immunopatterns were identified. Antigenic diversity among isolates from different geographical origins as well as from a single area was observed.
TI  - Molecular characterization of Haemophilus ducreyi by ribosomal DNA fingerprinting.
AB  - Intraspecies genotypic heterogeneity among Haemophilus ducreyi isolates was examined by using genomic fingerprints with rRNA from Escherichia coli as a probe. DNA from 44 isolates of H. ducreyi was digested by restriction endonuclease HincII or HindIII, separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, transferred to nylon membranes, and hybridized with 32P-labeled 16S and 23S rRNA. HincII digests yielded four hybridization patterns (ribotypes), whereas HindIII digests yielded eight ribotypes. Four HincII and five HindIII ribotypes were observed among 14 H. ducreyi isolates collected within a period of 1 month in Kenya, where chancroid is endemic. In contrast, one HincII and two HindIII ribotypes were observed among 28 isolates collected during the Orange County, Calif., chancroid epidemic that occurred in 1981 and 1982. The plasmid content, in conjunction with ribotyping, provided additional differentiation among some isolates of H. ducreyi. This study demonstrates that ribotyping of H. ducreyi may be used to study the epidemiology of chancroid.
TI  - Role of lipooligosaccharides in experimental dermal lesions caused by Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The mouse and rabbit intradermal injection models have been used to define factors that may be important in Haemophilus ducreyi pathogenesis. We used H. ducreyi strains with diverse geographic origins and phenotypic characteristics to evaluate the experimental models. Injection of live and heat-killed bacteria caused skin abscesses in both models. Semiquantitative cultures of skin injected with live bacteria showed that H. ducreyi failed to replicate in animal tissue. These data suggested that the experimental lesions were caused by a heat-stable substance such as lipooligosaccharide (LOS). In mice, injection of H. ducreyi and Haemophilus influenzae LOS and Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide caused mild to moderate inflammation. In rabbits, injection of H. ducreyi LOS caused intradermal abscesses that were histologically similar to those caused by live and heat-killed bacteria. H. ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae LOS caused significantly larger lesions than equivalent amounts of H. influenzae LOS and E. coli lipopolysaccharide in the rabbit model. We conclude that the intradermal injection models are not valid models to study the growth of H. ducreyi in vivo. However, these data indicate that H. ducreyi LOS may play an important role in the pathogenesis of chancroid and that the rabbit model should be useful in studying H. ducreyi LOS toxicity at the cellular level.
TI  - TnA transposons can be introduced and maintained in Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  - In Neisseria gonorrhoeae, all penicillinase-specifying plasmids isolated so far share homology with each other and carry a 60% deleted sequence of TnA. Plasmid pHD131, an element isolated from Haemophilus ducreyi and carrying an intact copy of the ampicillin resistance transposable element, was introduced from Escherichia coli into N. gonorrhoeae by both transformation and conjugative mobilization. Plasmids were recovered with no detectable deletion. After their transfer back into E. coli, transposition assays onto phage-lambda DNA demonstrated that the TnA elements were still functional. Plasmid pHD131 could be stably maintained in N. gonorrhoeae with or without the presence of penicillin. These results support the hypothesis that the absence in N. gonorrhoeae of plasmids carrying entire and functional TnA transposons cannot be ascribed to incompatibility between the genetic element and the host, but rather to a barrier to introduction of foreign DNA into gonococcus.
TI  - Characterization of a multiple antibiotic resistance plasmid from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Plasmid pLS88 from a clinical isolate of Haemophilus ducreyi encoded resistance determinants for sulfonamides and streptomycin related to those of RSF1010 and for kanamycin related to Tn903 but lacked the inverted repeats of the transposon. Its host range included Haemophilus influenzae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, and Escherichia coli; and it was compatible with pDM2 and RSF1010.
TI  - Penicillin-binding proteins of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - The penicillin-binding protein (PBP) profile of Haemophilus ducreyi was determined by a whole-cell-labeling assay. Only two major PBPs, of molecular weights 90,000 (PBP 1) and 38,500 (PBP 2), were detected in six of eight strains studied. Competition binding experiments and the attendant morphological effects suggested that PBP 1 was either a functional amalgamation or a lack of resolution of two proteins equivalent to PBPs 1 and 3 of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Activity of pefloxacin and thirteen other antimicrobial agents in vitro against isolates from hospital and genitourinary infections.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the quinolone derivative pefloxacin was compared with that of three other quinolones, five beta-lactam antibiotics and three aminoglycosides against 367 isolates from hospital patients and from out-patients with genitourinary infections. MIC90 of pefloxacin and norfloxacin for each strain was the same; that of ciprofloxacin was a little lower. All strains except Escherichia coli were resistant to nalidixic acid. Pefloxacin was highly active against Staphylococcus aureus (39 strains; MIC90 1.0 mg/l) and most strains of coagulase-negative staphylococci (56; 4 mg/l), Esch. coli (50; 0.25 mg/l), other enterobacteria (33; 1.0 mg/l) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 6; 0.25 mg/l). With Bacteroides spp. (total 78; 64 mg/l), the fragilis group (23) and the fusobacteria (19) were resistant, but the melaninogenicus-oralis group (31; range 0.06- greater than 64 mg/l) and B. ureolyticus (22; 0.125- greater than 64 mg/l) gave variable results. Amongst genitourinary isolates, Neisseria gonorrhoeae (15) and Haemophilus ducreyi (34) were sensitive (less than 0.06 mg/l) but Gardnerella vaginalis (25) and Mobiluncus spp. (11) were resistant (32 mg/l). Pefloxacin was more active than ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftizoxime, latamoxef and piperacillin against S. aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci and than gentamicin, tobramycin and amikacin against coagulase-negative staphylococci. No enterobacteria or pseudomonads were resistant to pefloxacin or other quinolones, whereas some were resistant to beta-lactams and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Characterization of a Haemophilus ducreyi mobilizing plasmid.
AB  - The OriV site of Haemophilus ducreyi mobilizing plasmid pHD147, determined by replication in Escherichia coli polA, is located close to the OriT site. The OriT site, located by recombination-proficient and -deficient cells, and the OriV site map in a region of pHD147 homologous to the beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids of H. ducreyi and Neisseria gonorrhoeae.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated aminoglycoside phosphotransferases in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Three clinical isolates of Haemophilus ducreyi, representing at least two subtypes, were shown to be resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin. They also produced a beta-lactamase and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase and were resistant to tetracycline. In the three strains the resistance to both aminoglycoside antibiotics was encoded by a plasmid of ca. 4.7 kilobases which apparently did not carry ampicillin, chloramphenicol, or tetracycline resistance genes, as determined after transfer to Escherichia coli by transformation. Resistance to streptomycin and kanamycin was due to the presence of two aminoglycoside phosphotransferases (APH). The enzyme modifying kanamycin was a 3',5"-APH of type I [APH(3',5")-I], as inferred from its substrate profile and immunological cross-reactivity with the APH(3',5")-I encoded by the transposable element Tn903. However, the APH(3',5")-I gene in H. ducreyi did not appear to be carried by Tn903.
TI  - Molecular epidemiology of beta-lactamase-specifying plasmids of Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We have studied the genetic basis of beta-lactamase production in eight strains of Haemophilus ducreyi isolated in diverse areas of the world. Beta-lactamase production in all strains was mediated by plasmids having a molecular mass of either 5.7 or 7.0 megadaltons. Plasmids of 5.7 megadaltons were shown to carry the entire sequence of pFA7, the beta-lactamase specifying plasmid found in isolates of Neisseria gonorrhoeae epidemiologically linked to West Africa. Plasmids of 7.0 megadaltons were shown to carry the entire sequence of pFA3, the beta-lactamase specifying plasmid found in Far Eastern isolates of N. gonorrhoeae. Both groups of H. ducreyi plasmids were shown to carry physically complete and functional TnA sequences. Thus we have identified two types of H. ducreyi beta-lactamase plasmid which are identical to the two types of N. gonorrhoeae beta-lactamase plasmid, except that they carry complete TnA sequences.
TI  - Characterization of ampicillin resistance plasmids from Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Seven strains of Haemophilus ducreyi from diverse geographic origins were analyzed for their plasmid content. All strains were multiply resistant, but only resistance to ampicillin was transferred to Escherichia coli by transformation. The H. ducreyi plasmids encoding for ampicillin resistance were 7.4, 5.7, and 3.6 megadaltons and encoded for part or all of TnA, and ampicillin transposon. The relatedness of these plasmids was examined by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA-DNA homology with isolated DNA fragments from TnA.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative antibiotic resistance plasmids in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - A clinical isolate of Haemophilus ducreyi was found to harbor three plasmids: a 23.5-megadalton (Mdal) phenotypically cryptic plasmid, a 7.0-Mdal ampicillin resistance plasmid, and a 4.0-Mdal sulfonamide resistance plasmid. The two smaller plasmids were transferable by conjugation to Haemophilus recipients, but only if the donor cell harbored the 23.5-Mdal plasmid as well, indicating that this large plasmid had mobilizing capabilities. Transfer was also possible to Escherichia coli recipients. Haemophilus influenzae transconjugants which had acquired both the 23.5-Mdal plasmid and one of the R-plasmids could subsequently retransfer the R-plasmid to other Haemophilus recipients at higher frequencies. A derivative of the 23.5 Mdal plasmid was isolated which was shown by restriction endonuclease analysis to contain an ampicillin resistance transposon and to have retained its conjugative ability.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated sulfonamide resistance in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Clinical isolates of Haemophilus ducreyi from patients with chancroid were shown  to have one or more 4.9- to 7.0-megadalton non-self-transferable plasmids and to have in vitro resistance to sulfonamides. Transformation of Escherichia coli to sulfonamide resistance was associated with the acquisition of a 4.9-megadalton plasmid, which did not confer linked resistance to streptomycin. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of this plasmid was found to be 57%. Filter-blot hybridization and restriction endonuclease digestion studies suggested a relationship of this plasmid to RSF1010. Electron microscope heteroduplex analysis confirmed this relationship. The identification in H. ducreyi of a plasmid closely related to plasmids found in enteric species, rather than transposition of a resistance determinant to an indigenous plasmid, suggests that further dissemination of the enteric plasmid pool to this genus is possible since plasmid transfer between certain Haemophilus species is readily demonstrated.
TI  - Molecular nature of a plasmid specifying beta-lactamase production in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - We characterized pJB1, the plasmid previously reported to mediate beta-lactamase  production in Haemophilus ducreyi. We studied its relationship to pMR0360 and RSF0885, the plasmids responsible for beta-lactamase production in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, respectively. Although pJB1 was maintained as a multicopy pool in Escherichia coli, it was not stably maintained in the absence of antibiotic selection. Electron microscope heteroduplex studies showed that it carried 100% of the transposable ampicillin resistance sequence TnA. This sequence was transposed to plasmid pUB307 at a low rate. Heteroduplexes between pMR0360 and pJB1 showed that they contained 3.3 megadaltons of homologous sequences. Two sets of nonhomologous sequences, one a TnA sequence and the other a non-TnA sequence, took the form of insertion loops. For plasmids pMR0360 and RSF0885, previously shown to be highly related, the nonhomologous sequences took the form of a substitution loop. We concluded that all three plasmids shared major portions of their sequences but differed in discrete segments. pJB1 was the first such plasmid to have a physically and functionally intact TnA sequence.
TI  - Plasmid-mediated ampicillin resistance in Haemophilus ducreyi.
AB  - Three of 19 strains of Haemophilus ducreyi, isolated during a recent outbreak of  chancroid, were found to produce beta-lactamase and to harbor a 6.0 x 10(6)-dalton plasmid. Escherichia coli transformed with this plasmid acquired beta-lactamase-mediated resistance to ampicillin. The guanine-plus-cytosine content of the plasmid was found to be 41 mol%. Restriction endonuclease digestion studies suggest that a relatively large portion of the Tn1 translocon is carried by this plasmid. Whereas this plasmid could not be transferred to H. influenzae by mating on membrane filters, a strain of H. ducreyi was able to receive and donate a 30 x 10(6)-dalton ampicillin resistance plasmid from H. influenzae. The ability of H. ducreyi to receive and donate conjugative plasmids may result in the appearance of multiply resistant strains.
TI  - The microbiological flora of penile ulcerations.
AB  - The penile ulcerations of 100 consecutive men were tested for microorganisms. A polymicrobial flora was identified in the ulcers of 97 men. The microorganisms recovered from these ulcers included combinations of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria (including Mycoplasma), herpes simplex virus, yeasts, and filamentous fungi. Fifty-three study entrants had microorganisms, identified by culture or serologic tests, that were considered primary in ulcer pathogenesis. Herpes simplex virus was the most prevalent and Treponema pallidum was the next most prevalent pathogen identified. Of our patients, 5% had two recognized pathogens confirmed by laboratory tests, and only one of these was suspected at clinical examination. In addition, the study suggests that microorganisms other than Haemophilus ducreyi can produce ulcers with a morphology mimicking chancroid.
