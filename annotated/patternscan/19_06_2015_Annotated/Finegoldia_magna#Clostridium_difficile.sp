TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == biofilm-growing intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == sessile growth of anaerobic bacteria from the human intestinal tract has been poorly investigated, so far. we recently reported data on the close association existing between biliary stent clogging and polymicrobial biofilm development in  its lumen. by exploiting the explanted stents as a rich source of anaerobic bacterial strains belonging to the genera bacteroides, clostridium, fusobacterium, finegoldia, prevotella, and veillonella, the present study focused on their ability to adhere, to grow in sessile mode and to form in vitro mono- or dual-species biofilms. experiments on dual-species biofilm formation were planned on the basis of the anaerobic strains isolated from each clogged biliary stent, by selecting those in which a couple of anaerobic strains belonging to different  species contributed to the polymicrobial biofilm development. then, strains were  investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy and confocal laser scanning microscopy to reveal if they are able to grow as mono- and/or dual-species biofilms. as far as we know, this is the first report on the ability to adhere and form mono/dual-species biofilms exhibited by strains belonging to the species bacteroides oralis, clostridium difficile, clostridium baratii, clostridium fallax, clostridium bifermentans, finegoldia magna, and fusobacterium necrophorum.

TI  == complete genome sequence of a serotype 11a, st62 streptococcus pneumoniae invasive isolate.
AB  == background: streptococcus pneumoniae is an important human pathogen representing  a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. we sequenced the genome of a  serotype 11a, st62 s. pneumoniae invasive isolate (ap200), that was erythromycin-resistant due to the presence of the erm(tr) determinant, and carried out analysis of the genome organization and comparison with other pneumococcal genomes. results: the genome sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 is 2,130,580 base pair in length. the genome carries 2216 coding sequences (cds), 56 trna, and 12 rrna genes. of the cdss, 72.9% have a predicted biological known function. ap200 contains the pilus islet 2 and, although its phenotype corresponds to serotype 11a, it contains an 11d capsular locus. chromosomal rearrangements resulting from a large inversion across the replication axis, and  horizontal gene transfer events were observed. the chromosomal inversion is likely implicated in the rebalance of the chromosomal architecture affected by the insertions of two large exogenous elements, the erm(tr)-carrying tn1806 and a functional prophage designated phispn_200. tn1806 is 52,457 bp in size and comprises 49 orfs. comparative analysis of tn1806 revealed the presence of a similar genetic element or part of it in related species such as streptococcus pyogenes and also in the anaerobic species finegoldia magna, anaerococcus prevotii and clostridium difficile. the genome of phispn_200 is 35,989 bp in size and is organized in 47 orfs grouped into five functional modules. prophages similar to phispn_200 were found in pneumococci and in other streptococcal species, showing a high degree of exchange of functional modules. phispn_200 viral particles have morphologic characteristics typical of the siphoviridae family and are capable of infecting a pneumococcal recipient strain. conclusions: the sequence of s. pneumoniae ap200 chromosome revealed a dynamic genome, characterized by chromosomal rearrangements and horizontal gene transfers. the overall diversity of ap200 is driven mainly by the presence of the exogenous elements tn1806 and phispn_200 that show large gene exchanges with other genetic  elements of different bacterial species. these genetic elements likely provide ap200 with additional genes, such as those conferring antibiotic-resistance, promoting its adaptation to the environment.

TI  == in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes.
AB  == daptomycin has in vitro activity against gram-positive anaerobic bacteria, although limited numbers of species have been tested. we studied the in vitro activities of daptomycin, vancomycin, and penicillin against more than 100 strains each of clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, finegoldia magna, and propionibacterium acnes. daptomycin etest mics and results from time-kill studies were determined for selected strains. for 392 of 421 strains (93%), daptomycin was inhibitory at < or =1 microg/ml, including 15 of 16 strains of c. difficile with elevated linezolid mics of 8 and 16 microg/ml, all 32 strains with moxifloxacin mics of > or =4 microg/ml, and all 16 strains resistant to clindamycin. daptomycin mics were also < or =1 microg/ml for all 16 f. magna strains resistant to clindamycin and all 32 strains resistant to tetracycline. only one strain, a c. perfringens strain, had a mic of >2 microg/ml to daptomycin. eighty-five and 92.5% of the etest mics were within 1 dilution of the agar dilution method for all drugs at 24 and 48 h, respectively. in time-kill studies, a c. difficile strain was inhibited by both daptomycin and vancomycin at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h; colony counts were decreased by 2.3 to 2.9 log at 24 h. vancomycin was not bactericidal for c. perfringens; however, daptomycin showed bactericidal activity as early as 1 h at four and eight times the mic and at 2 and 4 h at two and four times the mic.

TI  == phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia  species analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  == species of peptostreptococcus cause a variety of infections, primarily abscesses  of soft tissues, joints, and mucous membranes. the aim of this study was to compare the phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus species, represented by p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. lacrimalis, and p. prevotii; micromonas micros (p. micros) and finegoldia magna (p. magnus).  after anaerobic growth on blood-faa, lipids extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) were purified, then analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (fab-ms) in negative ion mode. the major peaks with mass to charge (m/z) 719, 721, and 749, corresponded to phosphatidylglycerol analogues, namely pg (32:1), pg (32:0), and pg (34:0), which have been found previously in lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and staphylococcus spp. other major peaks observed, with m/z 619, 647, 665, 675, 677, 687, 691, 693, 701, 703, 707, 733, and 746 have also been reported in one or more of these three species. however, other major peaks found here in peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia have not been described elsewhere; these are 501, 514, 515, 618, 659, 673, 676, 688, 690, 692,  694, 700, 706, 715, 718, 722, and 750. we conclude that peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia isolates are chemically unique.
