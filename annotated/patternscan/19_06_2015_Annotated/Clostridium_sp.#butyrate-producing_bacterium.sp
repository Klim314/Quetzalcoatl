TI  == a gene-targeted approach to investigate the intestinal butyrate-producing bacterial community.
AB  == background: butyrate, which is produced by the human microbiome, is essential for a well-functioning colon. bacteria that produce butyrate are phylogenetically diverse, which hinders their accurate detection based on conventional phylogenetic markers. as a result, reliable information on this important bacterial group is often lacking in microbiome research. results: in this study we describe a gene-targeted approach for 454 pyrotag sequencing and quantitative  polymerase chain reaction for the final genes in the two primary bacterial butyrate synthesis pathways, butyryl-coa:acetate coa-transferase (but) and butyrate kinase (buk). we monitored the establishment and early succession of butyrate-producing communities in four patients with ulcerative colitis who underwent a colectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis and compared it with three control samples from healthy colons. all patients established an abundant butyrate-producing community (approximately 5% to 26% of the total community) in  the pouch within the 2-month study, but patterns were distinctive among individuals. only one patient harbored a community profile similar to the healthy controls, in which there was a predominance of but genes that are similar to reference genes from acidaminococcus sp., eubacterium sp., faecalibacterium prausnitzii and roseburia sp., and an almost complete absence of buk genes. two patients were greatly enriched in buk genes similar to those of clostridium butyricum and c. perfringens, whereas a fourth patient displayed abundant communities containing both genes. most butyrate producers identified in previous studies were detected and the general patterns of taxa found were supported by 16s rrna gene pyrotag analysis, but the gene-targeted approach provided more detail about the potential butyrate-producing members of the community. conclusions: the presented approach provides quantitative and genotypic insights  into butyrate-producing communities and facilitates a more specific functional characterization of the intestinal microbiome. furthermore, our analysis refines  but and buk reference annotations found in central databases.

TI  == anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium from clostridium cluster xiva isolated from broiler chicken caecal content, and emended description of the genus anaerostipes.
AB  == four butyrate-producing isolates were obtained from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. the 16s rrna gene sequences were determined and confirmed the close relatedness of the four isolates, which suggested that they were derived from a single bacterial clone. phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences showed that its closest relatives were members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria and that the closest  related type strain was anaerostipes caccae l1-92(t) (94.5 % similarity). similarity levels of 96-98 % with sequences from uncultured bacteria from human stool samples were observed. on the basis of morphological, biochemical and phylogenetic characteristics, this strain is assigned to a novel species in the genus anaerostipes, for which the name anaerostipes butyraticus sp. nov. is proposed. the type strain is 35-7(t) (=lmg 24724(t) =dsm 22094(t)). an emended description of the genus anaerostipes is also provided.

TI  == butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from the caecal content of a broiler chicken.
AB  == five isolates that produced large amounts of butyrate were obtained in the course of a study on the butyrate-producing microbiota from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. the five isolates were virtually indistinguishable in biochemical and genetic terms, suggesting that they were derived from a single bacterial clone colonizing this habitat. a phylogenetic analysis based on 16s rrna gene sequences demonstrated that the five isolates represented a unique lineage within the clostridium leptum subgroup of the clostridia, with eubacterium desmolans as the closest phylogenetic neighbour (about 93 % similarity). these data indicate that the five novel isolates represent a single  novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name butyricicoccus  pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov. the type strain of butyricicoccus pullicaecorum is 25-3(t) (=lmg 24109(t) =ccug 55265(t)). the dna g+c content of strain 25-3(t)  was 54.5 mol% .

TI  == butyrivibrio hungatei sp. nov. and pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans sp. nov., butyrate-producing bacteria from the rumen.
AB  == two novel gram-negative, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, butyrate-producing bacterial species, strains mz 5t and jk 615t, were isolated from the rumen fluid  of cow and sheep. both strains were curved rods that were motile by means of single polar or subpolar flagellum and common in the rumen microbial ecosystem. strain mz 5t produced high xylanase, proteinase, pectin hydrolase and dnase activities; 1,4-beta-endoglucanase was also detected in the culture medium. the bacterium utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. glucose was fermented to formate, butyrate, lactate, succinate and ethanol. the dna g + c content was 42.1 mol%. the complete 16s rdna sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships  were determined. strain mz 5t and related isolates were located in clostridial cluster xiva and were closely related to pseudobutyrivibrio ruminis, butyrivibrio crossotus, roseburia cecicola and eubacterium rectale. the name proposed for this novel bacterium is pseudobutyrivibrio xylanivorans; the type strain is mz 5t (=dsm 14809t =atcc baa-455t). strain jk 615t produced no fibrolytic activity, but utilized a wide range of carbohydrates. glucose was fermented to formate, acetate, butyrate and ethanol. the dna g + c content was 44-8 mol%. the complete  16s rdna sequence was obtained and phylogenetic relationships were determined. strain jk 615t was located in clostridial cluster xiva and was closely related to clostridium proteoclasticum, butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and eubacterium halii. the name proposed for this novel bacterium is butyrivibrio hungatei; the type strain  is jk 615t (=dsm 14810t =atcc baa-456t).

TI  == roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., a novel saccharolytic, butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == five strains of butyrate-producing, anaerobic, gram-positive bacteria were isolated from human faecal material. these strains were slightly curved rods that showed motility by means of multiple subterminal flagella. the dna g + c content  of the strains was 29-31 mol%. a detailed investigation of the phenotypic and phylogenetic characteristics of the strains revealed that they represent a novel  species of anaerobic, low-g+c-content, butyrate-producing bacterium that shows net acetate utilization during growth on media containing carbohydrates and short-chain fatty acids. the 16s rrna gene sequences of the five isolates were determined and they confirmed that these strains were closely related to each other. phylogenetic analysis indicated that the most closely related species are  eubacterium rectale, eubacterium oxidoreducens and roseburia cecicola, members of cluster xiva of the clostridium subphylum of gram-positive bacteria, although they share less than 95% sequence identity with the novel strains. it is proposed that a novel species, roseburia intestinalis sp. nov., be created, with strain l1-82t (= dsm 14610t = ncimb 13810t) as the type strain.

TI  == anaerostipes caccae gen. nov., sp. nov., a new saccharolytic, acetate-utilising,  butyrate-producing bacterium from human faeces.
AB  == two strains of a previously undescribed eubacterium-like bacterium were isolated  from human faeces. the strains are gram-variable, obligately anaerobic, catalase  negative, asporogenous rod-shaped cells which produced acetate, butyrate and lactate as the end products of glucose metabolism. the two isolates displayed 99.9% 16s rrna gene sequence similarity to each other and treeing analysis demonstrated the faecal isolates are far removed from eubacterium sensu stricto and that they represent a new subline within the clostridium coccoides group of organisms. based on phenotypic and phylogenetic criteria, it is proposed that the two strains from faeces be classified as a new genus and species, anaerostipes caccae. the type strain of anaerostipes caccae is ncimb 13811t (= dsm 14662t).

TI  == chemostat enrichments of human feces with resistant starch are selective for adherent butyrate-producing clostridia at high dilution rates.
AB  == resistant starch (rs) enrichments were made using chemostats inoculated with human feces from two individuals at two dilution rates (d = 0.03 h(-1) and d = 0.30 h(-1)) to select for slow- and fast-growing amylolytic communities. the fermentations were studied by analysis of short-chain fatty acids, amylase and alpha-glucosidase activities, and viable counts of the predominant culturable populations and the use of 16s rrna-targeted oligonucleotide probes. considerable butyrate was produced at d = 0. 30 h(-1), which corresponded with reduced branched-chain fatty acid formation. at both dilution rates, high levels of extracellular amylase activity were produced, while alpha-glucosidase was predominantly cell associated. bacteroides and bifidobacteria predominated at the low dilution rate, whereas saccharolytic clostridia became more important at d =  0.30 h(-1). microscopic examination showed that within 48 h of inoculation, one particular bacterial morphotype predominated in rs enrichments at d = 0.30 h(-1). this organism attached apically to rs granules and formed rosette-like structures which, with glycocalyx formation, agglomerated to form biofilm networks in the planktonic phase. attempts to isolate this bacterium in pure culture were repeatedly unsuccessful, although a single colony was eventually obtained. on the basis of its 16s rdna sequence, this rs-degrading, butyrate-producing organism was identified as being a previously unidentified group i clostridium sp. a 16s rrna-targeted probe was designed using this sequence and used to assess the abundance of the population in the enrichments. at 240 h, its contributions to total rrna in the chemostats were 5 and 23% at d = 0.03 and 0.30 h(-1), respectively. this study indicates that bacterial populations with significant metabolic potential can be overlooked using culture-based methodologies. this may provide a paradigm for explaining the discrepancy between the low numbers of butyrate-producing bacteria that are isolated from fecal samples and the actual production of butyrate.
