TI  == rna of enterococcus faecalis strain ec-12 is a major component inducing interleukin-12 production from human monocytic cells.
AB  == interleukin-12 (il-12) is an important cytokine for the immunomodulatory effects  of lactic acid bacteria (lab). using murine immune cells, we previously reported  that the rna of enterococcus faecalis ec-12, a lab strain exerting probiotic-like beneficial effects, is the major il-12-inducing immunogenic component. however, it was recently revealed that bacterial rna can be a ligand for toll-like receptor (tlr) 13, which is only expressed in mice. because tlr13 is not expressed in humans, the immuno-stimulatory and -modulatory effects of lab rna in human cells should be augmented excluding tlr13 contribution. in experiment 1 of  this study, the role of lab rna in il-12 induction in human immune cells was studied using three lab strains, e.faecalis ec-12, lactobacillus gasseri jcm5344, and bifidobacterium breve jcm1192. rnase a treatment of heat-killed lab significantly decreased the il-12 production of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells on stimulation, while rnase iii treatment revealed virtually no effects. further, il-12 production against heat-killed e. faecalis ec-12 was abolished by depleting monocytes. these results demonstrated that single stranded rna (ssrna) of lab is a strong inducer of il-12 production from human monocytes.  in experiment 2, major receptor for ssrna of e. faecalis ec-12 was identified using thp-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line. the type of rna molecules of e. faecalis ec-12 responsible for il-12 induction was also identified. il-12 production induced by the total rna of e. faecalis ec-12 was significantly reduced by the treatment of sirna for tlr8 but not for tlr7. furthermore, both 23s and 16s rrna, but not mrna, of e. faecalis ec-12 markedly induced il-12 production from thp-1 cells. these results suggested that the recognition of ssrna of e. faecalis ec-12 was mediated by tlr8 and that rrna was the rna molecule that exhibited il-12-inducing ability in human cells.

TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces as potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages.
AB  == a total of 109 lactic acid bacteria isolated from infant faeces were identified by partial 16s rrna, cpn60 and/or phes sequencing. lactobacillus was the most prevalent genus, representing 48% of the isolates followed by enterococcus (38%). lactobacillus gasseri (21%) and enterococcus faecalis (38%) were the main species detected. a further selection of potential probiotic starter cultures for fermented sausages focused on lactobacillus as the most technologically relevant  genus in this type of product. lactobacilli strains were evaluated for their ability to grow in vitro in the processing conditions of fermented sausages and for their functional and safety properties, including antagonistic activity against foodborne pathogens, survival from gastrointestinal tract conditions (acidity, bile and pancreatin), tyramine production, antibiotic susceptibility and aggregation capacity. the best strains according to the results obtained were lactobacillus casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678, lactobacillus  rhamnosus ctc1679, l. gasseri ctc1700, l. gasseri ctc1704, lactobacillus fermentum ctc1693. those strains were further assayed as starter cultures in model sausages. l. casei/paracasei ctc1677, l. casei/paracasei ctc1678 and l. rhamnosus ctc1679 were able to lead the fermentation and dominate (levels ca. 10(8) cfu/g) the endogenous lactic acid bacteria, confirming their suitability as probiotic starter cultures.

TI  == tunel analysis of dna fragmentation in mouse unfertilized oocytes: the effect of  microorganisms within human follicular fluid collected during ivf cycles.
AB  == recently we reported the presence of bacteria within follicular fluid. previous studies have reported that dna fragmentation in human spermatozoa after in vivo or in vitro incubation with bacteria results in early embryo demise and a reduced rate of ongoing pregnancy, but the effect of bacteria on oocytes is unknown. this study examined the dna within mouse oocytes after 12 hours' incubation within human follicular fluids (n=5), which were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. each follicular fluid sample was cultured to detect the presence of bacteria. terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dutp nick-end labeling (tunel) was used to label dna fragmentation in ovulated, non-fertilized mouse oocytes following in vitro incubation in human follicular fluid. the bacteria streptococcus anginosus and peptoniphilus spp., lactobacillus gasseri (low-dose), l. gasseri (high-dose), enterococcus faecalis, or propionibacterium acnes were detected within the follicular fluids. the most severe dna fragmentation was observed in oocytes incubated in the follicular fluids containing p. acnes or l. gasseri (high-dose). no dna fragmentation was observed in the mouse oocytes incubated in the follicular fluid containing low-dose l. gasseri or e. faecalis. low human oocyte fertilization rates (<29%) were associated with extensive fragmentation in mouse oocytes (80-100%). bacteria colonizing human follicular fluid in vivo may cause dna fragmentation in mouse oocytes following 12h of in vitro incubation. follicular fluid bacteria may result in poor quality oocytes and/or embryos, leading to poor ivf outcomes.

TI  == gassericin a: a circular bacteriocin produced by lactic acid bacteria lactobacillus gasseri.
AB  == during the recent years extensive efforts have been made to find out bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria (lab) active against various food spoilage and pathogenic bacteria, and superior stabilities against heat treatments and ph variations. bacteriocins isolated from lab have been grouped into four classes. circular bacteriocins which were earlier grouped among the four groups of bacteriocins, have recently been proposed to be classified into a different class, making it class v bacteriocins. circular bacteriocins are special molecules, whose precursors must be post translationally modified to join the n to c termini with a head-to-tail peptide bond. cyclization appears to make them less susceptible to proteolytic cleavage, high temperature and ph, and, therefore, provides enhanced stability as compared to linear bacteriocins. the advantages of circularization are also reflected by the fact that a significant number of macrocyclic natural products have found pharmaceutical applications. circular bacteriocins were unknown two decades ago, and even to date, only a few  circular bacteriocins from a diverse group of gram positive organisms have been reported. the first example of a circular bacteriocin was enterocin as-48, produced by enterococcus faecalis as-48. gassereccin a, produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, reutericin 6 produced by lactobacillus reuteri la6 and circularin a, produced by clostridium beijerinickii atcc 25,752, are further examples of this group of antimicrobial peptides. in the present scenario, gassericin a can be an important tool in the food preservation owing to its properties of high ph  and temperature tolerance and the fact that it is produced by lab l. gasseri, whose many strains are proven probiotic.

TI  == bacteriocin production, antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of haemolytic and gelatinase activity in faecal lactic acid bacteria isolated from healthy ethiopian infants.
AB  == the objective of this study was to characterise lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from faecal samples of healthy ethiopian infants, with emphasis on bacteriocin production and antibiotic susceptibility. one hundred fifty lab were  obtained from 28 healthy ethiopian infants. the isolates belonged to lactobacillus (81/150), enterococcus (54/150) and streptococcus (15/150) genera.  lactobacillus species were more abundant in the breast-fed infants while enterococcus dominated the mixed-fed population. bacteriocin-producing lab species were isolated from eight of the infants. many different bacteriocins were identified, including one new bacteriocin from streptococcus salivarius, avicin a (class iia) from enterococcus avium, one class iia bacteriocin from enterococcus  faecalis strains, one unknown bacteriocin from e. faecalis and two unknown bacteriocins from lactobacillus fermentum strains and the two-peptide gassericin  t from lactobacillus gasseri isolate. susceptibility tests performed for nine antibiotics suggest that some lactobacilli might have acquired resistance to erythromycin (3 %) and tetracycline (4 %) only. the streptococci were generally antibiotic sensitive except for penicillin, to which they showed intermediate resistance. all enterococci were susceptible to ampicillin while 13 % showed penicillin resistance. only one e. faecalis isolate was vancomycin-resistant. tetracycline (51 %) and erythromycin (26 %) resistance was prevalent among the enterococci, but multidrug resistance was confined to e. faecalis (47 %) and enterococcus faecium (33 %). screening of enterococcal virulence traits revealed  that 2 % were beta-haemolytic. the structural genes of cytolysin were detected in 28 % of the isolates in five enterococcal species, the majority being e. faecalis and enterococcus raffinosus. this study shows that bacteriocin production and antibiotic resistance is a common trait of faecal lab of ethiopian infants while  virulence factors occur at low levels.

TI  == heat-killed lactic acid bacteria enhance immunomodulatory potential by skewing the immune response toward th1 polarization.
AB  == heat-killed lactic acid bacteria not only possess immunomodulatory functions but  also provide the advantages of longer product shelf life, easier storage, and more convenient transportation. to establish appropriate heat treatments for the  industrial preparation of probiotics with immunomodulatory effects, 4 different heat treatments were used to kill 11 strains of lactic acid bacteria. comparisons among the strains and with viable forms were carried out in terms of immunomodulatory activity and adhesion to caco-2 cells. field-emission scanning electron microscope (fe-sem) was employed to observe morphological changes in bacteria after heating. among the 11 viable strains, lactobacillus gasseri ai-88  was the strongest inducer of interferon-gamma (ifn)-gamma and interleukin (il)-12p70 production. however, after heat treatments its stimulatory ability was attenuated. heat-killed enterococcus faecalis ym-73 and lactobacillus salivarius  ap-32 strains showed enhanced stimulation of ifn-gamma and il-12p70 secretion and coincidental decrease in il-13 production. the adhesion of lactic acid bacteria to caco-2 cells decreased with increases in temperature. however, heat exposure did not influence immunomodulatory activity. with rising temperature, roughness and unevenness of bacterial cell surfaces increased significantly. the results indicated that heat-killed e. faecalis ym-73 and l. salivarius ap-32 have immunomodulatory ability via increased th1-associated cytokines and reduced th2-associated cytokines, switching the immune response from a th2 toward a th1 response. these 2 heat-killed strains have the potential for development as commercial products.

TI  == analysis of vaginal lactic acid producing bacteria in healthy women.
AB  == vaginal lactic acid-producing bacteria of 80 pre-menopausal women were studied by isolation on blood and deman-rogosa-sharpe agar, pcr with group-specific primers  for lactobacillus-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), and pcr with specific primers for v3 region in 16s rrna-temporal temperature gel electrophoresis (ttge). conventional isolation method on media detected only one  lactobacillus (lactobacillus brevis) while ttge detected only lactobacillus sp. dgge detected seven lactobacillus species; l. coleohominis, l. crispatus, l. iners, l. reuteri, l. rhamnosus, l. vaginalis, and leuconostoc lactis. l. acidophilus and l. gasseri, which are prevalent in western women, were not detected in korean women. furthermore, l. rhamnosus, leuc. lactis, l. coleohominis, and weissella cibaria, which were not previously reported in the vaginal microbiota of korean women, were detected. the five most prevalent labs in vaginal microbiota in korean women were l. iners, enterococcus faecalis, l. crispatus, leuc. lactis, and w. cibaria.

TI  == genetic features of circular bacteriocins produced by gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == this review highlights the main genetic features of circular bacteriocins, which  require the co-ordinated expression of several genetic determinants. in general terms, it has been demonstrated that the expression of such structural genes must be combined with the activity of proteins involved in maturation (cleavage/circularization) and secretion outside the cell via different transporter systems, as well as multifaceted immunity mechanisms essential to ensuring the bacteria's self-protection against such strong inhibitors. several circular antibacterial peptides produced by gram-positive bacteria have been described to date, including enterocin as-48, from enterococcus faecalis s-48 (the first one characterized), gassericin a, from lactobacillus gasseri la39, and a similar one, reutericin 6, from lactobacillus reuteri la6, butyrivibriocin ar10, from the ruminal anaerobe butyrivibrio fibrisolvens ar10, uberolysin, from  streptococcus uberis, circularin a, from clostridium beijerinckii atcc 25752, and subtilosin a, from bacillus subtilis. we summarize here the progress made in the  understanding of their principal genetic features over the last few years, during which the functional roles of circular proteins with wide biological activity have become clearer.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == the circular bacteriocins gassericin a and circularin a.
AB  == gassericin a, a bacteriocin produced by lactobacillus gasseri la39, shows antibacterial activity against a number of gram-positive food-borne pathogenic bacteria. circularin a produced by clostridium beijerinckii atcc25752 is active against c. tyrobutyricum, a known cheese-spoilage bacterium. both bacteriocins were purified to homogeneity from culture supernatants by reverse-phase chromatography and the subsequently determined amino acid sequences were used to  clone the bacteriocin structural genes. mature gassericin a and circularin a are  class v circular bacteriocins comprised of 58 and 69 amino acid residues, respectively. both bacteriocins are resistant to several peptidases and proteases, as are other cyclic bacteriocins. heterologous expression of gassericin a in escherichia coli was used to produce a non-cyclic mature peptide, which was shown to have a specific activity 173-fold lower than the circular molecule. the minimal region for production and secretion of active circularin a  is comprised of five genes, as was deduced by heterologous gene expression in enterococcus faecalis. gassericin a and circularin a have limited mutual similarity in their primary sequences. unlike most bacteriocins, including gassericin a, circularin a has a three-amino-acid-leader sequence.

TI  == characterization of the aggregation promoting factor from lactobacillus gasseri,  a vaginal isolate.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri 2459, isolated from the human vagina, exhibits a strong autoaggregating phenotype. filter-sterilized spent supernatants of this strain promote aggregation of lact. plantarum ll441 and enterococcus faecalis ef. aggregation was abolished upon exposure of the cells to proteases and, in the case of ent. faecalis, to metaperiodate, which suggests the involvement of cell-surface proteins and glycoproteins, respectively, in the aggregation phenotype. in accordance with this, a 75 kda surface protein, and possibly another of approximately 94 kda, appears in lact. plantarum ll441 cultures incubated with lact. gasseri culture supernatants. the diffusible aggregation promoting factor was purified from stationary phase culture supernatants and determined to be a 2 kda hydrophilic peptide active at ph 3-4 and stable at neutral and acid ph. the activity was resistant to heat, chymotrypsin, chelating  agents, triton x-100 and reducing agents, but sensitive to other proteases and sds.

TI  == positive selection, cloning vectors for gram-positive bacteria based on a restriction endonuclease cassette.
AB  == lactococcus lactis contains numerous restriction and modification (r/m) systems of different specificities. a novel iis type r/m system encoded by the llai operon has previously been characterized from the l. lactis conjugative plasmid ptr2030. the llai operon is composed of six genes: first, a small regulatory gene llaic precedes the methylase gene llaim. the following three genes, llai.1, llai.2, llai.3, are all essential for restriction endonuclease activity and are designed as the restriction cassette llair. the forth open reading frame of unknown function follows the llair gene cassette. we have successfully subcloned  the three llair genes, llai.1, llai.2, and llai.3, without llaim, as a suicide cassette into the three shuttle vectors ptrkl2, ptrkh2, and pbv5030. a promoter (p6) from lactobacillus acidophilus atcc4356, which is functional in e. coli, lactococci, and lactobacilli (djordjevic and topisirovic, unpublished) was cloned upstream of the three gene cassette. restriction activity was evaluated in escherichia coli and several gram-positive bacteria. the llair restriction cassette was not functional in e. coli, but its presence was lethal to l. lactis, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus acidophilus, carnobacterium pisicola, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus subtilis, and leuconostoc gelidum. several novel, positive selection cloning vectors were developed that can exploit unique cloning sites within the llair cassette. insertions in llai.1 resulted in complete inactivation of restriction activity and provided unconditional selection for recombinant plasmids in surviving transformants. these positive selection cloning vectors are the first for gram-positive bacteria that are based on a restriction endonuclease cassette. functional activity of the llair genes in various gram-positive bacteria would also enable use of these cloning vectors for positive selection of promoters, terminators, and regulatory sequences across these genera.
