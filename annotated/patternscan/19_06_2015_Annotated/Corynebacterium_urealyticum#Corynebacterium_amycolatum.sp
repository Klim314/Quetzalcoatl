TI  == corynebacterium prosthetic joint infection.
AB  == identification of corynebacterium species may be challenging. corynebacterium species are occasional causes of prosthetic joint infection (pji), but few data are available on the subject. based on the literature, c. amycolatum, c. aurimucosum, c. jeikeium, and c. striatum are the most common corynebacterium species that cause pji. we designed a rapid pcr assay to detect the most common human corynebacterium species, with a specific focus on pji. a polyphosphate kinase gene identified using whole-genome sequence was targeted. the assay differentiates the antibiotic-resistant species c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum from other species in a single assay. the assay was applied to a collection of human corynebacterium isolates from multiple clinical sources, and clinically relevant species were detected. the assay was then tested on corynebacterium isolates specifically associated with pji; all were detected. we also describe the first case of c. simulans pji.

TI  == [wound infections due to opportunistic corynebacterium species].
AB  == wound infections are often due to endogenous bacterial flora which penetrates into a site of injury. the establishment of the etiologic agent can be problematic, especially when opportunistic bacteria are present, suggesting contamination of clinical material. among bacteria that can cause such diagnostic problems are opportunistic corynebacterium spp. and coryneforms colonizing skin.  the aim of the study was to analyze the 24 clinical samples collected from wounds of different location, with gram positive rods isolated in numbers suggesting the cause of infection. bacterial identification was performed by api coryne and additional biochemical tests (api zym, api ne). it was detected that the commonest species isolated were: c. amycolatum (29.2%), c. striatum (16.7%), c. group g (16.7%) and brevibacterium spp., c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, c. group f1. the drug susceptibility testing was performed by e-test method. among isolated strains, 83.3% were simultaneously resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. in 75% cases resistance to co-trimoxazole was noted, in 71.7% resistance to chloramphenicol and in 16.7% resistance to beta-lactams were detected. in presented study the high percentage of strains resistant to macrolids and linkosamids (mlsb) was noted. all strains were susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin.

TI  == high frequency of macrolide resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates of corynebacterium species.
AB  == the genus corynebacterium includes a high number of species that are usually isolated from human skin as saprophytes. however, these microorganisms have also  been reported as infectious agents in a broad group of patients and have showed broad-spectrum resistance. we studied the susceptibility profiles against macrolides, clindamycin, and streptogramins of 254 clinical strains belonging to  the species corynebacterium urealyticum (120), corynebacterium amycolatum (66), corynebacterium jeikeium (17), corynebacterium striatum (20), corynebacterium coyleae (12), corynebacterium aurimucosum (11), and corynebacterium afermentans subsp. afermentans (8). the mls(b) phenotype was detected in 186 strains and was  associated with the presence of methylase enzymes codified by the erm(x) gene in  171 strains. the erm(b) gene was only detected in two c. urealyticum strains. fourteen strains showed macrolide resistance, but they did not carry erm genes. mef genes were not detected despite eight c. amycolatum strains showed the m phenotype. also, the presence of hydrolytic enzymes codified by ere(b) was evaluated, but all results were negative. resistance to macrolide in corynebacterium sp. is mainly due to the presence of erm(x) methylase, although other resistance mechanisms could be involved.

TI  == [antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria isolated from the reproductive tract of women].
AB  == the species composition, antilysozyme activity and antibiotic resistance of coryneform bacteria, isolated from the reproductive tract of women with microecological disturbances, were studied. sixty six women without microecological disturbances and 102 female patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract were examined. the study showed that corynebacterium minutissimum, c. amycolatum, c. group jk, c. bovis and c. pseudodiphtheriticum prevailed in the healthy women. in the patients with microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract c. vitarumen, c. matruchotii, c. striatum, c. renale and c. urealyticum were detected in addition  to the above species. the average antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria isolated from the healthy women was 1.32 +/- 0.47. in the patients with  microecological disturbances in the reproductive tract it was 1.84 +/- 0.38. the  in vitro susceptibility of the coryneform bacteria to antimicrobial agents was determined. high prevalence of resistance to beta-lactams (oxacillin and penicillin), erythromycin and co-trimoxazole was detected. thus, the species variety and the antilysozyme activity of the coryneform bacteria in the reproductive tract of the women with microecological disturbances were found to be higher. the high prevalence of resistance to oxacillin, penicillin, erythromycin and co-trimoxazole in the coryneform bacteria isolated from the patients with the microecological disturbances did not differ from that in the healthy women.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other antimicrobials against clinical isolates of the genus corynebacterium.
AB  == we studied the in vitro activity of tigecycline and 10 other commonly used antibiotics against 135 clinical isolates of non-diphtheria corynebacterium spp.  using the etest system. tigecycline minimum inhibitory concentrations for 50% and 90% of the organisms (mic(50) and mic(90) values, respectively, in mg/l) were: corynebacterium urealyticum, 0.094 and 0.125; corynebacterium amycolatum, 0.125 and 2; corynebacterium jeikeium, 0.094 and 0.75; corynebacterium coyleae, 0.064 and 0.064; corynebacterium striatum, 0.064 and 1; corynebacterium aurimucosum, 0.094 and 0.125; and corynebacterium afermentans, 0.064 and 0.094. the activities of all other antimicrobials were variable, with good activity of glycopeptides, linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin and daptomycin and with resistance to macrolides in a high number of isolates. tigecycline is a good alternative for the therapy of infections caused by non-diphtheria corynebacteria.

TI  == in vitro activity of linezolid and 12 other antimicrobials against coryneform bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to compare the in vitro activity of linezolid with 12 other antimicrobials against 190 strains of the coryneform bacteria, including 60 strains of c. amycolatum, 30 of c. striatum, 30 of c. jeikeium, 10 of c. urealyticum, 20 of b. casei, 20 of d. hominis and 20 of t. otitidis. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and time-death curves were carried out according to the recommendations of the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). results: linezolid was very active against the 130 strains of the corynebacterium species studied. only the glycopeptides showed similar efficacy. in contrast, penicillin g, ampicillin, macrolides, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides showed generally high mics. among the beta-lactams, only imipenem was active against the majority of strains of c. striatum and c. amycolatum, and, approximately half of the c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum isolates. both dermabacter hominis and brevibacterium casei showed marked resistance against most of the antimicrobials tested, while turicella otitidis only showed high mics against macrolides and clindamycin. for all of them, linezolid, vancomycin and teicoplanin proved effective. the time-death curves showed linezolid to behave as a bacteriostatic agent (approximately 90% death rate). such activity was more accentuated for c. amycolatum and c. striatum (reduction of 1.3 and 1.7log(10)cfu/ml, respectively) than for c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum (reduction of 1.0 and 0.8log(10), respectively). conclusions: our results indicate that linezolid is active against coryneform bacteria. the efficacy of linezolid is equal to or even superior to that of the glycopeptides.

TI  == [evaluation of api coryne system, version 2.0, for diphteroid gram-positive rods  identification with clinical relevance].
AB  == the ability of the api coryne system, version 2.0, to identify 178 strains of gram-positive rods was evaluated. seventy eight isolates belonged to genus corynebacterium and one hundred to related genera, all strains were isolated from clinical samples at the laboratory of bacteriology, hospital de clinicas jose de  san martin (uba) between 1995 and 2004. the isolates were identified according to von graevenitz and funke's scheme. one hundred and sixty two out of 178 strains (91%) were correctly identified at genus and species level (ic95 = 85.6-94.6), in 44 of them (24.7%) additional tests were needed to final identification. sixteen  strains (9%) were not correctly identified (ic95 = 5.4-14.4); none of the 178 strains remained unidentified. the api coryne system, version 2.0, is useful to identify the majority of cory-nebacterium species with clinical relevance: corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium urealyticum, corynebacterium striatum,  corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, corynebacterium amycolatum and related species such as arcanobacterium haemolyticum, dermabacter hominis, listeria monocytogenes, among others. nevertheless for yellow-pigmented diphteroid gram-positive rods (aureobacterium spp., leifsonia aquatica, microbacterium spp.  and cellulomonas spp.) and for acid fast gram-positive rods (rhodococcus, gordonia, tsukamurella and nocardia) the identification usefulness the system is  limited.

TI  == corynebacterium suicordis sp. nov., from pigs.
AB  == nineteen strains of gram-positive, non-motile, non-spore-forming, catalase-positive, rod-shaped bacteria isolated from pigs were characterized by using biochemical, molecular chemical and molecular genetic methods. two distinct groups of organisms were discerned, based on their colonial morphology, camp (christie-atkins-munch-petersen) reaction and numerical profile by using the api  coryne system. the first group (13 strains) gave a doubtful discrimination between corynebacterium striatum and corynebacterium amycolatum, whilst the second group (six strains) were identified tentatively as corynebacterium urealyticum. comparative 16s rrna gene sequencing studies demonstrated that all of the isolates belonged phylogenetically to the genus corynebacterium: the first group of organisms was highly similar to corynebacterium testudinoris with respect to 16s rrna gene sequences and physiological characteristics, whereas the remaining six isolates formed a hitherto unknown subline within the genus, associated with a small subcluster of species that included corynebacterium auriscanis and its close relatives. the unknown corynebacterium sp. was distinguished readily from these and other species of the genus by biochemical tests. based on both phenotypic and phylogenetic evidence, it is proposed that the new isolates from pigs should be classified as a novel species, corynebacterium suicordis sp. nov. the type strain is p81/02(t) (=cect 5724(t)=ccug 46963(t)).

TI  == in vitro activity of newer antibiotics against corynebacterium jeikeium, corynebacterium amycolatum and corynebacterium urealyticum.
AB  == the in vitro activity of ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, telithromycin, teicoplanin, linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin was tested against human derived pathogenic corynebacteria. the mics of these antibiotics were measured using the  agar dilution method against 31 strains of corynebacterium jeikeium, 58 corynebacterium amycolatum (including 33 multidrug-resistant strains) and 64 corynebacterium urealyticum clinical strains. a high resistance rate to ciprofloxacin and erythromycin was found in the three species. telithromycin was  much more active than erythromycin (mic(90) of erythromycin >or=128 mg/l for all  three species; mic(90) of telithromycin: 4 mg/l for c. jeikeium, 64 mg/l for c. amycolatum and 1 mg/l for c. urealyticum). there were no teicoplanin-resistant (mic(90) 1, 0.5 and 1 mg/l, respectively) or linezolid-resistant strains (mic(90) 1, 0.2 and 0.5 mg/l, respectively). quinupristin-dalfopristin was active against  most strains with an activity similar to linezolid, but three c. jeikeium and one c. amycolatum showed mics >or=4 mg/l. telithromycin showed much better activity against corynebacteria than older macrolides. synercid and linezolid were active  against most isolates tested, including multidrug resistant strains.

TI  == phospholipid composition of several clinically relevant corynebacterium species as determined by mass spectrometry: an unusual fatty acyl moiety is present in inositol-containing phospholipids of corynebacterium urealyticum.
AB  == a comparative study on phospholipids of corynebacterium amycolatum, corynebacterium jeikeium and corynebacterium urealyticum was carried out using fast-atom bombardment (fab) and electrospray ionization (esi) mass spectrometry.  data obtained indicate the presence of acylphosphatidylglycerol (apg), diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol (pg), phosphatidylinositol (pi) and  triacylphosphatidylinositol dimannosides (ac(3)pim(2)) in these bacteria. in general, octadecenoyl and hexadecanoyl fatty acyl moieties predominated in phospholipids of c. amycolatum, whereas high levels of hexadecenoyl were found in c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum. mass spectra from purified apg and pg indicated that the sn-1 position of the glycerol was occupied by octadecenoyl in the three  species studied. notably, several major molecular species of pi and ac(3)pim(2) from c. urealyticum contained significant amounts of a moiety identified as 10-methyleneoctadecanoyl, located at the sn-1 position of these molecules. on the other hand, multiantibiotic resistant and susceptible strains of c. amycolatum differed in several minor phospholipid fatty acids of 19 carbon atoms, identified as 10-methyloctadecenoic, 10-methyloctadecanoic (tuberculostearic acid) and 10-methyleneoctadecanoic. the results demonstrate an overall similarity among the phospholipids of the different species studied but also significant differences related to the acyl chains of the glycerol moiety of these compounds, notably the high levels of an unusual fatty acyl moiety in inositol-containing phospholipids  of c. urealyticum.

TI  == activities of gemifloxacin and five other antimicrobial agents against listeria monocytogenes and coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples.
AB  == the in vitro activities of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ampicillin, doxycycline,  gentamicin, and vancomycin were evaluated against 15 listeria monocytogenes strains and 205 coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples. the percentages of strains inhibited by gemifloxacin at 0.5 microg/ml were 100% (l. monocytogenes), 93.3% (brevibacterium spp.), 90% (corynebacterium minutissimum),  42.5% (corynebacterium amycolatum), 20% (corynebacterium striatum), 12.5% (corynebacterium jeikeium), and 10% (corynebacterium urealyticum). one hundred percent of the l. monocytogenes strains were inhibited by 0.25 microg of gemifloxacin per ml, whereas 0% of the strains were inhibited by 0.25 microg of ciprofloxacin per ml. vancomycin at 2 microg/ml inhibited all strains. doxycycline and gentamicin at 4 microg/ml inhibited 94 and 49% of the strains, respectively, while ampicillin at 0.5, 2, and 8 microg/ml inhibited 24, 61, and 66% of the strains, respectively. it is concluded that gemifloxacin shows good in vitro activity against l. monocytogenes and coryneform bacteria except c. jeikeium and c. urealyticum.

AB  == background: corynebacterium sp. is an extremely varied genus which includes little known species and of which only corynebacterium diphteriae, corynebacterium urealyticum and corynebacterium jeikeium are considered indisputable pathogens. other species, such as c. amycolatum are at present being reconsidered as causative agents in infectious pathologies, partly on account of  our greater aquaintance and improved identification techniques for these microorganisms and partly on account of the growing number of immunocompromised patients in whom all their pathogenic capacity is usually able to develope. we present 3 cases of significant bacteremia by c. amycolatum. methods: bacterial isoliations from blood culture were obtained using the vital systems. identification was performed by means of gran stain, colony morphology, the results of numerous biochemical tests (including the api coryne systems), the behaviour of the strains against the vibriostatic agent o/129 and the antibiotic  susceptibility pattern obtained with the e-test. results: the three isolates of c. amycolatum were obtained from patients after a lenghtly hospitalization, multi-instrumentation and who had severe underlying disease. all three presented  with concomitant isolates of c. amycolatum from other sites: sputum, wound and catheter respectively, which could explain the origin of the bacteremia. colony morphology, antibiotic susceptibility patterns, resistance to the vibriostatic agent o/129 and the results of the biochemical test carried out were similar to those previously describe in the literature. conclusions: c. amycolatum should be born in mind as a agent responsable for significant and severe pathology in this  type of patient. in addition, it as certain specific characteristics which assits in its identification in the normal micr

TI  == in-vitro activity of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and d-ofloxacin against coryneform bacteria and listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the in-vitro activity of levofloxacin, ofloxacin and d-ofloxacin compared with ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin  and sparfloxacin against coryneform bacteria and listeria monocytogenes isolated  from clinical samples. the following organisms (and number of strains) were studied: corynebacterium jeikeium (20), corynebacterium urealyticum (20), corynebacterium minutissimum (20), corynebacterium striatum (20), corynebacterium amycolatum (30), brevibacterium spp. (15) and listeria monocytogenes (15). antimicrobial activity was determined by microdilution using cation-adjusted mueller-hinton broth supplemented with 0.5% tween 80 when testing c. jeikeium or  c. urealyticum. fluoroquinolones were used in the range 0.015-16 mg/l. plates were incubated in air at 35 degrees c for 18-20 h (24 h when testing c. jeikeium  or c. urealyticum). the following mic50 values were obtained for all 140 organisms tested: levofloxacin, 1 mg/l; ofloxacin, 2 mg/l; d-ofloxacin, > 16 mg/l; ciprofloxacin, 1 mg/l; norfloxacin, 16 mg/l; sparfloxacin, 1 mg/l. mic90 values were > 16 mg/l for all test antibiotics with the exception of levofloxacin, which had an mic90 value of 16 mg/l. at a concentration of 2 mg/l,  levofloxacin inhibited all l. monocytogenes strains and 35-93% of the remaining species. mic90 values of ofloxacin were one dilution step higher than those of levofloxacin against c. minutissimum, c. striatum, brevibacterium spp. and l. monocytogenes. levofloxacin showed similar (c. jeikeium, c. urealyticum, c. amycolatum and brevibacterium spp.) or greater (c. minutissimum and c. striatum)  activity than ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin, and higher than d-ofloxacin or norfloxacin against all species studied. in conclusion, levofloxacin was the most active of the six fluoroquinolones evaluated against coryneform bacteria isolated from clinical samples and could therefore be a promising treatment option in this setting.

TI  == [bacteriological and clinical aspects of corynebacterium].
AB  == the microbiologists use the term corynebacteria to describe aerobically growing,  asporogenous, irregularly sharped gram-positive rods. they comprise strictly aerobic bacteria isolated from environment as well as preferentially anaerobic bacteria found in clinical specimens. a large part of these bacteria is considered as commensal of skin and mucous membranes. this group of organisms has recently been subjected to considerable taxonomic revisions, which have resulted  in the proposal of several new species, many of them representing previous centers for diseases control coryneform groups. moreover, recent investigations demonstrated the existence of a pathogenic role for some of them. these bacteria  comprise well-known pathogens such as c. diphtheriae responsible for diphtheria,  actinomyces spp. responsible for actinomycosis and arcanobacterium haemolyticum recovered from pharyngitis, but other corynebacteria were related to particular infections. for example, the lipophilic and antibiotics multiresistant species corynebacterium urealyticum and c. jeikeium were found to be responsible for urinary tract infections and septicemias, respectively. the recently described species turicella otitidis was found to be implicated in otitis media and c. seminale were recovered from genital specimens of male patients. implantation of  material devices, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics led to an increase of sepsis  due to the species c. jeikeium and c. amycolatum. many of the new actinomyces species grow well under aerobic conditions and are often implicated in various abscesses. moreover an increase of immunocompromised patients led to the development of infections due to the aerobic actinomycete rhodococcus equi. the association of some corynebacteria with particular diseases should prompt the microbiologist to identify these bacteria when they are encountered in a pathogenic situation. identification of the major part of corynebacteria isolated from clinical specimens can now be achieved by using recent schemes.

TI  == evaluation of the applicability of amplified rdna-restriction analysis (ardra) to identification of species of the genus corynebacterium.
AB  == the 16s rrna genes (rdna) of 50 strains belonging to 26 different coryneform bacterial species and genomospecies and of the type strain of rhodococcus equi were enzymatically amplified. amplified rdna restriction analysis (ardra) with the enzymes alui, cfoi and rsai was carried out. the combination of the ardra patterns obtained after restriction with these three different enzymes enabled the differentiation between the following species: corynebacterium accolens (number of strains = 2), c. afermentans subsp. afermentans (2), c. afermentans subsp. lipophilum (2), c. amycolatum (3), cdc coryneform group anf-1-like (1), cdc coryneform group anf-3-like (1), c. cystitidis (1), c. diphtheriae (4), c. jeikeium (3), c. macginleyi (2), c. minutissimum (1), c. pilosum (1), c. pseudotuberculosis (2), c. renale (2), c. striatum (2), c. urealyticum (3), c. xerosis (1), cdc coryneform groups b-1 (2), b-3 (2), f-1, genomospecies 1 and 2 (6), g, genomospecies 1 (1) and g, genomospecies 2 (2). the following strains or  species could not be differentiated from each other: c. pseudodiphtheriticum (2)  from c. propinquum (former cdc coryneform group anf-3) (2), cdc coryneform group  f-1, genomospecies 1 (4) from genomospecies 2 (2) and c. jeikeium genomospecies a (1) from genomospecies c (2). ardra may represent a possible alternative for identification of coryneforms, since this technique enabled the identification of most coryneforms tested and since dna extraction (i.e. cell lysis by boiling), amplification, restriction and electrophoresis can be carried out within 8 hours. this might allow quick identification of c. diphtheriae and other possible pathogens of the genus corynebacterium.
