TI  - Efficient one-pot multienzyme synthesis of UDP-sugars using a promiscuous UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase from Bifidobacterium longum (BLUSP).
AB  - A promiscuous UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase (BLUSP) was cloned from Bifidobacterium longum strain ATCC55813 and used efficiently with a Pasteurella multocida inorganic pyrophosphatase (PmPpA) with or without a monosaccharide 1-kinase for one-pot multienzyme synthesis of UDP-galactose, UDP-glucose, UDP-mannose, and their derivatives. Further chemical diversification of a UDP-mannose derivative resulted in the formation of UDP-N-acetylmannosamine.
