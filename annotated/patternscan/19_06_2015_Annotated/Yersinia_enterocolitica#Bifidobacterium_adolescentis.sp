TI  == plasmacytoid dendritic cells are crucial in bifidobacterium adolescentis-mediated inhibition of yersinia enterocolitica infection.
AB  == in industrialized countries bacterial intestinal infections are commonly caused by enteropathogenic enterobacteriaceae. the interaction of the microbiota with the host immune system determines the adequacy of an appropriate response against pathogens. in this study we addressed whether the probiotic bifidobacterium adolescentis is protective during intestinal yersinia enterocolitica infection. female c57bl/6 mice were fed with b. adolescentis, infected with yersinia enterocolitica, or b. adolescentis fed and subsequently infected with yersinia enterocolitica. b. adolescentis fed and yersinia infected mice were protected from yersinia infection as indicated by a significantly reduced weight loss and splenic yersinia load when compared to yersinia infected mice. moreover, protection from infection was associated with increased intestinal plasmacytoid dendritic cell and regulatory t-cell frequencies. plasmacytoid dendritic cell function was investigated using depletion experiments by injecting b. adolescentis fed, yersinia infected c57bl/6 mice with anti-mouse pdca-1 antibody, to deplete plasmacytoid dendritic cells, or respective isotype control. the b. adolescentis-mediated protection from yersinia dissemination to the spleen was abrogated after plasmacytoid dendritic cell depletion indicating a crucial function for pdc in control of intestinal yersinia infection. we suggest that feeding of b. adolescentis modulates the intestinal immune system in terms of increased plasmacytoid dendritic cell and regulatory t-cell frequencies, which might account for the b. adolescentis-mediated protection from yersinia enterocolitica infection.

TI  == identification of commensal bacterial strains that modulate yersinia enterocolitica and dextran sodium sulfate-induced inflammatory responses: implications for the development of probiotics.
AB  == an increasing body of evidence suggests that probiotic bacteria are effective in  the treatment of enteric infections, although the molecular basis of this activity remains elusive. to identify putative probiotics, we tested commensal bacteria in terms of their toxicity, invasiveness, inhibition of yersinia-induced inflammation in vitro and in vivo, and modulation of dextran sodium sulfate (dss)-induced colitis in mice. the commensal bacteria escherichia coli, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides distasonis, and streptococcus salivarius were screened for adhesion to, invasion of, and toxicity for host epithelial cells (ec), and the strains were tested for their ability to  inhibit y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation. additionally, b. adolescentis was administered to mice orally infected with y. enterocolitica and  to mice with mucosae impaired by dss treatment. none of the commensal bacteria tested was toxic for or invaded the ec. b. adolescentis, b. distasonis, b. vulgatus, and s. salivarius inhibited the y. enterocolitica-induced nf-kappab activation and interleukin-8 production in ec. in line with these findings, b. adolescentis-fed mice had significantly lower results for mean pathogen burden in the visceral organs, intestinal tumor necrosis factor alpha mrna expression, and  loss of body weight upon oral infection with y. enterocolitica. in addition, the  administration of b. adolescentis decelerated inflammation upon dss treatment in  mice. we suggest that our approach might help to identify new probiotics to be used for the treatment of inflammatory and infectious gastrointestinal disorders.

TI  == photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: bacterial contamination of platelet (plt) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. a photochemical treatment (pct) process with amotosalen hcl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (uva), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in plt concentrates. study design and methods: high titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic gram-negative bacteria (7  species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor plt concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) plts in approximately 300 ml of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent plt additive solution (intersol, baxter healthcare) or saline. after pct with 150 micro mol per l amotosalen and 3 j per cm(2) uva, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. results: the level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. log reduction of gram-positive bacteria for staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for  clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. log reduction of gram-negative bacteria for escherichia coli was > 6.4; for serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for salmonella choleraesuis,  > 6.2; for yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. log reduction of spirochetes for treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for borrelia  burgdorferi, > 6.9. conclusion: pct inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. the inactivation of bacteria in plt concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent plt-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
