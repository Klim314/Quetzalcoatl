inhibition of phagocytosis of e. coli by b. fragilis group--an in vitro study.
bacteriodes fragilis group can inhibit the phagocytosis and killing of co-existing aerobes. forty six strains of b.fragilis group are tested for their ability to resist phagocytosis and inhibit the killing of indicator organism, e. coli by denoting the viable count. among the species of b. fragilis group, the inhibitory index of the phagocytic system was the highest with b. fragilis followed by b. thetaiotamicron. none of the strains of b. fragilis group were phagocytosed or killed in this system. this property of resisting the phagocytosis and killing of e. coli by b. fragilis group might be the contributing factor towards their prevalence in mixed infections.
human endothelial cell adhesiveness for neutrophils, induced by escherichia coli  lipopolysaccharide in vitro, is inhibited by bacteroides fragilis lipopolysaccharide.
recent studies in vitro have demonstrated that lps from gram-negative bacteria are capable of inducing endothelial cells to express a cell surface property that promotes the adherence of neutrophils (polymorphonuclear cells, pmn). we have investigated the effects of lps from bacteroides fragilis, an organism documented to have little toxicity in vivo, on the induction of this property in human endothelial cells. monolayers of cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huve) exhibited no increase in adhesiveness for 51cr-radiolabeled pmn after 4 h of exposure to b. fragilis lps from 1 ng to 10 micrograms/ml. escherichia coli lps elicited a dose-dependent enhancement of huve adhesiveness for pmn over the same concentration range, reaching a maximum of 49.4 +/- 6.6% at 10 micrograms/ml. like e. coli lps, b. fragilis lps converted chromogenic substrate in the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, and was directly cytotoxic to bovine aortic endothelial cells. both b. fragilis lps activities required doses two-to-three log-fold higher than for e. coli lps. in addition, we found that b. fragilis lps inhibited the induction of huve adhesiveness for pmn by e. coli lps. this inhibition was also dose-dependent, becoming maximal (greater than 80%) when b. fragilis lps was in 10- to 20-fold excess. tumor necrosis factor and il-1, two monokines which also elicit huve adhesiveness for pmn, were not inhibited by b. fragilis lps, suggesting a mechanism of huve activation by lps which is signal-specific, and which recognizes specificities of lps structure.
