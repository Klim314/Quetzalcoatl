TI  == the culturome of the human nose habitats reveals individual bacterial fingerprint patterns.
AB  == the complex anatomy of the human nose might offer distinct microbial niches. microbiota composition may affect nose inflammatory diseases and staphylococcus aureus carriage. considering different nasal cavity locations, microbial colonization was analysed across individuals exhibiting chronic nasal inflammatory diseases (n = 18) and those without local inflammation signs (n = 16). samples were collected systematically during surgery and examined by an extensive culture-based approach and, for a subset, by 16s rrna gene community profiling. cultivation yielded 141 taxa with members of staphylococcus, corynebacterium and propionibacterium as most common isolates comprising the nasal core culturome together with finegoldia magna. staphylococcus aureus was most frequently found in association with staphylococcus epidermidis and propionibacterium acnes, and the posterior vestibules were redefined as s. aureus' principle habitat. culturome analysis revealed host-specific bacterial 'fingerprints' irrespective of host-driven factors or intranasal sites. comparisons between cultivable and molecular fingerprints demonstrated that only  a small fraction of phylotypes (6.2%) was correlated. while the total number of different phylotypes was higher in the molecular dataset, the total number of identifications down to the species level was higher in the culturomic approach.  to determine host-specific microbiomes, the advantages of molecular approaches should be combined with the resolution and reliability of species identification  by culturomic analyses.

TI  == the microbial epidemiology of breast implant infections in a regional referral centre for plastic and reconstructive surgery in the south of france.
AB  == background: breast implant infections are usually caused by staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci. gram-negative bacilli are rarely reported to be involved in breast implant infections. methods: thirty-seven cases of microbiologically confirmed breast implant infection managed from january 2008 to june 2012 in the study centre were reviewed, including 10 cases from the study centre itself and 27 cases from private clinics in the region. results: the prevalence of breast implant infection in the study centre was 0.74% of breast implantation, i.e., 3.23% in breast reconstruction for breast cancer and 0.27% in aesthetic breast augmentation (p=0.0002). of the 37 cases, 30% had undergone radiotherapy and 11% had undergone a lymph node dissection. s. aureus was identified in 18 cases, gram-negative bacilli in 10 cases, coagulase-negative staphylococci in eight cases, anaerobic bacteria in eight cases, and streptococci in three cases. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the second most commonly identified pathogen. staphylococcus epidermidis was the most frequent coagulase-negative staphylococcus species. in addition to propionibacterium acnes and actinomyces neuii, other facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria have not been reported before, e.g., bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, corynebacterium simulans, dermabacter hominis, finegoldia magna, and peptoniphilus harei. seventy-percent of cases were treated by immediate implant removal. all cases treated only with antibiotics were treated with surgery at the second visit. conclusions: the microbiological epidemiology was noted by an increasing the proportion of gram-negative bacteria  and anaerobic bacteria detected with the advent of maldi-tof ms and molecular identification for diagnosis.

TI  == [bacteria isolated from surgical infections and its susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents - special references to bacteria isolated between april 2011 and march 2012].
AB  == bacteria isolated from surgical infections during the period from april 2011 to march 2012 were investigated in a multicenter study in japan, and the following results were obtained. in this series, 785 strains including 31 strains of candida spp. were isolated from 204 (78.8%) of 259 patients with surgical infections. five hundred and twenty three strains were isolated from primary infections, and 231 strains were isolated from surgical site infection. from primary infections, anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were predominant, followed by aerobic gram-negative bacteria, while from surgical site infection aerobic gram-positive bacteria were predominant, followed by anaerobic gram-negative bacteria. among aerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus  spp., in this order, from primary infections, while enterococcus spp. was highest, followed by staphylococcus spp. from surgical site infection. among aerobic gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli was the most predominantly isolated from primary infections, followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas  aeruginosa and enterobacter cloacae, in this order, and from surgical site infection, e. coli was most predominantly isolated, followed by p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. cloacae. among anaerobic gram-positive bacteria, the isolation rate of eggerthella lenta was the highest from primary infections, followed by parvimonas micra, collinsella aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus and finegoldia magna, and from surgical site infection, e. lenta was most predominantly isolated, followed by p micra and l. acidophilus, in this order. among anaerobic gram-negative bacteria, the isolation rate of bacteroidesfragilis was the highest from primary infections, followed by bilophila wadsworthia, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides uniformis and bacteroides vulgatus, and from surgical site infection, b. fragilis was most predominantly isolated, followed by bacteroides caccae, b. thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides ovatus and b. wadsworthia, in this order. in this series, vancomycin-resistant mrsa (methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus  spp. and multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa were not observed. we should carefully follow up b. wadsworthia which was resistant to various antimicrobial agents, and also bacteroides spp. which was resistant to many beta-lactams.

TI  == substrate profiling of finegoldia magna sufa protease, inhibitor screening and application to prevent human fibrinogen degradation and bacteria growth in vitro.
AB  == sufa, which belongs to the subtilisin-like serine protease family, contains a non-canonical asp-his-ser catalytic triad. under in vitro conditions, sufa is capable of human fibrinogen hydrolysis leading to inhibition of fibrin network formation, thus suggesting its important role in the development and progression  of finegoldia magna infections. in addition, it has been demonstrated that sufa can hydrolyze antibacterial peptides such as ll-37 and the chemokine mig/cxcl 9,  hence evading host defence mechanisms. although the sufa protease from f. magna was discovered several years ago, its optimal substrate preference has not yet been identified. considering the role of sufa, we have focused on the profiling of its substrate sequence preference spanning s1-s3 binding pockets using the fret (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) approach. next, based on the structure of the p1 residue of the developed substrate, we narrowed the inhibitor screening to the phosphonic analogues of amino acids containing an arginine-like  side chain. among all the compounds tested, only cbz-6-amnphth(p)(oph)2 showed any inhibitory activity against sufa displaying k2/ki value of 10,800 m(-1) s(-1). in addition, it prevented sufa-mediated human fibrinogen hydrolysis in vitro and exhibited potent antibacterial activity against f. magna, staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli. herein, we report on the substrate specificity, synthesis and kinetic evaluation of phosphonic inhibitors of sufa protease from f. magna which could help to establish its function in pathogenesis development and may lead to the elaboration of new antibacterial drugs.

TI  == ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic  model.
AB  == anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. the broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. we compared  the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (cpa) to that of ertapenem (ert) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk/pd) model. simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fcmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fcmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fcmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of bacteroides fragilis, one strain of prevotella bivia, and  one strain of finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro pk/pd model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 cfu/ml. bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 cfu/ml from the starting inoculum. both cpa and ert were bactericidal against all four strains. cpa demonstrated improved activity against bacteroides strains compared to that of ert but had similar activity against finegoldia magna and p. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with cpa against p. bivia. no resistance emerged from any of the models. the pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. cpa has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == [v. a. c. instill(r) therapy - new option in septic thoracic surgery].
AB  == background: the v. a. c. instill(r) therapy is an innovative process for treating chronic wounds that are not optimally accessible to a systemic antibiotic therapy or infected with multi-resistant pathogens. we report on our first experience and applications of v. a. c. instill(r) therapy in the field of septic thoracic surgery. materials and methods: v. a. c. instill therapy was used in 11 cases between 11/2009 and 01/2012. three patients had sternum osteomyelitis (2 mrsa, 1  finegoldia magna). in 3 patients chronic pleural empyema after lobectomy (1 streptococcus viridans, 1 mixed infection with mrsa among others) and after pneumectomy (1 mrsa) were detected. in 2 cases there was an acute pleural empyema with extensive phlegmona in the region of the thoracic soft tissues (2 streptococci). in 1 patient a chronic pleural empyema with mrsa infection was treated. septic arthritis of the sternoclavicular joint with joint destruction and extensive phlegmona in the region of the cervical soft tissues (1 streptococcus pneumoniae, 1 staphylococcus aureus) was treated in 2 patients. in  all cases instillation of the wound was performed with lavasept 0.2 %. swabs of the wound were taken before starting and after ending v. a. c. instill(r) therapy as well as before wound closure. results: mean patient age was 48.8 +/- 18.9 years. v. a. c. instill(r) therapy was performed for 6.5 +/- 1.7 days. instillation time amounted to 21.7 +/- 5.7 s. the duration of action was standardised at 18 min in all cases. in 2 cases (1 mesa, 1 finegoldia) the v. a.  c. instill(r) therapy was repeated. in 10 patients a sterile wound status was achieved before secondary wound closure. all wounds underwent secondary closure without recurrence. conclusions: chronic osteomyelitis with mrsa infections as well as chronically infected residual cavities after empyema surgery and extensive phlegmona are possible indications for v. a. c. instill(r) therapy in order to help eradicating the infection as quickly and as completely as possible.

TI  == an in vitro comparison of two silver-containing antimicrobial wound dressings .
AB  == preclinical studies have shown that release of silver by different wound dressings varies. the purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the antimicrobial activity of silver alginate (sa) and silver carboxymethylcellulose  (scm) dressings. an- timicrobial activity was tested using nine bacterial strains with log10 reduction and corrected zone of inhibition (czoi) as- says. antimicrobial effect was visualized using confocal microscopy (clsm). log10 reduction was comparable between both dressings for staphylococcus aureus ncimb 9518, candida albicans atcc 90028, finegoldia magna nctc 11804t, and pseudomonas  aeruginosa nctc 10662. log10 reduction was higher for scm than sa dressing-exposed escherichia coli (p = 0.035) and p. aeruginosa atcc 15692 (p = 0.032), and lower for scm than sa dressing-exposed streptococcus pyogenes (p = 0.007), peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus (p = 0.045), and s. aureus nctc 8325 (p =  0.012). both dressings were equivalent against four strains (5 to 8 days' activity) in the czoi assay. sa dressing silver activity lasted >24 hours longer  than scm activity when exposed to c. albicans (9 days' activity), e. coli (7 days' activity), f. magna (5 days' activity), and p. asaccharolyticus (5 days' activity), whereas the smc exhibited greater persistence against s. pyogenes (13  days' activity). clsm showed complete kill of s. aureus after 20 hours for both dressings. the results of this study confirm the broad-spectrum, in vitro activity of some dressings containing ionic silver. the in vitro antimicrobial efficacy of both wound dressings was comparable, but clinical studies comparing the efficacy and effectiveness of silver-containing dressings to nonionic silver-containing dressings are needed.

TI  == assessment of bacterial diversity in the cattle tick rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus through tag-encoded pyrosequencing.
AB  == background: ticks are regarded as the most relevant vectors of disease-causing pathogens in domestic and wild animals. the cattle tick, rhipicephalus (boophilus) microplus, hinders livestock production in tropical and subtropical parts of the world where it is endemic. tick microbiomes remain largely unexplored. the objective of this study was to explore the r. microplus microbiome by applying the bacterial 16s tag-encoded flx-titanium amplicon pyrosequencing (btefap) technique to characterize its bacterial diversity. pyrosequencing was performed on adult males and females, eggs, and gut and ovary  tissues from adult females derived from samples of r. microplus collected during  outbreaks in southern texas. results: raw data from btefap were screened and trimmed based upon quality scores and binned into individual sample collections.  bacteria identified to the species level include staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus chromogenes, streptococcus dysgalactiae, staphylococcus sciuri, serratia marcescens, corynebacterium glutamicum, and finegoldia magna. one hundred twenty-one bacterial genera were detected in all the life stages and tissues sampled. the total number of genera identified by tick sample comprised:  53 in adult males, 61 in adult females, 11 in gut tissue, 7 in ovarian tissue, and 54 in the eggs. notable genera detected in the cattle tick include wolbachia, coxiella, and borrelia. the molecular approach applied in this study allowed us to assess the relative abundance of the microbiota associated with r. microplus.  conclusions: this report represents the first survey of the bacteriome in the cattle tick using non-culture based molecular approaches. comparisons of our results with previous bacterial surveys provide an indication of geographic variation in the assemblages of bacteria associated with r. microplus. additional reports on the identification of new bacterial species maintained in nature by r. microplus that may be pathogenic to its vertebrate hosts are expected as our understanding of its microbiota expands. increased awareness of the role r. microplus can play in the transmission of pathogenic bacteria will enhance our ability to mitigate its economic impact on animal agriculture globally. this recognition should be included as part of analyses to assess the risk for re-invasion of areas like the united states of america where r. microplus was eradicated.

TI  == surface bacteriology of venous leg ulcers and healing outcome.
AB  == aim: bacteria can be cultured from all venous leg ulcers (vlus) regardless of healing status, and the significance of a positive swab result in non-clinically  infected ulcers is unknown. the aim of this study was to characterise the bacteriological flora of vlus by routine culture to determine whether the data generated had prognostic value. methods: the ulcers of 178 patients were sampled  weekly for 12 weeks and healing outcome monitored while the limb was treated with graduated compression. wound bacteriology was assessed using culture methodology  standardised to ensure data reproducibility. results: 153 individual bacterial species were identified. the species most frequently found were staphylococcus aureus (64.3% of assessments), corynebacterium striatum (60.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (32.6%), helcococcus kunzii (22.0%), finegoldia magna (21.4%) and proteus mirabilis (16.1%). no single species or the presence of anaerobes and increasing diversity of bacterial species, previously thought to be predictive of impaired healing, was shown to be associated with healing outcome. the presence of c striatum was associated with healing outcome but not after adjusting for the known prognostic factors of wound area and duration. conclusion: routine bacteriological culture analysis of the vlu wound surface may be used to identify diverse flora in all ulcers. however, the data generated are of no additional value as a prognostic indicator of healing outcome. the presence of c striatum may represent colonisation of non-healing vlu by normal skin flora.

TI  == bacterial surface protein l binds and inactivates neutrophil proteins s100a8/a9.
AB  == finegoldia magna is an anaerobic bacterial species that is part of the normal human flora on all nonsterile body surfaces, but it is also a significant opportunistic pathogen causing a wide range of infections. some isolates of f. magna that are more frequently associated with clinical infection express protein l, a surface protein containing multiple homologous domains (b1-b5) that bind igs through interactions with ig l chains. the present study shows that the n-terminal a domain of protein l binds s100a8/a9, antibacterial proteins present  in large amounts in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, but also extracellularly in tissues during inflammation. as a result, protein l-expressing f. magna are protected against killing by s100a8/a9. igs and s100a8/a9 were found to interact  independently with protein l, demonstrating that this bacterial surface protein is capable of manipulating both adaptive and innate immune defense mechanisms.
