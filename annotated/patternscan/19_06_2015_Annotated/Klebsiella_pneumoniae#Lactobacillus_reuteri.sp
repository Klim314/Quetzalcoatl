TI  == identification and characterization of the propanediol utilization protein pdup of lactobacillus reuteri for 3-hydroxypropionic acid production from glycerol.
AB  == although the de novo biosynthetic mechanism of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-hp) in  glycerol-fermenting microorganisms is still unclear, the propanediol utilization  protein (pdup) of lactobacillus species has been suggested to be a key enzyme in  this regard. to verify this hypothesis, a pdup gene from lactobacillus reuteri was cloned and expressed, and the encoded protein was characterized. recombinant  l. reuteri pdup exhibited broad substrate specificity including 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and utilized both nad(+) and nadp(+) as a cofactor. among various aldehyde substrates tested, the specific activity was highest for propionaldehyde, at ph 7.8 and 37 degrees c. the k(m) and v(max) values for propionaldehyde in the presence of nad(+) were 1.18 mm and 0.35 u mg(-)(1), respectively. when l. reuteri pdup was overexpressed in klebsiella pneumoniae, 3-hp production remarkably increased as compared to the wild-type strain (from 0.18 g l(-)(1) to 0.72 g l(-)(1)) under shake-flask culture conditions, and the highest titer (1.38 g l(-)(1) 3-hp) was produced by the recombinant strain under  batch fermentation conditions in a bioreactor. this is the first report stating the enzymatic properties of pdup protein and the probable role in biosynthesis of 3-hp in glycerol fermentation.

TI  == antagonistic activity against pathogenic bacteria by human vaginal lactobacilli.
AB  == this study attempted to isolate lactobacilli strains from healthy vaginal ecosystem to search for a new effective antibacterial probiotic strain. the strains were identified and characterized for their probiotic properties including bile salt and acid tolerance, growth at acidic ph, their ability to utilize protein, starch, and lipid, the production of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin as well as their antibiotic resistance patterns. the antibacterial activity of the culture supernatant of these strains were tested against a wide range of gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae. salmonella typhi, and salmonella typhimurium. none of the strains inhibited the growth of gram-negative bacteria. contrastly, the culture supernatant of strain l 22, identified as lactobacillus reuteri, significantly inhibited all of the clinical  isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). the antibacterial effect of the selected strain l 22 was further investigated. in the presence of l 22, the bacterial growth was assessed in vitro by viable bacterial counting. the numbers  of viable cells were significantly lower in l 22-containing broth than those in the control by 6h. this finding clearly demonstrates that strain l 22 can produce an anti-mrsa effect. the antibacterial ability of the strain l 22 was fundamentally attributed to their bacteriocin production which can cause both cell inhibition and cell death.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the soy isoflavone genistein.
AB  == genistein, a radioprotective soy isoflavone and protein kinase inhibitor, blocks  the invasion of pathogenic bacteria in mammalian epithelial cells. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the direct effect of genistein on the survival and growth of the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri and selected opportunistic bacteria in vitro as a prelude to in vivo use for managing postirradiation sepsis. we evaluated the opportunistic bacterial enteropathogens escherichia coli, shigella  sonnei, and staphylococcus aureus as well as klebsiella pneumoniae and the non-pathogenic organism, bacillus anthracis (sterne). the latter two bacteria are found in the environment and may be of concern in irradiated individuals. a standard in vitro test was employed to evaluate the direct effect of genistein on the bacteria. this test involved determining bacterial colony forming unit (cfu)  counts at a single concentration of genistein. in the cfu assays, significant reductions in cfus were found for s. aureus and b. anthracis when cultured in the presence of 100 mum genistein. however, l. reuteri, e. coli, s. sonnei, and k. pneumoniae were not altered by in vitro culturing in the presence of 100 mum genistein. these results demonstrate the in vitro antimicrobial activity of genistein. furthermore, the use of genistein in combination with probiotics may augment the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies currently used in the management of infections, including those induced by ionizing irradiation.

TI  == 1,3-propanediol:nad+ oxidoreductases of lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri.
AB  == in the cofermentation of glycerol with a sugar by lactobacillus brevis and lactobacillus buchneri, a 1,3-propanediol:nad+ oxidoreductase provides an additional method of nadh disposal. the enzyme has been purified from both l. brevis b22 and l. buchneri b190 and found to have properties very similar to those reported for the enzyme from klebsiella pneumoniae. the enzymes required mn2+ and are probably octamers with a molecular mass of 350 kda. although not absolutely specific for 1,3-propanediol when tested as dehydrogenases, the enzymes have less than 10% activity with glycerol, ethanol, and 1,2-propanediol.  these properties contrast sharply with those of a protein isolated from another lactobacillus species (l. reuteri) that ferments glycerol with glucose and previously designated a 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase.
