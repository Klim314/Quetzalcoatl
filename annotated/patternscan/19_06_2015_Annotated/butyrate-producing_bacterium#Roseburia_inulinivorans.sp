TI  == prebiotic stimulation of human colonic butyrate-producing bacteria and bifidobacteria, in vitro.
AB  == dietary macronutrients affect the composition of the gut microbiota, and prebiotics are used to improve and maintain a healthy gut. the impact of prebiotics on dominant gut bacteria other than bifidobacteria, however, is under-researched. here, we report carbohydrate utilisation patterns for representative butyrate-producing anaerobes, belonging to the gram-positive firmicutes families lachnospiraceae and ruminococcaceae, by comparison with selected bacteroides and bifidobacterium species. growth assessments using anaerobic hungate tubes and a new rapid microtitre plate assay were generally in  good agreement. the bacteroides strains tested showed some growth on basal medium with no added carbohydrates, utilising peptides in the growth medium. the butyrate-producing strains exhibited different growth profiles on the substrates, which included starch, inulin, fructooligosaccharides (fos), galactooligosaccharides (gos) and xylooligosaccharides (xos). eleven were able to grow on short-chain fos, but this number decreased as the chain length of the fructan substrates increased. long-chain inulin was utilised by roseburia inulinivorans, but by none of the bifidobacterium species examined here. xos was  a more selective growth substrate than fos, with only six of the 11 firmicutes strains able to use xos for growth. these results illustrate the selectivity of different prebiotics and help to explain why some are butyrogenic.

TI  == in vitro kinetics of prebiotic inulin-type fructan fermentation by butyrate-producing colon bacteria: implementation of online gas chromatography for quantitative analysis of carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas production.
AB  == kinetic analyses of bacterial growth, carbohydrate consumption, and metabolite production of five butyrate-producing clostridial cluster xiva colon bacteria grown on acetate plus fructose, oligofructose, inulin, or lactate were performed. a gas chromatography method was set up to assess h2 and co2 production online and to ensure complete coverage of all metabolites produced. method accuracy was confirmed through the calculation of electron and carbon recoveries. fermentations with anaerostipes caccae dsm 14662(t), roseburia faecis dsm 16840(t), roseburia hominis dsm 16839(t), and roseburia intestinalis dsm 14610(t) revealed similar patterns of metabolite production with butyrate, co2, and h2 as  the main metabolites. r. faecis dsm 16840(t) and r. intestinalis dsm 14610(t) were able to degrade oligofructose, displaying a nonpreferential breakdown mechanism. lactate consumption was only observed with a. caccae dsm 14662(t). roseburia inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) was the only strain included in the present  study that was able to grow on fructose, oligofructose, and inulin. the metabolites produced were lactate, butyrate, and co2, without h2 production, indicating an energy metabolism distinct from that of other roseburia species. oligofructose degradation was nonpreferential. in a coculture of r. inulinivorans dsm 16841(t) with the highly competitive strain bifidobacterium longum subsp. longum lmg 11047 on inulin, hardly any production of butyrate and co2 was detected, indicating a lack of competitiveness of the butyrate producer. complete recovery of metabolites during fermentations of clostridial cluster xiva butyrate-producing colon bacteria allowed stoichiometric balancing of the metabolic pathway for butyrate production, including h2 formation.

TI  == cell-associated alpha-amylases of butyrate-producing firmicute bacteria from the  human colon.
AB  == selected butyrate-producing bacteria from the human colon that are related to roseburia spp. and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens showed a good ability to utilize a variety of starches for growth when compared with the gram-negative amylolytic anaerobe bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. a major cell-associated amylase of high molecular mass (140-210 kda) was detected in each strain by sds-page zymogram analysis, and genes corresponding to these enzymes were analysed for two representative strains. amy13b from but. fibrisolvens 16/4 is a multi-domain enzyme of 144.6 kda that includes a family 13 glycoside hydrolase domain, and duplicated family 26 carbohydrate-binding modules. amy13a (182.4 kda), from roseburia inulinivorans a2-194, also includes a family 13 domain, which is preceded by two repeat units of approximately 116 aa rich in aromatic residues, an isoamylase n-terminal domain, a pullulanase-associated domain, and an additional unidentified domain. both amy13a and amy13b have n-terminal signal peptides and c-terminal cell-wall sorting signals, including a modified lpxtg motif similar to that involved in interactions with the cell surface in other gram-positive bacteria, a hydrophobic transmembrane segment, and a basic c terminus. the overexpressed family 13 domains showed an absolute requirement for  mg2+ or ca2+ for activity, and functioned as 1,4-alpha-glucanohydrolases (alpha-amylases; ec 3.2.1.1). these major starch-degrading enzymes thus appear to be anchored to the cell wall in this important group of human gut bacteria.
