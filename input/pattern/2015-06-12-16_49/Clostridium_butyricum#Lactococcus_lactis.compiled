TI  - Gene transfer to Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319.
AB  - Although much is known about the bacterial cellulosome and its various protein components, their contributions to bacterial growth on cellulose and the process of cellulolysis in vivo cannot currently be assessed. To remedy this, the authors have developed gene transfer techniques for Clostridium cellulolyticum ATCC 35319. Firstly, transfer of Tn1545 has been obtained using an Enterococcus faecalis donor. Secondly, IncP-mediated conjugative mobilization of plasmids from Escherichia coli donors has also been achieved. The yield of transconjugants in both cases was low and was probably limited by the suboptimal growth conditions that must of necessity be employed for the co-culture of oligotrophic C. cellulolyticum with copiotrophic donors. A restriction endonuclease was detected in crude extracts of C. cellulolyticum. This enzyme, named CCE:I, is an isoschizomer of MSP:I (HPA:II). Electro-transformation was employed to establish plasmids containing the replication functions of pAMss1 (En. faecalis), pIM13 (Bacillus subtilis), pCB102 (Clostridium butyricum), pIP404 (Clostridium perfringens) and pWV01 (Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris) in C. cellulolyticum. Transformants were only obtained if the DNA was appropriately methylated on the external C of the sequence 5'-CCGG-3' using either BSU:FI methylase in vivo or MSP:I methylase in vitro. Plasmids based on the pAMss1 and pIM13 replicons were more stably maintained than one based on the pCB102 replicon. Selection of transformants on solid medium led to low apparent transformation efficiencies (approx. 10(2) transformants per microg DNA) which might, in part, reflect the low plating efficiency of the organism. Selection of transformants in liquid medium led to a higher apparent yield of transformants (between 10(5) and 10(7) transformants per microg DNA). The methods developed here will pave the way for functional analysis of the various cellulosome components in vivo.
TI  - Occurrence of nisin Z production in Lactococcus lactis BFE 1500 isolated from wara, a traditional Nigerian cheese product.
AB  - Screening for bacteriocin production of 500 strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from various African fermented foods resulted in the detection of a bacteriocin producing Lactococcus lactis (BFE 1500) isolated from a dairy product called wara. The bacteriocin inhibited not only the closely related LAB, but also strains of Listeria monocytogenes, Listeria innocua, Clostridium butyricum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillis cereus and Staphylococcus aureus. It was heat stable even at autoclaving temperature (121 degrees C for 15 min) and was active over a wide pH range (2-10), but highest activity was observed in the lower pH range. The bacteriocin was inactivated by alpha-chymotrypsin and proteinase K, but not by other proteases. Growth kinetic assay indicated stronger growth inhibition by the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 on L. monocytogenes WS 2250 and B. cereus DSM 2301 than with the nisin A producing strain DSM 20729. Polymerase chain reaction indicated the presence of the nisin operon in strain BFE 1500 and sequencing of its structural gene showed that Lc. lactis BFE 1500 produced the natural nisin variant, nisin Z, as indicated by the substitution of asparagine residue instead of histidine at position 27. The genetic determinants for bacteriocin production in strain BFE 1500 are located on a conjugative transposon. The ability of the bacteriocin produced by Lc. lactis BFE 1500 to inhibit a wide range of food-borne pathogens is of special interest for food safety, especially in the African environment with perennial problems of poor food hygiene.
TI  - In vitro utilization of amylopectin and high-amylose maize (Amylomaize) starch granules by human colonic bacteria.
AB  - It has been well established that a certain amount of ingested starch can escape  digestion in the human small intestine and consequently enters the large intestine, where it may serve as a carbon source for bacterial fermentation. Thirty-eight types of human colonic bacteria were screened for their capacity to utilize soluble starch, gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, and high-amylose maize starch granules by measuring the clear zones on starch agar plates. The six cultures which produced clear zones on amylopectin maize starch- containing plates were selected for further studies for utilization of amylopectin maize starch and high-amylose maize starch granules A (amylose; Sigma) and B (Culture Pro 958N). Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) was used to detect bacterial starch-degrading enzymes. It was demonstrated that Bifidobacterium spp., Bacteroides spp., Fusobacterium spp., and strains of Eubacterium, Clostridium, Streptococcus, and Propionibacterium could hydrolyze the gelatinized amylopectin maize starch, while only Bifidobacterium spp. and Clostridium butyricum could efficiently utilize high-amylose maize starch granules. In fact, C. butyricum and Bifidobacterium spp. had higher specific growth rates in the autoclaved medium containing high-amylose maize starch granules and hydrolyzed 80 and 40% of the amylose, respectively. Starch-degrading enzymes were cell bound on Bifidobacterium and Bacteroides cells and were extracellular for C. butyricum. Active staining for starch-degrading enzymes on SDS-PAGE gels showed that the Bifidobacterium cells produced several starch-degrading enzymes with high relative molecular (M(r)) weights (>160,000), medium-sized relative molecular weights (>66,000), and low relative molecular weights (<66,000). It was concluded that Bifidobacterium spp. and C. butyricum degraded and utilized granules of amylomaize starch.
