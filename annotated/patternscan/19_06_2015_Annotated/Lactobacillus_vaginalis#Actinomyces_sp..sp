TI  == the natural antimicrobial subtilosin a synergizes with lauramide arginine ethyl ester (lae), epsilon-poly-l-lysine (polylysine), clindamycin phosphate and metronidazole, against the vaginal pathogen gardnerella vaginalis.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is a common, recurrent vaginal infection linked to increased chances of preterm delivery, incidence of sexually transmitted infections and fertility problems. bv is caused by a shift of the vaginal ecosystem from predominately lactobacillus to a multispecies actinomyces biofilm  with the most common representatives identified as gardnerella vaginalis and prevotella spp. current treatments have been associated with increased resistance as well as negative effects on healthy microbiota. the objective of this study was to evaluate the synergistic potential of ten two-antimicrobial combinations against g. vaginalis and four representative lactobacilli. the four tested antimicrobials were lauramide arginine ethyl ester, epsilon-poly-l-lysine, clindamycin phosphate, metronidazole and the bacteriocin subtilosin a. the use of bacteriocins as either synergist or alternative treatment positions bacteriocins  as an excellent alternative to current antibiotics. the microdilution method was  used to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of each of the antimicrobials individually, and the checkerboard assay was used to evaluate these mics in combination. clindamycin and subtilosin (cs), and metronidazole and subtilosin were synergistic against g. vaginalis in terms of fractional inhibitory concentration index (fici). all tested combinations were found to have bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and polylysine (cp) was identified  as antagonistic against l. acidophilus in terms of both fici and bliss synergy. the combination of clindamycin and metronidazole (cm) was antagonistic against l. vaginalis for both fici and bliss synergy. the combinations of cp, clindamycin and lae, cs, and lae and polylysine were identified as bliss antagonistic against l. vaginalis but did not indicate fici antagonism.

TI  == the lower genital tract microbiota in relation to cytokine-, slpi- and endotoxin  levels: application of checkerboard dna-dna hybridization (cdh).
AB  == in the present study the lower genital tract microbiota in asymptomatic fertile women (n=34) was identified and quantified by culturing vaginal secretions. also, vaginal and cervical samples were analyzed by a semiquantitative checkerboard dna-dna hybridization technique (cdh) based on genomic probes prepared from 13 bacterial species (bacteroides ureolyticus, escherichia coli, fusobacterium nucleatum, gardnerella vaginalis, mobiluncus curtisii ss curtisii, prevotella bivia, prevotella disiens, prevotella melaninogenica, atopobium vaginae, lactobacillus iners, staphylococcus aureus ss aureus, streptococcus anginosus, and streptococcus agalactiae). the bacterial species found by either culture or cdh were correlated with proinflammatory cytokines (il-1 alpha, il-1 beta, il-6,  il-8), secretory leukocyte protease inhibitor (slpi), and endotoxin in the cervicovaginal samples. grading the women into healthy, intermediate, or bacterial vaginosis (bv) as based on gram staining of vaginal smears, the viable  counts of lactobacilli (l. gasseri) and of streptococci-staphylococci combined were highest in the intermediate group. in bv, particularly the high concentrations of actinomyces urogenitalis, atopobium vaginae, and peptoniphilus  harei were noted (>or=10(11) per ml). the total viable counts correlated with both cervical il-1 alpha and il-1 beta. a strong negative correlation was observed between l. iners and total viable counts, g. vaginalis, or cervical il-1 alpha, while it correlated positively with slpi. analysis of vaginal and cervical samples from 26 out of the 34 women by cdh showed that anaerobic bacteria were more frequently detected by cdh compared to culture. by this method, a. vaginae correlated with g. vaginalis, and l. iners with s. aureus. with regard to cytokines, b. ureolyticus correlated with both cervical and vaginal il-1 alpha as well as with cervical il-8, while f. nucleatum, s. agalactiae, s. anginosus, or s. aureus correlated with vaginal il-1 alpha. furthermore, all gram-negative bacteria taken together, as measured by cdh, correlated with vaginal endotoxin and inversely with vaginal slpi. the significance of the results is discussed. in summary, mapping of the identity and quantity of vaginal bacterial species and their association with locally produced host innate immune factors will help in defining various types of abnormal vaginal microbiota, developing new ways of assessing the risk of ascending subclinical infections, and in treating them. cdh appears to be a suitable tool for future analyses of large numbers of clinical samples with an extended number of bacterial probes.

TI  == characterisation of prototype nurmi cultures using culture-based microbiological  techniques and pcr-dgge.
AB  == undefined nurmi-type cultures (ntcs) have been used successfully to prevent salmonella colonisation in poultry for decades. such cultures are derived from the caecal contents of specific-pathogen-free birds and are administered via drinking water or spray application onto eggs in the hatchery. these cultures consist of many non-culturable and obligately anaerobic bacteria. due to their undefined nature it is difficult to obtain approval from regulatory agencies to use these preparations as direct fed microbials for poultry. in this study, 10 batches of prototype ntcs were produced using an identical protocol over a period of 2 years. traditional microbiological techniques and a molecular culture-independent methodology, polymerase chain reaction combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge), were applied to characterise  these cultures and also to examine if the constituents of the ntcs were identical. culture-dependent analysis of these cultures included plating on a variety of selective and semi-selective agars, examination of colony morphology,  gram-staining and a series of biochemical tests (api, biomerieux, france). two sets of pcr-dgge studies were performed. these involved the amplification of universal and subsequently lactic acid bacteria (lab)-specific hypervariable regions of a 16s rrna gene by pcr. resultant amplicons were subjected to dgge. sequence analysis was performed on subsequent bands present in resultant dgge profiles using the basic local alignment search tool (blast). microbiological culturing techniques tended to isolate common probiotic bacterial species from the genera lactobacillus, lactococcus, bifidobacterium, enterococcus, clostridium, escherichia, pediococcus and enterobacterium as well as members of the genera, actinomyces, bacteroides, propionibacterium, capnocytophaga, proteus, and klebsiella. bacteroides, enterococcus, escherichia, brevibacterium, klebsiella, lactobacillus, clostridium, bacillus, eubacterium, serratia, citrobacter, enterobacter, pectobacterium and pantoea spp. in addition to unculturable bacteria were identified as constituents of the ntcs using universal pcr-dgge analysis. a number of the sequences detected by lab-specific pcr-dgge were homologous to those of a number of lactobacillus spp., including l. fermentum, l. pontis, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, l. casei, l. suntoryeus, l. vaginalis, l. gasseri, l. aviaries, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, and l. mucosae  in addition to a range of unculturable lactobacilli. while ntcs are successful due to their complexity, the presence of members of lactobacillus spp. amongst other probiotic genera, in these samples possibly lends to the success of the ntc cultures as probiotics or competitive exclusion products in poultry over the decades. pcr-dgge proved to be an effective tool in detecting non-culturable organisms present in these complex undefined cultures. in conclusion, while the culture-dependent identification methods or pcr-dgge alone cannot comprehensively elucidate the bacterial species present in such complex cultures, their complementarity provides useful information on the identity of the constituents of ntcs and will aid in future development of defined probiotics. moreover, for the purpose of analysing prototype ntcs during their development, pcr-dgge overcomes the limitations associated with conventional culturing methods including their low sensitivities, inability to detect unculturable bacteria and  unknown species, very slow turnabout time and poor reproducibility. this study demonstrated that pcr-dgge is indeed more valuable in detecting predominant microbial populations between various ntcs than as an identification methodology, being more applicable as a quality control method used to analyse for batch-to-batch variation during ntc production.

TI  == relationship of bacteriologic characteristics to semen indices in men attending an infertility clinic.
AB  == bacteria can be isolated from most seminal fluid samples, but the significance of these microorganisms is uncertain because most men lack symptoms associated with  bacterial infection of the reproductive tract. we obtained semen samples from 37  men attending a special infertility clinic and assessed the relationship between  seminal fluid microorganisms and seminal fluid analysis including sperm motility, morphology, and concentration; the numbers of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and other white blood cells; and the hamster zona-free oocyte sperm penetration assay. aerobic and/or anaerobic bacteria were recovered from 36 of the 37 samples. one hundred eighty-eight isolates (113 aerobes, 74 anaerobes, and one yeast) were recovered, with a mean of 5.2 isolates per semen specimen. the microorganisms recovered from the samples included: coagulase-negative staphylococci (89%), viridans streptococci (65%), diphtheroids (86%), peptostreptococcus sp (62%), bacteroides sp (27%), gardnerella vaginalis (19%), lactobacillus sp (16%), actinomyces sp (16%), enterococcus (11%), and veillonella (11%). other microorganisms including group b streptococcus, hemophilus, escherichia coli, mobiluncus, and clostridium were each recovered from fewer than 10% of the specimens. when the microbiology of seminal fluid specimens with or without polymorphonuclear leukocytes was compared, the presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the semen was not associated with the isolation of staphylococci (33 versus 25%), viridans streptococci (33 versus 28%), bacteroides sp (17 versus 37%), or peptostreptococcus (31 versus 33%) (p greater  than .05 for each comparison). the proportion of semen samples yielding bacterial isolates was similar after categorization by normal motility (more than 60%), pyospermia (six or more leukocytes per 100 sperm), sperm concentration, morphology, and a normal sperm penetration assay (11% or more).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [isolation and identification of gardnerella vaginalis].
AB  == thirty-four strains of gardnerella vaginalis were studied. they were isolated from non specific vaginitis. a presumptive identification can be based on colonial morphology, gram stain characteristics, negative catalase and oxidase test. the differentiation of gardnerella vaginalis from other negative catalase coccobacilli is based on the acid formation of carbohydrates, enzymatic test, analysis of short chain volatile and non volatile end products of fermentation in glc. all gardnerella strains produce acid from glucose, maltose, starch and are hippurate and alpha glucosidase positive. they are sulfonamide resistant, acetic, lactic and succinic acids are detected by gas liquid chromatography.

TI  == a taxonomic study of gardnerella vaginalis (haemophilus vaginalis) gardner and dukes 1955.
AB  == fifty-five strains received as haemophilus vaginalis or as catalase-negative coryneform bacteria from the vagina together with 61 marker cultures were subjected to numerical phenetic analyses using 149 unit characters. the data were examined using the simple matching (ssm), jaccard (sj) and pattern (dp) coefficients and clustering was achieved using the average linkage algorithm. cluster composition was not markedly affected by the coefficient used or by test  error, estimated at 6 . 5%. the h. vaginalis strains formed a tight cluster which was only distantly related to representatives of the genera arthrobacter, cellulomonas, corynebacterium sensu stricto, erysipelothrix, haemophilus, kurthia, lactobacillus, listeria and propionibacterium but shared a high overall  affinity to unclassified catalase-negative coryneforms which formed a discrete taxon, cluster 9. the h. vaginalis strains could be distinguished from the related strains in cluster 9 by several unrelated phenotypic characters. using the s1 endonuclease assay, dna-dna hybridizations were performed with representative strains from the numerical as well as with reference strains of bifidobacterium and actinomyces. haemophilus vaginalis was found to be a genotypically legitimate group and its dna showed little homology with dna from the marker strains tested. the dna base composition of h. vaginalis was 42 to 44  mol % guanine plus cytosine. a new genus should be created to incorporate strains known as h. vaginalis or corynebacterium vaginale. the name gardnerella vaginalis proposed by greenwood & pickett (1979) is supported.
