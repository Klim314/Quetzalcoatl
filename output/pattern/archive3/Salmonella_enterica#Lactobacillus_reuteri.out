adhesive ability means inhibition activities for lactobacillus against pathogens  and s-layer protein plays an important role in adhesion.
eighty-five strains of lactobacillus were isolated from the pig intestine and identified by sequencing analysis based on 16s rrna gene, from which five lactobacillus strains with high adhesive ability were selected. the inhibition ability of the five lactobacillus strains with or without s-layer proteins against adherence of escherichia coli k88 and salmonella enteritidis 50335 to caco-2 was evaluated in vitro with lactobacillus rhamnosus gg strain (lgg) as a positive control. in addition, tolerance of lactobacilli to heat, acid, bile, zn(2+) and cu(2+) were assessed. all five selected strains, lactobacillus salivarius zj614 (jn981856), lactobacillus reuteri zj616 (jn981858), l. reuteri zj617 (jn981859), l. reuteri zj621 (jn981863) and l. reuteri zj623 (jn981865), showed inhibition against the two pathogens, e. coli k88 and s. enteritidis 50335. l. reuteri zj621 showed higher inhibition ability than the others to s. enteritidis 50335 (p < 0.05). sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis indicated that all five strains had abundant bands with molecular weight ranging from 34 to 130 kda as well as had a common band of approximately 42 kda. after treatment with 5 m licl to remove s-layer protein, the inhibition activities of the lactobacilli against pathogens decreased significantly (p < 0.05). the results showed that higher adhesive ability means higher inhibition activity for lactobacillus against pathogen, in which s-layer proteins plays an important role.
glycerol supplementation enhances l. reuteri's protective effect against s. typhimurium colonization in a 3-d model of colonic epithelium.
the probiotic effects of lactobacillus reuteri have been speculated to partly depend on its capacity to produce the antimicrobial substance reuterin during the reduction of glycerol in the gut. in this study, the potential of this process to protect human intestinal epithelial cells against infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium was investigated. we used a three-dimensional (3-d) organotypic model of human colonic epithelium that was previously validated and applied to study interactions between s. typhimurium and the intestinal epithelium that lead to enteric salmonellosis. using this model system, we show that l. reuteri protects the intestinal cells against the early stages of salmonella infection and that this effect is significantly increased when l. reuteri is stimulated to produce reuterin from glycerol. more specifically, the reuterin-containing ferment of l. reuteri caused a reduction in salmonella adherence and invasion (1 log unit), and intracellular survival (2 log units). in contrast, the l. reuteri ferment without reuterin stimulated growth of the intracellular salmonella population with 1 log unit. the short-term exposure to reuterin or the reuterin-containing ferment had no observed negative impact on intestinal epithelial cell health. however, long-term exposure (24 h) induced a complete loss of cell-cell contact within the epithelial aggregates and compromised cell viability. collectively, these results shed light on a potential role for reuterin in inhibiting salmonella-induced intestinal infections and may support the combined application of glycerol and l. reuteri. while future in vitro and in vivo studies of reuterin on intestinal health should fine-tune our understanding of the mechanistic effects, in particular in the presence of a complex gut microbiota, this the first report of a reuterin effect on the enteric infection process in any mammalian cell type.
identification and biological activity of potential probiotic bacterium isolated  from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb.
the lactic acid bacterium e isolated from the stomach mucus of breast-fed lamb was identified by sequencing of 16s rdna fragment and species-specific pcr as lactobacillus reuteri. its potential antimicrobial activity and ability to modulate immune system in vitro and in vivo was determined. the growth inhibition of potential pathogens decreased from staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica ser. minnesota to escherichia coli. the lowest inhibition activity was observed in the case of candida albicans. the ability of l. reuteri e to modulate biological activities of human and mouse mononuclear cells was estimated in vitro and in vivo, respectively. the production of il-1beta by monocytes in vitro was significantly induced by l. reuteri e (relative activity 2.47). the ability to modulate biological activities of mononuclear cells by living l. reuteri e cells in vitro in comparison to disintegrated l. reuteri e cells in vivo differed. for example lysozyme activity in vitro was inhibited while in vivo was stimulated (relative activities 0.30 and 1.83, respectively). the peroxidase activity in vitro was stimulated while in vivo was inhibited (relative activities 1.53 and 0.17, respectively). obtained results indicate that l. reuteri e is potential candidate to be used in probiotic preparations for animals and/or human.
evaluation of antimicrobial activity of probiotic bacteria against salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhimurium 1344 in a common medium under different environmental conditions.
the importance of probiotics in human nutrition has been gaining recognition in recent years. these organisms have been shown to promote human health by enhancing immunological and digestive functions and fighting respiratory tract infections. we propose an improved in vitro model for the study of probiotic antimicrobial activity against enteropathogens, by attempting to re-create, in a common culture medium, environmental growth conditions comparable to those present in the small intestine. a preliminary experiment was carried out in order to find a culture medium able to support both probiotics and pathogens. this was done with the aim of obtaining correct assessment of the interaction under shared growth conditions. bhi medium was selected as the common culture medium and was therefore used in antimicrobial activity assays. the interactions between salmonella 1344 and lactobacillus rhamnosus and lactobacillus reuteri were then assessed at different ph and oxygen availability conditions mimicking the small intestinal environment. l. rhamnosus gg atcc 53103 (lgg) had the strongest antimicrobial effect, in particular under anaerobic conditions and at lower ph levels. its antagonistic activity involved both lactic acid and secreted non-lactic acid molecules. our findings suggest that each probiotic strain has an optimum range of action and should therefore be thoroughly investigated to optimize its use.
in vitro antagonistic activities of animal intestinal strains against swine-associated pathogens.
a wide range of enteropathogens cause costly diarrhoeal diseases in fattening piglets and account for food-related infections in humans. the objective of this study was to screen beneficial bacterial strains from the gastrointestinal tract of various animal sources for antagonistic activity against diverse pathogens associated with hazardous pig production times. using agar spot assays, 15 well-characterized strains belonging to lactobacillus, enterococcus, bifidobacterium and bacillus were studied for inhibition of clostridium perfringens type a, various serovars of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, as well as brachyspira pilosicoli. strong antagonists were further analyzed by studying their cell-free supernatants with and without ph neutralization, proteinase k and catalase treatment. enterobacteriaceae were effectively inhibited by lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus reuteri strains, independent from the animal source, and on a lower level by single strains belonging to lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus amylovorus and bifidobacterium thermophilum, due to organic acid production. the bacillus subtilis strain was found to produce an anti-clostridial and anti-brachyspira metabolite of proteinaceous nature. homofermentative lactobacilli and b. thermophilum could suppress the growth of b. pilosicoli, the causative agent of intestinal spirochaetosis, whereas heterofermentative strains belonging to l. reuteri and l. mucosae had no effect. the lactic acid bacteria exerted their activity primarily by organic acid release, except one enterococcus faecium and l. amylovorus strain, which exhibited antagonism through joint activity of lactate and hydrogen peroxide. the findings of this study provide a basis for further in vitro studies and encourage feeding studies to evaluate the antagonistic potential of promising strains in pig production.
human-derived probiotic lactobacillus reuteri demonstrate antimicrobial activities targeting diverse enteric bacterial pathogens.
lactobacillus reuteri is a commensal-derived anaerobic probiotic that resides in  the human gastrointestinal tract. l. reuteri converts glycerol into a potent broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound, reuterin, which inhibits the growth of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we compared four human-derived l. reuteri isolates (atcc 55730, atcc pta 6475, atcc pta 4659 and atcc pta 5289) in their ability to produce reuterin and to inhibit the growth of different enteric pathogens in vitro. reuterin was produced by each of the four l. reuteri strains and assessed for biological activity. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of reuterin derived from each strain was determined for the following enteric pathogens: enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei and vibrio cholerae. we also analyzed the relative abilities of l. reuteri to inhibit enteric pathogens in a pathogen overlay assay. the magnitude of reuterin production did not directly correlate with the relative ability of l. reuteri to suppress the proliferation of enteric pathogens. additional antimicrobial factors may be produced by l. reuteri, and multiple factors may act synergistically with reuterin to inhibit enteric pathogens.
specific bifidobacterium strains isolated from elderly subjects inhibit growth of staphylococcus aureus.
cell-free, ph-controlled supernatants of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains isolated from healthy elderly subjects were subjected to antimicrobial activity assay. bioluminescent indicator strains staphylococcus aureus rn4220, escherichia coli k-12, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium atcc 14028 were used as targets of antimicrobial activity. the effect of nutrient depletion on the inhibition was eliminated with spent-culture controls. three out of thirty-eight bifidobacterium strains were capable of inhibiting the growth of s. aureus. the inhibition was equal to 23.2+/-19.1% to 50.4+/-26.7% of the inhibition caused by 50 iu/ml nisin. reuterin-producing positive strain lactobacillus reuteri sd2112 was capable of 86.0+/-24.6% inhibition, but bifidobacterium lactis bb-12, a known probiotic strain, showed no inhibition. none of the strains was capable of inhibiting the growth of e. coli or s. enterica. the observed inhibition by bifidobacteria was related to hydrogen peroxide formation and possible production of heat-stable proteinaceous compounds. the results suggest that production of antimicrobial substances other than organic acids is not common among bifidobacterium strains typical of elderly subjects. however, specific strains were identified which showed considerable inhibitory activity against s. aureus.
identification of lactobacilli isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens and characterization for potential use as probiotics to control salmonella enteritidis.
aims: to select lactobacillus strains from laying hens for potential use as probiotic to control salmonella enteritidis infection. methods and results: one hundred and eighty-six lactobacilli were isolated from the cloaca and vagina of laying hens, and identified at the species level by a polyphasic taxonomic approach. all isolates belonged to the lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus reuteri or lactobacillus salivarius phylogenetic groups, with the l. reuteri group being the most predominant group. based on genetic diversity, about 50 representative strains were selected and tested for in vitro properties that could be predictive for probiotic activity in laying hens. salmonella inhibition was shown to be species dependent, and correlated to some extent with the production of lactic acid. a selection of strains was evaluated in a s. enteritidis challenge experiment. two strains, l. reuteri r-17485 and lactobacillus johnsonii r-17504 significantly decreased the colonization of chicks by s. enteritidis in caeca, liver and spleen. conclusions: lactobacilli isolated from laying hens were observed to inhibit salmonella growth in vitro, most probably through production of lactic acid, and to decrease in vivo the s. enteritidis colonization of chicks. significance and impact of the study: the data demonstrate that lactobacillus isolates from laying hens may have probiotic potential in reducing s. enteritidis infection.
selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l. reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.
live lactobacillus rhamnosus [corrected] is essential for the inhibitory effect on tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced interleukin-8 expression.
the mechanism of the apparent anti-inflammatory action of probiotic organisms is  unclear. lactobacillus reuteri is effective in inhibiting colitis in interleukin-10 (il-10)-deficient mice. nerve growth factor (ngf), in addition to its activity on neuronal cell growth, has significant anti-inflammatory effects in several experimental systems in vitro and in vivo, including a model of colitis. our experiments were designed to explore the mechanism of effect of l. reuteri in the human epithelial cell lines t84 and ht29 on cytokine and ngf synthesis and il-8 response to tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha). epithelial cells were cultured for various times with live and killed l. reuteri and examined by reverse transcription-pcr for ngf, il-10, and tnf-alpha-induced il-8 expression. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantitate intracellular il-8 and secreted product. western blotting and confocal microscopy were used to determine the effects on ikappab and nf-kappab, respectively. live but not heat-killed or gamma-irradiated l. reuteri upregulated ngf and dose dependently inhibited constitutive synthesis by t84 and ht29 cells of il-8 and that induced by tnf-alpha in terms of mrna and intracellular and secreted protein. similarly, l. reuteri inhibited il-8 synthesis induced by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. l. reuteri required preincubation and adherence for effect, inhibited translocation of nf-kappab to the nuclei of hela cells, and prevented degradation of ikappab. neither cellular lysates nor media supernatants had any effect on tnf-alpha-induced il-8. the conclusion is that l. reuteri has potent direct anti-inflammatory activity on human epithelial cells, which is likely to be related to the activity of ingested probiotics. l. reuteri also upregulates an unusual anti-inflammatory molecule, ngf, and inhibits nf-kappab translocation to the nucleus.
modulation of anti-pathogenic activity in canine-derived lactobacillus species by carbohydrate growth substrate.
aims: to investigate the effect of various carbon sources on the production of extracellular antagonistic compounds against two escherichia coli strains and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium by three canine-derived lactobacilli strains. methods and materials: cell-free preparations, ph neutralized, were used in antibiotic disc experiments as an initial screening. the bacteria/carbohydrate combinations that showed inhibition of the growth of those pathogens, were further investigated in batch co-culture experiments. the cell-free supernatants of the cultures, that decreased the population number of the pathogens in the co-culture experiments to log cfu ml-1 <or= 4, were tested for inhibition of the pathogens in pure cultures at neutral and acidic ph. conclusions: the results showed that the substrate seems to affect the production of antimicrobial compounds and this effect could not just be ascribed to the ability of the bacteria to grow in the various carbon sources. l. mucosae, l. acidophilus and l. reuteri, when grown in sugar mixtures consisting of alpha-glucosides (degree of polymerization (dp) 1-4) could produce antimicrobial compounds active against all three pathogens in vitro. this effect could not be attributed to a single ingredient of those sugar mixtures and was synergistic. this inhibition had a dose-response characteristic and was more active at acidic ph. significance and impact of the study: knowledge of the effect that the carbon source has on the production of antimicrobial compounds by gut-associated lactobacilli allows the rational design of prebiotic/probiotic combinations to combat gastrointestinal pathogens.
antibacterial activity of lactobacillus species against vibrio species.
forty-one lactobacillus strains were tested for antagonistic activity against nine strains of vibrio. l. plantarum and l. casei were the most effective, and l. brevis was the least effective in inhibiting the growth of vibrio species. l. gasseri and l. helveticus strains showed higher activity, while l. reuteri and l. fermentum showed lower inhibitory activity against vibrio species. l. acidophilus strains exhibited various degrees of antagonistic activities against vibrio species. however, none of the lactobacillus species were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella enteritidis, s. typhimurium, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus. inhibition of the vibrio species was probably due to the production of organic acids by the lactobacillus species.
