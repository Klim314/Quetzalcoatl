TI  == exposure of feral swine (sus scrofa) in the united states to selected pathogens.
AB  == feral swine (sus scrofa) are widely distributed in the united states. in 2011 and 2012, serum samples and tonsils were recovered from 162 and 37 feral swine, respectively, in the us to evaluate exposure to important swine endemic pathogens. antibodies against porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (prrsv) and porcine circovirus type 2 (pcv2) were found in 2.5% and 25.3% of tested sera, respectively. positive serological reactions against mycoplasma hyopneumoniae and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae have been detected in 19.7% and 69.7% of animals. more than 15% of animals presented antibodies against these 2 pathogens simultaneously. most animals were also seropositive for lawsonia intracellularis. feral swine can also be involved in transmission of zoonotic agents. almost 50% of animals possessed antibodies against salmonella. in addition, 94.4% of animals were carriers of streptococcus suis in their tonsils.  in conclusion, feral swine may be considered as a potential reservoir for different endemic diseases in domestic pigs, as well as for important zoonotic agents.
