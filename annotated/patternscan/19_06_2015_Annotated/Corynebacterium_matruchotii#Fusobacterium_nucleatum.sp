TI  == subgingival microbiome in smokers and non-smokers in korean chronic periodontitis patients.
AB  == smoking is a major environmental factor associated with periodontal diseases. however, we still have a very limited understanding of the relationship between smoking and subgingival microflora in the global population. here, we investigated the composition of subgingival bacterial communities from the pooled plaque samples of smokers and non-smokers, 134 samples in each group, in korean patients with moderate chronic periodontitis using 16s rrna gene-based pyrosequencing. a total of 17,927 reads were analyzed and classified into 12 phyla, 126 genera, and 394 species. differences in bacterial communities between  smokers and non-smokers were examined at all phylogenetic levels. the genera fusobacterium, fretibacterium, streptococcus, veillonella, corynebacterium, tm7,  and filifactor were abundant in smokers. on the other hand, prevotella, campylobacter, aggregatibacter, veillonellaceae gq422718, haemophilus, and prevotellaceae were less abundant in smokers. among species-level taxa occupying  > 1% of whole subgingival microbiome of smokers, higher abundance (>/= 2.0-fold compared to non-smokers) of seven species or operational taxonomic units (otus) was found: fusobacterium nucleatum, neisseria sicca, neisseria oralis, corynebacterium matruchotii, veillonella dispar, filifactor alocis, and fretibacterium ay349371. on the other hand, lower abundance of 11 species or otus was found in smokers: neisseria elongata, six prevotella species or otus, fusobacterium canifelinum, aggregatibacter am420165, selenomonas otu, and veillonellaceae gu470897. species richness and evenness were similar between the  groups whereas diversity was greater in smokers than non-smokers. collectively, the results of the present study indicate that differences exist in the subgingival bacterial community between smoker and non-smoker patients with chronic moderate periodontitis in korea, suggesting that cigarette smoking considerably affects subgingival bacterial ecology.

TI  == association of a novel high molecular weight, serine-rich protein (srpa) with fibril-mediated adhesion of the oral biofilm bacterium streptococcus cristatus.
AB  == the surface of the oral plaque bacterium streptococcus cristatus is decorated with a lateral tuft of fibrils. the fibrillar tuft functions in the adhesion of s. cristatus to heterologous bacterial species in the plaque biofilm. the tuft typically consists of a densely packed fringe of shorter fibrils 238 +/- 19 nm long with longer, less abundant fibrils 403 +/- 66 nm long projecting through the fringe of short fibrils. the two types of fibrils in the tufts of s. cristatus have been refractory to biochemical separation, complicating their characterization. a hexadecane partition assay was used to enrich for subpopulations of s. cristatus cr311 (type strain nctc 12479) having distinct fibrillar morphotypes. negative staining in the tem revealed that cells of a hydrophobic subpopulation of s. cristatus (cr311var1) carried only the long fibrils (395 +/- 32 nm). a hydrophilic subpopulation of s. cristatus (cr311var3)  consisted of mixed morphotypes having no fibrils or remnant short fibrils (223 +/- 49 nm). no long fibrils were observed on any cells in the cr311var3 subpopulation. the cr311var3 morphotype, unlike the wild-type strain and cr311var1, was not able to form corncobs with either corynebacterium matruchotii  or fusobacterium nucleatum. variant cr311var3 did not express the novel gene srpa, which encodes a high molecular weight (321,882 da) serine-rich protein, srpa. the srpa protein contains two extensive repeat motifs of 17 and 71 amino acids and a gram-positive cell wall anchor consensus sequence (lpntg). the unusual properties of srpa most closely resemble those of fap1, the fimbrial-associated adhesin protein of streptococcus parasanguis. the association of long fibrils, high surface hydrophobicity, ability to form corncob formations, and expression of the srpa gene suggest that srpa is a long fibril protein in s.  cristatus.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.
