TI  == antibacterial assay-guided isolation of active compounds from artocarpus heterophyllus heartwoods.
AB  == context: preparations from artocarpus heterophyllus lam. (moraceae) heartwoods are used in the traditional folk medicine for the treatment of inflammation, malarial fever, and to prevent bacterial and fungal infections. objective: the objective of this study was to isolate pure antibacterial compounds from a. heterophyllus heartwoods. materials and methods: the dried and powdered a. heterophyllus heartwoods were successively extracted with the following solvents: hexane, ethyl acetate, and methanol. each of the extracts was screened for their  antibacterial activities using a disc diffusion method (10 mg/disc). their minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) were determined using a broth microdilution method. the extract that showed the strongest antibacterial activities was fractionated to isolate the active compounds by an antibacterial assay-guided isolation process. results and  discussion: the ethyl acetate extract exhibited the strongest antibacterial activities against streptococcus mutans, s. pyogenes, and bacillus subtilis with  mic values of 78, 39, and 9.8 microg/ml, respectively. based on an antibacterial  assay-guided isolation, four antibacterial compounds: cycloartocarpin (1), artocarpin (2), artocarpanone (3), and cyanomaclurin (4) were purified. among these isolated compounds, artocarpin exhibited the strongest antibacterial activity against gram-positive bacteria, including s. mutans, s. pyogenes, b. subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and s. epidermidis with mics of 4.4, 4.4, 17.8,  8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, and mbcs of 8.9, 8.9, 17.8, 8.9, and 8.9 microm, respectively, while artocarpanone showed the strongest activity against escherichia coli, a gram-negative bacteria with mic and mbc values of 12.9 and 25.8 microm, respectively. only artocarpin showed inhibitory activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa with an mic of 286.4 microm.

TI  == antibacterial activity of berry juices, an in vitro study.
AB  == abstract objective. the aim of the present study was to evaluate in vitro antibacterial activities of blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices on bacteria associated with gingival inflammation. materials and methods. the growth of selected bacteria (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and pseudomonas aeruginosa) was studied in vitro on agar plates. the  content of phenols in the different extracts was measured with hplc-esi-ms. results. the spectrometric analysis identified that the highest level of the single phenols studied was found for ferulic acid (113 mug/ml) in blackcurrant juice. sea buckthorn contained low levels of selected phenols. total bacterial inhibition for all bacterial species studied was found at 20% berry juice concentration with ph varying between 4.1-5.4. conclusions. the present study identified that in vitro bacterial growth on agar plates was inhibited by blackcurrant and sea buckthorn juices and that low juice ph explains bacterial in vitro growth. this may have clinical implications in biofilm development, reducing the risks for both tooth decay and gingivitis.

TI  == a microbiological assessment of the oral hygiene of 24-72-month-old kindergarten  children and disinfection of their toothbrushes.
AB  == background: the objective of this study is to assess the index of decayed, missing and filled teeth (dmf-t), habit of brushing teeth, and the microbiological agents accumulating on the children's toothbrushes for 4 weeks and response of these agents to disinfection via a chlorhexidine solution, then compare those results with the education and income levels of the children's parents. method: included in the study were 187 children (96 in the control group and 91 in the experiment group - chlorhexidine) chosen randomly from 600 kindergarten children whose ages ranged from 24 months to 72 months. the children selected had not taken any antibiotics, antimicotics for three months and dental  treatments during this trial. the distribution of these children to the groups was also done randomly. after performing a survey for the education, occupation,  and income status of the parents, the children were examined and the number of decayed teeth was recorded. the children were given toothbrushes, toothpaste (with fluroide), and the solutions (including distilled water and chlorhexidine)  for four weeks under the condition that toothbrushes were returned at the end of  each week. the 14 different microbiological agents observed as a result of the assessment of the samples taken in the first week were also included in the assessments of the samples taken over the four-week period. results: the decrease in the dmf-t index was found to be meaningful according to the differences in education, income, and occupation status of the parents. of all the samples taken from the toothbrushes, the bacteria with the greatest rate of reproduction included streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeuroginosa, enterococcus spp, staphylococcus epidermidis and candida albicans. except for candida albicans, the other microorganisms taken as samples from the toothbrushes reproduced less overall. in the group using the solution with chlorhexidine, a meaningful decrease in bacterial reproduction was discovered compared to the control group. conclusion: the findings of this study show that the education, occupation, and socioeconomic situations of the parents should be considered when discussing children's oral and dental health. moreover, the study shows that disinfection of toothbrushes in order to prevent reinfection and contamination oral flora with the bacteria again is important in terms of preventive medicine and family-children health.

TI  == susceptibility of methacrylate-based root canal filling to degradation by bacteria found in endodontic infections.
AB  == objectives: to present a case of endodontic failure obturated with a methacrylate-based root filling material, resilon/realseal (rs). to determine if  rs is susceptible to biodegradation by endodontically relevant microbes by a method known to show rs degradation. method and materials: emulsions of rs were dispersed in agar with minimal bacterial nutrients in culture plates. lipase ps served as a positive control. pseudomonas aeruginosa, fusobacterium nucleatum, prevotella intermedia, porphyromonas gingivalis, porphyromonas asaccharolytica, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis were tested for their ability to biodegrade rs. the bacteria were inoculated in the plates and examined daily for rs degradation for 7 days. results: degradation of the emulsified rs manifested in the formation of clear zones around p aeruginosa, p intermedia, p asaccharolytica, s aureus, and s epidermidis. no degradation was seen with the other tested bacteria or in plates that did not contain rs emulsion. conclusion:  endodontic pathogenic bacteria can degrade rs. these findings complement other work and suggest that the seal and integrity of root canal fillings obturated with rs may be impaired by a microbial insult.

TI  == bacterial resistance of self-assembled surfaces using ppom-b-psbman zwitterionic  copolymer - concomitant effects of surface topography and surface chemistry on attachment of live bacteria.
AB  == three well-defined diblock copolymers made of poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate) (poly(sbma)) and poly(propylene oxide) (ppo) groups were synthesized by atom transfer radical polymerization (atrp) method. they were physically adsorbed onto three types of surfaces having different topography, including smooth flat surface, convex surface, and indented surface. chemical state of surfaces was characterized by xps while the various topographies were examined by sem and afm. hydrophilicity of surfaces was dependent on both the surface chemistry and the surface topography, suggesting that orientation of copolymer brushes can be tuned in the design of surfaces aimed at resisting bacterial attachment. escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and escherichia coli with  green fluorescent protein (e. coli gfp) were used in bacterial tests to assess the resistance to bacterial attachment of poly(sbma)-covered surfaces. results highlighted a drastic improvement of resistance to bacterial adhesion with the increasing of poly(sbma) to ppo ratio, as well as an important effect of surface  topography. the chemical effect was directly related to the length of the hydrophilic moieties. when longer, more water could be entrapped, leading to improved anti-bacterial properties. the physical effect impacted on the orientation of the copolymer brushes, as well as on the surface contact area available. convex surfaces as well as indented surfaces wafer presented the best  resistance to bacterial adhesion. indeed, bacterial attachment was more importantly reduced on these surfaces compared with smooth surfaces. it was explained by the non-orthogonal orientation of copolymer brushes, resulting in a  more efficient surface coverage of zwitterionic molecules. this work suggests that not only the control of surface chemistry is essential in the preparation of surfaces resisting bacterial attachment, but also the control of surface topography and orientation of antifouling moieties.

TI  == gamma-alkylidene-gamma-lactones and isobutylpyrrol-2(5h)-ones analogues to rubrolides as inhibitors of biofilm formation by gram-positive and gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  == several molecules have been discovered that interfere with formation of bacterial biofilms, opening a new strategy for the development of more efficient treatments in case of antibiotic resistant bacteria. amongst the most active compounds are some natural brominated furanones from marine algae delisea pulchra that have proven to be able to control pathogenic biofilms. we have recently reported that  some rubrolide analogues are able to inhibit biofilm formation of enterococcus faecalis. in the present letter we describe results of the biological evaluation  of a small library of 28 compounds including brominated furanones and the corresponding lactams against biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutans. our  results showed that in general these compounds were more active against biofilms  of s. epidermidis and p. aeruginosa, with little or no inhibition of planktonic bacterial growth. in some cases they were able to prevent biofilm formation of p. aeruginosa at concentrations as low as 0.6 mug/ml (1.3 mum, compound 3d) and 0.7  mug/ml (1.3 mum, 3f). results also indicate that, in general, lactams are more active against biofilms than their precursors, thus designating this class of molecules as good candidates for the development of a new generation of antimicrobial drugs targeted to biofilm inhibition.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == photocatalytic antibacterial effects are maintained on resin-based tio2 nanocomposites after cessation of uv irradiation.
AB  == photocatalysis induced by tio2 and uv light constitutes a decontamination and antibacterial strategy utilized in many applications including self-cleaning environmental surfaces, water and air treatment. the present work reveals that antibacterial effects induced by photocatalysis can be maintained even after the  cessation of uv irradiation. we show that resin-based composites containing 20% tio2 nanoparticles continue to provide a pronounced antibacterial effect against  the pathogens escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis for up to two hours post uv. for biomaterials or implant coatings, where direct uv illumination is not feasible, a prolonged antibacterial effect after the cessation of the illumination would offer new unexplored treatment possibilities.

TI  == synergetic inactivation of staphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus mutansin  a tio2/h2o2/uv system.
AB  == tio 2 photocatalysis can be used to kill surface adherent bacteria on biomaterials, and is particularly interesting for use with percutaneous implants  and devices. its efficiency and safety, however, depend on the activation energy  required. this in vitro study investigates synergetic effects against the clinically relevant strains s. epidermidis and s. mutans when combining photocatalytic surfaces with h2o2. after 20 min exposure to 0.1 wt% h2o2 and uv light on tio2 surfaces, viabilities of s. epidermidis and s. mutans were reduced  by 99.7% and 98.9%, respectively. without h2o2 the corresponding viability reduction was 86% for s. epidermidis and 65% for s. mutans. this study indicates  that low concentrations of h2o2 can enhance the efficiency of photocatalytic tio2 surfaces, which could potentially improve current techniques used for decontamination and debridement of tio2 coated biomedical implants and devices.

TI  == a distinguishable role of edna in the viscoelastic relaxation of biofilms.
AB  == bacteria in the biofilm mode of growth are protected against chemical and mechanical stresses. biofilms are composed, for the most part, of extracellular polymeric substances (epss). the extracellular matrix is composed of different chemical constituents, such as proteins, polysaccharides, and extracellular dna (edna). here we aimed to identify the roles of different matrix constituents in the viscoelastic response of biofilms. staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms were grown under different conditions yielding distinct matrix chemistries. next, biofilms were subjected to mechanical deformation and stress relaxation was monitored over time. a maxwell model possessing an average of four elements for an individual biofilm was used to fit the data. maxwell elements were defined by a relaxation time constant and their relative importance. relaxation time constants varied widely over the 104 biofilms included and were divided into seven ranges (<1, 1 to 5, 5 to 10, 10 to 50, 50 to 100, 100 to 500, and >500 s). principal-component  analysis was carried out to eliminate related time constant ranges, yielding three principal components that could be related to the known matrix chemistries. the fastest relaxation component (<3 s) was due to the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, combined with the absence of bacteria, i.e., the heaviest masses in a biofilm. an intermediate component (3 to 70 s) was related to other epss, while a distinguishable role was assigned to intact edna, which possesses a unique principal component with a time constant range (10 to 25 s) between those of eps constituents. this implies that edna modulates its interaction with other matrix constituents to control its contribution to viscoelastic relaxation under mechanical stress. importance: the protection offered by biofilms to organisms that inhabit it against chemical and mechanical  stresses is due in part to its matrix of extracellular polymeric substances (epss) in which biofilm organisms embed themselves. mechanical stresses lead to deformation and possible detachment of biofilm organisms, and hence, rearrangement processes occur in a biofilm to relieve it from these stresses. maxwell analysis of stress relaxation allows the determination of characteristic  relaxation time constants, but the biofilm components and matrix constituents associated with different stress relaxation processes have never been identified. here we grew biofilms with different matrix constituents and used principal-component analysis to reveal that the presence of water and soluble polysaccharides, together with the absence of bacteria, is associated with the fastest relaxation, while other epss control a second, slower relaxation. extracellular dna, as a matrix constituent, had a distinguishable role with its own unique principal component in stress relaxation with a time constant range between those of other epss.

TI  == cytotoxicity of brazilian plant extracts against oral microorganisms of interest  to dentistry.
AB  == background: with the emergence of strains resistant to conventional antibiotics,  it is important to carry studies using alternative methods to control these microorganisms causing important infections, such as the use of products of plant origin that has demonstrated effective antimicrobial activity besides biocompatibility. therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of plant extracts of equisetum arvense l., glycyrrhiza glabra l., punica granatum l. and stryphnodendron barbatimam mart. against staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, candida albicans, candida tropicalis, and candida glabrata, and to analyze the cytotoxicity of these extracts in cultured murine macrophages (raw 264.7). methods: antimicrobial activity of plant extracts was evaluated by microdilution method based on clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi), m7-a6 and m27-a2 standards. the cytotoxicity of concentrations that eliminated the microorganisms was evaluated by mtt colorimetric method and by quantification of proinflammatory cytokines (il-1beta and tnf-alpha) using elisa. results: in determining the minimum microbicidal concentration, e. arvense l., p. granatum l., and s. barbatimam mart. extracts at a concentration of 50 mg/ml and g. glabra l. extract at a concentration of 100 mg/ml, were effective against all microorganisms tested. regarding cell viability, values were 48% for e. arvense l., 76% for p. granatum l, 86% for s. barbatimam mart. and 79% for g. glabra l. at the same concentrations. about cytokine production after stimulation with the most effective concentrations of the extracts, there was a significant increase of il-1beta in macrophage cultures treated with s. barbatimam mart. (3.98 pg/ml) and p. granatum l. (7.72 pg/ml) compared to control (2.20 pg/ml) and a significant decrease of tnf-alpha was observed in cultures treated with g. glabra l. (4.92 pg/ml), s. barbatimam mart. (0.85 pg/ml), e. arvense l. (0.83 pg/ml), and p. granatum l. (0.00 pg/ml) when compared to control (41.96 pg/ml). conclusions: all plant extracts were effective against the microorganisms tested. the g. glabra l. extract exhibited least cytotoxicity and the e. arvense l. extract was the most cytotoxic.

TI  == duodenal-mucosal bacteria associated with celiac disease in children.
AB  == celiac disease (cd) is an immune-mediated enteropathy triggered by the ingestion  of cereal gluten proteins. this disorder is associated with imbalances in the gut microbiota composition that could be involved in the pathogenesis of cd. the aim  of this study was to characterize the composition and diversity of the cultivable duodenal mucosa-associated bacteria of cd patients and control children. duodenal biopsy specimens from patients with active disease on a gluten-containing diet (n = 32), patients with nonactive disease after adherence to a gluten-free diet (n = 17), and controls (n = 8) were homogenized and plated on plate count agar, wilkins-chalgren agar, brain heart agar, or yeast, casitone, and fatty acid agar. the isolates were identified by partial 16s rrna gene sequencing. renyi diversity profiles showed the highest diversity values for active cd patients, followed by  nonactive cd patients and control individuals. members of the phylum proteobacteria were more abundant in patients with active cd than in the other child groups, while those of the phylum firmicutes were less abundant. members of the families enterobacteriaceae and staphylococcaceae, particularly the species klebsiella oxytoca, staphylococcus epidermidis, and staphylococcus pasteuri, were more abundant in patients with active disease than in controls. in contrast, members of the family streptococcaceae were less abundant in patients with active cd than in controls. furthermore, isolates of the streptococcus anginosus and streptococcus mutans groups were more abundant in controls than in both cd patient groups, regardless of inflammatory status. the findings indicated that the disease is associated with the overgrowth of possible pathobionts that exclude symbionts or commensals that are characteristic of the healthy small intestinal microbiota.

TI  == identification of the hydroxyapatite-binding domain of salivary agglutinin.
AB  == the salivary agglutinin glycoprotein (sag) is present in saliva but is also part  of the salivary pellicle, playing a seemingly paradoxical role with regard to bacterial homeostasis. on the one hand, sag aggregates bacteria in solution, thereby preventing bacterial colonization. on the other hand, when bound to the tooth surface, sag facilitates bacterial colonization and microbial growth. the protein part of sag is predominantly composed of conserved scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (srcr) domains. previously it was found that bacterial binding and  aggregation is mediated via a single peptide loop, designated srcrp2 (p2), within the srcr domains of sag. the current data suggest that the srcr domains also harbour a hydroxyapatite (ha)-binding moiety, srcrp3 (p3). the observation that p2 and p3 individually play unique roles in the function of sags contributes to our understanding of the dual role of sags in bacterial binding. inspired by the  bacterial-modulating capacity of sags, we created a p3-polyethylene glycol (peg)  conjugate. it was found that a p3 coating resulted in an increased antifouling activity of 20% compared with the uncoated surface in vitro. an additional peg moiety resulted in an antifouling activity of up to 40% and 30% for streptococcus mutans and staphylococcus epidermidis, respectively.

TI  == lantibiotic production by pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == lantibiotics are ribosomally synthesised, post-translationally modified antimicrobial peptides produced by gram positive bacteria, many which have broad-ranging antimicrobial activities. lantibiotics have long been the subject of investigation with a view to their application as food preservatives or chemotherapeutic agents for clinical and veterinary medicine, while the associated biosynthetic machinery has been employed for peptide engineering purposes. however, although many lantibiotics are produced by generally regarded  as safe or food-grade bacteria, it is increasingly apparent that a number of gram positive pathogens, including strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus uberis and enterococcus faecalis, also produce these compounds. it is proposed that production of these antimicrobials may provide the associated microorganisms with a competitive advantage when colonizing/infecting  a host, thereby enhancing the virulence of the producing strain. here we review the production of lantibiotics by these pathogens and discuss how their production may contribute to their disease-causing potential.

TI  == extracellular dna in biofilms.
AB  == extracellular dna (edna) is an important biofilm component that was recently discovered. its presence has been initially observed in biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mutans, then enterococcus faecalis and staphylococci. autolysis is the common mechanism by which edna is released. in p. aeruginosa edna is generated by lysis of a bacterial subpopulation, under control of quorum sensing system. in e. faecalis autolysis proceeds in a fratricide mode, resulting from a process similar to necrosis of eukaryotic cells. in staphylococcus aureus autolysis originates by an altruistic  suicide, i.e., a programmed cell death similar to apoptosis of eukaryotic cells.  in s. aureus autolysis is mediated by murein hydrolase, while in s. epidermidis by the autolysin protein atle. in p. aeruginosa edna is located primarily in the  stalks of mushroom-shaped multicellular structures. in s. aureus the crucial role of edna in stabilizing biofilm is highlighted by the disgregating effect of dnase i. edna represents an important mechanism for horizontal gene transfer in bacteria. edna and other microbial structural motifs are recognized by the innate immune system via the tlr family of pattern recognition receptors (prrs).

TI  == electrochemically induced anatase inhibits bacterial colonization on titanium grade 2 and ti6al4v alloy for dental and orthopedic devices.
AB  == bacterial contamination of implanted devices is a common cause of their failure.  the aim of the present study was to assess the capability of electrochemical procedures to: (a) promote the formation of anatase on the surface of commercially pure grade 2 ti and ti grade 5 (ti6al4v) alloy; (b) inhibit in vitro biofilm formation of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and porphyromonas gingivalis and oral plaque in vivo, (c) preserve favorable response of osteoblasts and fibroblasts to materials surfaces. ti grade 2 and ti grade 5 were respectively anodized at two different voltages: 90 and 130v for pure titanium; 100 and 120v for ti6al4v alloy. surface characterization was performed by scanning electron microscopy (sem) equipped with eds probe, laser profilometry and x-ray diffractometry. bacterial adhesion characterization was performed either in vitro and in vivo in patients. osteoblast and fibroblast response was evaluated by metabolic activity assessment. the higher voltage applied in the anodization treatment of pure titanium (130v) and ti6al4v alloy (120v) surfaces, compared to the untreated pure titanium and ti6al4v and to lower voltage treatments, resulted in a greater decrease in bacterial attachment and biofilm formation in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. in contrast, the high voltage treatments were found to promote  osteoblasts and fibroblasts proliferation. the observations indicated that the experimented high voltage anodization treatments may contribute to preserve the tissue integration and reduce bacteria colonization of titanium and titanium alloy for implantable applications.

TI  == proposal of protocols using d-glutamine to optimize the 2,3-bis(2-methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenly)-5-[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-2h-tetrazolium hydroxide (xtt) assay for indirect estimation of microbial loads in biofilms of medical importance.
AB  == due to technical problems, biofilm biomasses are difficult to be precisely determined. one reliable strategy is based on the colorimetry of formazan compounds derived from tetrazolium salt reduction. xtt presents some desirable properties that make the biofilm measurements easier. however, cells entrapped within the extracellular matrixes normally do not metabolize the tetrazolium equally, leading to underestimation of cell contents. this study evaluated the effectiveness of d-glutamine, a plerotic substrate of tricarboxilic acid cycle (tac), as inducer of xtt reduction. the metabolic activities of aerobic and anaerobic 48 h-old monospecific biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc(r)27853,  klebsiella pneumoniae atcc(r)13883, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc(r)12228, streptococcus mutans atcc(r)25175, and candida albicans sc5314 were evaluated. results showed that d-glutamine 50 mm (for p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and s. epidermidis) and 25 mm (for s. mutans and c. albicans) may enhance the detection  of soluble formazan in a significant manner, what becomes the xtt reduction assay more robust.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == increase in detectable opportunistic bacteria in the oral cavity of orthodontic patients.
AB  == objectives: this study was performed to detect the opportunistic bacteria and fungi from the oral cavities of orthodontic patients and examine the ability of the organisms to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. methods: opportunistic bacteria and fungi were isolated from 58 patients (orthodontic group: 42; non-orthodontic group: 16) using culture methods and were identified based on their biochemical and enzymatic profiles. seven opportunistic and four streptococcal strains were tested for their ability to adhere to saliva-coated metallic brackets. results: more opportunistic bacteria and fungi were detected in the orthodontic group than in the non-orthodontic group (p < 0.05). opportunistic bacteria adhered to saliva-coated metallic brackets to the same degree as oral streptococci. conclusions: the isolation frequencies of opportunistic bacteria and fungi increase during orthodontic treatment, suggesting the importance of paying special attention to oral hygiene in orthodontic patients to prevent periodontal disease and the aggravation of systemic disease in immunocompromised conditions.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == reduced medical infection related bacterial strains adhesion on bioactive rgd modified titanium surfaces: a first step toward cell selective surfaces.
AB  == ideally, implants should inhibit nonspecific protein adsorption, bacterial adhesion, and at the same time, depending on the final application be selective toward cellular adhesion and spreading for all or only selected cell types. poly(l-lysine)-grafted-poly(ethylene glycol) (pll-g-peg) polymers have been shown to adsorb from aqueous solution onto negatively charged metal oxide surfaces, reducing protein adsorption as well as fibroblast, osteoblast and epithelial cell adhesion significantly. pll-g-peg can be functionalized with bioligands such as rgd (arg-gly-asp), which then restores host cell adhesion, but the surface remains resistant to nonspecific protein adsorption. previously, it was also shown that both nonfunctionalized pll-g-peg and rgd-peptide functionalized pll-g-peg reduced the adhesion of staphylococcus aureus to titanium (ti) surfaces. the present study looked at the effect of other implant associated infection relevant bacteria, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa towards the same surface chemistries. the different surfaces were exposed to the bacteria for 1-24 h, and bacteria surface density was evaluated using scanning electron microscopy (sem) and fluorescence light microscopy (fm). the adhesion of all bacteria strains tested was reduced on ti surfaces coated with pll-g-peg compared to uncoated ti surfaces even in the presence of rgd. the percentage reduction in bacterial adhesion over the 24-h culture time investigated was 88%-98%, depending on the bacteria type. therefore, coating surfaces with pll-g-peg/peg-rgd allows cells such as fibroblasts and osteoblasts to attach but not bacteria, resulting in a selective biointeractive pattern that may be useful on medical implants.

TI  == an alternative infrared spectroscopy assay for the quantification of polysaccharides in bacterial samples.
AB  == the ability of bacteria to produce extracellular polysaccharides has been regarded as an indication of biofilm-forming capacity. therefore, the determination of the sugar content in bacterial samples becomes a significant parameter. the colorimetric methods currently used are rather sensitive to the nature of the sugars and therefore require knowledge of the sugar types present in the samples. unfortunately, the types of sugars present in bacteria are generally unknown and often composed of a complex mixture. in this article, we propose an alternative method based on fourier transform infrared (ftir) spectroscopy for the estimation of the total sugar content in bacterial samples.  the method is based on a systematic treatment of ftir spectra obtained from dried bacteria samples. it is assumed that the total sugar amount can be estimated from the area of characteristic bands between 970 and 1182 cm(-1). in parallel, the amide ii band (1560-1530 cm(-1)) associated with proteins, or the c-h stretching  region (2820-3020 cm(-1)) associated with the biomass, can be used for normalization purposes. therefore, the ratio of the band area in the sugar window over that of the amide ii or c-h stretching can be used to report the sugar content in bacterial samples. this method has been validated on model bacterial mixtures containing sugars, proteins, and dna. results with real bacterial samples are also provided and show conclusively that increased sugar contents in  biofilms can be identified. the proposed ftir approach requires minimal sample preparation and a single acquisition, is rapid, and may be applied to any kind of bacterial growth.

AB  == in this study the quantitative adhesion of a strain of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans and pseudomonas aeruginosa to and the ease of removal from different tinox coatings was investigated by means of a parallel plate flow chamber and in situ image analysis. quality of adhesion was determined by counting bacteria which remained attached to the surface after exposure to an  air-liquid interface. s. epidermidis and s. mutans showed a bipolar adhesion pattern with highest numbers of adhesion at low and high resistivity with lowest  adhesions at a resistivity of 10(4) microohms cm. p. aeruginosa was the least adherent organism. these results indicate that the affinity of these three strains under the current experimental conditions is minimal for tinox coatings with a specific resistivity. tinox coatings with pre-adsorbed fibrinogen showed different numbers of s. epidermidis adhered to the different coatings. however, the affinity of this strain for fibrinogen-coated tinox remains low when the resistivity is around 10(4) microohms cm. this indicates that the specific influence of the resistivities of the tinox coatings is transferred through the adsorbed fibrinogen film to the interface with adhering bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of a castor oil-based irrigant.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of irrigating solutions--endoquil (castor oil detergent), 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution, and 0.5% naocl solution-was evaluated against gram-positive cocci (micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, and streptococcus sobrinus), gram-negative rods (escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa), and the yeast candida albicans. activity was evaluated using the two-layer agar diffusion technique. the base layer was obtained by pouring 10.0 ml of muller hinton medium or 10.0 ml of brain heart infusion agar in a petri dish. after solidification a 5.0 ml seed layer of muller hinton medium or brain heart infusion agar with inoculum (106/ml) was added. absorbent paper disks (6.0  mm in diameter) immersed in the solutions were placed at equidistant points. plates were maintained at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion of the solutions and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the candle jar system was used  for the brain heart infusion agar plates. all tests were performed in duplicate.  after incubation the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% triphenyltetrazolium chlorate gel and inhibition halos were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by 2.0% chlorhexidine gluconate. endoquil was effective against gram-positive microorganisms, and 0.5% naocl was effective only against s. aureus.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of four root canal sealers (ah plus, sealapex, ketac endo, and fill canal), two calcium hydroxide pastes (calen and calasept), and a zinc oxide paste was evaluated. seven bacterial strains were used, six of them standard; micrococcus luteus atcc 9341, staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, pseudomonas aeruginosa atcc 27853, staphylococcus epidermidis atcc 12228, escherichia coli atcc 25922, and enterococcus faecalis atcc 10541. there was a wild strain of streptococcus mutans isolated from saliva obtained in an adult dental clinic. activity was evaluated using the agar diffusion method with brain  heart infusion agar and muller hinton medium seeded by pour plate. calcium hydroxide-based sealers and pastes were either placed directly into 4.0 x 4.0 mm  wells or by using absorbent paper points. the plates were kept at room temperature for 2 hr for diffusion. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 24 hr, the medium was optimized with 0.05 g% ttc gel and inhibition haloes were measured. all bacterial strains were inhibited by all materials using the well method. however, when the materials were applied with absorbent paper points, enterococcus faecalis was not inhibited by zinc oxide, and pseudomonas aeruginosa was not inhibited by ah plus, fill canal, and the zinc oxide-based paste. we conclude that sealers and pastes presented antimicrobial activity in vitro and culture medium optimization with 0.05 g% ttc gel facilitated observation of the inhibition haloes.

TI  == adherence of staphylococcus aureus is enhanced by an endogenous secreted protein  with broad binding activity.
AB  == a novel mechanism for enhancement of adherence of staphylococcus aureus to host components is described. a secreted protein, eap (extracellular adherence protein), was purified from the supernatant of s. aureus newman and found to be able to bind to at least seven plasma proteins, e.g., fibronectin, the alpha-chain of fibrinogen, and prothrombin, and to the surface of s. aureus. eap  bound much less to cells of staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus mutans, or  escherichia coli. the protein can form oligomeric forms and is able to cause agglutination of s. aureus. binding of s. aureus to fibroblasts and epithelial cells was significantly enhanced by addition of eap, presumably due to its affinity both for plasma proteins on the cells and for the bacteria.

TI  == genetic and biochemical analysis of mutacin 1140, a lantibiotic from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans jh1000 and its derivatives were previously shown (j. d. hillman, k. p. johnson, and b. i. yaphe, infect. immun. 44:141-144, 1984) to produce a low-molecular-weight, broad-spectrum bacteriocin-like inhibitory substance (blis). the thermosensitive vector ptv1-ok harboring tn917 was used to  isolate a blis-deficient mutant, dm25, and the mutated gene was recovered by shotgun cloning in escherichia coli. sequence analysis of insert dna adjacent to  tn917 led to the identification of four open reading frames including two (lana and lanb) which have substantial homology to the staphylococcus epidermidis structural gene (epia) and a modifying enzyme gene (epib) for biosynthesis of the lantibiotic epidermin, respectively. although the blis activity could not be recovered from broth cultures, high yields were obtained from a solid medium consisting of todd-hewitt broth containing 0.5% agarose that was stab inoculated  with jh1140 (a spontaneous mutant of jh1000 that produces threefold-elevated amounts of activity). agar could not substitute for agarose. chloroform extraction of the spent medium produced a fraction which yielded two major bands  on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the faster-migrating band was absent in chloroform extracts of the mutant, dm25. the  amino acid sequence of this band was determined by edman sequencing and mass spectroscopy. the results showed that it is a lantibiotic, which we have named mutacin 1140, and that the sequence corresponded to that deduced from the lana sequence. we observed a number of similarities of mutacin 1140 to epidermin and an s. mutans lantibiotic, b-ny266, but it appears to have significant differences in the positions of its thioether bridges. it also has other unique features with regard to its leader sequence and posttranslational modification. a proposed structure for mutacin 1140 is presented.

TI  == enzymatic removal and disinfection of bacterial biofilms.
AB  == model biofilms of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, pseudomonas  fluorescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were made on steel and polypropylene substrata. plaque-resembling biofilms of streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and fusobacterium nucleatum were made on saliva-coated hydroxyapatite.  the activity of enzymes against bacterial cells in biofilm was measured by fluorescence microscopy and an indirect conductance test in which evolution of carbon dioxide was measured. glucose oxidase combined with lactoperoxidase was bactericidal against biofilm bacteria but did not remove the biofilm from the substrata. a complex mixture of polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes was able to remove bacterial biofilm from steel and polypropylene substrata but did not have  a significant bactericidal activity. combining oxidoreductases with polysaccharide-hydrolyzing enzymes resulted in bactericidal activity as well as removal of the biofilm.

TI  == the interaction of phospholipid liposomes with bacteria and their use in the delivery of bactericides.
AB  == liposomes have been prepared from dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (dppc) incorporating the cationic lipids stearylamine (sa), dimethyldioctadecylammonium  bromide (ddab) and dimethylaminoethane carbamoyl cholesterol (dcchol) and the anionic lipids dipalmitoylphosphatidylglycerol (dppg) and phosphatidylinositol (pi). their adsorption to biofilms of skin-associated bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis and proteus vulgaris) and oral bacteria (streptococcus mutans and sanguis) has been investigated as a function of mole % cationic and anionic lipid. targeting (adsorption) was most effective for the systems dppc-chol-sa, dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes to s. epidermidis. the effect of extracellular mucopolysaccharide on targeting was investigated for s. epidermidis biofilms. it  was found that targeting increased with the level of extracellular mucopolysaccharide for all liposome compositions studied. the delivery of the oil-soluble bactericide triclosan and the water soluble bactericide chlorhexidine was studied for a number of liposomal compositions. superior delivery of both bactericides relative to the free bactericide occurred for dppc-chol-sa liposomes and for triclosan delivery by dppc-dppg and dppc-pi liposomes targeted to s. epidermidis at low bactericide concentrations. dppc-chol-sa liposomes were also effective for delivery of triclosan to s. sanguis biofilms. double labelling experiments using [14c]-chlorhexidine and [3h]-dppc suggested that there was exchange between adsorbed liposomes which had delivered bactericide to the biofilm and those in the bulk solution implying a diffusion mechanism for bactericide delivery.

AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == all strains of oral streptococci tested and specially those of streptococcus mutans, strep. sanguis and strep. mitior produced more than one distinct bacteriocin-like substance with variable inhibitory activity on 20 indicator staphylococci. inhibitory activity was comparatively higher on nasal strains of staph. aureus and staph. epidermidis than on strains of both species isolated from the mouth. nineteen of 20 staphylococcal indicators were inhibited by 1-12 of the 12 effector streptococci. sensitivity of nasal staphylococci to bacteriocins (frequency of positive inhibitory tests and total inhibition zone diameters) was significantly higher (p less than 0.001, chi 2 test and p less than 0.05, t test respectively) than that of oral ones. the sensitivity of nasal  over oral staph. aureus (p less than 0.001 and p less than 0.01) and of oral staph. epidermidis over oral staph. aureus (p less than 0.01 and p less than 0.05) was also significantly higher. the evaluation of variability of inhibitory  patterns of bacteriocins produced by streptococci (p-typing), of sensitivity patterns of staphylococci to bacteriocins (s-typing) and of the significantly higher sensitivity of nasal over oral staphylococci to bacteriocins from the epidemiological and ecological viewpoints are discussed.

TI  == arginolytic and ureolytic activities of pure cultures of human oral bacteria and  their effects on the ph response of salivary sediment and dental plaque in vitro.
AB  == thirty-nine different microorganisms commonly found in supragingival plaque and salivary sediment were screened for their ability to raise the ph by producing base from arginine, lysylarginine and urea. only actinomyces naeslundii and staphylococcus epidermidis showed significant ph-rise activity with all three compounds. eleven bacteria demonstrated such activity with arginine and lysylarginine but not with urea. only one, actinomyces viscosus, produced a ph-rise with urea but not with the two arginine compounds. the remaining 26 bacteria showed little or no base-forming activity with any of the three test substrates. the ability of the different oral bacteria to produce base (especially from urea) was a less universal function than their ability to produce acid from fermentable carbohydrate. substituting pure cultures of arginolytic or non-arginolytic bacteria for portions of the mixed bacterial populations of plaque or sediment in test incubations containing glucose and arginine altered their ability to produce ph-fall-ph-rise responses shaped like those of the stephen curve in vivo. in general, addition of arginolytic bacteria  made these in vitro ph responses less acidic, whereas addition of non-arginolytic bacteria made the responses more acidic. because of the relatively high arginolytic activity of the plaque harvested in this study, the effect of adding  non-arginolytic bacteria was more readily seen than the converse. similar changes in levels of ureolytic microorganisms and incubation with glucose and urea had little effect on sediment or plaque being able to produce a ph-fall-ph-rise type  of response. when increasing proportions of the mixed bacteria in salivary sediment were replaced with the highly cariogenic lactobacillus casei or streptococcus mutans, the ph minimum became slightly more acidic and then slightly more alkaline, whereas the ph-rise became progressively and significantly less. thus arginolytic bacteria have a different and greater effect on shaping the ph response of plaque or sediment than ureolytic bacteria. a large change in the proportions of arginolytic or non-arginolytic microorganisms may be needed to make a plaque microflora potentially non-cariogenic or cariogenic, respectively.

TI  == mode of action and in-vitro activity of vancomycin.
AB  == vancomycin is a unique glycopeptide structurally unrelated to any currently available antibiotic. it also has a unique mode of action inhibiting the second stage of cell wall synthesis of susceptible bacteria. there is also evidence that vancomycin alters the permeability of the cell membrane and selectively inhibits  ribonucleic acid synthesis. induction of bacterial l-phase variants from susceptible organisms with vancomycin is extremely difficult, and such variants are unstable. stable l-phase variants induced by other agents are susceptible to  vancomycin. vancomycin is active against a large number of species of gram-positive bacteria, such as staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant strains), staph. epidermidis (including multiple-resistant  strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (including multiple-resistant strains), str. pyogenes, str. agalactiae, str. bovis, str. mutans, viridans streptococci, enterococci, clostridium species, diphtheroids, listeria monocytogenes, actinomyces species and lactobacillus species. there has been no increase in resistance to vancomycin during the past three decades. enhancement of antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated with the combination of vancomycin and an aminoglycoside against staph. aureus, str. bovis, enterococci and viridans streptococci. the combination of vancomycin and rifampicin are antagonistic to most strains of staph. aureus, though indifference and occasionally synergism have been shown, but is synergistic against strains of staph. epidermidis. it shows indifference against enterococci. vancomycin and fusidic acid are indifferent against staph. aureus.

AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

TI  == arthritogenicity in rats of cell walls from several streptococci staphylococci and two other bacteria.
AB  == bacterial cell walls from str. bovis, str. lactis, str. mutans, str. thermophilus, str. salivarius, and str. pyogenes were able to produce polyarthritis in rats but str. faecalis cell walls were nonarthritogenic. s. aureus cell walls produced extremely severe disease. it was also shown that cell  walls from s. epidermidis, b. megaterium, and m. lysodeikticus were nonarthritogenic. a close correlation was observed between development of arthritis and the delayed hypersensitivity to bacterial peptidoglycans but not with the ppd hypersensitivity. it was suggested that the adjuvanticity of bacterial cell walls is needed to induce the disease and that arthritogenicity requires a specific antigen in addition to the presence of an adjuvant-inducing agent.

TI  == immunoadjuvant activities of cell walls and their water-soluble fractions prepared from various gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the cell walls from all 21 species of gram-positive bacteria examined, except lysozyme-susceptible micrococcus lysodeikticus (nctc 2665) and lysozyme-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis (atcc 155), were found to be definitely adjuvant-active in both stimulation of increased serum antibody levels and induction of delayed-type hypersensitivity to ovalbumin when administered to guinea-pigs as water-in-oil emulsions. using various cell wall lytic enzymes, the immunoadjuvant principles were solubilized with full retention of the adjuvant activities from walls of staphylococcus aureus (copenhagen), streptococcus pyogens (group a, type 6; s43/100), streptococcus salivarius (ifo 3350), streptococcus faecalis (ifo 12580), streptococcus mutans (bht), lactobacillus plantarum (atcc 8014), bacillus megaterium (ifo 12068), corynebacterium diphtheriae (park-williams no. 8), mycobacterium smegmatis, and actinomyces viscous (atcc 15987). evidence was obtained that the non-peptidoglycan portion of the cell walls is not essential for manifestation of immunoadjuvancy.
