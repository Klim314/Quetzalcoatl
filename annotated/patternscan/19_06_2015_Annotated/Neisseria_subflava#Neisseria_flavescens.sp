TI  == evaluation of the versant ct/gc dna 1.0 assay (kpcr) for the detection of extra-genital chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae infections.
AB  == screening for extra-genital chlamydia trachomatis and neisseria gonorrhoeae infections is a crucial component for sexually transmitted diseases management, even if at present days no commercial methods have been approved for use on pharyngeal and rectal specimens by the us fda or have received the conformity ce  marking. here we report the analytical sensitivities of the versant ct/gc 1.0 assay (siemens healthcare diagnostics, tarrytown, ny, usa) on rectal and pharyngeal swabs, and an evaluation about the suitability for this assay with two widely used swab collection devices (e-swab and enat, copan, brescia, italy). the limits of detection for rectal and pharyngeal specimens with the versant assay were 10 copies/ml and 1.0 copies/ml, for c. trachomatis and n. gonorrhoeae, respectively. false positive results due to the presence of non-gonococcal neisseria species were excluded when clinical rectal and pharyngeal samples containing organisms identified as n. meningitidis, n. sicca, n. flavescens and n. subflava were tested. due to its sensitivity and specificity, the versant assay represents a good choice for the diagnosis of chlamydial and/or gonococcal  infections not only in genito-urinary samples, but also on rectal and pharyngeal  swabs.

TI  == genome sequence analyses show that neisseria oralis is the same species as 'neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis'.
AB  == phylogenies generated from whole genome sequence (wgs) data provide definitive means of bacterial isolate characterization for typing and taxonomy. the species  status of strains recently defined with conventional taxonomic approaches as representing neisseria oralis was examined by the analysis of sequences derived from wgs data, specifically: (i) 53 neisseria ribosomal protein subunit (rps) genes (ribosomal multi-locus sequence typing, rmlst); and (ii) 246 neisseria core genes (core genome mlst, cgmlst). these data were compared with phylogenies derived from 16s and 23s rrna gene sequences, demonstrating that the n. oralis strains were monophyletic with strains described previously as representing 'neisseria mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and that this group was of equivalent taxonomic status to other well-described species of the genus neisseria. phylogenetic analyses also indicated that neisseria sicca and neisseria macacae should be considered the same species as neisseria mucosa and that neisseria flavescens should be considered the same species as neisseria subflava. analyses  using rmlst showed that some strains currently defined as belonging to the genus  neisseria were more closely related to species belonging to other genera within the family; however, whole genome analysis of a more comprehensive selection of strains from within the family neisseriaceae would be necessary to confirm this.  we suggest that strains previously identified as representing 'n. mucosa var. heidelbergensis' and deposited in culture collections should be renamed n. oralis. finally, one of the strains of n. oralis was able to ferment lactose, due to the presence of beta-galactosidase and lactose permease genes, a characteristic previously thought to be unique to neisseria lactamica, which therefore cannot be thought of as diagnostic for this species; however, the rmlst and cgmlst analyses confirm that n. oralis is most closely related to n. mucosa.

TI  == biochemical and genomic analysis of the denitrification pathway within the genus  neisseria.
AB  == since neisseria gonorrhoeae and neisseria meningitidis are obligate human pathogens, a comparison with commensal species of the same genus could reveal differences important in pathogenesis. the recent completion of commensal neisseria genome draft assemblies allowed us to perform a comparison of the genes involved in the catalysis, assembly and regulation of the denitrification pathway, which has been implicated in the virulence of several bacteria. all species contained a highly conserved nitric oxide reductase (norb) and a nitrite  reductase (ania or nirk) that was highly conserved in the catalytic but divergent in the n-terminal lipid modification and c-terminal glycosylation domains. only neisseria mucosa contained a nitrate reductase (nar), and only neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea, neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens and neisseria sicca contained a nitrous oxide reductase (nos) complex. the regulators of the denitrification genes, fnr, narqp and nsrr, were highly conserved, except  for the gaf domain of narq. biochemical examination of laboratory strains revealed that all of the neisserial species tested except n. mucosa had a two- to fourfold lower nitrite reductase activity than n. gonorrhoeae, while n. meningitidis and most of the commensal neisseria species had a two- to fourfold higher nitric oxide (no) reductase activity. for n. meningitidis and most of the  commensal neisseria, there was a greater than fourfold reduction in the no steady-state level in the presence of nitrite as compared with n. gonorrhoeae. all of the species tested generated an no steady-state level in the presence of an no donor that was similar to that of n. gonorrhoeae. the greatest difference between the neisseria species was the lack of a functional nos system in the pathogenic species n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis.

TI  == distribution of transferrin binding protein b gene (tbpb) variants among neisseria species.
AB  == background: transferrin binding protein b (tbpb), an outer membrane lipoprotein,  is required for the acquisition of iron from human transferrin. two tbpb families have been documented in neisseria meningitidis: an isotype i tbpb gene of 1.8 kb  and an isotype ii tbpb gene of 2.1 kb, the former expressed by meningococci in the disease-associated st-11 clonal complex and the latter found among meningococci belonging to the hyper-invasive clonal complexes including st-8, st-18, st-32, st-41/44 as well as n. gonorrhoeae isolates. the origin of the isotype i tbpb gene is unknown, however several features in common with non-pathogenic neisseria and the st-11 clonal complex n. meningitidis isolate fam18 have been documented leading to the hypothesis that the isotype i tbpb gene may also be shared between non-pathogenic neisseria and st-11 meningococci. as a  result, the diversity of the tbpb gene was investigated in a defined collection of neisseria species. results: two families of isotype i tbpb were identified: family a containing conserved genes belonging to st-11 meningococci, n. polysaccharea and n. lactamica isolates and family b including more diverse isotype i tbpb genes from n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. subflava as well as n. cinerea, n. flavescens and n. polysaccharea isolates. three isotype ii tbpb families were identified with: family c containing diverse tbpb genes belonging to n. polysaccharea, n. lactamica, n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis isolates, family d including another subset of isotype ii tbpb genes from n. lactamica isolates and family e solely composed of n. gonorrhoeae tbpb genes. conclusion: this study reveals another instance of similarity between meningococci of the st-11 clonal complex and non-pathogenic neisseria with the origin of the isotype  i tbpb gene resulting from a horizontal genetic transfer event occurring between  these two populations.

TI  == analysis of mutations within multiple genes associated with resistance in a clinical isolate of neisseria gonorrhoeae with reduced ceftriaxone susceptibility that shows a multidrug-resistant phenotype.
AB  == a neisseria gonorrhoeae strain with a reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone (minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) = 0.5 microg/ml) was isolated among 398 clinical isolates obtained from 2000-2001 in fukuoka city, japan. the n. gonorrhoeae strain was negative for penicillinase production but it showed multidrug resistance against penicillin (mic = 8 microg/ml), tetracycline (mic =  4 microg/ml), azithromycin (mic = 0.5 microg/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic = 16 microg/ml). the molecular mechanisms of the multidrug-resistant phenotype in this strain were analysed. polymerase chain reaction and direct dna sequencing were performed to identify mutations within the pena, pona, mtrr, penb, gyra and parc  genes of the gonococcal strain, which thus explain the multidrug-resistant phenotype. the n. gonorrhoeae strain contained a significantly different sequence of the pena gene from that of the ceftriaxone-susceptible strains. some regions of the transpeptidase domain within this pena gene were closely similar to those  found in other neisseria species such as neisseria subflava, neisseria flavescens or neisseria perflava/sicca. this strain also included a pona mutation that is associated with high-level resistance to penicillin, mtrr mutations that mediate  overexpression of the mtrcde efflux pump responsible for resistance to hydrophobic agents such as azithromycin, and penb mutations that reduce porin permeability to hydrophilic agents such as tetracycline. moreover, this strain contained gyra and parc mutations that confer high-level resistance to ciprofloxacin. these results indicate the emergence of a n. gonorrhoeae strain with reduced susceptibility to ceftriaxone, which also showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype that can be explained by the presence of multiple loci mutations associated with antibiotic resistance.

TI  == functional diversity of three different dsba proteins from neisseria meningitidis.
AB  == the genome of neisseria meningitidis serogroup b strain mc58 contains three genes - nmb0278, nmb0294 and nmb0407 - encoding putative homologues of dsba, a periplasmic thiol disulphide oxidoreductase protein-folding catalyst of the dsb protein family. dsba assists the folding of periplasmic and membrane proteins in  diverse organisms. while all three cloned genes complemented the dtt sensitivity  of dsba-null escherichia coli, they showed different activities in folding specific target proteins in this background. nmb0278 protein was the most active  in complementing defects in motility and alkaline phosphatase activity, while nmb0294 was the most active in folding periplasmic malf. nmb0407 showed the weakest activity in all assays. it is extremely unusual for organisms to contain  more than one chromosomal dsba. among the members of the genus neisseria, only the meningococcus carries all three of these genes. strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria lactamica, neisseria cinerea and neisseria polysaccharea contained only homologues of nmb0278 and nmb0407, while neisseria flava, neisseria subflava and neisseria flavescens carried only nmb0294. it is speculated that the versatility of the meningococcus in surviving in different colonizing and invasive disease settings may be derived in part from an enhanced  potential to deploy outer-membrane proteins, a consequence of carrying an extended repertoire of protein-folding catalysts.

TI  == the integration site of the iga gene in commensal neisseria sp.
AB  == an iga1 protease is produced by the human pathogens neisseria gonorrhoeae and n.  meningitidis but not by related non-pathogenic, commensal, neisseria species. in  this study, the chromosomal iga locus was characterized in the n. gonorrhoeae strain ms11 and compared to corresponding loci in n. meningitidis and commensal neisseria species. in n. gonorrhoeae, the genes trpb and ksga were found immediately downstream of iga. in addition to coml and coma, a homolog of the escherichia coli yfii gene was identified upstream of iga. each gene in the iga region (yfii and coml, coma and iga, and trpb and ksga) is transcribed in the opposite direction to its neighbors. the coml/ coma and iga/ trpb pairs each have a transcriptional terminator in the correct position for joint use. these terminators contain the common gonococcal dna uptake sequence (dus). a highly conserved direct repeat of 25 bp located immediately adjacent to the iga gene in  n. gonorrhoeae was also found in n. meningitidis. in southern hybridization experiments, no homology to iga was detectable in the chromosomal dnas of the commensal species n. mucosa, n. lactamica, n. flavescens, n. cinerea, n. subflava, n. flava, n. sicca or n. elongata. when n. gonorrhoeae coml and trpb were used as probes, signals were detected on the same restriction fragment in six of the eight species. this indicated that commensal neisseria species share a possible integration site for the iga gene between coma and trpb. the region between coma and trpb was therefore amplified by pcr. the fragment obtained from  n. lactamica showed a high degree of homology to gonococcal coma and trpb, respectively, but iga was replaced by a sequence of 13 bp that shows no homology  to any known gonococcal sequence. our data suggest that iga was acquired by a common ancestor of n. gonorrhoeae and n. meningitidis rather than being distributed by horizontal gene transfer. n. lactamica, which is more closely related to n. gonorrhoeae than other commensals, may have lost iga by deletion.

TI  == neisseria gonorrhoeae : detection and typing by probe hybridization, lcr, and pcr.
AB  == neisseria gonorrhoeae, first described by neisser in 1879, is a gram-negative, nonmotile, nonspore-forming diplococcus, belonging to the family neisseriaceae. it is the etiologic agent of gonorrhea. the other pathogenic species is neisseria meningitidis, to which n. gonorrhoeae is genetically closely related. although n. meningitidis is not usually considered to be a sexually transmitted disease, it may infect the mucous membranes of the anogenital area of homosexual men (1). the other members of the genus, which include neisseria lactamic a, neisseriapolysaccharea, neisseria cinerea, and neisseria flavescens, which are related to neisseria gonorrhoeae, and saccharolytic strains, such as neisseria subflava, neisseria sicca, and neisseria mucosa, which are less genetically related to the aforementioned, are considered to be nonpathogenic, being normal flora of the nasopharyngeal mucous membranes (2).

TI  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of the genus neisseria.
AB  == a numerical phenotypic taxonomic study of 315 strains of neisseria and some allied bacteria examined for 155 phenotypic tests showed 31 groups, most of which were reasonably distinct. these fell into four major areas. areas a, b and c contained species of neisseria, whereas area d contained the organisms known as 'false neisserias' together with branhamella, moraxella and kingella species. area a contained n. gonorrhoeae (which showed two subgroups), n. meningitidis (with two subgroups, and n. cinerea closely associated), n. polysaccharea, n. elongata subsp, glycolytica and n. lactamica. area b contained mainly organisms from the human nasopharynx, and the nine groups were not very distinct: only three, n. mucosa, n. perflava and n. sicca could be recognized by the presence of type strains, and there was little relationship between taxonomic position and species epithets. area c contained several groups from animals, n. animalis, n. canis and two phenons that may be justified as new species of neisseria, one from lizards and the other from dental plaque of herbivores. area c also contained n.  elongata, n. subflava (with n. flavescens), type strain of morococcus cerebrosis  and the cdc groups m-5 (n. weaveri) and ef-4. area d contained branhamella catarrhalis, a combined group which consists of strains of the 'false neisserias' n. caviae and n. cuniculi, the 'false neisseria' n. ovis, and a group of moraxella strains. a small group representing kingella kingae is included in area d. mean test error was 1.7%.

TI  == detection of the tetm determinant in neisseria gonorrhoeae using a non-radioactively labelled oligonucleotide probe.
AB  == three oligonucleotide probes, complementary to tetm sequences, were labelled non-radiometrically using the dig-oligonucleotide tailing kit and evaluated for their specificity for the detection of plasmid mediated tetracycline resistance in neisseria gonorrhoeae. only probe 3, 5'-gct caa caa ttc tgt tcc agc-3', was specific for tetm. it hybridized with the tetm-containing 25.2-mda plasmids from  all of the 232 trng and the 130 pp/trng isolates used in the study. its sensitivity, determined by dot-blot hybridization, was 0.1 pg of pj13 plasmid dna or 10(4) cells. it did not hybridize with the dna from non-ppng, cmrng and tetracycline susceptible isolates from seven other neisseria species (n. meningitidis, n. subflava, n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. sicca, n. mucosa, and n.  flavescens), moraxella spp. and haemophilus influenzae. probe 3 also hybridized to dna of three tetracycline resistant p. magnus (mic = 16 micrograms ml-1) isolates which presumptively carried the tetm determinant. therefore, probe 3 can be used by reference laboratories as a confirmatory test for trng, as well as isolates from other genera containing the tetm determinant.

TI  == genetic diversity of the iron-binding protein (fbp) gene of the pathogenic and commensal neisseria.
AB  == the pathogenic neisseria and most commensal neisseria species produce an iron-binding protein (fbp) when grown under iron-limited conditions. in the current study, we confirmed the presence of fbp, as well as dna sequences homologous to the gonococcal fbp, in strains of n. gonorrhoeae, n. meningitidis,  n. cinerea, n. lactamica, n. subflava, n. kochii and n. polysaccharea. the fbp genes from these strains were amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, digested with stui or rsai, and the restriction patterns examined. the patterns for the gonococcal and meningococcal fbp were virtually identical; however, variations were observed in the fbp sequences of the commensal neisseria species. n. flavescens, n. mucosa, n. sicca, n. ovis and branhamella catarrhalis, did not  produce fbp as detected by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and reactivity with an fbp specific monoclonal antibody, nor did  they hybridize to an fbp-specific dna probe.

TI  == unusual pathogens in narcotic-associated endocarditis.
AB  == we report the cases of three adults with a history of intravenous drug abuse who  developed endocarditis caused by corynebacterium xerosis, neisseria subflava, and neisseria flavescens, respectively. no cases of endocarditis caused by c. xerosis or n. flavescens and only one case caused by n. subflava have previously been reported in association with narcotic addiction. the prominent clinical features  in all patients included poor response to antibiotic therapy, persistent fever, and major embolic events. stigmata of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, as manifested by oral candidiasis, cervical lymphadenopathy, and serologic evidence, were present in two of the three patients. at our institution, where staphylococcus aureus remains the most frequent etiologic agent of narcotic-associated endocarditis, the occurrence of these three cases in a 9-month period is striking. we speculate that infection with human immunodeficiency virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of endocarditis caused by these unusual organisms.

TI  == conjugation of plasmids of neisseria gonorrhoeae to other neisseria species: potential reservoirs for the beta-lactamase plasmid.
AB  == the discovery that penicillinase production in neisseria gonorrhoeae was plasmid  mediated and the spread of the beta-lactamase encoding plasmids in gonococcal isolates since 1976, raise the possibility that a nonpathogenic indigenous bacterium could serve as a reservoir for these plasmids. we initiated studies to  define the ability of commensal neisseria species and branhamella catarrhalis strains, as well as strains of the pathogen neisseria meningitidis, to serve as recipients in conjugation with neisseria gonorrhoeae. we found that with n. gonorrhoeae as the donor, 3 of 5 neisseria cinerea, 2 of 5 neisseria flava, 0 of  1 neisseria flavescens, 1 of 3 neisseria subflava, 0 of 6 b. catarrhalis, 0 of 7  neisseria lactamica, 1 of 5 neisseria mucosa, 1 of 7 neisseria perflava/sicca, and 0 of 13 n. meningitidis strains gave detectable conjugation frequencies (greater than 10(-8). n. cinerea was the only species found to maintain the gonococcal conjugal plasmid (ple2451). a n. cinerea transconjugant containing ple2451 was observed to transfer both the beta-lactamase plasmid and ple2451 to n. gonorrhoeae at high frequency.

TI  == the significance of nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseria isolates from blood cultures.
AB  == nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae are part of the normal respiratory flora and infrequently cause disease. these organisms include neisseria lactamica, neisseria mucosa, neisseria sicca, neisseria flavescens, neisseria subflava , neisseria perflava , neisseria flava , and branhamella catarrhalis (previously classified as neisseria catarrhalis). blood cultures positive for these bacteria have been associated with serious infections, including endocarditis, septicemia, and meningitis. in a retrospective survey of a 10-year  period, 1970-1980, eight patients were identified at hartford hospital (hartford, conn.) whose blood cultures were positive for nongonococcal, nonmeningococcal neisseriae. in four patients, the neisseria blood isolates were associated with serious infections: two with endocarditis, one with sepsis, and one with meningitis. in four other patients, the neisseria blood isolates were contaminants.

TI  == occurence of veillonella and neisseria in the niches of the human oral cavity.
AB  == samples collected from the dental surface, gingival sulcus, dorsum of the tongue  and from the cheek of ten adults (18 to 32 years) were investigated to identify the veillonella and neisseria species present by applying the taxonomic criteria  suggested in the latest edition of bergey's manual. the various niches contain both v. parvula and v. alcalescens, but with the predominance of strains which do not fit precisely the described catalase and putrescine requirements. eighty-nine out of 100 isolated strains of gram negative oxidase positive cocci could be identified as n. sicca and n. subflava; about 11 unidentified strains exhibited characteristics of n. flavescens species.

TI  == fatty acid composition of neisseria species as determined by gas chromatography.
AB  == duplicate cultures of 53 strains representing 9 species of neisseria were analyzed by gas-liquid chromatography for cellular fatty acids. n. sicca, n. mucosa, n. flava, n. flavescens, n. perflava, n. subflava, and the several serotypes of n. meningitidis examined were found to comprise a fairly homogeneous group on the basis of the percentages of individual fatty acids present. lactose-fermenting neisseria also were in this group. n. catarrhalis, however, contained decanoic acid in addition to the acids occurring in the other species.  moreover, the 18 c-saturated and monoenoic acids together constituted 36% of the  total fatty acid composition for n. catarrhalis, while the comparable mean value  for the other species was less than 13%.

TI  == deoxyribonucleic acid homologies among species of the genus neisseria.
AB  == eleven aerobic species of neisseria, a mima sp., and a herellea sp. were tested for deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) homology in direct hybridization experiments. dna labeled with either (14)c or (32)p was prepared from five species of neisseria. unlabeled dna from the various microorganisms was immobilized on membrane filters, which, after pretreatment, were incubated with labeled dna (4,000 counts per min per filter) for 14 hr at 67 c. the measure of relatedness was expressed as the relative percentage of direct binding compared to that obtained with homologous dna. all serological types of n. meningitidis, including the newly proposed types, were homologous to the standard strain of n. meningitidis with one possible exception, type z. the genus neisseria is heterogeneous in nature, forming at least three distinct groups: first, n. meningitidis and n. gonorrhoeae; second, n. perflava, n. subflava, n. sicca, n. flavescens, and n. flava; third, n. catarrhalis and n. caviae. mima and herellea species show no significant homology with the neisseria.
