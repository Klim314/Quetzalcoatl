TI  == pyrosequencing analysis of microbial community and food-borne bacteria on restaurant cutting boards collected in seri kembangan, malaysia, and their correlation with grades of food premises.
AB  == this study adopts the pyrosequencing technique to identify bacteria present on 26 kitchen cutting boards collected from different grades of food premises around seri kembangan, a city in malaysia. pyrosequencing generated 452,401 of total reads of otus with an average of 1.4x10(7) bacterial cells/cm(2). proteobacteria, firmicutes and bacteroides were identified as the most abundant phyla in the samples. taxonomic richness was generally high with >1000 operational taxonomic units (otus) observed across all samples. the highest appearance frequencies (100%) were otus closely related to enterobacter sp., enterobacter aerogenes, pseudomonas sp. and pseudomonas putida. several otus were identified most closely related to known food-borne pathogens, including bacillus cereus, cronobacter sakazaki, cronobacter turisensis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, hafnia alvei, kurthia gibsonii, salmonella bongori, salmonella enterica, salmonella paratyphi, salmonella tyhpi, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica ranging from 0.005% to 0.68% relative abundance. the condition and grade of the food premises on a three point cleanliness scale did not correlate with the bacterial abundance and type. regardless of the status and grades, all food premises have the same likelihood to introduce food-borne bacteria from cutting boards to their foods and must always prioritize the correct food handling procedure in order to avoid unwanted outbreak of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
AB  == sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter  sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.

TI  == outbreak of a novel enterobacter sp. carrying blactx-m-15 in a neonatal unit of a tertiary care hospital in tanzania.
AB  == enterobacter hormaechei and cronobacter sakazakii are amongst the most important  causes of outbreaks of neonatal sepsis associated with powdered milk. in this study, we report for the first time an outbreak of a novel enterobacter sp. harbouring bla(ctx-m-15) in a neonatal unit in tanzania. seventeen gram-negative  enteric isolates from neonatal blood cultures were studied. antibiotic susceptibility was assessed by disc diffusion testing, and the presence of the bla(ctx-m-15) gene was established by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and sequencing. isolates were typed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge). identification by biochemical profiling was followed by nucleotide sequencing of  16s ribosomal dna (rdna), rpob and hsp60 alleles. environmental sampling was done and control measures were established. isolates were initially misidentified based on their fermentation characteristics and agglutination as salmonella enterica serotype paratyphi. all isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics, except for ciprofloxacin and carbapenems, and were found to harbour bla(ctx-m-15) on a 291-kb narrow-range plasmid. pfge analysis indicated the clonal outbreak of  a single strain, infecting 17 neonates with a case fatality rate of 35%. the same strain was isolated from a milk bucket. phylogenetic analysis using 16s rdna, rpob and hsp60 sequences permitted no definitive identification, clustering the strains in the enterobacter cloacae complex with similarities of 92-98.8%. the data describe an outbreak of a novel bla(ctx-m-15)-positive, multiresistant enterobacter strain in an african neonatal unit that can easily be misidentified  taxonomically. these data highlight the need for constant surveillance of bacteria harbouring extended-spectrum beta-lactamases as well as improvements in  hygiene measures in developing countries.

TI  == surfactin reduces the adhesion of food-borne pathogenic bacteria to solid surfaces.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effect of the biosurfactants surfactin and rhamnolipids  on the adhesion of the food pathogens listeria monocytogenes, enterobacter sakazakii and salmonella enteritidis to stainless steel and polypropylene surfaces. methods and results: quantification of bacterial adhesion was performed using the crystal violet staining technique. preconditioning of surfaces with surfactin caused a reduction on the number of adhered cells of ent. sakazakii and l. monocytogenes on stainless steel. the most significant result was obtained with l. monocytogenes where number of adhered cells was reduced by 10(2) cfu cm(-2). on polypropylene, surfactin showed a significant decrease on the adhesion of all strains. the adsorption of surfactin on polystyrene also reduces the adhesion of l. monocytogenes and salm. enteritidis growing cells. for short contact periods using nongrowing cells or longer contact periods with growing cells, surfactin was able to delay bacterial adhesion. conclusions: the prior adsorption of surfactin to solid surfaces contributes on reducing colonization of the pathogenic bacteria. significance and impact of the study: this is the first  work investigating the effect of surfactin on the adhesion of the food pathogens  l. monocytogenes, ent. sakazakii and salm. enteritidis to polypropylene and stainless steel surfaces.

TI  == fate of the h-ns-repressed bgl operon in evolution of escherichia coli.
AB  == in the enterobacterial species escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, expression of horizontally acquired genes with a higher than average at content is repressed by the nucleoid-associated protein h-ns. a classical example of an h-ns-repressed locus is the bgl (aryl-beta,d-glucoside) operon of e. coli. this locus is "cryptic," as no laboratory growth conditions are known to relieve repression of bgl by h-ns in e. coli k12. however, repression can be relieved by  spontaneous mutations. here, we investigated the phylogeny of the bgl operon. typing of bgl in a representative collection of e. coli demonstrated that it evolved clonally and that it is present in strains of the phylogenetic groups a,  b1, and b2, while it is presumably replaced by a cluster of orfans in the phylogenetic group d. interestingly, the bgl operon is mutated in 20% of the strains of phylogenetic groups a and b1, suggesting erosion of bgl in these groups. however, bgl is functional in almost all b2 isolates and, in approximately 50% of them, it is weakly expressed at laboratory growth conditions. homologs of bgl genes exist in klebsiella, enterobacter, and erwinia  species and also in low gc-content gram-positive bacteria, while absent in e. albertii and salmonella sp. this suggests horizontal transfer of bgl genes to an  ancestral enterobacterium. conservation and weak expression of bgl in isolates of phylogenetic group b2 may indicate a functional role of bgl in extraintestinal pathogenic e. coli.

TI  == nitrous oxide emission and microbial community in the rhizosphere of nodulated soybeans during the late growth period.
AB  == we examined n(2)o emissions from the rhizosphere of field-grown soybeans during the late growth stage (99-117 days after sowing). marked emissions were detected  from the nodulated root systems of field-grown soybeans, whereas a non-nodulating soybean mutant showed no emission. degraded nodules exclusively generated the n(2)o. a culture-independent analysis of microbial communities showed bradyrhizobium sp., acidvorax facilis, salmonella enterica, xanthomonas sp., enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas putida, fusarium sp., nematodes, and other protozoans to be more abundant in the degraded nodules, suggesting that some of these organisms participate in the n(2)o emission process in the soybean rhizosphere.

TI  == identification of salmonella enterica serovar dublin-specific sequences by subtractive hybridization and analysis of their role in intestinal colonization and systemic translocation in cattle.
AB  == salmonella enterica serovar dublin is a host-restricted serovar associated with typhoidal disease in cattle. in contrast, the fowl-associated serovar s. enterica serovar gallinarum is avirulent in calves, yet it invades ileal mucosa and induces enteritis at levels comparable to those induced by s. enterica serovar dublin. suppression subtractive hybridization was employed to identify s. enterica serovar dublin strain sd3246 genes absent from s. enterica serovar gallinarum strain sg9. forty-one s. enterica serovar dublin fragments were cloned and sequenced. among these, 24 mobile-element-associated genes were identified, and 12 clones exhibited similarity with sequences of known or predicted function  in other serovars. three s. enterica serovar dublin-specific regions were homologous to regions from the genome of enterobacter sp. strain 638. sequencing  of fragments adjacent to these three sequences revealed the presence of a 21-kb genomic island, designated s. enterica serovar dublin island 1 (sdi-1). pcr analysis and southern blotting showed that sdi-1 is highly conserved within s. enterica serovar dublin isolates but rarely found in other serovars. to probe the role of genes identified by subtractive hybridization in vivo, 24 signature-tagged s. enterica serovar dublin sd3246 mutants lacking loci not present in salmonella serovar gallinarum sg9 were created and screened by oral challenge of cattle. though attenuation of tagged sg9 and sd3246 salmonella pathogenicity island-1 (spi-1) and spi-2 mutant strains was detected, no obvious  defects of these 24 mutants were detected. subsequently, a deltasdi-1 mutant was  found to exhibit weak but significant attenuation compared with the parent strain in coinfection of calves. sdi-1 mutation did not impair invasion, intramacrophage survival, or virulence in mice, implying that sdi-1 does not influence fitness per se and may act in a host-specific manner.

TI  == type 3 fimbriae, encoded by the conjugative plasmid pola52, enhance biofilm formation and transfer frequencies in enterobacteriaceae strains.
AB  == the conjugative plasmid pola52, which confers resistance to olaquindox and other  antimicrobial agents through a multidrug efflux pump, was investigated for its ability to promote biofilm formation in escherichia coli. screening of a transposon-mutagenized pola52 clone library revealed several biofilm-deficient mutants, which all mapped within a putative operon with high homology to the mrkabcdf operon of klebsiella pneumoniae, where these genes are responsible for type 3 fimbriae expression, attachment to surfaces and biofilm formation. biofilm formation in microtitre plates and in urinary catheters of clones containing pola52 with a disrupted putative mrk operon was reduced by more than 100-fold and 2-fold, respectively, compared to mutants with an intact mrk operon. the conjugative transfer rate of pola52 was also significantly lower when the mrk operon was disrupted. through reverse transcriptase analysis, it was demonstrated that the genes contained in the putative mrk operon were linked and likely to be  expressed as a single operon. immunoblotting with type 3 fimbriae (mrka)-specific antibodies further verified expression of type 3 fimbriae. when transferred to other, potentially pathogenic, members of the family enterobacteriaceae, including klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, kluyvera sp. and enterobacter aerogenes, pola52 facilitated increased biofilm formation. pola52 is believed to represent the first example of a conjugative plasmid encoding type 3  fimbriae, resulting in enhanced conjugation frequencies and biofilm formation of  the plasmid-harbouring strain.

TI  == distribution of genes encoding the microbial non-oxidative reversible hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases.
AB  == bacterial non-oxidative, reversible multi subunit hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylases/phenol carboxylases are encoded by the three clustered genes, b, c, and d, of approximately 0.6, 1.4, and 0.2 kb, respectively. there are more than 160 homologues in the database with significant similarity to gene b (homology to ubix) and c (ubid) distributed in all three microbial domains, however, homologues to gene d, are not numerous ( approximately 15). the occurrence of the entire bcd gene cluster encoding for either identified or presumptive hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase to date has been revealed in sedimentibacter hydroxybenzoicus (unique genes arrangement cdb), streptomyces sp. d7, bacillus subtilis, b. licheniformis, e. coli o157:h7, klebsiella pneumoniae,  enterobacter cloacae, shigella dysenteriae, salmonella enterica, s. paratyphi, s. typhimurium, s. bongori, and s. diarizonae. the corresponding genes from s. hydroxybenzoicus, b. subtilis, streptomyces sp. d7, e. coli o157:h7, k. pneumoniae, and s. typhimurium were cloned and expressed in e. coli dh5alpha (void of analogous genes), and shown to code for proteins exhibiting non-oxidative hydroxyarylic acid decarboxylase activity.

TI  == validation of a pcr for diagnosis of typhoid fever and salmonellosis by amplification of the hila gene in clinical samples from colombian patients.
AB  == validation of a pcr test to detect hila gene sequences of salmonella spp. was performed in blood and faeces samples from typhoid fever and salmonellosis patients. sensitivity (s), specificity (sp), positive predictive value (ppv) and  negative predictive value (npv) of the pcr in blood samples were performed by testing: 37 patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever, 34 of them confirmed by isolation of s. typhi from blood cultures; 35 patients infected with other pathogens corroborated by blood culture (klebsiella pneumoniae, 9; serratia marcescens, 5; escherichia coli, 4; pseudomonas aeruginosa, 9; providencia alcalifaciens, 4 and enterobacter cloacae, 4) and blood samples from 150 healthy  volunteers. to evaluate s, sp, ppv and npv of the pcr in faeces samples we studied: 34 patients with enteritis due salmonella spp. (s. typhimurium, 21; s. enteritidis, 9; s. choleraesuis, 3 and s. agona, 1); faeces samples from 35 patients with enteric infection due to shigella sonnei (8), shigella flexneri (10), enteropathogenic e. coli (12), aeromonas hydrophila (5) and faeces samples  from 150 healthy volunteers. the s, sp, ppv and npv of the pcr in blood samples were all 100 %. pcr detected three patients with clinical diagnosis of typhoid fever and negative blood cultures. in faeces samples, s was 97 %, sp 100 %, ppv 100 % and npv 99 %. the lowest number of c.f.u. ml(-1) detected by pcr in blood samples was 1 x 10(1) and in faeces samples 4 x 10(2).

TI  == the antibacterial innate immune response by the mosquito aedes aegypti is mediated by hemocytes and independent of gram type and pathogenicity.
AB  == previous mosquito studies showed that the hemocyte-mediated innate immune response against gram- escherichia coli is phagocytosis, but against gram+ micrococcus sp., is melanization. we examined the immune responses mounted by aedes aegypti towards gram- enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella typhimurium, and gram+ bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. using light microscopy, electron microscopy, and survival analysis, this investigation conclusively shows that the factors governing phagocytic vs. melanization responses are complex and independent of bacterial gram type and pathogenicity. these data provide further evidence that hemocytes are central to  the immune response against prokaryotes.

TI  == prevalence and growth of pathogens on salad vegetables, fruits and sprouts.
AB  == a total of 120 samples, comprising different types of raw vegetables (seven), fruits (three) and sprouts (three) obtained from street vendors, were tested for  aerobic plate count, coliform count and various food-borne pathogens. average aerobic plate counts for salad vegetables, fruits and sprouts were greater than 10(10) cfu/g and 10(9) cfu/g respectively. pathogens isolated were s. aureus, e.  coli, enterobacter sp., klebsiella sp., s. typhi, serratia sp., providencia sp. and p. aeruginosa. the antibiotic resistant patterns of the isolates revealed p.  aeruginosa to be the most antibiotic resistant, e. coli, salmonella, enterobacter and p. aeruginosa also showed the presence of plasmids. the model development phase of this study involved 27 growth curves conducted under 9 combinations of temperature and ph in the brain heart infusion broth. models for specific growth  rate and lag period were developed by response surface modelling using multiple linear regression analysis. the model provides an estimate of bacterial growth in response to any combination of the variables studied within specified ranges. growth patterns of organisms on vegetable and fruits were also studied at room temperature (32 degrees c) to assess the growth in the actual food environment. cucumber and watermelon supports the growth of s. aureus and s. typhi, carrot retarded their growth while pineapple did not support the growth.

TI  == evaluation of the petrifilm rapid coliform count plate method for coliform enumeration from surimi-based imitation crab slurry.
AB  == the 3m petrifilm rapid coliform count (rcc) plate method was compared with two conventional methods, namely violet red bile agar (vrba) and desoxycholate lactose agar (dla), for enumerating coliforms. the vrba plating method is a reference method in the bacteriological analytical manual and the dla plating method is the method recommended by the food sanitation law of korea for enumeration of coliforms. serratia sp., a coliform that was isolated from frozen  surimi, was incubated in surimi-based imitation crab (sbic) slurries and enumerated on the petrifilm rcc, vrba, and dla plates. results from the petrifilm rcc plate were not significantly different from results from vrba or dla plates at p < 0.05 level. the correlation coefficient for petrifilm rcc plates versus the vrba method and for petrifilm rcc plates versus the dla method were 0.994 and 0.996, respectively. with the petrifilm rcc plate method, we were able to estimate presumptive coliforms (except serratia sp.) after 14 h and to enumerate  confirmed coliforms (including serratia sp.) after 24 h.

TI  == phosphatase-mediated heavy metal accumulation by a citrobacter sp. and related enterobacteria.
AB  == a citrobacter sp. was reported previously to accumulate heavy metals as cell-bound heavy metal phosphates. metal uptake is mediated by the activity of a  periplasmic acid-type phosphatase that liberates inorganic phosphate to provide the precipitant ligand for heavy metals presented to the cells. amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments of the purified enzyme revealed significant homology to the phon product (acid phosphatase) of some other enterobacteria. these organisms, together with klebsiella pneumoniae, previously reported to produce acid phosphatase, were tested for their ability to remove uranium and lanthanum from challenge solutions supplemented with phosphatase substrate. the coupling of phosphate liberation to metal bioaccumulation was limited to the metal accumulating citrobacter sp.; therefore the participation of species-specific additional factors in metal bioaccumulation was suggested.

TI  == evaluation of thiol broth for the culture of salmonella typhi and other bacteria  from blood.
AB  == thiol broth is known to neutralize various antimicrobial agents. positivity of growth of various species of bacteria from blood in thiol broth was reported as similar to that in tryptic soy broth (tsb). as blood cultures are often used for  the diagnosis of typhoid fever, and as patients may receive antimicrobial therapy before blood culture, the positivity and rapidity of growth of salmonella typhi in thiol broth were compared to those in tsb. routine blood culture samples from  yonsei medical center patients were inoculated in 50-ml amounts of tsb and thiol  broth. the media were prepared from dehydrated products and did not contain co2,  but tsb contained 0.025% sodium polyanethol sulfonate (sps). growth of s. paratyphi-a, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens and alpha-hemolytic streptococcus were similar in both media. however, greater positivity and shorter incubation time for macroscopic detection were noted in tsb with s. typhi, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. it is concluded that thiol broth is inferior to tsb plus sps for the culture of s. typhi from blood.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. thirty-two strains of pseudomonas and 960 strains of enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and salmonella enterica). tigemonam displayed good activity against enterobacteriaceae. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were as follows: mic50s were 0.01 mg/l for p. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/l for s. marcescens, mic90s were 0.03 mg/l for p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and 4 mg/l for citrobacter freundii. tigemonam inhibited e. coli and p. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. despite mic90s of 9.5 and 4 mg/l for enterobacter and c. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. tigemonam was found to be inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with mic50s and mic90s higher than 128 mg/l (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/l). tigemonam's activity was found to  be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against p. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (mic90, 8 mg/l for norfloxacin; mic50, 8 mg/l and mic90, 32 mg/l for aztreonam). cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested.

TI  == carbohydrate-binding sites of the mannose-specific fimbrial lectins of enterobacteria.
AB  == the combining sites of type 1 fimbrial lectins of various species of enterobacteria were studied by measuring the inhibitory activity of linear and branched oligosaccharides and several glycosides of d-mannose on the agglutination of yeast cells by the organisms. the results showed that all five strains of escherichia coli tested possessed an elongated combining site best fitting a trisaccharide and including a hydrophobic region. similar results were  obtained with klebsiella pneumoniae. within the salmonella genus, the combining sites of the six species tested were similar, but all differed significantly from those of the e. coli strains. the combining sites of enterobacter cloacae and enterobacter agglomerans were different from each other and from those of salmonella sp. and e. coli. the results suggest that although classified under the general term "mannose-specific," bacterial lectins in the form of type 1 fimbriae on different genera exhibit differences in sugar specificities.

TI  == alternative prey: a mechanism for elimination of bacterial species by protozoa.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant strains of salmonella typhimurium and klebsiella pneumoniae  died readily after their addition to raw sewage, but they grew in sterilized sewage. the decline was not a result of abiotic stresses, and because the bacteria were able to survive in large numbers for at least 15 days in solutions  containing no organic nutrients, it was not a result of competition. toxin production, bacteriophages, and bdellovibrio sp. did not cause the disappearance  of the two bacterial species. a decline was also evident if the sewage was first  passed through a 3-micron (pore size) filter or treated with cycloheximide or cycloheximide plus nystatin, but protozoa developed under these conditions. little or no decline occurred if the sewage was filtered and treated with the eucaryotic inhibitors before the addition of s. typhimurium or k. pneumoniae, and protozoa were not detected. s. typhimurium increased in abundance if cycloheximide, streptomycin, and erythromycin or large amounts of glucose were added to sewage. tetrahymena thermophilus did not significantly reduce the population of s. typhimurium in buffer when the density of the bacterium was about 10(4)/ml. however, when more than 10(8) enterobacter agglomerans cells per  ml were added to the buffer, t. thermophilus reduced the abundance of e. agglomerans and s. typhimurium to 10(6) and 10/ml, respectively. the density of s. typhimurium was further decreased by a second increment of e. agglomerans cells. the disappearance of s. typhimurium and k. pneumoniae from sewage thus is  the result of predation by protozoa.(abstract truncated at 250 words)
