TI  - Use of probiotics to reduce faecal shedding of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia  coli in sheep.
AB  - Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are zoonotic, foodborne pathogens of humans. Ruminants, including sheep, are the primary reservoirs of STEC and there is a need to develop intervention strategies to reduce the entry of STEC into the food chain. The initiation of the majority of bacterial, enteric infections involves colonisation of the gut mucosal surface by the pathogen. However, probiotic bacteria can serve to decrease the severity of infection via a number of mechanisms including competition for receptors and nutrients, and/or the synthesis of organic acids and bacteriocins that create an environment unfavourable for pathogen development. The aim of the current study was to determine whether the administration of a probiotic mixture to sheep experimentally infected with a non-O157 STEC strain, carrying stx1, stx2 and eae genes, was able to decrease faecal shedding of the pathogen. The probiotic mixture contained Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Lactobacillus lactis, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. The numbers of non-O157 STEC in faecal samples collected from sheep receiving daily doses of the probiotic mixture were significantly lower at the 3rd, 5th and 6th week post-inoculation when compared to the levels recorded in untreated animals. It was concluded that administration of the probiotic mixture reduced faecal shedding of non-O157 STEC in sheep, and holds potential as a pre-harvest intervention method to reduce transmission to humans.
TI  - Effects of Citrus junos by-products fermented with multistrain probiotics on growth performance, immunity, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability in broilers.
AB  - 1. The present study was conducted to develop Citrus junos probiotics (CJP), using by-products of Citrus junos fermented with multispecies probiotic bacteria including Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bacillus subtilis. The effects of dietary CJP on the growth performance, immune status, caecal microbiology and meat oxidative stability of broiler were investigated. 2. A total of 240 one-day-old Ross broiler chicks were used in a 35-d experiment in which the chicks were randomly allotted to one of the 4 dietary treatments (0, 5, 10 and 20 g CJP/kg diet) in a completely randomised design. 3. Dietary supplementation of 5 g/kg CJP significantly increased body weight, average daily gain and average daily feed intake of broiler during the overall experimental period. 4. Serum immunoglobulin (Ig)M concentration was significantly increased by 10 and 20 g/kg CJP, whereas the IgG and IgA concentration remained unaffected. In addition, 20 g/kg CJP significantly inhibited proliferation of Escherichia coli without affecting the concentration of Lactobacillus or Bacillus spp. 5. A significant reduction in the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meat was observed in response to increasing concentration of dietary CJP. 6. Thus, the results suggest that CJP up to a concentration of 20 g/kg can be used in the diet of broilers to improve immunity and to reduce caecal E. coli and TBARS values of breast and thigh meat without any adverse effects on growth performance.
TI  - [Tactics for the correction of intestinal microbiocenotic disorders in the combination therapy of patients with chronic liver diseases].
AB  - AIM: To evaluate the efficacy of the symbiotic Linex used in the combination therapy of liver cirrhosis (LC). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Seventy-four patients with LC, including 44 who received additionally the symbiotic Linex and 30 who had conventional therapy, were examined. All the patients underwent clinical and biochemical blood tests, abdominal ultrasonography, fecal test for bacteria, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry of the blood composition of microbial markers, number connecting test, and quality-of-life assessment (SF-36). RESULTS: The symbiotic-treated patients showed a significant improvement in biochemical parameters (decreases in transaminase activities, bilirubin levels, hepatic protein-synthetic function--there were elevations in the concentrations of total protein from 74.0 +/- 0.50 to 78.1 +/- 0.80 g/l (p < 0.05) and albumin from 30.6 +/- 1.7 to 35.5 +/- 1.6 g/l (p < 0.05). There were also increases in the count of bifidobacteria from 8.7 +/- 0.1 to 9.1 +/- 0.1 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05), lactobacilli from 5.0 +/- 0.2 to 5.2 +/- 0.2 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05) and in the total count of Escherichia coli from 7.6 +/- 0.3 to 7.9 +/- 0.3 Ig CFU/g (p < 0.05); a tendency for normalization of microbial markers was revealed by mass spectrometry; the manifestations of hepatic encephalopathy were alleviated (the number connecting test showed a reduction from 51.0 +/- 3.58 to 29.7 +/- 4.10 sec (p < 0.05)), and the quality of life improved. CONCLUSION: By normalizing enteric microbiocenosis, the symbiotic Linex positively affects the course and prognosis of LC and it is both a symptomatic and pathogenetic agent for the treatment of patients.
TI  - [Identification and biological properties of intestinal lactic acid bacteria isolated from aged women].
AB  - The strains of lactic acid bacteria have been isolated from the intestine of older women. These strains were identified and their biological activity was studied. It has been established that Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. salivarius var. salivarius and Enterococcus faecium had the highest antagonistic activity against opportunistic microorganisms. It has been revealed, that the adhesive properties and antibiotic resistance of the tested cultures had strain specificity. Most of the isolates were highly adhesive and did not produce hemolysins.
TI  - Effect of probiotics on biomarkers of cardiovascular disease: implications for heart-healthy diets.
AB  - The objectives of this article are to review clinical trials that have examined the effects of probiotics on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and to assess the potential of probiotic intake as a therapeutic lifestyle change (TLC) dietary option. Twenty-six clinical studies and two meta-analyses are reviewed. Significant LDL-C reductions were observed for four probiotic strains: Lactobacillus reuteri NCIMB 30242, Enterococcus faecium, and the combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus La5 and Bifidobacterium lactis Bb12. Two synbiotics, L. acidophilus CHO-220 plus inulin and L. acidophilus plus fructo-oligosaccharides, also decreased LDL-C. Of the probiotics examined, L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 was found to best meet TLC dietary requirements by 1) significantly reducing LDL-C and total cholesterol, with robustness similar to that of existing TLC dietary options, 2) improving other coronary heart disease risk factors, such as inflammatory biomarkers, and 3) having "generally recognized as safe" (GRAS) status. Based on these results, the probiotic L. reuteri NCIMB 30242 is a viable candidate both for future TLC dietary studies and as a potential option for inclusion in TLC dietary recommendations.
TI  - Individual responses of mother sows to a probiotic Enterococcus faecium strain lead to different microbiota composition in their offspring.
AB  - Pregnant gilts were fed the probiotic Enterococcus faecium NCIMB10415 (SF68) one  month before birth of piglets. DNA extracts of sow faeces taken in weekly intervals as well as extracts from the intestine of their offspring during the suckling period at 12 and 26 days of life were analysed by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR. DGGE profiles of faecal bacterial communities from three out of six probiotic-fed sows were distinctly different from the control and other probiotic-fed sows at all time points after probiotic supplementation. The probiotic-fed sows and their offspring were therefore divided into non-responder (n=3) and responder (n=3) groups. The probiotic strain significantly increased faecal lactobacilli cell numbers in mother sows, which could be assigned to a significant increase of Lactobacillus amylovorus and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Responding sows showed a more pronounced increase than non-responding sows. Similarly, suckling piglets from non-responding and responding sows showed numeric and significant differences for different bacterial groups and species. DGGE profiles of suckling piglets from responding sows also grouped more closely than profiles from control animals. Non-metric multiscaling of suckling piglets showed the same tendency for suckling piglets, but not for post-weaning piglets. This study showed that the probiotic E. faecium strain modified the faecal microbiota of sows. This modification is carried over to their offspring, but leads to changes that do not mirror the quantitative composition in the mother sow. Individual variations in the bacterial composition of mother sows before probiotic feed intake may influence the impact of a probiotic in sows and their offspring.
TI  - The effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. A completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. The highest count of faecal Enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log CFU g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. The highest count of Lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log CFU g(-1)). Moreover, the MALDI TOF MS Biotyper identified the following genera: Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella oxytoca, as well as Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. crispatus, L. fermentum and L. salivarius from the Lactobacilli group and Enterococcus avium, E. casseliflavus, E. cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus from the Enterococci group. Additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of chickens were tested. The best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against K. oxytoca.
TI  - Effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  - The composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. Changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term consequences for host health. The large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. To facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium infantis, Bifidobacterium pseudolongum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Clostridium butyricum, C. perfringens, C. bifermentans, C. innocuum, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. Ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats operated at different dilution rates (D; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (D = 0.21 h(-1)). Perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a 48-h period. Lactobacillus acidophilus and C. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. Ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and C. perfringens populations at both dilution rates. Metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. The bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. Several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. The growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.
TI  - The effect of a multispecies synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and length of hospital stay in children with acute diarrhea in Turkey: single blinded randomized study.
AB  - Probiotics have been successfully used for the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and this effect depends on the strains and dose. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of a synbiotic mixture on the duration of diarrhea and the length of hospital stay in children with acute watery diarrhea. This is a prospective randomized, multicenter single blinded clinical trial in hospitalized children with acute watery diarrhea. All children were treated with conventional hydration therapy with or without a daily dose of a synbiotic (2.5 x 10(9) CFU live bacteria including Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Bifidobacterium longum, Enterococcus faecium, and 625 mg fructooligosaccharide) for 5 days. The primary endpoint was duration of diarrhea and duration of hospitalization was the secondary endpoint. Among 209 eligible children, 113 received the synbiotic mixture and 96 served as a control. The duration of diarrhea was significantly shorter ( approximately 36 h) in children receiving the synbiotic group than the controls (77.9 +/- 30.5 vs. 114.6 +/- 37.4 h, p < 0.0001). The duration of hospitalization was shorter in children receiving the synbiotic group (4.94 +/- 1.7 vs. 5.77 +/- 1.97 days, p = 0.002). The effect of synbiotic mixture on diarrhea started after 24th hours and stool frequency significantly decreased after 24th and 48th hours. The percentage of diarrhea-free children is significantly higher in synbiotic group at 48th and 72nd hours of synbiotic group. In conclusion, this study showed a reduction in diarrhea duration by approximately 36 h and a reduction in the duration of hospitalization with approximately 1 day in children with acute diarrhea with this synbiotic mixture.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly Irish subjects.
AB  - AIMS: To isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. METHODS AND RESULTS: Screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects, using the indicator organisms Lactobacillus bulgaricus LMG 6901 and Listeria innocua DPC 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. Genomic fingerprinting following ApaI digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. The antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. The predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as Lactobacillus salivarius, Lactobacillus gasseri, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Enterococcus spp. A number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including ABP-118 and salivaricin B (from Lact. salivarius), enterocin B (Enterococcus faecium), lactacin B (Lact. acidophilus), gassericin T and a variant of gassericin A (Lact. gasseri), were identified. Interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: Lactococcus lactis producing nisin Z and Streptococcus mutans producing mutacin II. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The results presented are important due to growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.
TI  - Evaluation of probiotic strains for development of fermented Alisma canaliculatum and their effects on broiler chickens.
AB  - The present study was conducted to select appropriate microbial strains for the development of fermented Alisma canaliculatum A. Br. et Bouche (FAC) feed additive and to examine their effects on broilers. In experiment 1, 16 strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecium, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus coagulans, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae from the Korean Collection for Type Cultures (KCTC) were evaluated. The strains were tested for their acid, bile, and heat tolerance levels. Among them, L. acidophilus KCTC 3111, E. faecium KCTC 2022, B. subtilis KCTC 3239, and S. cerevisiae KCTC 7928 were selected to produce FAC. For experiment 2, 140 Ross broiler chicks were allocated to four 5-wk-long dietary groups: NC (basal diet), PC (basal diet with 0.005% oxytetracycline), AC (basal diet with 0.5% A. canaliculatum rhizome powder), and FAC (basal diet with 0.5% FAC). Final BW and total BW gain were increased (P < 0.05) upon the addition of FAC, whereas feed conversion ratio improved (P < 0.05) in the supplemented groups compared with the NC group. Crude protein content increased and crude fat decreased (P < 0.05) in the breast meat of the FAC group compared with the AC and PC groups, respectively. Proventriculus and kidney relative weights of the FAC group differed (P < 0.05) from the AC group but not from the PC group. Lower (P < 0.05) thiobarbituric acid reactive substances value of thigh meat was observed in the FAC group compared with the other groups. The FAC diet increased (P < 0.05) alpha-linolenic acid and linoleic acid in meat. Alteration of these fatty acids led to increased levels of polyunsaturated fatty acid, polyunsaturated fatty acid /saturated fatty acid, n-3 and n-6 fatty acids, and decreased n-6/n-3 ratio in breast or thigh meat (P < 0.05). It is concluded that FAC confers high tolerance to acid, bile and heat; and beneficially affects growth, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition. The FAC may be a functional feed additive in broilers.
TI  - [Interaction of Bifidobacterium bifidum with members of normal microflora in human intestine microsymbiocenosis].
AB  - AIM: Study the influence of exometabolites of B. bifidum on biological properties of bacteria that are the members of normoflora and their ability to interact with associative microsymbionts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial strains that are members of the normal microflora of human intestine: B. bifidum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcusfaecium and Escherichia coli lactose positive non-hemolytic (lac "+"/hly "-") were used. As opportunistic microorganisms cultures of E. coli lactose negative hemolytic (lac "-"/hly "+"), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were used. Isolation and identification of microorganisms was performed by generally accepted methods according to guidances. In the first series of experiments influence of B. bifidum metabolites on biological properties of microorganisms that are members ofnormoflora was studied. In the second series--the influence of bifidobacteria supernatants on interrelations of B. bifidum, L. acidophilus and E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" with opportunistic associants. Growth properties (GP), biofilm formation (BFF) and anti-lysozyme activity (ALA) of microorganisms was studied photometrically. Optical density measurement were performed on ELx808 (BioTek, U.S.A.) photometer. The data obtained were treated by nonparametric method using Mann-Whitney criteria. RESULTS: B. bifidum supernatant was established to stimulate in 33.3-66.7% of cases or did not alter growth/reproduction, BFF and ALA of microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of intestine including bacteria of the same species that could have implications for realization by bifidobacteria ofbiotope colonization resistance. Features of interaction ofexometabolites of bifidobacteria with microorganisms that are characteristic for eubiosis of human intestine consisting in enchantment or changes of effects of the influence of normoflora members on BFF of associants were revealed. The maximum enchantment of inhibitory effect of indigenous strains under the influence ofbifidobacteria was noted in associations E. coli lac "+"/hly "-" E. coli lac "-"/hly "+" as well as E. faecium--S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Thus, the data obtained may be used for detection of mechanisms of functioning of normal microsymbiocenosis in human associative symbiosis.
TI  - Study of antimicrobial activity and atomic force microscopy imaging of the action mechanism of cashew tree gum.
AB  - The aim of this work was to evaluate the antimicrobial potential of two grades of cashew tree gum (crude and purified) against eight microorganisms and to analyze the mechanism of cashew tree gum antimicrobial action via atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging. The results indicated strong antimicrobial properties of pure cashew tree gum against all tested microorganisms, except for Candida albicans and Lactobacillus acidophilus. On the other hand crude cashew gum showed antimicrobial activity only against Gram-positive bacteria (MRSA, MSSA, Listeria innocua and Enterococcus faecium). Atomic force microscopy imaging showed that pure cashew tree gum lead to bacterial cell collapse. In conclusion cashew tree gum presented relevant antimicrobial activity against most of the studied bacteria, and the purification of the cashew gum affected its antimicrobial spectrum.
TI  - Growth performance, meat yield, oxidative stability, and Fatty Acid composition of meat from broilers fed diets supplemented with a medicinal plant and probiotics.
AB  - The experiment was carried out to investigate the effects of Alisma canaliculatum with probiotics (ACP) on the growth performance, meat composition, oxidative stability, and fatty acid composition of broiler meat. Sixteen probiotic strains were tested for their levels of acid, bile, and heat tolerance. Among them, Lactobacillus acidophilus KCTC 3111, Enterococcus faecium KCTC 2022, Bacillus subtilis KCTC 3239, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae KCTC 7928 were selected for use in ACP. Exactly 140 Ross broiler chicks were assigned to four dietary treatments in five replications for 5 wks in a completely randomized design. The dietary treatments were NC (Negative control; basal diet), PC (Positive control; basal diet with 0.005% Chlortetracycline), ACP-0.5% (basal diet with 0.5% ACP powder), and ACP-1% (basal diet with 1% ACP powder). According to the results, body weight of the broilers increased, and feed conversion ratio improved in the ACP-0.5% group compared to the NC group (p<0.05). Crude protein content of breast meat was higher (p<0.05) in the ACP-0.5% group, whereas crude fat content of thigh meat was lower (p<0.05) in the supplemented groups. Breast meat absolute and relative weights were both higher (p<0.05) in the ACP groups compared to the control group. Further, ACP diets increased gizzard and decreased large intestine relative weights, whereas kidney relative weight decreased upon the addition of a higher level (1%) of ACP (p<0.05). Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances values of breast and thigh meats were reduced (p<0.05) by ACP supplementation compared to control. Regarding the fatty acid composition of breast meat, arachidonic acid, docosahexaenoic acid, PUFA, and n6 fatty acid levels decreased (p<0.05) in the ACP groups, whereas the levels of linoleic acid, PUFA, PUFA/SFA, and n6 fatty acid in thigh meat decreased (p<0.05) by ACP and PC diets. It can be suggested based on the study results that ACP-0.5% diet could be an effective feed additive for broilers.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antimicrobial activity of propolis on the microbiota from gastrointestinal tract of chickens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of propolis extracts on the microbial colonization of chicken gastrointestinal tract in vivo. The propolis was administered to both feed mixtures in various amounts except of the control group. The addition of 150 mg propolis to 1 kg of feed was included in the first experimental group, the addition of 450 mg.kg(-1) in the second experimental group, the addition of 600 mg.kg(-1) the third experimental group and 800 mg kg(-1) in the fourth one. The highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the third group (8.6 cfu.g(-1)) where 600 mg of propolis to 1 kg was added to the feed mixture. The highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the fourth experimental group (8.83 cfu.g(-1)) where was 800 mg of propolis added to 1 kg of feed mixture and number of Enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in control group (8.73 cfu.g(-1)). With RTQ PCR detected species from the genus Enterococcus were: E. avium, E. casseliflavus, E cecorum, E. faecalis, E. faecium, E. gallinarum, E. hirae and E. malodoratus and from genus Lactobacillus were: Lactobacillus crispatus, L. acidophilus and L. salivarius. With MALDI TOF MS Biotyper from Enterobacteriaceae genera were identified Citrobacter braakii, Raoultella ornithinolytica, Serratia fonticola, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella oxytoca. Antimicrobial activities In vitro of six species of bacteria isolated from gastrointestinal tract of chickens were also tested. The best antimicrobial effect of Citrobacter braakii on ethanolic propolis extract in all concentrations were found.
TI  - Fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to study the fatty acid profile of pig meat after probiotic administration. Thirty postweaned pigs (25 day old) were distributed into 2 groups: control (n = 15) and probiotic (n = 15). Each experimental group was fed ad libitum on a commercial diet for 35 days. Lactobacillus amylovorus and Enterococcus faecium mixed culture (10(8) CFU/ml)was daily orally delivered to the probiotic group. At the end of the assay, six pigs randomly selected from each group were slaughtered and muscle samples (Longissimus dorsi) were taken for fatty acid analysis. Tissues from the probiotic group animals exhibited an increase in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids; furthermore, linoleic acid (C18:2), linolenic acid (18:3), and cis-9,trans-11 conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentrations were significantly higher (p < 0.05) compared to the control group. These results suggest probiotic administration could be useful to modify and improve the fatty acid profile of pig meat.
TI  - Determination of wine microbiota using classical method, polymerase chain method  and Step One Real-Time PCR during fermentation process.
AB  - The aim of our study was the identification of grape, must and wine microbiota during the fermentation process using a classical microbiological method and Real-Time PCR. The changes in different groups of microorganisms were monitored in total counts of bacteria, lactobacilli and yeasts. Microbiological parameters were observed during the current collection and processing of grapes in 2009. Samples were taken during the fermentation process in wine enterprises and a private vineyard. During this period 30 samples of wine among Muller Thurgau, Cabernet Sauvignon, Chardonnay, Tramin and Red Bio-wine were examined. Samples were collected from stages of grape-must unfiltered, grape-must filtered, the beginning of fermentation, fermentation, late fermentation and young wine. The highest total counts of bacteria ranged from 0.00 to 176 +/- 15 CFU.mL(-1) in the wine of Muller Thurgau, the highest number of yeast ranged from 0.00 to 150 +/- 9 CFU.mL(-1) in the wine of Muller Thurgau and the number of Lactobacillus spp. ranged from 0.00 to 92 +/- 5 CFU.mL(-1) in the sample of Cabernet Sauvignon wine. The presence and sensitivity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus crispatus and Lactobacillus salivarius were detected using Real-Time PCR (RTQ PCR). Susceptibility of Enterococcus faecium varied in different isolates from 1 to 10(6) CFU.mL(-1), the sensitivity of the species Lactobacillus acidophilus in different isolates of the wine samples ranged from 1 to 10(5) CFU.mL(-1). We also monitored representation of species Lactobacillus crispatus, which were captured by RTQ PCR sensitivity and ranged from 1 to 10(5) CFU.mL(-1). Identification of the species Lactobacillus salivarius in each of isolates by RTQ PCR method showed the presence of these bacteria in the range of 1 to 10(4) CFU.mL(-1).
TI  - The effect of using different probiotic cultures on conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) concentration and fatty acid composition of white pickle cheese.
AB  - Pickle white cheeses were produced from whole milk with five different probiotic  cultures (Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus paracasei, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium bifidum and Lactobacillus acidophilus). Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) content of cheeses ranged from 3.52 to 3.92 mg/g. Probiotic differences and storage process have not affected the CLA contents of the samples statistically. There was no correlation between the CLA content of all probiotic cheeses and saturated fatty acids. A positive correlation between the CLA and linoleic acid contents of L. paracasei and L. acidophilus cheeses was observed.
TI  - Host range of enterococcal vanA plasmids among Gram-positive intestinal bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The most prevalent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance is encoded by the vanA transposon Tn1546 located mainly on transferable plasmids in Enterococcus faecium. The limited occurrence in other species could be due to the lack of inter-species transferability and/or stability of Tn1546-containing plasmids in other species. We investigated the in vitro transferability of 14 pre-characterized vanA-containing plasmids hosted by E. faecium (n = 9), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 4) and Enterococcus raffinosus (n = 1) into several enterococcal, lactobacterial, lactococcal and bifidobacterial recipients. METHODS: A filter-mating protocol was harmonized using procedures of seven partner laboratories. Donor strains were mated with three E. faecium recipients, three E. faecalis recipients, a Lactobacillus acidophilus recipient, a Lactococcus lactis recipient and two Bifidobacterium recipients. Transfer rates were calculated per donor and recipient. Transconjugants were confirmed by determining their phenotypic and genotypic properties. Stability of plasmids in the new host was assessed in long-term growth experiments. RESULTS: In total, 282 enterococcal matings and 73 inter-genus matings were performed and evaluated. In summary, intra-species transfer was far more frequent than inter-species transfer, if that was detectable at all. All recipients of the same species behaved similarly. Inter-genus transfer was shown for broad host range control plasmids (pIP501/pAMbeta1) only. Acquired resistance plasmids remained stable in the new host. CONCLUSIONS: Intra-species transfer of enterococcal vanA plasmids was far more frequent than transfer across species or genus barriers and may thus explain the preferred prevalence of vanA-containing plasmids among E. faecium. A reservoir of vanA plasmids in non-enterococcal intestinal colonizers does not seem to be reasonable.
TI  - The effect of selected microbial strains on internal milieu of broiler chickens after peroral administration.
AB  - The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of probiotic preparation with  multi-strains composition (Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus LAT 187, Lactobacillus acidophilus LAT 180, Lactobacillus helveticus LAT 179, Lactobacillus delbrueckii ssp. lactis LAT 182, Streptococcus thermophilus LAT 205 and Enterococcus faecium E 253) on internal milieu, antioxidant status and body weight of broiler chickens. Chickens were divided into three groups (C, control; E1 and E2, experimental groups). Experimental chickens received the probiotic preparation in drinking water. Probiotic preparation caused a significant increase of serum calcium and potassium content. In the group with higher dose of probiotic strains serum triglycerides level decreased. Total antioxidant status in groups with addition of probiotic strains showed higher values in comparison to control group. Serum albumin level was found to increase after consumption of probiotic preparation in group with higher dose of probiotic strains. Probiotic strains improved body weight in last observed weeks of feeding.
TI  - Inducer bacteria, unique signal peptides, and low-nutrient media stimulate in vitro bacteriocin production by Lactobacillus spp. and Enterococcus spp. Strains.
AB  - Bacteriocins (BCN) are antimicrobial peptides that provide potential to control bacterial infections in a variety of applications. We previously reported on three class IIa BCN molecules produced by Lactobacillus salivarius B-30514 (OR-7), Enterococcus faecium B-30746 (E 50-52), and Enterococcus durans/faecium/hirae B-30745 (E-760). These BCN are notably effective against a wide array of pathogenic bacteria. To commercially apply such BCN, adequate quantities must be produced and harvested. We determined that a combination of host producer synthesized signal peptides (SP) in the presence of both producer and inducer bacteria grown in a dilute fermentation medium enabled marked increases in the synthesis of BCN. These SP contained 24-30 amino acid residues with sizes ranging from 2095 to 3065 Da having the unique terminal carboxyl sequence of VKGLT. The inducer bacterial isolates used were Lactobacillus acidophilus B-30510 and Lactobacillus crispatus B-30884. We used a nutrient-limited medium of 10% brucella broth (containing 0.01% glucose) to enhance BCN production. Using the combination of these above three parameters enabled us to reproducibly harvest at least 200 mg of BCN/L of the spent fermentation broth.

TI  - Effects of a multi-strain probiotic (PrimaLac) on performance and antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease virus vaccination in broiler chickens.
AB  - The effects of the probiotic PrimaLac (Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium bifidium) was investigated on performance and immune responses to vaccination against Newcastle disease and infectious bursal disease in broiler chickens. Use of PrimaLac significantly (P<0.05) enhanced broiler performance by improving body weight and decreasing the feed conversion ratio. Although administration of the probiotic appeared to improve the antibody responses to Newcastle disease virus and infectious bursal disease vaccination, the antibody titres of the probiotic-treated group were not significantly different from those not receiving probiotics.
TI  - Biodiversity of the microbial community in a Spanish farmhouse cheese as revealed by culture-dependent and culture-independent methods.
AB  - The microbial diversity within Alberquilla cheese, made from a spontaneously fermented mixture of raw goats' and sheep's milk in the Alpujarra mountains (Granada, south-east Spain), has been studied by the classical culturing method and also by molecular analysis of community DNA. A collection of 206 isolates was obtained from the cheese on different selective/differential media, which were then re-grouped to 52 after randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD)-PCR analyses. Isolates on Man-Rogosa and Sharpe-agar (MRS), M17-glucose agar and Kenner Fecal (KF)-agar medium were identified by specific PCR or 16S rRNA gene sequencing and belonged mainly to the lactic-acid bacteria group. The predominant genus was Lactobacillus, which accounted for more than 50% of the isolates, the most abundant species being Lactobacillus paracasei, followed by considerably less quantities of Lb. plantarum and Lb. brevis. Other lactic-acid bacteria identified were Pediococcus urinaequi, Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, Leuc. mesenteroides, Lactococcus lactis and even the enterococci Enterococcus faecium and E. devriesei. Cluster analyses of RAPD-PCR patterns revealed a high degree of diversity among the lactobacilli. The Gram-negative bacterial strains belonged mainly to Hafnia alvei species. The microbes occurring in Alberquilla cheese were also studied by PCR temporal temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) of the 16S rRNA V3 region and partial 16S rRNA sequencing of the TTGE bands. The results showed a major presence of lactic-acid bacteria closely related to Lc. lactis, Lb. paracasei, Lb. plantarum, Lb. brevis, Lb. acidophilus and Enterococcus sp. The non-lactic-acid bacterium detected was identified as Escherichia coli. All the Enterococcus strains showed great susceptibility to the most clinically relevant antibiotics, harbouring only the virulence gene efaAfm. On the basis of their antimicrobial activity against Listeria monocytogenes we chose two strains of Ln. mesenteroides that produced mesenterocin B105 and mesenterocin Y105, as revealed by PCR techniques.
TI  - Probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria isolated from stool samples of longevous people in regions of Hotan, Xinjiang and Bama, Guangxi, China.
AB  - A total of 567 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from the stool samples of longevous people in regions of Hotan, Xinjiang and Bama, Guangxi, China. In order to reduce the number of strains for further examinations, 36 isolates were screened out for further examination whilst the other strains, which had lower probiotic properties, were not suitable for yogurt production due to the absence of growth in pH 3.5 MRS medium and no curding during fermentation, and so were excluded. The result of identification by API, sequence analysis of 16S rRNA and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis showed that there were three strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, 10 strains of Lactobacillus rhamnosus, three strains of Lactobacillus casein, three strains of Lactobacillus brevis, two strains of Enterococcus faecium, two strains of Enterococcus faecalis, four strains of Bifdibacterium infantis, three strains of Bifdibacterium brevise, three strains of Bifdibacterium bifidium, two strains of Bifdibacterium adolecentis and one strain of Bifdibacterium longam among the 36 isolates. These strains were evaluated by in vitro methods including survival upon exposure to pH 2.0, 3.0 and/or 0.3% oxgall and adhesion to the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line Caco-2 as well as antimicrobial activity against potential pathogens. The results presented here show that L. rhamnosus LV108, L. rhamnosus F, B. brevise R39 and B. infantis R42 are acid and bile tolerant, adhere to the cultured human intestinal Caco-2 cell line, antagonistic activity against potential pathogenic bacteria infection in vitro, and so are potential strains for probiotic use.
TI  - Probiotics, prebiotics, and synbiotics.
AB  - According to the German definition, probiotics are defined viable microorganisms, sufficient amounts of which reach the intestine in an active state and thus exert positive health effects. Numerous probiotic microorganisms (e.g. Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, bifidobacteria and certain strains of L. casei or the L. acidophilus-group) are used in probiotic food, particularly fermented milk products, or have been investigated--as well as Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, certain enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) and the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii--with regard to their medicinal use. Among the numerous purported health benefits attributed to probiotic bacteria, the (transient) modulation of the intestinal microflora of the host and the capacity to interact with the immune system directly or mediated by the autochthonous microflora, are basic mechanisms. They are supported by an increasing number of in vitro and in vivo experiments using conventional and molecular biologic methods. In addition to these, a limited number of randomized, well-controlled human intervention trials have been reported. Well-established probiotic effects are: 1. Prevention and/or reduction of duration and complaints of rotavirus-induced or antibiotic-associated diarrhea as well as alleviation of complaints due to lactose intolerance. 2. Reduction of the concentration of cancer-promoting enzymes and/or putrefactive (bacterial) metabolites in the gut. 3. Prevention and alleviation of unspecific and irregular complaints of the gastrointestinal tracts in healthy people. 4. Beneficial effects on microbial aberrancies, inflammation and other complaints in connection with: inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract, Helicobacter pylori infection or bacterial overgrowth. 5. Normalization of passing stool and stool consistency in subjects suffering from obstipation or an irritable colon. 6. Prevention or alleviation of allergies and atopic diseases in infants. 7. Prevention of respiratory tract infections (common cold, influenza) and other infectious diseases as well as treatment of urogenital infections. Insufficient or at most preliminary evidence exists with respect to cancer prevention, a so-called hypocholesterolemic effect, improvement of the mouth flora and caries prevention or prevention or therapy of ischemic heart diseases or amelioration of autoimmune diseases (e.g. arthritis). A prebiotic is "a selectively fermented ingredient that allows specific changes, both in the composition and/or activity in the gastrointestinal microflora that confers benefits upon host well being and health", whereas synergistic combinations of pro- and prebiotics are called synbiotics. Today, only bifidogenic, non-digestible oligosaccharides (particularly inulin, its hydrolysis product oligofructose, and (trans)galactooligosaccharides), fulfill all the criteria for prebiotic classification. They are dietary fibers with a well-established positive impact on the intestinal microflora. Other health effects of prebiotics (prevention of diarrhoea or obstipation, modulation of the metabolism of the intestinal flora, cancer prevention, positive effects on lipid metabolism, stimulation of mineral adsorption and immunomodulatory properties) are indirect, i.e. mediated by the intestinal microflora, and therefore less-well proven. In the last years, successful attempts have been reported to make infant formula more breast milk-like by the addition of fructo- and (primarily) galactooligosaccharides.
TI  - Effects of direct-fed microbial supplementation on digestibility and fermentation end-products in horses fed low- and high-starch concentrates.
AB  - A study was conducted to determine whether direct-fed microbials (DFM) could be used to increase digestibility and minimize the risk of acidosis associated with feeding an increase in the amount of starch fed to horses. Fifteen mature Thoroughbred geldings were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatments in a 3 x 3 Latin square design balanced for carryover effects. Within each 26-d period, horses were offered grass hay + low-starch concentrate (LS; 1.2 g of starch x kg of BW(-1) x meal(-1)) from d 1 to 13 and then were abruptly changed to hay + high-starch concentrate (HS; 2.4 g of starch.kg of BW(-1)x meal(-1)) on d 14 continuing through d 26. The DFM treatments were offered in concentrate pellets at a target dosage of 10(8) cfu/(50 kg of BW x d) as follows: no DFM (CON; control), Lactobacillus acidophilus (LAC1; single-species DFM), or a mixture of L. acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Bifidobacterium bifidum, and Enterococcus faecium (LAC4; multiple-species DFM). Total feces were collected over 72 h from d 11 to 13 (LS; low dietary starch collection), from d 15 to 17 (AC; abrupt change in dietary starch collection), and at the end of each experimental period, from d 24 to 26 (HS; high dietary starch collection). Data collected consisted of total DM intake and fecal output, fecal pH, fecal acetate and propionate concentrations, and viable numbers of DFM in the feed. With the exception of Fe digestibility, there were no starch x DFM interactions. There was an effect of starch level (P <or= 0.02) on most nutrient digestibilities, except for Mg (P = 0.08) and CP, K, and Zn (P > 0.10). Horses supplemented with LAC4 had increased ether extract (P < 0.05) and a tendency for decreased Na (P < 0.10) digestibilities compared with CON horses. All DFM-supplemented horses had increased Cu (P < 0.05) and Fe and numerically increased Zn digestibilities compared with CON horses. Fecal pH decreased (P < 0.05), and fecal propionate concentration increased (P < 0.05) as dietary starch content changed from LS to HS. There was a tendency for elevated fecal pH (P < 0.10) in LAC1 horses compared with CON horses. These results confirm that increasing starch in the equine diet can enhance nutrient digestibility of the diet. Supplementing equine diets with either a single or mixed strain direct-fed lactic acid bacteria had limited effects on nutrient digestibility or on reducing the risk of acidosis associated with feeding high-starch concentrates to horses. The potential response of DFM supplementation should be evaluated when a more acute acidotic state is induced in horses than in the current study.
TI  - A probiotic Lactobacillus strain can acquire vancomycin resistance during digestive transit in mice.
AB  - The present study demonstrates for the first time the transfer of vancomycin resistance (vanA cluster) from enterococci to a Lactobacillusacidophilus commercial strain. Transfers were observed in vitro, but also in vivo in the gut of mice (in the absence of antibiotic pressure) where transconjugants arose at relatively high frequencies and could persist in the digestive environment. Since transfer of vancomycin resistance genes might also take place in the human digestive tract, lactobacilli probiotics should be carefully considered especially in either immunocompromised patients or during antibiotherapy. Acquisition and retransfer of resistance genes should be addressed in the safety evaluation of probiotics.
TI  - Are probiotics detectable in human feces after oral uptake by healthy volunteers?
AB  - GOALS: Assessment of the presence of probiotic bacteria in feces after oral ingestion. BACKGROUND: Probiotic bacteria are said to have beneficial effects on the host. As a precondition for any effect, probiotic strains must survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract. STUDY: The feces of seven volunteers were analyzed for the presence of probiotic strains after one week's oral ingestion of each of six commercially available products: E. coli Nissle 0.5-5 x 10(9) cells (Mutaflor), Enterococcus faecium SF 68 7.5 x 10(7) cells (Bioflorin), Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium infantis both 1 x 10(9) cells (Infloran), Lactobacillus gasseri and Bifidobacterium longum both 1 x 10(8) cells (Omniflora), Lactobacillus casei rhamnosus 1 x 10(9) cells (Antibiophilus), and yoghurt enriched with Lactobacillus casei Immunitas 1 x 10(10) cells (Actimel). Ten colonies were selected from each stool sample, and DNA was extracted and typed using random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD). Typing patterns of the ingested probiotics and the fecal isolates were compared. RESULTS: Fingerprints identical to the ingested probiotic strains were recovered from fecal samples of 4/7 volunteers after one week of Mutaflor, from 4/6 after taking Bioflorin, and from 1/6 after Infloran. Cultivation of strains of the same species from fecal specimens was negative after consumption of Antibiophilus, Omniflora and Actimel. CONCLUSIONS: After oral consumption of probiotics, E. coli and enterococci could be detected in stool samples (57% and 67%, respectively). In contrast, with only one exception, ingested lactobacilli and bifidobacteria could not be detected in human feces.
TI  - Probiotics for treatment of acute diarrhoea in children: randomised clinical trial of five different preparations.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of five probiotic preparations recommended to  parents in the treatment of acute diarrhoea in children. Design Randomised controlled clinical trial in collaboration with family paediatricians over 12 months. SETTING: Primary care. PARTICIPANTS: Children aged 3-36 months visiting a family paediatrician for acute diarrhoea. INTERVENTION: Children's parents were randomly assigned to receive written instructions to purchase a specific probiotic product: oral rehydration solution (control group); Lactobacillus rhamnosus strain GG; Saccharomyces boulardii; Bacillus clausii; mix of L delbrueckii var bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, L acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium bifidum; or Enterococcus faecium SF68. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcomes were duration of diarrhoea and daily number and consistency of stools. Secondary outcomes were duration of vomiting and fever and rate of admission to hospital. Safety and tolerance were also recorded. RESULTS: 571 children were allocated to intervention. Median duration of diarrhoea was significantly shorter (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG (78.5 hours) and the mix of four bacterial strains (70.0 hours) than in children who received oral rehydration solution alone (115.0 hours). One day after the first probiotic administration, the daily number of stools was significantly lower (P<0.001) in children who received L rhamnosus strain GG and in those who received the probiotic mix than in the other groups. The remaining preparations did not affect primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes were similar in all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Not all commercially available probiotic preparations are effective in children with acute diarrhoea. Paediatricians should choose bacterial preparations based on effectiveness data. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN56067537 [controlled-trials.com].
TI  - [Adhesion of various species of lactic acid bacteria depending on the AB0 system  blood group].
AB  - The influence of the AB0 blood groups on adhesion of different lactic acid bacteria species was studied. From twelve investigated strains of Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum and L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus species, difference between adhesion average index on erythrocytes of various blood groups was found in two strains. The average adhesion index of the strain E. faecium K-50 in A (II) blood group erythrocytes was higher (AAI = 4.91 +/- 0.26) than in B (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.17 +/- 0.33). The strain L. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus 4n has displayed a higher adhesive activity in A (II) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 4.36 +/- 0.13) in comparison with AB (III) blood group erythrocytes (AAI = 3.61 +/- 0.75).
TI  - Probiotics and prebiotics: effects on diarrhea.
AB  - Probiotics have preventive as well as curative effects on several types of diarrhea of different etiologies. Prevention and therapy (or alleviation) of diarrhea have been successfully investigated for numerous dietary probiotics to establish probiotic properties and to justify health claims (the medicinal use of probiotic food and the therapy of gastrointestinal diseases itself may not be advertised under current food laws). Other probiotic microorganisms (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, L. reuteri, certain strains of L. casei, L. acidophilus, Escherichia coli strain Nissle 1917, and certain bifidobacteria and enterococci (Enterococcus faecium SF68) as well as the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii have been investigated with regard to their medicinal use, either as single strains or in mixed-culture probiotics. However, the effects on humans have been assessed mainly in smaller (n<100) randomized, controlled clinical studies or in open label trials, but large intervention studies and epidemiological investigations of long-term probiotic effects are largely missing. Perhaps with the exception of nosocomial diarrhea or antibiotic-associated diarrhea, the results of these studies are not yet sufficient to give specific recommendations for the clinical use of probiotics in the treatment of diarrhea.
TI  - In vitro growth control of selected pathogens by Lactobacillus acidophilus- and Lactobacillus casei-fermented milk.
AB  - AIMS: Food-borne pathogen inhibition was tested in the presence of a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Lactobacillus casei during fermentation under controlled pH conditions. METHODS AND RESULTS: The growth of Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella serotype Typhimurium, Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria innocua, Enterococcus faecium and Enterococcus faecalis was evaluated for 48 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of the lactic acid bacteria (LAB), an increase of the generation time was observed for all the gram-positive bacteria evaluated. Staphylococcus aureus was the most sensitive strain showing an increase of the generation time by 210%. However, for all the gram-negative bacteria evaluated, no inhibition occurred after 8 h of fermentation. The soluble portion of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk was recuperated and tested for its antimicrobial activity. Listeria innocua and Staph. aureus were the most sensitive to the presence of fermented milk supernatant showing an inhibition of 85.9% and 84.7%, respectively. This soluble fraction was neutralized to eliminate the antimicrobial effect of the organic acids produced; the most sensitive strains were L. innocua and E. coli O157:H7 showing an inhibition of 65.9% and 61.9%, respectively. Finally, the soluble fraction was neutralized and irradiated at 45 kGy using a (60)Co source to eliminate the possible antimicrobial effect of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like substances. Enterococcus faecalis, E. coli O157:H7 and Staph. aureus were the most affected bacteria by this fraction, showing 39.1, 32 and 31.2% inhibition, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The results obtained in this study suggest the implication of both organic acids and bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances in the antimicrobial activity observed in the soluble fraction of the probiotic preparation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study revealed the antimicrobial mechanisms of action of Lact. acidophilus- and Lact. casei-fermented milk used to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
TI  - [Study of vaginal and intestinal microflora of women in the prenatal period and its correction in dysbacteriosis].
AB  - A comparative research of the structure of vaginal and intestinal microflora in norm and at kidney pathologies in women in the prenatal period was carried out. At physiologically normal course of pregnancy microbiocenosis of vagina and intestine does not contain pathogenic and conditional-pathogenic microorganisms. Lactic acid bacteria are fixed within the limits of 10(5)-10(8) CFU/1 ml in the vagina secretion and 10(7)-10(8) CFU/1 g in the intestine content. The spore microorganisms have completely disappeared in vaginal biocenosis of women with pyelonephritis after pharmacotherapy; and colibacterias has disappeared in 62% of women. Quantity of lactic acid bacteria has also decreased. Quantity of E. coli (10(8)- 10(9)) CFU/g, sporous microorganisms (10(3)-10(4)) CFU/g and yeast (10(4)-10(5)) CFU/g has considerably increased in the content of intestine. Lactic acid bacteria in content of the vagina are presented by: Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. plantarum, L. fermentum, L. vaginalis; in content of the intestine--L. plantarum and L. fermentum. All the isolated strains of lactobacilli are resistant to metrogyl and amphotericin, 87%--to cephoxitine, cypropfloxacine. Twenty three of 24 strains of lactic acid bacteria--antagonists of pathogenic microflora have shown adhesion to vaginal epthelium. The degree of adhesive activity depends on the strain and genus specificity of cultures. The highest index of adhesiveness in indicated in Enterococcus faecium (5.82 - 7.62) and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (2.74 - 6.40) strains. The screening of strains has been performed, which suppress growth of gas-producing microflora. The strain of Lactobacillus plantarum 200D proved to be the most active one. A complex of cultures of the lactic bacteria providing normalization of microbial cenosis of the vagina in women in the prenatal period has been selected as based on the data obtained. The biotechnology of production of vaginal suppositories is developed.
TI  - Lactobacillus plantarum gene clusters encoding putative cell-surface protein complexes for carbohydrate utilization are conserved in specific gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Genomes of gram-positive bacteria encode many putative cell-surface proteins, of which the majority has no known function. From the rapidly increasing number of available genome sequences it has become apparent that many cell-surface proteins are conserved, and frequently encoded in gene clusters or operons, suggesting common functions, and interactions of multiple components. RESULTS: A novel gene cluster encoding exclusively cell-surface proteins was identified, which is conserved in a subgroup of gram-positive bacteria. Each gene cluster generally has one copy of four new gene families called cscA, cscB, cscC and cscD. Clusters encoding these cell-surface proteins were found only in complete genomes of Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus sakei, Enterococcus faecalis, Listeria innocua, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactococcus lactis ssp lactis and Bacillus cereus and in incomplete genomes of L. lactis ssp cremoris, Lactobacillus casei, Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Lactobacillius brevis, Oenococcus oeni, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, and Bacillus thuringiensis. These genes are neither present in the genomes of streptococci, staphylococci and clostridia, nor in the Lactobacillus acidophilus group, suggesting a niche-specific distribution, possibly relating to association with plants. All encoded proteins have a signal peptide for secretion by the Sec-dependent pathway, while some have cell-surface anchors, novel WxL domains, and putative domains for sugar binding and degradation. Transcriptome analysis in L. plantarum shows that the cscA-D genes are co-expressed, supporting their operon organization. Many gene clusters are significantly up-regulated in a glucose-grown, ccpA-mutant derivative of L. plantarum, suggesting catabolite control. This is supported by the presence of predicted CRE-sites upstream or inside the up-regulated cscA-D gene clusters. CONCLUSION: We propose that the CscA, CscB, CscC and CscD proteins form cell-surface protein complexes and play a role in carbon source acquisition. Primary occurrence in plant-associated gram-positive bacteria suggests a possible role in degradation and utilization of plant oligo- or poly-saccharides.
TI  - Characterization of a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus faecium GM-1 isolated  from an infant.
AB  - AIM: To partially characterize the bacteriocin produced by the GM-1 strain of Enterococcus faecium, isolated from the faeces of a newborn human infant. METHODS AND RESULTS: The bacteriocin produced by E. faecium GM-1 showed a broad spectrum of activity against indicator strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Vibrio spp., Salmonella typhimurium, Listeria monocytogenes, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus thermophilus. Treatment of the GM-1 bacteriocin with proteolytic enzymes reduced its inhibitory activities. The bacteriocin was stable at 100 degrees C for 20 min and displayed inhibitory activity at neutral pH. The optimal production of bacteriocin from E. faecium GM-1 was obtained when the culture conditions were pH 6.0-6.5 and 35-40 degrees C. The inhibitory activity of the bacteriocin was not substantially changed by the use of different carbon sources in the media, except when galactose was substituted for glucose. The use of a sole nitrogen source caused a decrease in inhibitory activity. A bacteriocin gene similar to enterocin P was identified from the total DNA of E. faecium GM-1 by PCR and direct sequencing methods. CONCLUSION: E. faecium GM-1, which was isolated from the faeces of a newborn baby, produces an enterocin P-like bacteriocin with inhibitory activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including food-borne pathogens. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: E. faecium GM-1, isolated from infant faeces, produces a new bacteriocin that is similar to enterocin P. This bacteriocin is heat stable and has a broad antibacterial spectrum that includes both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Intestinal microflora in patients with liver cirrhosis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Patients with liver cirrhosis have varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora and probiotics can improve some of the symptoms of gastrointestinal dysfunction in these patients. In the present study, blood ammonia, fecal pH, fecal ammonia, and plasma endotoxin were measured after administration of two kinds of probiotics in order to detect the changes in intestinal flora. METHODS: Six bacteria and yeast were cultured and the colony forming units were counted. Fifty cirrhotic patients were randomized to receive probiotic capsules containing Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus, or probiotic capsules containing Bacillus subtilis and Enterococcus faecium for 14 days. Fecal flora, pH and ammonia, blood ammonia (detected by test paper) and plasma endotoxin (detected by LAL test kits) were measured before and after the treatment. RESULTS: Patients with liver cirrhosis had varying degrees of imbalance of the intestinal flora as shown by a decrease in the Bifidobacterium count (10.04 +/- 0.78 vs 9.48 +/- 1.13, P < 0.05). The severity of the imbalance was matched by that of liver dysfunction, with the most serious imbalance observed in Child-Pugh C patients. Both types of probiotic increased the Bifidobacterium count (9.46 +/- 1.09 vs 10.30 +/- 1.11, 9.81 +/- 0.62 vs 10.44 +/- 1.08, respectively, P < 0.05) and reduced the levels of fecal pH and fecal and blood ammonia (P < 0.05). Probiotics containing B. subtilis and E. faecium reduced the level of endotoxin in cirrhotic patients with endotoxemia (0.0876 +/- 0.0117 Eu/mL vs 0.0685 +/- 0.0246 Eu/mL, P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with liver cirrhosis have an imbalance of intestinal bacteria flora. Probiotics effectively increased the Bifidobacterium count and reduced the level of fecal pH and fecal and blood ammonia.
TI  - Growth inhibition of intestinal bacteria and mutagenicity of 2-, 3-, 4-aminobiphenyls, benzidine, and biphenyl.
AB  - 2-Aminobiphenyl (2-ABP), 3-aminobiphenyl (3-ABP) and 4-aminobiphenyl (4-ABP), but not benzidine (Bz) and biphenyl (Bp), were found to be inhibitory to the growth of human intestinal bacteria Bifidobacterium infantis ATCC 15697, B. bifidium ATCC 11863, Clostridium perfringens ATCC 13124, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, E. coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 13047 and Salmonella typhimurium TA98, TA100, YG1041 at 10-200 microg/ml in culture broth. Bacteroides distasonis ATCC 8503, B. fragilis ATCC 25285, B. theataiotaomicron ATCC 29741, C. paraputrificum ATCC 26780, C. clostridiiforme ATCC 25537, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 and Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434 were not inhibited by the above mentioned compounds in concentrations up to 200 microg/ml. The Ames Salmonella/microsome assay was employed to test the mutagenicity of the above-mentioned compounds using strains TA98 and TA100 in the presence and absence of Aroclor 1254-induced rat S9 mix. It was found that 4-ABP was mutagenic to both TA98 and TA100, and Bz was mutagenic to TA98 in the presence of rat S9 mix. 2-Aminobiphenyl, 3-ABP, and Bp were not mutagenic to both strains tested. 2-Aminobiphenyl and 3-ABP are chemical isomers of 4-ABP and are as strong as 4-ABP in inhibiting the growth of intestinal bacteria but not as mutagenic as 4-ABP. Evidence suggested that the mechanism of growth inhibition is not involved with the interaction of DNA that causes mutations, but rather on the electron transport system of these organisms.
TI  - Esterolytic and lipolytic activities of lactic acid bacteria isolated from ewe's  milk and cheese.
AB  - In the present work, we report on the esterase and lipase activities of lactic acid bacteria representing the genera Lactococcus, Leuconostoc, Lactobacillus, and Enterococcus isolated from ewe's milk and cheeses. Esterase activity was studied using alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 12 carbon atoms and postelectrophoretic detection. The lactic acid bacteria evaluated had intracellular esterase activities, which preferentially degraded the alpha- and beta-naphthyl derivatives of 2 to 6 carbon atoms. By studying postelectrophoretic patterns, it was found that some strains presented more than one esterase. Lactobacillus plantarum O236 showed four enzymes that hydrolyze carboxyl ester linkages with different specificity. Lipase activity was studied in intracellular and extracellular fractions using tributyrin, tricaprylin, triolein, and milk fat as substrates. The intracellular and extracellular fractions of Leuconostoc mesenteroides O257, Lactobacillus plantarum O236, and Lactobacillus acidophilus O177 were able to hydrolyze tributyrin. L. plantarum O186, L. acidophilus O252, Enterococcus faecium O174 and O426, and Enterococcus faecalis Ov409 showed lipase activity associated with the intracellular fraction on tributyrin. Lactococcus lactis O233, L. plantarum O155, and Lactobacillus casei O190 did not hydrolyze triglycerides. Not all strains that showed esterase activity exhibited high activity on triglycerides. Esterase and lipase activities were species- and strain-specific. Wide variations in activity between strains highlight the need for selecting appropriate starters to produce enzyme-modified cheese as well as accelerated ripened cheese.
TI  - Development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - A membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. Digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. Hybridization signals were read by NBT/BCIP color development. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. fragilis, B. distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, C. leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, R. bromii, R. callidus, R. albus, Bifidobacterium longum, B. adolescentis, B. infantis, Eubacterium biforme, E. aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus,Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. The result was also confirmed by using specific PCR methods for these bacteria.
TI  - Probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea.
AB  - Antibiotic-associated diarrhoea is a common event. In some cases, it could represent a life-threatening event. Clostridium difficile colitis is a further distinct complication of antibiotic administration. Treatment options for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea and Clostridium difficile colitis include supplementation with several types of probiotics, as overviewed in this paper. Three randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trials show a therapeutic effect of Saccharomyces boulardii in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. The efficacy of Lactobacillus acidophilus and bulgaricus has also been ascertained in two double-blind controlled studies. Other studies focusing on Lactobacillus as a new preventive agent for antibiotic-associated diarrhoea are not double-blind. Among these, a positive effect of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium longum and Enterococcus faecium SF68 has been reported. Effectiveness of probiotics in antibiotic-associated diarrhoea has, therefore, a consistent scientific rationale, however few studies have performed an assessment of bacterial recovery in stools, and this approach may be helpful in deciding a more rigorous dose standardisation.
TI  - Design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  - An oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. The 16S rDNA sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. Three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. Cyanine5 (CY5)-labeled 16S rDNAs were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from human fecal samples or bacterial DNA using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. The 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides vulgatus, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides distasonis, Clostridium clostridiiforme, Clostridium leptum, Fusobacterium prausnitzii, Peptostreptococcus productus, Ruminococcus obeum, Ruminococcus bromii, Ruminococcus callidus, Ruminococcus albus, Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Bifidobacterium infantis, Eubacterium biforme, Eubacterium aerofaciens, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecium. The two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16S rDNA from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. The hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
TI  - Characterization of a cryptic plasmid from Lactobacillus fermentum KC5b and its use for constructing a stable Lactobacillus cloning vector.
AB  - Lactobacillus fermentum KC5b, a strain originally isolated from the human vagina, contains a cryptic plasmid pKC5b. The sequence and genetic organization of the 4392-bp plasmid were determined. It contains two convergently oriented replicons, which are homologous to each other and to the stable replicon of the Enterococcus faecium plasmid pMBB1. The two replicons of pKC5b were used either individually or together to construct Lactobacillus-Escherichia coli shuttle plasmids. Only the plasmid pSP1 that carried both replicons transformed lactobacilli, suggesting a complementary function between the two replicons. Since the replicons had a high homology to those of other plasmids that replicate via a theta-like mechanism and no detectable single-stranded intermediates were found for the plasmid, it is possible that pKC5b may replicate via a theta-like mechanism. The new shuttle plasmid pSP1 has been transformed and stably maintained in several Lactobacillus strains. As an initial application, pSP1 was used to clone the S-layer protein gene (slpA) of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4356 into a heterologous vaginal Lactobacillus strain and achieved surface-bound expression of the protein.
TI  - Characterisation of IS153, an IS3-family insertion sequence isolated from Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  - An insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis DSM 20451T as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. The sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfA and orfB, from which three putative proteins are produced. OrfAB is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf A and orf B that is presumed to be the transposase. The large orfAB of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the IS3 family. In L. sanfranciscensis type strain DSM 20451T multiple truncated IS elements were identified. Inverse PCR was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly AT rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. Moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. Multiple copies of IS153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of L. sanfranciscensis. Resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16S rDNA. With a PCR based approach IS153 or highly similar sequences were detected in L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. malefermentans, L. plantarum, L. hilgardii, L. collinoides L. farciminis L. sakei and L. salivarius, L. reuteri as well as in Enterococcus faecium, Pediococcus acidilactici and P. pentosaceus.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against oral microorganisms.
AB  - Bakuchiol was isolated from the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, a tree native to China with various uses in traditional medicine, followed by extraction with ether and column chromatography combined with silica gel and octyldecyl silane. In this study, the antimicrobial activities of bakuchiol against some oral microorganisms were evaluated in vitro. The cell growth of Streptococcus mutans was inhibited in a bakuchiol concentration-dependent manner, and growth of S. mutans was completely prevented by 20 microg of bakuchiol per ml. The bactericidal effect of bakuchiol on S. mutans was dependent on temperature and stable under the following conditions: sucrose, 0 to 10% (wt/vol); pH, 3.0 to 7.0; organic acids (3% [wt/vol] citric and malic acids). Bakuchiol showed bactericidal effects against all bacteria tested, including S. mutans, Streptococcus sanguis, Streptococcus salivarius, Streptococcus sobrinus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Actinomyces viscosus, and Porphyromonas gingivalis, with MICs ranging from 1 to 4 microg/ml and the sterilizing concentration for 15 min ranging from 5 to 20 microg/ml. Furthermore, bakuchiol was also effective against adherent cells of S. mutans in water-insoluble glucan in the presence of sucrose and inhibited the reduction of pH in the broth. Thus, bakuchiol would be a useful compound for development of antibacterial agents against oral pathogens and has great potential for use in food additives and mouthwash for preventing and treating dental caries.
TI  - Biotherapeutic agents in the treatment of infectious diarrhea.
AB  - Biotherapeutic agents offer unique advantages over traditional treatments for infectious diarrhea, and several have been shown to be effective (Table 4). These therapeutic microbial agents are most effective in types of infectious diseases that are associated with a disruption of the normal intestinal microecology (e.g., AAD, C. difficile disease). The impact of biotherapeutic agents on rotaviral diarrhea is of special clinical importance because this is the most common cause of pediatric diarrhea, and there is no defined treatment. Strong efforts need to be made to limit antibiotic exposure in children. Biotherapeutic agents offer a safe and effective nonantibiotic method of treating this important pathogen, especially after the withdrawal of a rotaviral vaccine from the market by the FDA. However, for many biotherapeutic agents, well-done, placebo-controlled trials still are lacking, and not all types of infectious diarrhea respond to these agents. Continued research in this innovative therapeutic area is warranted.
TI  - Probiotics: "living drugs".
AB  - The uses, mechanisms of action, and safety of probiotics are discussed. Probiotics are live microorganisms or microbial mixtures administered to improve the patient's microbial balance, particularly the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and the vagina. The yeast Saccharomyces boulardii and the bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus, strain GG, have shown efficacy in clinical trials for the prevention of antimicrobial-associated diarrhea. Other probiotics that have demonstrated at least some promise as prophylaxis for this type of diarrhea are Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. The use of S. boulardii as an adjunctive treatment to therapy with metronidazole or vancomycin has been found in controlled studies to decrease further recurrences of Clostridium difficile-associated disease. Other gastrointestinal disorders for which probiotics have been studied include traveler's diarrhea, acute infantile diarrhea, and acute diarrhea in adults. Several Lactobacillus species given in yogurt or in tablet or suppository form have shown clinical efficacy as a treatment for vaginal infections. Lactobacillus strains have also been examined as a treatment for urinary-tract infections. Putative mechanisms of action of probiotics include production of pathogen-inhibitory substances, inhibition of pathogen attachment, inhibition of the action of microbial toxins, stimulation of immunoglobulin A, and trophic effects on intestinal mucosa. The available probiotics are considered nonpathogenic, but even benign microorganisms can be infective when a patient is severely debilitated or immunosuppressed. Probiotics have demonstrated an ability to prevent and treat some infections. Effective use of probiotics could decrease patients' exposure to antimicrobials. Additional controlled studies are needed to clearly define the safety and efficacy of these agents.
TI  - Adsorption effect of activated charcoal on enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli.
AB  - The adsorption property of activated charcoal on verotoxin (VT)-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) was examined using E. coli O157:H7. In the present study, E. coli O157:H7 strains were effectively adsorbed by activated charcoal. Adsorption was dose-dependent, and the maximum adsorption occurred within 5 min. At 10 mg of activated charcoal, bacteria tested were completely adsorbed. Activated charcoal also had the capacity to adsorb toxin (verotoxin 2) activity from the bacterial extract. Furthermore, the adsorption efficiency of activated charcoal for the normal bacterial flora in the intestine was assessed using Enterococcus faecium, Bifidobacterium thermophilum, and Lactobacillus acidophilus. Activated charcoal showed lower binding capacity to the normal bacterial flora tested than that to E. coli O157:H7 strains. These results suggest that activated charcoal could be a good adsorbent system for the removal of VTEC and verotoxin.
TI  - Evaluation of the components of a commercial probiotic in gnotobiotic mice experimentally challenged with Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica ser. Typhimurium.
AB  - Vitacanis((R)), a probiotic preparation containing a Lactobacillus acidophilus, an Enterococcus faecium and a Saccharomyces cerevisiae, has been developed for the prevention of intestinal disorders in dogs and cats. In the present study, these microorganisms were tested jointly or singly during experimental infection of gnotobiotic mice with Salmonella Typhimurium. Four experimental groups consisting of animals given probiotics jointly or singly and a control group consisting of germfree mice were used. The groups were treated with one or three of the microorganisms (experimental) or PBS (control) 10 days before intragastric challenge with a suspension containing about 10(2) cells of the bacterial pathogen. A higher survival (P<0.05) was observed in gnotobiotic mice given E. faecium (82%). All the animals in the other groups died after the challenge but the survival time was longer (P<0.05) for groups given all three of the microorganisms (7.4+/-2.4 days) or given only L. acidophilus (7.2+/-2.9 days) than for the control mice (4.4+/-1.1 days) and the mice that received S. cerevisiae (4.9+/-1.6 days) mice. The survival data agreed with the histopathological findings which showed more severe liver and intestinal lesions in control mice and in mice given Saccharomyces. In vitro antagonistic assays showed inhibition growth of E. faecium and S. Typhimurium around the colonies of L. acidophilus and for S. Typhimurium around the colonies of E. faecium. However, in vivo, S. Typhimurium became similarly established in the digestive tract of gnotobiotic mice at levels ranging from 10(8) to 10(10)CFU/g of feces and remained at these high levels until the animals died or were sacrificed. Among the three probiotic components of the commercial product Vitacanis((R)), E. faecium was the only one that provided protection against challenge with S. Typhimurium. Protection was not due to the reduction of the intestinal populations of the pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Treatment and prevention of antibiotic associated diarrhea.
AB  - Mild or severe episodes of antibiotic-associated diarrhea (AAD) are common side effects of antibiotic therapy. The incidence of AAD differs with the antibiotic and varies from 5 to 25%. The major form of intestinal disorders is the pseudomembranous colitis associated with Clostridium difficile which occurs in 10-20% of all AAD. In most cases of AAD discontinuation or replacement of the inciting antibiotic by another drug with lower AAD risk can be effective. For more severe cases involving C. difficile, the treatment of diarrhea requires an antibiotic treatment, with glycopeptides (vancomycin) or metronidazole. Another approach to AAD treatment or prevention is based on the use of non-pathogenic living organisms, capable of re-establishing the equilibrium of the intestinal ecosystem. Several organisms have been used in treatment or prophylaxis of AAD such as selected strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium longum, and Enterococcus faecium. Another biotherapeutic agent, a non-pathogenic yeast, Saccharomyces boulardii has been used. In animal models of C. difficile colitis initiated by clindamycin, animals treated with S. boulardii (at end of vancomycin therapy) had a significant decrease in C. difficile colony-forming units, and of toxin B production. In several clinical randomised trials (versus placebo), S. boulardii has demonstrated its effectiveness by decreasing significantly the occurrence of C. difficile colitis and preventing the pathogenic effects of toxins A and B of C. difficile. It has been shown to be a safe and effective therapy in relapses of C. difficile colitis. A good response has been seen in children with AAD, treated by S. boulardii only. In ICUs prevention of AAD remains based on limitation of antibiotic overuse and spread of C. difficile or other agents of AAD should be prevented by improved hygiene measures (single rooms, private bathrooms for patients, use of gloves and hand washing for personnel). In addition the increasing use of biotherapeutic agents such as S. boulardii should permit the prevention of the major side effect of antibiotics, i.e. AAD in at risk patients.
TI  - [AF, a new bacterial preparation based on lactobacilli and its biological properties].
AB  - A highly efficient bacterial composition "AF" which includes representatives of two genera of microorganisms Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus has been created as a result of analysis of biological properties of a number of strains of lactic-acid bacteria. Their biological properties--antagonistic activity in respect to pathogenic and conditionally pathogenic microorganisms, ability to adhesion and function in the intestine, sensitivity to antibiotics, etc., have been studied in the laboratory conditions. Prospects of the use of the given composition in production of milk products of functional effects have been shown.
TI  - [The antibacterial resistance of the strains making up the components of probiotic preparations].
AB  - The spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of 21 strains of normal microflora, mainly forming constituents of widely used probiotics to 25 antibacterial preparations. Lactobacillus spp. were prevalent in the strains under test. The spectrum of the antibiotic resistance of lactobacilli varied, the gradation of resistance being more pronounced with respect to strains and not species. Both highly sensitive and highly resistant Lactobacillus strains were found: L. acidophilus (a component of biopreparation "Linex"), L. plantarum 8RA3, L. fermentum 90T4C (probiotic "Lactobacterin"), L. fermentum BL96. Bacteria used as the components of combined preparation "Linex" exhibited the highest resistance to a number of modern antibiotics. Strains of bifidobacteria were found to be highly sensitive to antibiotics.
TI  - Effect of 8 week intake of probiotic milk products on risk factors for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of a probiotic milk product containing the culture CAUSIDO(R) and of two alternative products on risk factors for cardiovascular disease in overweight and obese subjects. DESIGN: An 8 week randomized, double-blind, placebo- and compliance-controlled, parallel study. SUBJECTS: Seventy healthy, weight-stable, overweight and obese (25.0<BMI<37.5 kg/m2) males (n=20) and females (n=50), 18-55 y old, were randomly assigned into five groups. INTERVENTION: Four groups consumed 450 ml fermented milk products (yoghurt) daily. Group 1: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (StLa). Group 2: a placebo yoghurt fermented with delta-acid-lactone (PY). Group 3: a yoghurt fermented with two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and one strain of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (StLr). Group 4: a yoghurt fermented with one strain of Enterococcus faecium and two strains of Streptococcus thermophilus (CAUSIDO(R) culture), GAIO(R) (G). The dietary composition of the yoghurt was otherwise similar. The fifth group was given two placebo pills (PP) daily. RESULTS: When comparing all five treatment groups, unadjusted for changes in body weight, no statistical effects were observed in week 8 in the G-group on low density lipoproteins (LDL)-cholesterol (P=0.29). After adjustment for small changes in body weight, LDL-cholesterol decreased by 8.4% (0.26+/-0.10 mmol/l; P<0.05) and fibrinogen increased (0.74+/-0.32 mmol/l; P<0.05) after 8 weeks in the G-group. This was significantly different from the group consuming chemically fermented yoghurt and the group consuming placebo pills (P<0.05). After 8 weeks, systolic blood pressure was significantly more reduced in the StLa and G-group compared to StLr. No other differences were found. CONCLUSION: The CAUSIDO(R) culture reduced LDL-cholesterol and increased fibrinogen in the overweight subjects at a 450 ml consumption daily for 8 weeks. The effect on LDL-cholesterol confirms previous studies. An immunostimulation by one of the strains in the product might explain the effect on fibrinogen in the G-group.

TI  - Effects of probiotic bacteria on diarrhea, lipid metabolism, and carcinogenesis:  a review of papers published between 1988 and 1998.
AB  - We reviewed the evidence from human intervention studies for the health effects of probiotic bacteria, ie, live bacteria that survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract and have beneficial effects on the host. Of the 49 studies reviewed, 26 dealt with the prevention or treatment of diarrheal disease, 9 with the prevention of cancer or of the formation of carcinogens, 7 with the lowering of serum cholesterol, and 7 with the stimulation of the immune system. The most widely studied probiotic bacteria were Lactobacillus GG (22 studies), Lactobacillus acidophilus (16 studies), Bifidobacterium bifidum (6 studies), and Enterococcus faecium (7 studies). Intake of Lactobacillus GG consistently shortened the diarrheal phase of rotavirus infection by 1 d. However, evidence for the prevention by Lactobacillus GG and other probiotics of diarrhea due to viral or bacterial infections was less strong. Effects of probiotics on the immune system are inconclusive because of the variety of outcome variables reported. Cholesterol lowering by L. acidophilus was shown in some but not all studies; cholesterol lowering by E. faecium seems to be transient. Two studies of one research group showed a smaller recurrence of bladder tumors in patients after treatment with Lactobacillus casei; these results await confirmation. The production of mutagens after a meal might be reduced by the concomitant intake of probiotics, but the relevance of this finding is unclear. In conclusion, consumption of foods containing Lactobacillus GG may shorten the course of rotavirus infection. Other health effects of probiotic bacteria have not been well established. Well-designed placebo-controlled studies with validated outcome variables are needed to determine the health effects of probiotics.
TI  - Growth of a human intestinal Desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  - Ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (SRB) Desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). Reproducible defined bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: Bifidobacterium longum, Bif. adolescentis, Bif. pseudolongum, Bif. infantis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Bact. vulgatus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Cl. butyricum, Cl. innocuum, Cl. bifermentans. Lactobacillus and Cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. Inclusion of Des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly Bif. longum, Cl. perfringens and Bif. pseudolongum. The two bacteroides species were unaffected by Des. desulfuricans, while numbers of Cl. butyricum increased. Extensive wall growth developed in the SRB culture, consisting mainly of Des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), Bact. thetaiotaomicron and Bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, Cl. perfringens and Bif. longum. Wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures. Chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (C15) and bifidobacterial (C18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-C15:0, C16:0, i-C17:1) could be identified. The metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the SRB chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. High concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were detected in the SRB chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. Saccharolytic organisms growing in the SRB fermenter utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. Profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the SRB culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic and Salmonella typhimurium-Specific antibodies on the colonization of Salmonella typhimurium in broilers.
AB  - Salmonella typhimurium colonizes the intestinal tract of poultry and causes food-borne illness in humans. Reduction of S. typhimurium colonization in the intestinal tract of poultry reduces potential carcass contamination during slaughter. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of an avian-specific probiotic and S. typhimurium-specific antibodies on the colonization of S. typhimurium in broilers and on body weights. Broiler chicks were spray-vaccinated at the hatchery with the commercial product. Avian Pac Plus, which contains Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, ad S. typhimurium-specific antibodies. At placement, these chicks were administered Avian Pac plus in the water. Six hours postplacement, chicks were orally challenged with 1.8 x 10 (7) CFU of S. typhimurium. Chicks were administered Avian Pac Plus for two additional days postchallenge. Chicks were evaluated for S. typhimurium colonization and shedding every 3 to 4 days for the first 2 weeks and every 7 days for 6 weeks. The mean cecal and colonic concentration of S. typhimurium from the Avian Pac Plus-treated group was significantly lower at day 31 (P = 0.0001), day 38 (P = 0.0005), and day 43 (P = 0.0001) than the nontreated control group. These results indicated that a combination of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Streptococcus faecium, and S typhimurium-specific antibodies have a beneficial effect in reducing the colonization of S. typhimurium in market-aged broilers.
TI  - Taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The current taxonomy of probiotic lactic acid bacteria is reviewed with special focus on the genera Lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Enterococcus. The physiology and taxonomic position of species and strains of these genera were investigated by phenotypic and genomic methods. In total, 176 strains, including the type strains, have been included. Phenotypic methods applied were based on biochemical, enzymatical and physiological characteristics, including growth temperatures, cell wall analysis and analysis of the total soluble cytoplasmatic proteins. Genomic methods used were pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA-PCR (RAPD-PCR) and DNA-DNA hybridization for bifidobacteria. In the genus Lactobacillus the following species of importance as probiotics were investigated: L. acidophilus group, L. casei group and L. reuteri/L. fermentum group. Most strains referred to as L. acidophilus in probiotic products could be identified either as L. gasseri or as L. johnsonii, both members of the L. acidophilus group. A similar situation could be shown in the L. casei group, where most of the strains named L. casei belonged to L. paracasei subspp. A recent proposal to reject the species L. paracasei and to include this species in the restored species L. casei with a neotype strain was supported by protein analysis. Bifidobacterium spp. strains have been reported to be used for production of fermented dairy and recently of probiotic products. According to phenotypic features and confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization most of the bifidobacteria strains from dairy origin belonged to B. animalis, although they were often declared as B. longum by the manufacturer. From the genus Enterococcus, probiotic Ec. faecium strains were investigated with regard to the vanA-mediated resistance against glycopeptides. These unwanted resistances could be ruled out by analysis of the 39 kDa resistance protein. In conclusion, the taxonomy and physiology of probiotic lactic acid bacteria can only be understood by using polyphasic taxonomy combining morphological, biochemical and physiological characteristics with molecular-based phenotypic and genomic techniques.
TI  - Evaluation of an avian-specific probiotic to reduce the colonization and shedding of Campylobacter jejuni in broilers.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni has often been responsible for human gastroenteritis. Poultry have often been implicated as a source for these human infections. Intestinal colonization of C. jejuni in the chicken plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. Thus, reducing C. jejuni colonization in chickens can potentially reduce the incidence of C. jejuni infections in humans. The use of probiotics to competitively exclude the colonization of intestinal pathogens has been proposed for poultry. Hence, the purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of an avian-specific probiotic containing Lactobacillus acidophilus and Streptococcus faecium for reducing the shedding and colonization of C. jejuni in the chicken intestinal tract. Day-old chicks were randomly allocated into either a probiotic-treated group or a control group. The treated group was given probiotic from day 1 to day 3, and the control group was not given any probiotic. Six hours after the first oral administration of probiotics (treatment) or double distilled water (control), these chicks were challenged with C. jejuni. The frequency of the C. jejuni shedding was monitored until market age. Intestinal colonization was determined for the two experimental groups at slaughter. Results indicated that chickens given probiotics from day 1 to day 3 had a 70% reduction in the frequency of C. jejuni shedding in colonized chicks (P = 0.0001) and a 27% reduction in jejunal colonization in colonized chicks (P = 0.0001) at slaughter when compared with the control group. Thus, the use of the avian-specific probiotic containing L. acidophilus and S. faecium can reduce the colonization and frequency of fecal shedding of C. jejuni in market-aged broilers.
TI  - A microbiology investigation on probiotic pharmaceutical products used for human  health.
AB  - Many and different probiotic pharmaceutical products are presently commercialised in the world. On this regard, a microbiological investigation was carried out to screen the microorganisms incorporated into these products, commonly used for human health. After determination of the cell number and viability of bacteria, several experiments were performed in vitro in order to characterise the microorganisms and to evaluate their probiotic value. Among all the strains identified, best results were obtained with Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Enterococcus faecium and Saccharomyces cerevisiae as far as regards growth rates, pH and bile salts tolerance. Moreover, the identification profiles of microorganisms showed a better reliability for the products containing a single species whereas the ones composed of different strains were usually not satisfactory. In some cases, the presence of Lactobacillus and Saccharomyces species was in disagreement with the claimed composition of the product and some species of lactobacilli, bifidobacteria and streptococci were found not viable. In defined mixed cultures experiments, the antagonism of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecium versus Yersinia enterocolitica was demonstrated and explained as acid and/or antimicrobials production.
TI  - Pharmaceutical probiotics for the treatment of anaerobic and other infections.
AB  - Pharmaceutical probiotics have been used as alternative treatments or preventative therapies for a variety of clinical diseases. The overuse of antibiotics and emergence of multiple-antibiotic resistant pathogens has refocused clinical attention on the field of probiotics. Anaerobic infections which seem to respond well to probiotics are infections which involve the disruption of normal microbial flora. Gastrointestinal infections (travelers' diarrhea, antibiotic-associated diarrhea,Clostridium difficile disease, rotavirus diarrhea) have been studied using the following pharmaceutical probiotics:Saccharomyces boulardii, Lactobacillus casei GG, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Streptococcus thermophilus and Enterococcus faecium. Vaginitis has been experimentally studied using L. acidophilus and L. casei GG. The efficacy, safety and mechanisms of action of these various probiotics are reviewed. Requirements for drug approval are similar for biologic probiotics and new drug entities and these requirements involve preclinical tolerability studies, pharmacokinetic studies and large, well-controlled blinded clinical trials.
TI  - Biotherapeutic agents. A neglected modality for the treatment and prevention of selected intestinal and vaginal infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the potential of biotherapeutic agents (microorganisms with therapeutic properties) for the prevention and/or treatment of selected intestinal and vaginal infections. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE database was searched for all relevant articles published between 1966 and September 1995. Search terms used were biotherapeutic agent, probiotic, Lactobacillus, Saccharomyces, Bifidobacterium, Candida, gastrointestinal- system, vaginitis, vaginosis-bacterial, and related terms. The bibliographies of obtained articles were also reviewed. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All placebo-controlled human studies on biotherapeutic agents were reviewed. English-language open trials, case series and reports, and animal studies were reviewed only if they were especially relevant to providing information on the potential efficacy, adverse effects, or mechanisms of action of these agents. DATA SYNTHESIS: Placebo-controlled studies have shown that biotherapeutic agents have been used successfully to prevent antibiotic-associated diarrhea (Lactobacillus caseiGG, bifidobacterium longum, B longum with L acidophilus, and Saccharomyces boulardii), to prevent acute infantile diarrhea (Bifidobacterium bifidum with Streptococcus thermophilus), to treat recurrent Clostridium difficile disease (S boulardii), and to treat various other diarrheal illnesses (Enterococcus faecium SF68, L caseiGG, and S boulardii). There is also evidence for Lactobacillus acidophilus in the prevention of candidal vaginitis. Few adverse effects have been reported. However, many of the studies tested only small numbers of patients or volunteers. CONCLUSIONS: There is now evidence that administration of selected microorganisms is beneficial in the prevention and treatment of certain intestinal and, possibly, treatment of vaginal infections. In an effort to decrease the reliance on antimicrobials, the time has come to carefully explore the therapeutic applications of biotherapeutic agents.
TI  - Development of RAPD protocol for typing of strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci.
AB  - A protocol for typing strains of lactic acid bacteria and enterococci based on randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fragments has been developed. Using a single 10-mer primer, fingerprints were achieved without the need to isolate genomic DNA. Different conditions of DNA release and amplification were investigated in order to obtain reproducible results and high discrimination among strains. This RAPD protocol was successfully applied for the typing of strains belonging to the species Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. helveticus, Lact. casei, Lact. reuteri, Lact. plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis, Ent. faecium and Streptococcus thermophilus.
TI  - In vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of Salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
AB  - In vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against Salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of Bifidobacterium bifidum, Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus casei, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus sp., and Salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (FOS-50 or FOS pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. Thirteen bacteria (two strains of Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus subtilis, B. bifidum, E. faecium, two strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus, L. casei, Pediococcus sp., Propionibacterium acidopropionici, P. jensenii, and Propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six Salmonella serotypes (S. california, S. enteritidis, S. heidelberg, S. mission, S. senftenberg, and S. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. Bifidobacterium bifidum, E. faecium, all lactobacilli, and Pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all Salmonella serotypes. In the growth experiments, E. faecium, L. lactis, and Pediococcus sp. grew in media with either FOS-50 or the pure formulation of FOS as the sole carbohydrate source. All tested Salmonella serotypes utilized FOS-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. In contrast, none of the Salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of FOS as the only carbohydrate source.
TI  - Microbiological evaluation of jejunal aspirates and faecal samples after oral administration of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - A double-blind placebo controlled investigation was carried out to study the effect of peroral colonization. Human volunteers were given mixtures of bifidobacteria and lactic acid bacteria. Measurements were made over a 1 week treatment period and for another week after the end of the treatment. Two different bacteriological preparations were used, one consisted of Enterococcus faecium and Bifidobacterium longum (a total of 6.4 x 10(8) cfu d-1); the other consisted of Lactobacillus acidophilus, Bif. bifidum, Lact. delbrueckii ssp. bulgaricus, and Streptococcus thermophilus (a total of 9 x 10(9) cfu d-1). Together with a placebo preparation, they were given to 24 healthy controls (eight in each group). Microbiological examinations of jejunal aspirates showed that viable counts of most species were below the detection limit. However, the test preparation containing Ent. faecium and Bif. longum significantly reduced the anaerobe: aerobe ratio in faeces by a factor of three during treatment (P = 0.03), and increased it by a factor of 30 during the following week (P < 0.02). This study shows that peroral administration of certain bacterial cultures may affect the distal intestinal microflora.
TI  - Serum cholesterol levels in axenic mice colonized with Enterococcus faecium and Lactobacillus acidophilus.
AB  - Hypocholesterolemic effect was shown in axenic, mono, bicolonized and conventional mice: the effect was different depending on probiotic properties of intestinal microorganisms. Contamination by Enterococcus faecium CX determined the highest effect: haematic cholesterol level decrease was 16.9% in females and 7.8% in males. In mice contaminated by Lactobacillus acidophilus N5 the decrease of haematic cholesterol levels was less and not relevant in mice contaminated by conventional microflora. Enterococcus faecium CX and Lactobacillus acidophilus N5 strains were able to grow in presence of bile salts, to colonize intestinal tract, to survive at gastric conditions and to assimilate cholesterol (E. faecium more than L. acidophilus). The authors consider the possibility to associate probiotic strains with these characteristics for the health of consumers.

TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of Lactobacillus products used for colonization of  the vagina.
AB  - Lactobacilli have long been considered to be the protective flora in the vagina.  Women with vaginal infections have used various non-prescription products in an attempt to restore their normal vaginal flora. Products that contain lactobacilli include dairy products (yogurt, acidophilus milk) and commercially available Lactobacillus powders and tablets. Recently, Lactobacillus species that produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) have been associated with normal vaginal flora. In this study, we compared 16 non-prescription products containing lactobacilli for H2O2 production, purity, and identifiable contaminants. All 16 products contained lactobacilli, of which ten (62%) produced H2O2. At least one contaminant was detected in 11 of 16 (69%) of the products: Enterococcus faecium (ten), Clostridium sporogenes (one), Streptococcus mitis (one), and Pseudomonas species (one). Although all of the products tested contained lactobacilli, only four of the products contained Lactobacillus acidophilus. Most of the lactobacilli-containing products currently available either do not contain the Lactobacillus species advertised and/or contain other bacteria of questionable benefit. We conclude that commercially available products may not be appropriate for recolonization of the vagina.
