TI  == differentiation of bacterial 16s rrna genes and intergenic regions and mycobacterium tuberculosis katg genes by structure-specific endonuclease cleavage.
AB  == we describe here a new approach for analyzing nucleic acid sequences using a structure-specific endonuclease, cleavase i. we have applied this technique to the detection and localization of mutations associated with isoniazid resistance  in mycobacterium tuberculosis and for differentiating bacterial genera, species and strains. the technique described here is based on the observation that single strands of dnas can assume defined conformations, which can be detected and cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases such as cleavase i. the patterns of fragments produced are characteristic of the sequences responsible for the structure, so that each dna has its own structural fingerprint. amplicons, containing either a single 5'-fluorescein or 5'-tetramethyl rhodamine label were  generated from a 620-bp segment of the katg gene of isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive m. tuberculosis, the 5' 350 bp of the 16s rrna genes of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella arizonae, shigella sonnei, shigella dysenteriae, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus, hominis, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus aureus and an approximately 550-bp dna segment comprising the intergenic region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella  arizonae, shigella sonnei, and shigella dysenteriae serotypes 1, 2, and 8. changes in the structural fingerprints of dna fragments derived from the katg genes of isoniazid-resistant m. tuberculosis isolates were clearly identified and could be mapped to the site of the actual mutation relative to the labeled end. bland patterns which clearly differentiated bacteria to the level of genus and, in some cases, species were generated from the 16s genes. cleavase i analysis of  the intergenic regions of salmonella and shigella species differentiated genus, species, and serotypes. structural fingerprinting by digestion with cleavase i is a rapid, simple, and sensitive method for analyzing nucleic acid sequences and may find wide utility in microbial analysis.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.
