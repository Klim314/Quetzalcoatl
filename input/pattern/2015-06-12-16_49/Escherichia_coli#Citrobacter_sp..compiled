TI  - Locus of enterocyte effacement: a pathogenicity island involved in the virulence  of enteropathogenic and enterohemorragic Escherichia coli subjected to a complex network of gene regulation.
AB  - The locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) is a 35.6 kb pathogenicity island inserted in the genome of some bacteria such as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic E.coli, Citrobacter rodentium, and Escherichia albertii. LEE comprises the genes responsible for causing attaching and effacing lesions, a characteristic lesion that involves intimate adherence of bacteria to enterocytes, a signaling cascade leading to brush border and microvilli destruction, and loss of ions, causing severe diarrhea. It is composed of 41 open reading frames and five major operons encoding a type three system apparatus, secreted proteins, an adhesin, called intimin, and its receptor called translocated intimin receptor (Tir). LEE is subjected to various levels of regulation, including transcriptional and posttranscriptional regulators located both inside and outside of the pathogenicity island. Several molecules were described being related to feedback inhibition, transcriptional activation, and transcriptional repression. These molecules are involved in a complex network of regulation, including mechanisms such as quorum sensing and temporal control of LEE genes transcription and translation. In this mini review we have detailed the complex network that regulates transcription and expression of genes involved in this kind of lesion.
TI  - Identification, cloning and heterologous expression of active [NiFe]-hydrogenase  2 from Citrobacter sp. SG in Escherichia coli.
AB  - Hydrogen (H2) is a potential alternative energy carrier which only produces water and heat upon combustion. Today, industrial hydrogen production mainly uses thermochemical processes based on fossil fuels or electrolysis of water. Therefore, biotechnological approaches to produce H2 from biomass are an interesting alternative. We introduce here a novel direct hydrogen measurement system using a semiconducting device specific for hydrogen detection. Using this device, a bacterium producing considerable amounts of hydrogen under aerobic cultivation was isolated and identified by 16S ribosomal DNA sequencing as Citrobacter sp. The enzyme responsible for the observed hydrogenase activity was partially purified by 3 chromatographic purification steps and could be identified by peptide mass fingerprinting to be a type 2 [NiFe]-hydrogenase. Expression of the [NiFe]-hydrogenase 2 containing operon from Citrobacter sp. SG in Escherichia coli allowed recombinant hydrogen production. The [NiFe]-hydrogenase 2 identified here may be useful for biotechnological hydrogen production. We speculate that the expression of the hydrogenase in Citrobacter may be an adaptation to growth in acidic conditions.
TI  - Screening of the novel colicinogenic gram-negative rods against pathogenic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - PURPOSE: Escherichia coli (E. coli) O157:H7 is gram-negative enteric pathogen producing different types of Shiga toxin. This bacterium is the most corporate cause of haemorrhagic colitis in human. Administration of antibiotics (particularly sulfa drugs) against this pathogen is a debatable topic as this may increase the risk of uremic syndrome; especially in children and aged people. Around the world, microbiologists are in search of alternative therapeutic methods specially probiotics against this pathogen. In the present study, we have focused on the investigation of alternate bio-therapeutics (probiotics) for the treatment of patients infected with E. coli O157:H7. This study is based on the identification of colicin-producing gram-negative bacteria (particularly enterobacteriaceae) which can competently exclude E. coli O157:H7 from the gut of the infected individual. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Hundred samples from human, animal faeces and septic tank water were analysed for nonpathogenic gram-negative rods (GNRs). RESULTS: Out of these samples, 175 isolates of GNRs were checked for their activity against E. coli O157:H7. Only 47 isolates inhibited the growth of E. coli O157:H7, among which majority were identified as E. coli. These E. coli strains were found to be the efficient producers of colicin. Some of the closely related species i. e., Citrobacter sp, Pantoea sp. and Kluyvera sp. also showed considerable colicinogenic activity. Moreover, colicinogenic species were found to be nonhaemolytic, tolerant to acidic environment (pH 3) and sensitive to commonly used antibiotics. CONCLUSION: Nonhaemolytic, acid tolerant and sensitive to antibiotics suggests the possible use of these circulating endothelial cells (CEC) as inexpensive and inoffensive therapeutic agent (probiotics) in E. coli O157:H7 infections.
TI  - Characterization of Beta-lactamases in Faecal Enterobacteriaceae Recovered from Healthy Humans in Spain: Focusing on AmpC Polymorphisms.
AB  - The intestinal tract is a huge reservoir of Enterobacteriaceae, some of which are opportunist pathogens. Several genera of these bacteria harbour intrinsic antibiotic resistance genes, such as ampC genes in species of Citrobacter, Enterobacter or Escherichia genera. In this work, beta-lactamases and other resistance mechanisms have been characterized in Enterobacteriaceae isolates recovered from healthy human faecal samples, focusing on the ampC beta-lactamase genes. Fifty human faecal samples were obtained, and 70 Enterobacteriaceae bacteria were isolated: 44 Escherichia coli, 4 Citrobacter braakii, 9 Citrobacter freundii, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 1 Proteus mirabilis, 1 Proteus vulgaris, 1 Klebsiella oxytoca, 1 Serratia sp. and 1 Cronobacter sp. A high percentage of resistance to ampicillin was detected (57 %), observing the AmpC phenotype in 22 isolates (31 %) and the ESBL phenotype in 3 isolates. AmpC molecular characterization showed high diversity into bla CMY and bla ACT genes from Citrobacter and Enterobacter species, respectively, and the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis demonstrated low clonality among them. The prevalence of people colonized by strains carrying plasmid-mediated ampC genes obtained in this study was 2 %. The unique plasmid-mediated bla AmpC identified in this study was the bla CMY-2 gene, detected in an E. coli isolate ascribed to the sequence type ST405 which belonged to phylogenetic group D. The hybridization and conjugation experiments demonstrated that the ISEcp1-bla CMY-2-blc structure was carried by a ~78-kb self-transferable IncK plasmid. This study shows a high polymorphism among beta-lactamase genes in Enterobacteriaceae from healthy people microbiota. Extensive AmpC-carrier studies would provide important information and could allow the anticipation of future global health problems.
TI  - Selective oxidation of glycerol to 1,3-dihydroxyacetone by covalently immobilized glycerol dehydrogenases with higher stability and lower product inhibition.
AB  - Glycerol dehydrogenase (GlyDH) catalyzes the regioselective oxidation of glycerol to yield 1,3-dihydroxyacetone (DHA); an important building block in chemical industry. Three recombinant GlyDHs from Geobacillus stearothermophilus, from Citrobacter braakii and from Cellulomonas sp. were stabilized by covalent immobilization. The highest activity recoveries (40-50%) of the insoluble preparations were obtained by immobilizing these enzymes in presence of polyethylene glycol (PEG). Noteworthy, these immobilized preparations were more stable and less inhibited by DHA than their soluble counterparts. In particular, GlyDH from G.stearothermophilus immobilized on agarose activated with both amine and glyoxyl groups and crosslinked with dextran aldehyde was 3.7-fold less inhibited by DHA than its soluble form and retained 100% of its initial activity after 18h of incubation at 65 degrees C and pH 7. This is one of the few examples where the same immobilization protocol has minimized enzyme product inhibition and maximized thermal stability.
TI  - Molecular detection of ESBLs production and antibiotic resistance patterns in Gram negative bacilli isolated from urinary tract infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: beta-lactam resistance is more prevalent in Gram negative bacterial isolates worldwide, particularly in developing countries. In order to provide data relating to antibiotic therapy and resistance control, routine monitoring of corresponding antibiotic resistance genes is necessary. AIMS: The aim of this study was the characterization of beta-lactam resistance genes and its plasmid profile in bacteria isolated from urinary tract infection samples. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this study, 298 Gram negative bacteria isolated from 6739 urine specimens were identified by biochemical standard tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by the disk diffusion method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing strains were also detected by the double-disk synergy test. The presence of blaTEM and blaSHV genes in the strains studied was ascertained by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Of all Gram negative bacteria, Escherichia coli (69.1%) was the most common strain, followed by Klebsiella sp. (12.1%), Enterobacter sp. (8.4%), Proteus sp. (4.4%), Citrobacter (4%) and Pseudomonas sp. (2%). The most antibiotic resistance was shown to tetracycline (95.16%), nalidixic acid (89.78%) and gentamycin (73.20%) antibiotics. Among all the strains tested, 35 isolates (11.75%) expressed ESBL activity. The prevalence of TEM and SHV positivity among these isolates was 34.29%, followed by TEM (31.43%), TEM and SHV negativity (20.0%) and SHV (14.29%), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Regular monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance seems necessary to improve our guidelines in the use of the empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. METHODS: Cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in Brooklyn, NY. As a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. Screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR method. RESULTS: Of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. Cephalosporin-resistant Citrobacter freundii (n = 3), Escherichia coli (n = 2), and Enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not from control sites. One isolate of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated VIM-2. Acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6 miles (P = .004). Eleven A baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-PCR and were also related to a known clinical isolate. CONCLUSIONS: Strains of A baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. Finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. The finding of integron-associated VIM-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further vigilance is warranted.
TI  - Microbial diversity and dynamics during the production of May bryndza cheese.
AB  - Diversity and dynamics of microbial cultures were studied during the production of May bryndza cheese, a traditional Slovak cheese produced from unpasteurized ewes' milk. Quantitative culture-based data were obtained for lactobacilli, lactococci, total mesophilic aerobic counts, coliforms, E. coli, staphylococci, coagulase-positive staphylococci, yeasts, fungi and Geotrichum spp. in ewes' milk, curd produced from it and ripened for 0 - 10 days, and in bryndza cheese produced from the curd, in three consecutive batches. Diversity of prokaryotes and eukaryotes in selected stages of the production was studied by non-culture approach based on amplification of 16S rDNA and internal transcribed spacer region, coupled to denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and sequencing. The culture-based data demonstrated an overall trend of growth of the microbial population contributing to lactic acid production and to ripening of the cheese, lactobacilli, lactococci and Geotrichum spp. growing up to densities of 10(8) CFU/g, 10(9) CFU/g and 10(5) CFU/g, respectively, in all three consecutive batches of bryndza cheese. The diversity of bacteria encompassed Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter guillouiae, Acinetobacter sp., Acinetobacter johnsonii, Citrobacter braakii, Clostridium bartlettii, Corynebacterium callunae, Corynebacterium maris, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter asburiae, Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus pallens, Escherichia coli, Haemophilus haemolyticus, Hafnia alvei, Kluyvera cryocrescens, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactococcus garvieae, Lc. lactis subsp. cremoris, Lc. lactis subsp. lactis, "Leuconostoc garlicum", Mannheimia glucosida, Mannheimia haemolytica, Pseudomonas sp., Ps. fluorescens, "Ps. reactans", Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, "Rothia arfidiae", Staphylococcus aureus, Staph. epidermidis, Staph. felis, Staph. pasteuri, Staph. sciuri, Staph. xylosus, Streptococcus parauberis, Str. thermophilus and Variovorax paradoxus. The diversity of yeasts and fungi encompassed Alternaria alternata, "Ascomycete sp.", Aspergillus fumigatus, Beauveria brongniartii, Candida xylopsoci, C. inconspicua, Cladosporium cladosporioides, Debaromyces hansenii, Fomes fomentarius, Galactomyces candidus, Gymnoascus reesii, Chaetomium globosum, Kluyveromyces marxianus, Metarhizium anisopliae, Penicillium aurantiogriseum, P. camemberti, P. freii, P. polonicum, P. viridicatum, Pichia kudriavzevii, Sordaria alcina, Trichosporon lactis and Yarrowia lipolytica.
TI  - Anti-ESBL activity of silver nanoparticles biosynthesized using soil Streptomyces species.
AB  - Emergence of antibiotic resistance by bacteria has become a serious threat for public health worldwide. In this study, Streptomyces isolated from fertile soil sample was tested for biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles (AgNps) using cell-free supernatant and synthesized AgNps were screened for anti-ESBL (extended spectrum b-lactamase) activity against multi-drug resistant (MDR) ESBL-producing strain Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 700603) and other medically important pathogens. Synthesis of AgNps was confirmed by change in pale yellow color to dark brown color and characteristic absorption spectra at 420 nm. The XRD spectrum displayed typical peaks of crystalline silver and EDAX analysis showed a major signal for silver. FTIR spectra revealed prominent peaks at 3,294 cm-1 (NH stretching due to amide group), 2,952 cm-1 (aldehydic C-H stretching) 1,658 cm-1 indicating the presence of carbonyl group. AgNps were spherical in shape with size ranging from 20 to 70 nm. The synthesized AgNps showed significant antimicrobial activity against standard ESBL pathogen K. pneumoniae (22 mm), 21 mm against clinical ESBL isolate E. coli and 16 mm against clinical ESBL isolates K. pneumoniae and Citrobacter species, respectively. The results of this study suggest that AgNps synthesized by Streptomyces sp. VITSJK10 can be used as a potential alternative to control MDR ESBL pathogens. The present study aimed for green synthesis of AgNps using Streptomyces species and to explore its anti-ESBL activity.
TI  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions of gyrA and parC in Enterobacteriaceae isolates from Brazil.
AB  - Mutations in the quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDR) in chromosomal gyrA and parC genes and fluoroquinolone susceptibility profiles were investigated in quinolone-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from community and hospitalized patients in the Brazilian Southeast region. A total of 112 nalidixic acid-resistant enterobacterial isolates collected from 2000 to 2005 were investigated for mutations in the topoisomerases genes gyrA and parC by amplifying and sequencing the QRDR regions. Susceptibility to fluoroquinolones was tested by the agar dilution method. Amongst the 112 enterobacterial isolates, 81 (72.3%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin and 5 (4.5%) showed reduced susceptibility. Twenty-six (23.2%) were susceptible to ciprofloxacin. Several alterations were detected in gyrA and parC genes. Escherichia coli isolates (47.7%) showed double mutations in the gyrA gene and a single one in the parC gene. Two unusual aminoacid substitutions are reported, an Asp87-Asn in a Citrobacter freundii isolate with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones and a Glu84-Ala in one E. coli isolate. Only a parC gene mutation was found in fluoroquinolone-susceptible Enterobacter aerogenes. None of the isolates susceptible to ciprofloxacin presented mutations in topoisomerase genes. This comprehensive analysis of QRDRs in gyrA and parC genes, covering commonly isolated Enterobacteriaceae in Brazil is the largest reported up to now.
TI  - Resistance and inactivation kinetics of bacterial strains isolated from the non-chlorinated and chlorinated effluents of a WWTP.
AB  - The microbiological quality of water from a wastewater treatment plant that uses  sodium hypochlorite as a disinfectant was assessed. Mesophilic aerobic bacteria were not removed efficiently. This fact allowed for the isolation of several bacterial strains from the effluents. Molecular identification indicated that the strains were related to Aeromonas hydrophila, Escherichia coli (three strains), Enterobacter cloacae, Kluyvera cryocrescens (three strains), Kluyvera intermedia, Citrobacter freundii (two strains), Bacillus sp. and Enterobacter sp. The first five strains, which were isolated from the non-chlorinated effluent, were used to test resistance to chlorine disinfection using three sets of variables: disinfectant concentration (8, 20 and 30 mg.L(-1)), contact time (0, 15 and 30 min) and water temperature (20, 25 and 30 degrees C). The results demonstrated that the strains have independent responses to experimental conditions and that the most efficient treatment was an 8 mg.L(-1) dose of disinfectant at a temperature of 20 degrees C for 30 min. The other eight strains, which were isolated from the chlorinated effluent, were used to analyze inactivation kinetics using the disinfectant at a dose of 15 mg.L(-1) with various retention times (0, 10, 20, 30, 60 and 90 min). The results indicated that during the inactivation process, there was no relationship between removal percentage and retention time and that the strains have no common response to the treatments.
TI  - Prevalence of community acquired urinary tract infections in Silchar Medical College, Assam, India and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to know the rate of prevalence of community  acquired UTI infections in both males and females, Assam, North-East India. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 50 mul of urine sample from each of the subjects was streaked on cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient agar medium. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C. Pure, isolated colonies of each type was separately cultured and characterized. The susceptibility of the clinical isolates to routinely prescribed antibiotics in the hospital was performed against various antibiotics. RESULTS: Of the total 40 patients, 26 positive samples were obtained of which 19 females (73.07%) and 7 male (26.92%) patients were shown to be urine culture positive. The most commonly isolated bacterium was Escherichia coli with a frequency rate of (33.3%) followed by Staphyloccous aureus (22.2%), Klebsiella pnemoniae (11.1%), coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (7.4%), Pseudomonas sp. (7.4%), Proteus myxofaciens (3.7%), Proteus mirabilis (3.7%), Edwardsiella tarda (3.7%), Morganella morganii (3.7%), and Citrobacter fruendii (3.7%). Analysis of the samples showed that UTI was more common in females of younger age group as compared with males. It was also observed that the patients responded effectively to imepenem (IE), cepefime, amikacin, norfloxacin, and co-trimoxazole antimicrobial agents against Gram-negative bacilli. Furthermore, the most effective antibiotics against Gram-positive cocci was found to be ampicillin, ciprofloxacin, IE, and penicillin G (benzyl penicillin). CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotics have been in use for a long period and more often the misuse of antimicrobial drugs has today led to a general rise in the emergence of resistant bacteria.
TI  - Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid resistance in fecal Enterobacteriaceae from patients  with cystic fibrosis and healthy siblings.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The present study set out to detect and identify amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (AMC)-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in fecal samples of two patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) and their respective siblings. METHODS: Fecal Enterobacteriaceae were enumerated onto EMB agar containing amoxicillin (AMX). A total of 173 CF isolates and 41 sibling isolates were grouped into seven Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) clusters and identified through 16S rRNA and rpoB sequence analysis. RESULTS: The fecal microbiota of patients with CF revealed a higher prevalence of AMX resistant Enterobacteriaceae compared to that of their healthy siblings. Whereas all selected isolates of healthy siblings were assigned to Escherichia coli, isolates of patients with CF belonged to Klebsiella oxytoca (58.4%), E. coli (28.3%), Klebsiella variicola (7.5%) or Citrobacter sp. (5.8%). All tested CF isolates showed a high resistance rate to AMX, and a lower level of resistance to the combination with clavulanic acid. In contrast, all tested sibling isolates were susceptible for both AMX and AMC. CONCLUSION: The higher abundance of AMX resistance in the investigated patients with CF suggests that frequent AMC administration may be one of the major contributing factors in the proliferation of Enterobacteriaceae and the development of resistant strains in the gastrointestinal tract.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Enterobacterial detection and Escherichia coli antimicrobial resistance in parrots seized from the illegal wildlife trade.
AB  - Enteric bacteria are considered important potential pathogens in avian clinical medicine, causing either primary or opportunistic infections. The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of enterobacteria in the intestinal microbiota of psittacine birds and to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of the Escherichia coli isolates cultured. Fecal samples were collected from 300 parrots captured from the illegal wildlife trade in Goias, Brazil and were processed using conventional bacteriological procedures. A total of 508 isolates were obtained from 300 fecal samples: 172 E. coli (33.9% of isolates; 57.3% of individuals); 153 Enterobacter spp. (30.1% of isolates; 51.0% of individuals); 89 Klebsiella spp. (17.7% of isolates; 29.7% of individuals); 59 Citrobacter spp. (11.6% of isolates; 19.7% of individuals), 21 Proteus vulgaris (4.2% of isolates; 7.0% of individuals), 5 Providencia alcalifaciens (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 5 Serratia sp. (0.98% of isolates; 1.67% of individuals), 3 Hafnia aivei (0.59% of isolates; 1.00% of individuals), and 1 Salmonella sp. (0.20% of isolates; 0.33% of individuals). Escherichia coli isolates were subsequently tested for susceptibility to the following antibiotics: amoxicillin (70.93% of the isolates were resistant), ampicillin (75.58%), ciprofloxacin (23.25%), chloramphenicol (33.14%), doxycycline (64.53%), enrofloxacin (41.28%), tetracycline (69.19%), and sulfonamide (71.51%). Multi-resistance to three and four groups of antibiotics occurred in 40 samples (23.25%) and 4 samples (2.32%), respectively. These results demonstrate that illegally traded birds are carriers of potentially pathogenic bacteria, including E. coli strains with antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Molecular diversity of class 2 integrons in antibiotic-resistant gram-negative bacteria found in wastewater environments in China.
AB  - The molecular architecture of class 2 integrons among gram-negative bacteria from wastewater environments was investigated in Jinan, China. Out of the 391 antibiotic-resistant bacteria found, 38 isolates harboring class 2 integrons encoding potentially transferrable genes that could confer antibiotic resistance were found. These isolates were classified into 19 REP-PCR types. These strains were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and found to be as follows: Proteus mirabilis (16), Escherichia coli (7), Providencia spp. (7), Proteus spp. (2), P. vulgaris (3), Shigella sp. (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). Their class 2 integron cassette arrays were amplified and then either analyzed using PCR-RFLP or sequenced. The typical array dfrA1-sat2-aadA1 was detected in 27 isolates. Six atypical arrays were observed, including three kinds of novel arrangements (linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1-orf441 or linF2(attC1)-dfrA1(attC2)-aadA1, dfrA1-catB2-sat2-aadA1, and estX(Vr)-sat2-aadA1) and a hybrid with the 3'CS of class 1 integrons (dfrA1-sat2-aadA1-qacH), and dfrA1-sat1. Twenty-four isolates were also found to carry class 1 integrons with 10 types of gene cassette arrays. Several non-integron-associated antibiotic resistance genes were found, and their transferability was investigated. Results showed that water sources in the Jinan region harbored a diverse community of both typical and atypical class 2 integrons, raising concerns about the overuse of antibiotics and their careless disposal into the environment.
TI  - Comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term Indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): Acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  - In this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (VB) and through cesarean section (CB) were investigated using culture-independent 16S rDNA cloning and sequencing approach. The results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of VB infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart CB infants. The intestinal microbiota of infants delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. The most abundant bacterial species present in VB infants were Acinetobacter sp., Bifidobacterium sp. and Staphylococcus sp. However, CB infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile. The intestinal microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of Bifidobacteria species. An interesting finding of our study was recovery of large number of Acinetobacter sp. consisting of Acinetobacter pittii (former Acinetobacter genomic species 3), Acinetobacter junii and Acinetobacter baumannii in the VB infants clone library. Among these, Acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and Acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii (ACB) complex. Although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.
TI  - Microbiological profile of orbital abscess.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the culture and sensitivity pattern is necessary, for the institution of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy in orbital abscess. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to describe culture and sensitivity patterns of specimens from the orbit and surrounding structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Retrospectively the medical records of 56 cases of orbital abscess were reviewed. RESULTS: Cultures were positive in 38/56 (68.8%) orbital specimens and the organisms included Staphylococcus aureus 18, Streptococci 7, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3, 2 each of Enterobactersp, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter sp. and 1 each of Actinomyces israelii, Diptheroids, Coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Citrobacter freundii, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Four had polymicrobial infection. Culture of purulent nasal discharge, swabs taken from foci of infection on the face, and blood cultures were done in 26/56, and positive cultures were obtained in 16/26 (61.5%) specimens. In 12 patients, there was a concurrence in the organism cultured from the orbit and from cultures from other sites. Gram-negative organisms were associated with increased ocular morbidity. CONCLUSION: Gram-positive cocci, especially S. aureus are the most common organisms isolated from orbital abscesses. Infections by Gram-negative organisms were associated with more complications. Empirical intravenous antibiotic therapy should have a broad spectrum of activity effective against a wide range of Staphylococcal organisms and Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - [Analysis of microorganism species diversity in plant intercropping models in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage].
AB  - The selective culture method and PCR-DGGE technology were applied to analyze the  number and the biodiversity of microorganism species in cells with plant intercropping models and without plants in different seasons in a wetland system constructed for treatment of municipal sewage. The results showed that the numbers of microorganisms were considerably larger in the cells with plant intercropping models than those without plants, while the number of microorganisms was apparently larger in summer than that in winter in all treatments. Along the three-sequenced treatment cells with plant intercropping models a "low-high-low" changing trend in the numbers of microorganisms in summer. The UPGMA cluster analysis showed that the treatments in the same season were clustered in the same branch except for a few samples in winter and the biodiversity index was consistently higher in summer than that in winter. Five different sequences (DF1-DF5) were obtained through BLAST analysis and retrieval. The closest known origin groups were located as Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Proteus sp., Klebsiella oxytoca, and Burkholderia sp. respectively. The BLASTX comparison test showed that DF1 closely related to the activities of the Mycobacterium bacillus and the Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, DF2 functioned as a conservative potential ATP binding protein, DF3 related to the activities of the Bacillus cereus spore, DF4 was involved in catabolism metabolism of microorganism and DF5 played an important role in decomposition of organic matters.
TI  - A rapid subtractive immunization method to prepare discriminatory monoclonal antibodies for food E. coli O157:H7 contamination.
AB  - To detect food E. coli O157:H7 contamination rapidly and accurately, it is essential to prepare high specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the pathogen. Cyclophosphamide (Cy)-mediated subtractive immunization strategy was performed in mice to generate mAbs that react with E. coli O157:H7, but not with other affiliated bacteria. Specificity of 19 mAbs was evaluated by ELISA and/or dot-immunogold filtration assay (DIGFA). Immunogloubin typing, affinity and binding antigens of 5 selected mAbs were also analysed. MAbs 1D8, 4A7, 5A2 were found to have high reactivity with E. coli O157:H7 and no cross-reactivity with 80 other strains of bacteria including Salmonella sp., Shigella sp., Proteus sp., Yersinia enterocolitica, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and other non-E. coli O157:H7 enteric bacteria. Their ascetic titers reached 1:10(6) with E. coli O157:H7 and affinity constants ranged from 1.57 x 10(10) to 2.79 x 10(10) L/mol. The antigens recognized by them were different localized proteins. Furthermore, immune-colloidal gold probe coated with mAb 5A2 could specifically distinguish minced beef contaminated by E. coli O157:H7 from 84 other bacterial contaminations. The Cy-mediated subtractive immunization procedure coupled with hybridoma technology is a rapid and efficient approach to prepare discriminatory mAbs for detection of E. coli O157:H7 contamination in food.
TI  - Coastal seawater bacteria harbor a large reservoir of plasmid-mediated quinolone  resistance determinants in Jiaozhou Bay, China.
AB  - Diversity and prevalence of plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants were investigated in environmental bacteria isolated from surface seawater of Jiaozhou Bay, China. Five qnr gene alleles were identified in 34 isolates by PCR amplification, including qnrA3 gene in a Shewanella algae isolate, qnrB9 gene in a Citrobacter freundii isolate, qnrD gene in 22 Proteus vulgaris isolates, qnrS1 gene in 1 Enterobacter sp. and 4 Klebsiella spp. isolates, and qnrS2 gene in 1 Pseudomonas sp. and 4 Pseudoalteromonas sp. isolates. The qnrC, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and qepA genes could not be detected in this study. The 22 qnrD-positive Proteus vulgaris isolates could be differentiated into four genotypes based on ERIC-PCR assay. The qnrS1 and qnrD genes could be transferred to Escherichia coli J53 Azi(R) or E. coli TOP10 recipient strains using conjugation or transformation methods. Among the 34 qnr-positive isolates, 30 had a single point mutation in the QRDRs of GyrA protein (Ala67Ser, Ser83Ile, or Ser83Thr), indicating that cooperation of chromosome- and plasmid-mediated resistance contributed to the spread and evolution of quinolone resistance in this coastal bay. Eighty-five percent of the isolates were also found to be resistant to ampicillin, and bla(CMY), bla(OXY), bla(SHV), and bla(TEM) genes were detected in five isolates that also harbored the qnrB9 or qnrS1 gene. Our current study is the first identification of qnrS2 gene in Pseudoalteromonas and Pseudomonas strains, and qnrD gene in Proteus vulgaris strains. High prevalence of diverse qnr genes in Jiaozhou Bay indicates that coastal seawater may serve as an important reservoir, natural source, and dissemination vehicle of quinolone resistance determinants.
TI  - Immunization of mice with Lactobacillus casei expressing a beta-intimin fragment  reduces intestinal colonization by Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) is a common cause of diarrhea in children from developing countries. Intimate adhesion of the bacteria to intestinal cells occurs via binding of the adhesin intimin to the TIR receptor exposed on cell surfaces. Here, Lactobacillus casei expressing a fragment of beta-intimin (L. casei-Int(cv)) was tested as mucosal vaccines in mice against intestinal colonization with the murine pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. Oral or sublingual immunization of C57BL/6 mice with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) IgA in feces but no IgG in sera. Conversely, anti-Int(cv) IgG was induced in the sera of mice after sublingual immunization with purified Int(cv). All vaccines were able to decrease C. rodentium recovery from feces. However, this reduction was more evident and sustained over time in mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv) by the sublingual route. These mice also displayed an increase in interleukin 6 (IL-6) and gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) secretion by spleen cells 10 days after infection. Additionally, oral or sublingual immunization of C3H/HePas mice, which are highly susceptible to C. rodentium infection, with L. casei-Int(cv) induced anti-Int(cv) antibodies and significantly increased survival after challenge. Immunohistological analysis of colon sections revealed that C. rodentium was located in deep fractions of the tissue from C3H/HePas mice immunized with L. casei whereas superficial staining was observed in colon sections from mice immunized with L. casei-Int(cv.) The results indicate that vaccines composed of L. casei expressing intimin may represent a promising approach and that the C3H/HePas infection model with C. rodentium can be used to evaluate potential vaccines against EPEC.
TI  - Rectal carriage of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacilli in community settings in Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum ss-lactamase-producing Enterobacteria (ESBL-PE) emerged at the end of the 1980s, causing nosocomial outbreaks and/or hyperendemic situations in hospitals and long-term care facilities. In recent years, community-acquired infections due to ESBL-PE have spread worldwide, especially across developing countries including Madagascar. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to determine the prevalence and risk factors of intestinal carriage of ESBL-PE in the community of Antananarivo. METHODS: Non-hospitalized patients were recruited in three health centers in different socio economic settings. Fresh stool collected were immediately plated on Drigalski agar containing 3 mg/liter of ceftriaxone. Gram-negative bacilli species were identified and ESBL production was tested by a double disk diffusion (cefotaxime and ceftazidime +/- clavulanate) assay. Characterization of ESBLs were perfomed by PCR and direct sequencing. Molecular epidemiology was analysed by Rep-PCR and ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: 484 patients were screened (sex ratio = 1.03, median age 28 years). 53 ESBL-PE were isolated from 49 patients (carrier rate 10.1%). The isolates included Escherichia coli (31), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14), Enterobacter cloacae (3), Citrobacter freundii (3), Kluyvera spp. (1) and Pantoae sp. (1). In multivariate analysis, only the socioeconomic status of the head of household was independently associated with ESBL-PE carriage, poverty being the predominant risk factor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of carriage of ESBL in the community of Antananarivo is one of the highest reported worldwide. This alarming spread of resistance genes should be stopped urgently by improving hygiene and streamlining the distribution and consumption of antibiotics.
TI  - Analysis of the DNA region mediating increased thermotolerance at 58 degrees C in Cronobacter sp. and other enterobacterial strains.
AB  - Cronobacter spp. are opportunistic pathogens associated with serious infections in neonates. The increased stress tolerance, including thermoresistance, of some Cronobacter strains can promote their survival in production facilities and thus raise the possibility of contamination of dried infant milk formula, which has been identified as a potential source of infection. In this study, we characterized a DNA region which is present in some Cronobacter strains and which contributes to their prolonged survival at 58 degrees C. The 18 kbp long region containing 22 open reading frames was sequenced in Cronobacter sakazakii ATCC 29544. The major feature of the region contained a cluster of conserved genes, most of them having significant homologies with bacterial proteins involved in some type of stress response, including heat, oxidation and acid stress. The same thermoresistance DNA region was detected in strains belonging to the genera Cronobacter, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Escherichia and its presence positively correlated with increased thermotolerance.
TI  - Akara Ogbomoso: microbiological examination and identification of hazards and critical control points.
AB  - Akara Ogbomoso was examined toward the establishment of hazard analysis and critical control point (HACCP). The akara was produced in residential buildings with the attendant consequence of contamination. There was ample growth of aerobes, coliforms, staphylococci, Shigella and yeast/mold from the samples, water and cowpea pastes. Microbial contaminations occur through the processing, which can be corrected through education by adopting good hygienic and manufacturing practices. The critical control points were identified as frying, storage and refrying. It may be heated in the microwave for 10 s before consumption. Akara, prepared in the laboratory through the implementation of HACCP was not contaminated. Several bacterial isolates, namely; Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia marcescens, Proteus vulgaris, Bacillus cereus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Bacillus sp. and Shigella sp., showed multiple resistance to antibiotics ranging from two to nine. Seven strains were not resistant to the antibiotics, while five were resistant to one type of antibiotic.
TI  - Etiologic agents of otitis media in Benin city, Nigeria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Otitis Media continues to be a major presentation in the ear, nose and throat clinic. AIM: This study aimed to isolate, characterize and identify the bacteriological and mycological etiologic agents of otitis media in Benin city. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ear discharge from 569 (299 males and 270 females) patients diagnosed clinically of otitis media between August 2009 and August 2010 were processed to recover the bacterial and fungal etiologic agents. Susceptibility test was performed on all bacterial isolate. RESULT: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.3%) was the predominant bacteria isolate causing otitis media followed by Staphylococcus aureus (21.0%), Klebsiella sp (8.9%), Proteus sp (8.2%), Alkaligenes spp (4.3%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (3.9%), Escherichia coli (3.0%) and Citrobacter freundi (1.7%). Fungi isolated were Aspergillus niger (9.2%), Candida albicans (5.4%), Candida tropicalis (3.0%), Aspergillus flavus (2.1%) and Candida parasilopsis (1.5%). 413 had a single organism isolated from the middle ear culture while twenty (3.51%) patients had mixed organisms isolated. Infection was highest among 0 - 5 years, and lowest among aged 18 - 23. All bacterial isolates were poorly susceptible to the antibacterial agents. CONCLUSION: The study uncovers a high frequency of bacteria associated otitis media with the finding of fungi too as a significant etiologic agent.
TI  - Development of a genetic transfer system in selenate-respiring bacterium Citrobacter sp. strain JSA which was isolated from natural freshwater sediment.
AB  - Conjugative mating between the selenate-reducing bacterium Citrobacter sp. strain JSA and Escherichia coli S17-1 harboring the broad-host-range plasmid pKT230 or pKT240 (IncQ) allowed genetic transfer to strain JSA at a maximum frequency of 2.5x10(-5) (pKT230) and 5.1x10(-6) (pKT240) per recipient JSA cell. Kanamycin-resistant (selection marker of pKT230 and pKT240) transconjugants were routinely obtained with this method, and we confirmed that both vectors were also successfully transferred and replicated in strain JSA without alteration of the replicon. Furthermore, an electroporation method has also allowed transformation of JSA at a frequency of 10(-7) to 10(-6) transformants per mug vector DNA (per recipient cell), and PCR and hybridization analyses revealed that pKT230 and pKT240 are stably maintained in transformed JSA cells. These results indicated that both InQ plasmids can be used as vectors for gene transfer to selenate-reducing strain JSA. This is the first study to demonstrate an effective method for genetic transfer in a selenate-reducing Citrobacter bacterium and will aid in the elucidation of the selenium oxyanion reduction mechanism in this genus of environmental selenate-respiring isolates.
TI  - A small-molecule inhibitor of the bacterial type III secretion system protects against in vivo infection with Citrobacter rodentium.
AB  - The type III secretion system (T3SS) is highly conserved in many Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria and functions as an injector of bacterial proteins (effectors) into host cells. T3SSs are involved in establishing disease processes, but this machinery is not essential for bacterial growth or homeostasis. Thus, T3SS is expected to be a candidate therapeutic target, and inhibitors of T3SSs could potentially reduce virulence without causing bacterial death, thereby avoiding any subsequent development of resistance. We identified a linear polyketide compound, aurodox, as a specific T3SS inhibitor from the culture broth of Streptomyces sp. using a screening system for the T3SS-mediated hemolysis of enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) established by our group. Aurodox strongly inhibited T3SS-mediated hemolysis with an IC(50) value of 1.5 mug ml(-1) without affecting bacterial growth in liquid media. We also demonstrated that aurodox specifically inhibits the secretion of type III-secreted proteins such as EspB, EspF and Map, without affecting the expression of the housekeeping protein GroEL. Furthermore, an in vivo infection study using mice clearly indicated that the administration of aurodox allowed the mice to survive a lethal dose of Citrobactor rodentium, a model bacterium for human pathogens such as EPEC. Thus, our in vivo study directly demonstrated for the first time that this putative T3SS inhibitor can be applied as a novel class of anti-infective agents.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of bacteria from the gut of Bombyx mori that degrade cellulose, xylan, pectin and starch and their impact on digestion.
AB  - Bombyx mori L. (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae) have been domesticated and widely used for silk production. It feeds on mulberry leaves. Mulberry leaves are mainly composed of pectin, xylan, cellulose and starch. Some of the digestive enzymes that degrade these carbohydrates might be produced by gut bacteria. Eleven isolates were obtained from the digestive tract of B. mori, including the Gram positive Bacillus circulans and Gram negative Proteus vulgaris, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Serratia liquefaciens, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas sp., and Erwinia sp.. Three of these isolates, P. vulgaris, K. pneumoniae, C. freundii, were cellulolytic and xylanolytic, P. fluorescens and Erwinia sp., were pectinolytic and K. pneumoniae degraded starch. Aeromonas sp. was able to utilize the CMcellulose and xylan. S. liquefaciens was able to utilize three polysaccharides including CMcellulose, xylan and pectin. B. circulans was able to utilize all four polysaccharides with different efficacy. The gut of B. mori has an alkaline pH and all of the isolated bacterial strains were found to grow and degrade polysaccharides at alkaline pH. The number of cellulolytic bacteria increases with each instar.
TI  - Production of antimicrobial silver nanoparticles in water extracts of the fungus  Amylomyces rouxii strain KSU-09.
AB  - A fungal strain, KSU-09, isolated from the roots of date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), was identified as Amylomyces rouxii based on sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of its rRNA genes. Mycelia-free water extracts obtained from mycelium suspended in water for 72h facilitated the production of stable, predominantly monodispersed and spherical silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) in the size range of 5-27nm upon addition of 1mM silver nitrate, as determined by the XRD, AFM and TEM. The AgNPs exhibited antimicrobial activity against Shigella dysenteriae type I, Staphylococcus aureus, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans and Fusarium oxysporum. Thus, the strain KSU-09 could be used for simple, non-hazardous and efficient synthesis of antimicrobial AgNPs.
TI  - A survey of veterinary hospitals in Nigeria for the presence of some bacterial organisms of nosocomial and zoonotic potential.
AB  - This study was undertaken to determine the type and estimate the prevalence of bacterial organisms on contact surfaces of five close-to-patient facilities in three veterinary health care settings within the Sokoto metropolis of north-western Nigeria. A total of 30 samples (10 from each setting) were collected and analysed using culture, microscopy and biochemical testing. Bacterial species isolated from samples in this study included the following: Bacillus sp. (27.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (15.9%), Listeria sp. (13.6%), Streptococcus sp. (11.4%), Salmonella sp. (6.8%), Escherichia coli (4.5%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (4.5%), Citrobacter sp. (2.3%), Klebsiella sp. (2.3%), Lactobacillus sp. (2.3%), Micrococcus sp. (2.3%), Pasteurella sp. (2.3%), Proteus sp. (2.3%), and Yersinia sp. (2.3%). A higher percentage (64.3%) of the total bacterial isolates were zoonotic in nature and hence of public health significance. Some pathogens have the potential of nosocomial spread. In this study, we seek to establish the first evidence of bacterial presence in the major veterinary health care settings in the Sokoto region of north-western Nigeria. Of particular interest is the hypothesis, which has not previously been formally tested, that nosocomial infections are especially likely to be implicated in both animals and occupational diseases in Nigeria. It was suggested that some of these isolates were associated with the risk of nosocomial and zoonotic infections and hence draws attention to the need to rigorously employ standard veterinary precautions as part of the hospital's infection control programme in an attempt to protect both patients and staff from infections.
TI  - Reconstruction of the violacein biosynthetic pathway from Duganella sp. B2 in different heterologous hosts.
AB  - Violacein is a bacteria-originated indolocarbazole pigment with potential applications due to its various bioactivities such as anti-tumor, antiviral, and antifungal activities. However, stable mass production of this pigment is difficult due to its low productivities and the instability of wild-type violacein-producing strains. In order to establish a stable and efficient production system for violacein, the violacein synthesis pathway from a new species of Duganella sp. B2 was reconstructed in different bacterial strains including Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter aerogenes by using different vectors. The gene cluster that encodes five enzymes involved in the violacein biosynthetic pathway was first isolated from Duganella sp. B2, and three recombinant expression vectors were constructed using the T7 promoter or the alkane-responsive promoter PalkB. Our results showed that violacein could be stably synthesized in E. coli, C. freundii, and E. aerogenes. Interestingly, we found that there were great differences between the different recombinant strains, not only in the protein expression profiles pertaining to violacein biosynthesis but also in the productivity and composition of crude violacein. Among the host strains tested, the crude violacein production by the recombinant C. freundii strain reached 1.68 g L(-1) in shake flask cultures, which was 4-fold higher than the highest production previously reported in flask culture by other groups. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the efficient production of violacein by genetically engineered strains.
TI  - [Enteropathogens relating to diarrhea in HIV patients on antiretroviral therapy].
AB  - The etiology of the diarrheic process in AIDS may be caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, protozoa or helminths, as well as HIV itself. This study evaluated enteropathogens relating to diarrhea in HIV patients who were on antiretroviral therapy. The parasitological methods used were Faust, Hoffmann and Kinyoun. Isolation and culturing of fungi were carried out in accordance with the methodology recommended by the NCCLS M27-A standard. The yeast species were identified using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Bacteria were isolated on MacConkey and SS agar and the species were identified using Enterokit B (Probac do Brasil) and biochemical methods. Forty-nine patients were evaluated: 44.89% presented enteroparasites and 48.1% presented Candida sp, of which 61.5% were Candida albicans, 7.6% were Candida sp and 30.7% were Candida non-albicans. Bacteria were isolated from 72% of the patients, of which 49% were Escherichia coli, 13% Salmonella parathyphi, Klebsiella sp or Proteus and 6% Citrobacter freundii or Yersinia sp. There was high prevalence of Candida sp in HIV patients with diarrhea and non-albicans species were isolated. Their presence could be taken to mean that they were accomplices in or causes of the infection.
TI  - Molecular and biochemical characterization of the natural chromosome-encoded class A beta-lactamase from Pseudomonas luteola.
AB  - Pseudomonas luteola (formerly classified as CDC group Ve-1 and named Chryseomonas luteola) is an unusual pathogen implicated in rare but serious infections in humans. A novel beta-lactamase gene, bla(LUT-1), was cloned from the whole-cell DNA of the P. luteola clinical isolate LAM, which had a weak narrow-spectrum beta-lactam-resistant phenotype, and expressed in Escherichia coli. This gene encoded LUT-1, a 296-amino-acid Ambler class A beta-lactamase with a pI of 6 and a theoretical molecular mass of 28.9 kDa. The catalytic efficiency of this enzyme was higher for cephalothin, cefuroxime, and cefotaxime than for penicillins. It was found to be 49% to 59% identical to other Ambler class A beta-lactamases from Burkholderia sp. (PenA to PenL), Ralstonia eutropha (REUT), Citrobacter sedlakii (SED-1), Serratia fonticola (FONA and SFC-1), Klebsiella sp. (KPC and OXY), and CTX-M extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. No gene homologous to the regulatory ampR genes of class A beta-lactamases was found in the vicinity of the bla(LUT-1) gene. The entire bla(LUT-1) coding region was amplified by PCR and sequenced in five other genetically unrelated P. luteola strains (including the P. luteola type strain). A new variant of bla(LUT-1) was found for each strain. These genes (named bla(LUT-2) to bla(LUT-6)) had nucleotide sequences 98.1 to 99.5% identical to that of bla(LUT-1) and differing from this gene by two to four nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms. The bla(LUT) gene was located on a 700- to 800-kb chromosomal I-CeuI fragment, the precise size of this fragment depending on the P. luteola strain.
TI  - Overexpression, purification and preliminary X-ray diffraction analysis of the controller protein C.Csp231I from Citrobacter sp. RFL231.
AB  - Restriction-modification controller proteins play an essential role in regulating the temporal expression of restriction-modification genes. The controller protein C.Csp231I represents a new class of controller proteins. The gene was sublconed to allow overexpression in Escherichia coli. The protein was purified to homogeneity and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. The crystals diffracted to 2.0 A resolution and belonged to space group P2(1). An electrophoretic mobility-shift assay provided evidence of strong binding of C.Csp231I to a sequence located upstream of the csp231IC start codon.
TI  - Conjugal transformation and transposon and chemical mutagenesis of gram-negative  selenate-respiring Citrobacter sp. strain JSA.
AB  - Conjugal mating between selenate-reducing Citrobacter sp. strain JSA and Escherichia coli S17-1 bearing pSUP2021 allowed transposon mutagenesis and chromosomal transformation. Kanamycin-resistant transconjugants were obtained successfully by this method from a freshwater selenate-respiring Citrobacter sp. strain JSA. The maximum frequency of kanamycin-resistant Tn5 transconjugants was 3.6 x 10(-6) per recipient of this strain. Of these transconjugants, eight strains of selenate reduction-deficient transconjugants living by nitrate reduction were obtained in the strain JSA. Moreover, the same phenotype of deficient mutant was created by chemical mutagenesis with ethylmethanesulfonate. The results strongly indicate that selenate reducing anaerobic respiration was independent of nitrate reduction in the Citrobacter sp. isolate strain JSA.
TI  - Phytochemical observation and antibacterial activity of Cyperus esculentus L.
AB  - In the present study various extracts of Cyperus esculentus L. such as acetone, 50% ethanol, chloroform and petroleum ether were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against several human pathogens such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella sp, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter freundii, by using disc diffusion method. The activity of the samples were compared with that of standard antibiotics. The qualitative phytochemical analysis was also carried out with all the extracts of the sample. Of all the extracts 50% ethanol and acetone extract were found to be rich in phytochemicals such as alkaloids, flavonoids, phenols, tannins, steroids, terpenoids and glycosides. Acetone extract showed highest inhibitory activity against S.aureus, ILpneumoniae and P.vulgaris. 50% ethanolic extract showed maximum activity against E.coli, S.aureus and Salmonella sp. Chloroform extract maximally inhibited the growth of S.aureus whereas, petroleum ether extract showed positive results against Salmonella sp respectively. All extracts were sensitive to C. freundii.
TI  - Aerobic bacterial microflora of Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris) oral cavity and cloaca, originating from parque Zoologico Arruda Camara, Paraiba, Brazil.
AB  - The objective of this study was to isolate and identify the aerobic bacterial microflora from the oral cavity mucosa and cloaca's samples, collected from Broad-snouted caiman (Caiman latirostris), born and bred in captivity at Parque Zoologico Arruda Camara, Joao Pessoa, Paraiba, Brazil. The most common bacteria were Staphylococcus sp. (14.74%), Corynebacterium sp. (13.68%), Escherichia coli (13.68%) and Shigella sp.(11.58%), and the less common were Citrobacter sp. (1.05%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1.05%) and Salmonella sp. (1.05%).This emphasizes the importance of these microorganisms' participation in infectious processes (sepsis) and injuries caused by crocodilians.
TI  - Causative agents of urinary tract infections in children and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern: a hospital based study.
AB  - A retrospective study was conducted to find out the causative agents of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children and their antibiotic sensitivity pattern among Nepalese children. This was done at Kanti Children's Hospital in Kathmandu (Nepal) by analyzing the records of urine samples collected for culture and sensitivity tests over a period of six months (April to November, 2007). Of the total 1878 mid-stream urine samples collected from suspected cases of UTI, 538 (28.6%) were positive for pathogenic organisms. There was no significant difference in growth positive rate in two genders (M: 51.7% and F: 48.3%). Of the various pathogenic organisms isolated, Escherichia coli constituted for 93.3% followed by Proteus sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, Staphylococcus aureus and others. E. coli was found to be most sensitive to amikacin, chloramphenicol, nitrofurantoin and ofloxacin and least sensitive to most commonly used drugs like cephalexin, nalidixic acid, cotrimoxazole and norfloxacin.
TI  - Prevalence of bacterial contamination with antibiotic-resistant and enterotoxigenic fecal coliforms in treated drinking water.
AB  - Pollution indicator bacteria such as coliforms, fecal coliforms, and fecal streptococci were enumerated using a multiple-tube fermentation method in 100 treated drinking-water samples from 20 locations in residential, commercial, and industrial areas of a tropical city during summer. Thirty-four percent of the samples were bacteriologically nonpotable. Maximum coliform-contaminated (27%) samples were derived from industrial areas, while samples contaminated with fecal coliform (23%) and fecal streptococci (20%) originated from commercial areas. Coliforms identified as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Enterobacter sp., and Citrobacter sp. were present in 29%, 26%, 24%, and 15% of samples, respectively. Fecal coliforms were examined for antibiotic susceptibility with disc diffusion method. All test isolates exhibited multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) for kanamycin, nalidixic acid, tetracycline, and trimethoprim. Escherichia coli isolates were examined for enterotoxigenicity using the suckling mice bioassay and 60% of the isolates displayed enterotoxigenicity. Data indicate that drinking water contaminated with antibiotic-resistant enterotoxigenic fecal bacteria may be responsible for presence of waterborne diarrheal diseases attributed to therapeutic agents used by urban populations in the tropics.
TI  - Occurrence and diversity of integrons and beta-lactamase genes among ampicillin-resistant isolates from estuarine waters.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence and molecular diversity of beta-lactamase genes and integrons among Gram-negative ampicillin-resistant bacteria from Ria de Aveiro. Ampicillin-resistant isolates were selected and subjected to genotyping using REP-PCR. Representatives from each REP pattern were affiliated with the following taxa by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene: Aeromonas caviae, A. hydrophila, A. media, A. molluscorum, A. veronii, A. salmonicida, Aeromonas sp., Pseudomonas putida, Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Escherichia sp., Shigella sonnei, Shigella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Raoultella ornithinolytica, R. terrigena, R. planticola, Citrobacter freundii, Morganella morganii and Enterobacter sp. Isolates affiliated with genera Escherichia or Shigella were identified as Escherichia coli using phenotypic-based tests. PCR was used to assess beta-lactamase encoding sequences (bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(CARB), bla(CTX-M), bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(CphA/IMIS), bla(OXA-A), bla(OXA-B), bla(OXA-C)), class 1 and class 2 integrases, and integron variable regions. Sequence analysis of PCR products was performed. beta-Lactamase genes were detected in 77.8% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 10.5% of the Aeromonas. The most frequently detected gene was bla(TEM), followed by bla(SHV,)bla(OXA-B), bla(CphA/IMIS) and bla(CARB). Retrieved sequences shared high homology with previously described beta-lactamases. The intI1 gene was present in 29.6% of the Enterobacteriaceae and in 21% of the Aeromonas isolates. The intI2 gene was present in 4 isolates. A total of 13 cassettes included in 12 different cassette arrays were identified. The most frequently found resistance gene cassettes were aadA variants. Previous investigations based on cultivation-independent approaches revealed higher molecular diversity among beta-lactamase-encoding sequences in this estuary. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that cultivation-dependent approaches may underestimate the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in environmental samples and may introduce bias in the recovery of their molecular variants.
TI  - There is a low incidence of recurrent bacteriuria in painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis patients followed longitudinally.
AB  - The objective of this paper was to establish whether patients with confirmed painful bladder syndrome/interstitial cystitis (PBS/IC) presenting with symptoms of UTI have actual bacteriuria vs a flare of their PBS/IC symptoms. One hundred and six (n = 106) consecutive female patients (mean age 39.8 +/- 14 years) with newly diagnosed IC were identified and followed longitudinally for 24 months. At the initial visit and at all subsequent visits, urinary specimens were obtained by sterile catheterization (Bard 14Fr female) and cultured for bacteria. Eight patients had an initially positive urine culture, and repeat cultures 8 weeks after treatment were all negative. Once sterile urine was established, the diagnosis of PBS/IC was confirmed. A pelvic pain/urgency/frequency (PUF) questionnaire score was obtained from 89 patients. After the diagnosis of PBS/IC, all patients received multimodal treatment. Patients were instructed to present to the office whenever they developed symptoms of UTI, at which time a sterile catheter specimen was obtained and sent for culture. Greater than 10(3) colonies were considered positive. Patients who did not report flares were contacted to establish whether unreported treatments were given. Seventy-two patients (68%) had no UTI episodes or flares. The remaining 34 patients (32%) presented with 54 flares, of which 44 were culture-negative and 10 were culture-positive. A single flare was reported by 21 patients during the 24 months, with three positive cultures (14.3%). Recurrent UTI symptoms (two to four flares) were seen in a small group (n = 13) for a total of 33 flares. Of these, seven had two flares each (12 negative, 2 positive), five had three flares each (12 negative, 3 positive), and one patient had four flares (two negative, two positive). Therefore, within the group with recurrent symptoms, seven positive cultures were obtained for a rate of recurrent bacteriuria of 6.6% (7/106). Nine of the 10 positive bacterial cultures were due to gram-negative bacteria: Escherichia coli (n = 6), Proteus mirabilis (n = 1), Klebsiella pneumonia (n = 1), and Citrobacter sp. (n = 1). One grew Streptococcus sp. There was no difference between the flare group and nonflares in regards to age or PUF scores between groups. This study is the first to report on the low incidence of confirmed UTIs in a large group of PBS/IC patients followed longitudinally. These data suggest that only a small number of PBS/IC patients with UTI symptoms have positive urine cultures (9.4%; 10/106). Although the symptoms of recurrent UTI are prevalent in IC patients, the incidence of confirmed recurrent UTIs is only 6.6%. Because the flares of IC are usually self-limiting, treatment response to antibiotics may be misleading in light of the low incidence of positive urine cultures. These data suggest that the symptom flares of IC are not usually associated with recurrent UTI and, therefore, are likely due to a triggering of the other painful mechanisms involved in IC patients who are culture-negative.
TI  - Confirmation of E. coli among other thermotolerant coliform bacteria in paper mill effluents, wood chips screening rejects and paper sludges.
AB  - Paper sludges are solid wastes material generated from the paper production, which have been characterized for their chemical contents. Some are rich in wood fiber and are a good carbon source, for example the primary and de-inking paper sludges. Others are made rich in nitrogen and phosphorus by pressing the activated sludge, resulting from the biological water treatments, with the primary sludge, yielding the combined paper sludge. Still, in the absence of sanitary effluents very few studies have addressed the characterization of their coliform microflora. Therefore, this study investigated the thermotolerant coliform population of one paper mill effluent and two paper mill sludges and wood chips screening rejects using chromogenic media. For the first series of analyses, the medium used was Colilert broth and positive tubes were selected to isolate bacteria in pure culture on MacConkey agar. In a second series of analyses, double selective media, based on ss-galactosidase and ss-glucuronidase activities, were used to isolate bacteria. First, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was detected in low numbers in most water effluents, but showed that the entrance of the thermotolerant coliforms was early in the industrial process. Also, large numbers of thermotolerant coliforms, i.e., 7,000,000 MPN/g sludge (dry weight; d.w.), were found in combined sludges. From this first series of isolations, bacteria were purified on MacConkey medium and identified as Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter sp, E. sakazakii, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, K. pneumoniae subsp. rhinoscleromatis, K. pneumoniae subsp. ozaenae, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Pantoea sp, Raoultella terrigena, R. planticola. Second, the presence of thermotolerant coliforms was measured at more than 3,700-6,000 MPN/g (d.w) sludge, whereas E. coli was detected from 730 to more than 3,300 MPN/g (d.w.) sludge. The presence of thermotolerant coliform bacteria and E. coli was sometimes detected from wood chips screening rejects in large quantities. Also, indigenous E. coli were able to multiply into the combined sludge, and inoculated E. coli isolates were often able to multiply in wood chips and combined sludge media. In this second series of isolations, API20E and Biolog identified most isolates as E. coli, but others remained unidentified. The sequences of the 16S rDNA confirmed that most isolates were likely E. coli, few Burkholderia spp, but 10% of the isolates remained unidentified. This study points out that the coliform bacteria are introduced by the wood chips in the water effluents, where they can survive throught the primary clarifier and regrow in combined sludges.
TI  - Antifungal and antibacterial activities of Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch heartwood lignans.
AB  - Five lignans (secoisolariciresinol, pinoresinol, eudesmin, lariciresinol, and lariciresinol-4-methyl ether) were isolated from an MeOH extract from Araucaria araucana (Mol.) K. Koch wood for the first time in this species and their structures determined with spectroscopic methods. The antimicrobial activities of these compounds were determined for the bacteria Citrobacter sp., Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and for the white rooting and staining fungi Mucor miehei, Paecilomyces variotii, Ceratocystis pilifera, Trametes versicolor, and Penicillium notatum, and in addition, the MeOH extract was evaluated against Aspergillus niger, Candida albicans, Fusarium moniliforme, F. sporotrichum and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. The most sensitive bacteria against pinoresinol were the Gram-positive. However, secoisolariciresinol exhibited a significant antifungal activity on fungi of white rooting and wood staining and this compound completely inhibited the mycelial growth of T. versicolor and C. pilifera at 300 and 400 microg per disc, respectively, whereas pinoresinol showed a moderate inhibitory activity. On the other hand, the MeOH extract had the highest activity against rooting and staining and pathogenic fungi as well as T. versicolor, Fusarium spp. and Trichophyton mentagrophytes, inhibiting completely the growth at 400 microg per disc.
TI  - Triphenylmethane reductase from Citrobacter sp. strain KCTC 18061P: purification, characterization, gene cloning, and overexpression of a functional protein in Escherichia coli.
AB  - We purified to homogeneity an enzyme from Citrobacter sp. strain KCTC 18061P capable of decolorizing triphenylmethane dyes. The native form of the enzyme was identified as a homodimer with a subunit molecular mass of about 31 kDa. It catalyzes the NADH-dependent reduction of triphenylmethane dyes, with remarkable substrate specificity related to dye structure. Maximal enzyme activity occurred at pH 9.0 and 60 degrees C. The enzymatic reaction product of the triphenylmethane dye crystal violet was identified as its leuco form by UV-visible spectral changes and thin-layer chromatography. A gene encoding this enzyme was isolated based on its N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences. The nucleotide sequence of the gene has a single open reading frame encoding 287 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 30,954 Da. Although the deduced amino acid sequence displays 99% identity to the hypothetical protein from Listeria monocytogenes strain 4b H7858, it shows no overall functional similarity to any known protein in the public databases. At the N terminus, the amino acid sequence has high homology to sequences of NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes containing the dinucleotide-binding motif GXXGXXG. The enzyme was heterologously expressed in Escherichia coli, and the purified recombinant enzyme showed characteristics similar to those of the native enzyme. This is the first report of a triphenylmethane reductase characterized from any organism.
TI  - Molecular analysis of colonized bacteria in a human newborn infant gut.
AB  - The complex ecosystem of intestinal microflora is estimated to harbor approximately 400 different microbial species, mostly bacteria. However, studies on bacterial colonization have mostly been based on culturing methods, which only detect a small fraction of the whole microbiotic ecosystem of the gut. To clarify the initial acquisition and subsequent colonization of bacteria in an infant within the few days after birth, phylogenetic analysis was performed using 16S rDNA sequences from the DNA isolated from feces on the 1st, 3rd, and 6th day. 16S rDNA libraries were constructed with the amplicons of PCR conditions at 30 cycles and 50 degrees c annealing temperature. Nine independent libraries were produced by the application of three sets of primers (set A, set B, and set C) combined with three fecal samples for day 1, day 3, and day 6 of life. Approximately 220 clones (76.7%) of all 325 isolated clones were characterized as known species, while other 105 clones (32.3%) were characterized as unknown species. The library clone with set A universal primers amplifying 350 bp displayed increased diversity by days. Thus, set A primers were better suited for this type of molecular ecological analysis. On the first day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc citreum, and Streptococcus mitis were present. The largest taxonomic group was L. lactis. On the third day of the life of the infant, Enterobacter, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, S. mitis, and Streptococcus salivarius were present. On the sixth day of the life of the infant, Citrobacter, Clostridium difficile, Enterobacter sp., Enterobacter cloacae, and E. coli were present. The largest taxonomic group was E. coli. These results showed that microbiotic diversity changes very rapidly in the few days after birth, and the acquisition of unculturable bacteria expanded rapidly after the third day.
TI  - Enteric fever-like illness caused by infection with citrobacter amalonaticus.
AB  - 'Enteric fever' is a potentially fatal, severe systemic disease, which is encountered worldwide. Traditionally, enteric fever refers to a bacteremic illness caused by members of certain Salmonella serotypes, notably: Salmonella typhi, a Gram-negative bacterium, and to a lesser extent, Salmonella paratyphi A, B and C. In addition, other non-salmonella organisms may produce a syndrome clinically indistinguishable from "enteric fever". Brucella sp., Campylobacter sp., Edwardsiella tarda, Enterobacter Cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Providencia alcalifaciens, Pseudomonas sp., Serratia marcescens, Francisella sp. and Yersinia pp have been identified in enteric fever This is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first case of Citrobacter to be reported presenting as enteric fever in a normal host in Thailand.
TI  - Detection and characterization of beta-lactamase genes in subgingival bacteria from patients with refractory periodontitis.
AB  - Fifty-three beta-lactamase-producing strains of oral bacteria isolated from patients with refractory periodontitis in Norway and USA were screened for the presence of the bla(TEM), bla(SHV), bla(OXA), bla(ampC), bla(cfxA), and bla(cepA/cblA) genes by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The PCR products were characterized by direct sequencing of the amplified DNA. Thirty-four of the 53 enzyme-producing strains (64%) were positive in one of the PCR assays. All beta-lactamase-producing Prevotella and Capnocytophaga spp. were CfxA positive. TEM-type beta-lactamases were identified in one strain each of Escherichia coli and Neisseria sp., and one strain of Citrobacter freundii possessed an AmpC-type beta-lactamase. Screening for gene cassettes and genes known to be associated with integrons did not reveal the presence of integrons in these oral bacteria. Sequence analyses showed that most CfxA positive Prevotella and Capnocytophaga isolates from patients with refractory periodontitis harboured variants of the CfxA2 and CfxA3 enzyme. The present study also showed that many different genetic determinants of beta-lactamase production are found in bacteria isolated from refractory periodontitis, many of which remain to be characterized.
TI  - Isolation of Citrobacter sp. mutants defective in decolorization of brilliant green by transposon mutagenesis.
AB  - To identify genes involved in the decolorization of brilliant green, we isolated  random mutants generated by transposon insertion in brilliant green-decolorizing bacterium, Citrobacter sp. The resulting mutant bank yielded 19 mutants with a complete defect in terms of the brilliant green color removing ability. Southern hybridization with a Tn5 fragment as a probe showed a single hybridized band in 7 mutants and these mutants appeared to have insertions at different sites of the chromosome. Tn5-inserted genes were isolated and the DNA sequence flanking Tn5 was determined. By comparing these with a sequence database, putative protein products encoded by bg genes were identified as follows: bg 3 as a LysR-type regulatory protein; bg 11 as a MalG protein in the maltose transport system; bg 14 as an oxidoreductase; and bg 17 as an ABC transporter. The sequences deduced from the three bg genes, bg 2, bg 7 and bg 16, showed no significant similarity to any protein with a known function, suggesting that these three bg genes may encode unidentified proteins responsible for the decolorization of brilliant green.
TI  - Incidence of enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus in day care centers in Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of enteric bacteria and Staphylococcus aureus in four day care centers in Akwa Ibom State was studied using culture techniques. The percentage frequencies of the isolates from 124 samples were Staphylococcus aureus (33.9), Escherichia coli (19.0), Klebsiella sp (14.4), Citrobacter sp (12.5) and Proteus mirabilis (7.4). The sources of contamination were floors, chairs, skin, bed linen, door handles, fans, children's tables, walls, windows, ceiling, headmistress's table and chairs, drinking water and wash water. Cultures from Aunty Chimmy's Day Care and Nursery School, Eket and Ideal Day Care and Nursery School, Eket yielded more organisms than those from Trinity International Nursery School, Ikot Ekpene and Adiaha Obong Day Care Center in Uyo. The results revealed the insanitary conditions in these day care centers. The enforcement of an effective public health enlightenment program is advocated in order to attract sufficient attention of the proprietors of these establishments to the role of fomites as reservoirs of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Extended spectrum beta-lactamase mediated resistance in urinary tract isolates of family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) hydrolyse expanded spectrum cephalosporins like ceftazidime, cefotaxime and monobactam aztreonam. ESBL producing bacteria may not be detectable in the routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests leading to inappropriate use of antibiotics and treatment failures. As information on ESBL producers causing urinary tract infection (UTI) is not available from our country, the occurrence of ESBL producing strains causing UTI was studied as also the differences between the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of ESBL and non-ESBL producers. METHODS: Urinary isolates (233) were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by Stoke's method and ESBL production by double disk diffusion method (ceftazidime and clavulanic acid). The clinical and demographic profile of the patients was noted. RESULTS: Sixty two of the 233 isolates tested (26.6%) were ESBL producers. Approximately 38.5 per cent of Klebsiellae, 24.7 per cent of Escherichia coli, 24 per cent of Enterobacter aerogenes, 33.3 per cent of Proteus sp. and the only Citrobacter strain produced ESBL. Recent surgery was found to be a significant (P < 0.01) risk factor for acquisition of ESBLs. Approximately 30 per cent of the ESBL producers appeared falsely sensitive or moderately sensitive to cefotaxime/ceftazidime in routine susceptibility testing. There was no difference between the ESBL producers and non-producers in the susceptibility to non-beta lactam agents except for gentamicin. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: A high percentage of urinary tract isolates produced ESBL. Since they are likely to be missed in routine disk diffusion susceptibility tests, all microbiology laboratories should look for ESBL production routinely to avoid treatment failures.
TI  - BUT-1: a new member in the chromosomal inducible class C beta-lactamases family from a clinical isolate of Buttiauxella sp.
AB  - An atypical Enterobacteriaceae strain with a beta-lactam susceptibility pattern of inducible cephalosporinase was isolated in Tenon Hospital (Paris, France) from a patient's skull wound infection. Identifications by the API-50CHE biochemical system and 16S rRNA gene sequencing concluded that it was a member of the Buttiauxella genus. The bla gene was cloned and sequenced. The deduced translated product was a 383-amino acid protein (BUT-1) with 75-78% identity with the chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases of Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae and Escherichia coli. The isoelectric point of 9.0 and the kinetic constants of BUT-1 were comparable with results described for other Ambler class C enzymes. bla(BUT-1) and the associated ampR transcriptional regulator gene were divergently transcribed from a common intercistronic region, a genetic organization already described for other inducible class C beta-lactamases. The deduced amino acid sequence of AmpR shared 85% and 81% identity with AmpR from E. cloacae and C. freundii respectively.
TI  - [Total and fecal coliforms, some enterobacteria staphylococcus sp. and moulds in  salads for hot dogs sold in Maracay, Venezuela].
AB  - Fast food sold on the streets are good vehicle to transmit gastrointestinal diseases to consumers because they are highly manipulated. The vegetables are a good media for pathogens growth. Raw vegetables salads for hot dog sold in Maracay were studied. Total and fecal Coliforms and Staphylococcus sp. were quantified by the Most Probable Number Technique, Coliforms and Staphylococcus isolated were partially identified. Also the mould population was quantified and identified. Microbial growth was correlated with pH and acidity measurements. MPN/g of Total Coliforms was 1.44 x 10(5) and 4.57 x 10(4) for fecal Coliforms. E. coli was no detected. 87 isolated from the Coliforms were partially identified as Citrobacter freundii variety 1 (45.09% of the isolated), C. freundii variety II (21.57%), Enterobacter aerogenes variety I (17.65%) and E. aerogenes variety II (15.69%); Staphylococcus sp. 3.93 x 10(6) MPN/g and all of its isolated (52) were coagulase negative. The mould population was 4.5 x 10(4) ufc/g, Penicillium sp., Aspergillus, sp., Fusarium sp. were partially identified. The salads presented a pH of 5.92 and an acidity of 0.78 ml of NaOH.
TI  - Cost-effective and rapid presumptive identification of gram-negative bacilli in routine urine, pus, and stool cultures: evaluation of the use of CHROMagar orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests.
AB  - The algorithm for a new identification system was designed on the basis of colony color and morphology on CHROMagar Orientation medium in conjunction with simple biochemical tests such as indole (IND), lysine decarboxylase (LDC), and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) utilization tests with gram-negative bacilli isolated from urine samples as well as pus, stool, and other clinical specimens by the following colony characteristics, biochemical reactions, and serological results: pinkish to red, IND positive (IND(+)), Escherichia coli; metallic blue, IND(+), LDC(+), and ODC negative (ODC(-)), Klebsiella oxytoca; IND(+), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Citrobacter diversus; IND(+) or IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(-), Citrobacter freundii; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(+), Enterobacter aerogenes; IND(-), LDC(-), and ODC(+), Enterobacter cloacae; IND(-), LDC(+), and ODC(-), Klebsiella pneumoniae; diffuse brown and IND(+), Morganella morganii; IND(-), Proteus mirabilis; aqua blue, Serratia marcescens; bluish green and IND(+), Proteus vulgaris; transparent yellow-green, serology positive, Pseudomonas aeruginosa; clear and serology positive, Salmonella sp.; other colors and reactions, the organism was identified by the full identification methods. The accuracy and cost-effectiveness of this new system were prospectively evaluated. During an 8-month period, a total of 345 specimens yielded one or more gram-negative bacilli. A total of 472 gram-negative bacillus isolates were detected on CHROMagar Orientation medium. For 466 of the isolates (98.7%), no discrepancies in the results were obtained on the basis of the identification algorithm. The cost of identification of gram-negative bacilli during this period was reduced by about 70%. The results of this trial for the differentiation of the most commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens in clinical specimens with the new algorithm were favourable in that it permitted reliable detection and presumptive identification. In addition, this rapid identification system not only significantly reduced costs but it also improved the daily work flow within the clinical microbiology laboratory.
TI  - Detection and distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria in the freshwater environment(1).
AB  - The distribution of insertion sequence 1 (IS1)-containing bacteria was investigated in Windermere (Cumbria, UK), a freshwater body impacted by treated sewage discharge and run-off from the surrounding catchment. Culturable IS1-containing bacteria were recovered from the water column at three depths in Windermere North Basin (WNB) and South Basin (WSB), and from sediment at both sites (at the sediment surface in WSB and to a depth of 12-13 cm in WNB). Polymerase chain reaction amplification of IS1 and the Escherichia coli/Shigella sp. specific gene uidA, from community DNA from shallow sediments, extended the detection limit beyond that of culture at both sites. This detection was extended further into deep sediment extracted from WNB as IS1 and uidA were detected in sub-samples to a depth of 4.7 and 2.3 m, respectively. Analysis of a representative subset of 90 IS1-carrying isolates recovered from water and sediment at both sites demonstrated 21 heterogeneous IS1 profiles with estimated copy numbers ranging from 1 to 16. Identification of the host bacteria showed that the element was confined mainly to Enterobacter spp. However, this study showed IS1 to be present in Citrobacter freundii for the first time. Plasmids were carried by 75.3% of enterobacterial isolates and four plasmids (2.6%) carried IS1. DNA sequence analysis of five IS1 clones demonstrated that IS1 isoforms from this study were similar (>89% nucleotide identity) to known IS1 isoforms. Two isoforms of IS1 from a single Enterobacter cloacae isolate differed by 6.7% at the nucleotide level suggesting that they had been acquired independently.
TI  - [The resistance of recent clinical isolates against isepamycin, other aminoglycosides and injectable beta-lactams].
AB  - Clinical isolates collected from clinical facilities across Japan in 1998 were tested against five aminoglycosides and three beta-lactams. The resistance of 50 strains each of methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Proteus sp. (P. mirabilis 25 strains and P. vulgaris 25 strains) to the aminoglycosides isepamicin (ISP), amikacin (AMK), gentamicin, tobramycin and dibekacin, and to the beta-lactams imipenem, ceftazidime and piperacillin (all three known to be effective against P. aeruginosa) were investigated using a micro liquid dilution method with the following results: 1. ISP was effective against all strains except for 14% of MRSA, 2% of Proteus sp., and 4% of P. aeruginosa. 2. Six strains of MRSA were resistant to all eight drugs; however, in these cases ISP exhibited a relatively low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared to the other compounds. 3. Four strains of MRSA were resistant to all drugs except ISP. MRSA was the only isolate to demonstrate a resistance to seven or more drugs. 4. Twenty-one strains of MRSA and 1 strain of P. aeruginosa were resistant to six drugs; however, all of these were susceptible to both ISP and AMK. 5. Against all strains tested, ISP generally exhibited a lower MIC compared to AMK. These results suggest that, even ten years after its entering the market, ISP is still an aminoglycoside having a high anti-bacterial activity against a wide range of clinical isolates.
TI  - The Yersinia high-pathogenicity island is present in different members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - A pathogenicity island termed high-pathogenicity island (HPI) is present in pathogenic Yersinia. This 35 to 45 kb island carries genes involved in synthesis, regulation and transport of the siderophore yersiniabactin. Recently, the HPI was also detected in various strains of Escherichia coli. In this study, the distribution of the HPI in the family Enterobacteriaceae was investigated. Among the 67 isolates pertaining to 18 genera and 52 species tested, nine (13.4%) harbored the island. These isolates were three E. coli, one Citrobacter diversus and five Klebsiella of various species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, Klebsiella ozaenae, Klebsiella planticola, and Klebsiella oxytoca). As in Yersinia sp., all nine isolates synthesized the HPI-encoded iron-repressible proteins HMWP1 and HMWP2. In the K. oxytoca strain, the right-end portion of the HPI was deleted, whereas the entire core region of the island was present in the eight other enterobacteria strains analyzed. In most of these isolates, the HPI was bordered by an asn tRNA locus, as in Yersinia sp. This report thus demonstrates the spread of the HPI among various members of the family Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Sub-MIC ciprofloxacin effect on fimbrial production by uropathogenic Escherichia  coli strains.
AB  - The urine from 210 patients with acute urinary tract infection (UTI) was examined to study the in vitro effect of ciprofloxacin on fimbriae production by uropathogenic Escherichia coli isolates. Forty-nine bacterial samples of density 10(5) CFU/ml were not considered. From the resulting 161 samples, E. coli was the major strain found, present in 54 samples. Other microoganisms found were: Enterococcus sp. (34 samples), Staphylococcus epidermis (22), yeasts (11), Proteus sp. (11), Pseudomonas sp. (11), Klebsiella sp. (8), Enterobacter sp. (6), Citrobacter sp. (3), and Acinetobacter sp. (1). The uropathogenic E. coli strains found were P-fimbriated, as demonstrated by hemoagglutination activity against human erythrocytes with and without mannose, SDS-PAGE of fimbrial proteins and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). All E. coli strains found were exposed in vitro to sub-inhibitory concentrations of ciprofloxacin (1/8 MIC). Our results showed that: 1) P-fimbriated E. coli is the most prevalent microorganism in acute UTI (34%); 2) exposure to sub-MICs of ciprofloxacin inhibits fimbrial production in 79% of E. coli strains; 3) the pattern of SDS-PAGE fimbrial proteins is modified after exposure; in particular, the most affected synthesis involves the protein at 18 kD known as P-fimbriae.
TI  - [Bacteriological and clinical break points: evaluation of the usefulness of cefozopran based on MIC].
AB  - Drug sensitivity of clinically isolated bacteria to cefozopran (CZOP), which is a new cephem antibiotic, was investigated, and the usefulness of the drug was evaluated from the viewpoint of bacteriological and clinical (pneumonia) break points. The following results were obtained. 1. According to bacteriological break points, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Enterococcus spp. showed low sensitivity to cefozopran (CZOP). However, the sensitivity of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), E. coli, and Klebsiella spp., which are often isolated as pathogens of common infections, was 100%, that of Enterobacter spp., Serratia sp., and Citrobacter sp. was 90% or higher, and that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa was 80% or higher; the values were comparable to or better than those for ceftazidime (CAZ). These results suggest a expanded antibacterial spectrum and enhanced antibacterial potency of CZOP. 2. The estimated response rate of pneumonia to CZOP was 87.5% in outpatients and 51.9% in inpatients. Therefore, CZOP is considered to be one of the first choices especially in outpatient empiric therapy.
TI  - The bacteriology of neonatal septicaemia in Ile-Ife, Nigeria.
AB  - The incidence of septicaemia among neonates categorized as being at high risk was 55 per cent in Ile-Ife, Nigeria. Gram-positive organisms, specifically Staphylococcus aureus, were predominant (33.8 per cent) among bacteria cultured from proven cases of septicaemia. Other coagulase-negative staphylococci also contributed 21 per cent, with Staphylococcus epidermidis occurring in 5 per cent of the isolates. Listeria monocytogenes was cultured from 8.4 per cent of septic neonates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was cultured from 3 per cent, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 14 per cent, and Escherichia coli from 7 per cent. Other Gram-negative bacilli cultured were Enterobacter aerogenes (5 per cent), Citrobacter freundii, Salmonella sp., and Proteus sp. (2 per cent each). The bacterial isolates were relatively resistant to antibiotics traditionally employed to treat cases of septicaemia. The study shows a high prevalence of neonatal bacterial sepsis at the centre and the emerging role of Listeria monocytogenes in the aetiology of neonatal sepsis. It highlights the preponderance of multiple antibiotic resistant organisms among these neonates early in life which is of epidemiological importance in the control of the infectious agents.
TI  - Clinical problems of sloths (Bradypus sp. and Choloepus sp.) in captivity.
AB  - A 20-yr retrospective study of disease prevalence was carried out for 51 sloths (34 Bradypus sp. and 17 Choloepus sp.) at the Sao Paulo Zoo. A total of 81 clinical disorders were detected, including nutritional (45.7%), digestive (12.3%), and respiratory (12.3%) problems and injuries (6.1%). A definitive diagnosis was not possible in 8.6% of the cases. The incidence of disease varied according to seasonal climate (winter, 32.5%; spring, 24%; summer, 22.9%; autumn, 20.5%), time in captivity (96.4% of diseases occurred within the first 6 mo and 3.6% occurred thereafter), and type of enclosure (quarantine cage, 96.4%; exhibition enclosure, 3.6%). Both young animals (86.7%) and adults (3.2%) were affected. Parasites were identified by fecal examination in 45.4% of animals with clinical illness (Ascaris sp., 80%; Coccidia sp., 20%). Bacteria such as Salmonella enteritidis, Escherichia coli, and Citrobacter freundii were isolated from feces and/or organs. The first 6 mo in captivity are critical for these animals. Proper management and early identification of medical conditions in captivity have implications for sloth population in the wild.
TI  - Cloning and expression in Escherichia coli of an azoreductase gene from Clostridium perfringens and comparison with azoreductase genes from other bacteria.
AB  - A genomic library of Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626 was constructed in phage lambda gt11 and screened with an antibody against the C. perfringens azoreductase, which catalyzes the reduction of azo dyes to aromatic amines. A positive recombinant phage, containing a 3.8 kb DNA fragment insert was selected and purified. Lytic and lysogenic Escherichia coli cultures infected with the recombinant phage had higher azoreductase activity than cultures infected only with the vector lambda gt11. The 3.8 kb DNA fragment was amplified by PCR and found to hybridize with one band from C. perfringens DNA digested with EcoR1, indicating the presence of a single copy of the azoreductase gene. The fragment also hybridized with DNA from other azoreductase-producing Clostridium species, a Eubacterium sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter amalonaticus and E. coli, but not with DNA from some other species of anaerobic bacteria capable of reducing azo dyes. The data indicate that the sequence of the azoreducatse gene of C. perfringens is conserved in some anaerobes and facultative anaerobes, but not in others, and that different types of azoreductase genes must be found in other anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - The use of Escherichia coli bearing a phoN gene for the removal of uranium and nickel from aqueous flows.
AB  - A Citrobacter sp. originally isolated from metal-polluted soil accumulates heavy  metals via metalphosphate deposition utilizing inorganic phosphate liberated via PhoN phosphatase activity. Further strain development was limited by the non-transformability of this environmental isolate. Recombinant Escherichia coli DH5 alpha bearing cloned phoN or the related phoC acquired metal-accumulating ability, which was compared with that of the Citrobacter sp. with respect to removal of uranyl ion (UO2(2+)) from dilute aqueous flows and its deposition in the form of polycrystalline hydrogen uranyl phosphate (HUO2PO4). Subsequently, HUO2PO4-laden cells removed Ni2+ from dilute aqueous flows via intercalation of Ni2+ into the HUO2PO4 lattice. Despite comparable acid phosphatase activity in all three strains, the E. coli DH5 alpha (phoN) construct was superior to Citrobacter N14 in both uranyl and nickel accumulation, while the E. coli DH5 alpha (phoC) construct was greatly inferior in both respects. Expression of phosphatase activity alone is not the only factor that permits efficient and prolonged metal phosphate accumulation, and the data highlight possible differences in the PhoN and PhoC phosphatases, which are otherwise considered to be related in many respects.
TI  - [Antibiotic sensitivity to isolated bacteria in pediatric urinary tract infections].
AB  - Of the childhood urinary tract infections, more than 50% are caused by Escherichia coli (E Coli), followed by Proteus mirabilis (P mirabilis), Klebsiella sp, other enterobacteria, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococci. Of E coli isolates, 50 to 60% are resistant to ampicillin (ampi-R), 10% being susceptible to amoxicillin + clavulanic acid (AMC). For P mirabilis, ampi-R isolates are less frequent and more often susceptible to AMC. Klebsiella sp is resistant to ampicillin, 75% of isolates being susceptible to AMC. In these three species, the susceptibility of isolates to third generation cephalosporins, aminogly-cosides, and ciprofloxacin is still high (> 90%), but 15 to 35% are resistant to cotrimoxazole. In the other enterobacteria (Enterobacter cloacae, Morganella morganii, P vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens) the resistance to cefalotin (hence to ampicillin and AMC) is permanent, with an exception: the susceptibility of P vulgaris to AMC. Enterococci are mostly susceptible to ampicillin, and P aeruginosa to ceftazidime, but in both species, the percentage of resistant strains in hospitalised patients is greater than in outpatients. For Staphylococcus aureus, the community-acquired isolates are susceptible to oxacillin and other anti-staphylococcal agents. All the coagulase negative staphylococci isolates are susceptible to vancomycin, but 70% of those from hospitalised patients are resistant to oxacillin, aminoglycosides and cotrimoxazole.
TI  - Coliforms and Salmonella in seawater near to domestic sewage sources in Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil).
AB  - The bacteriological conditions of the coastal region of Fortaleza (Ceara, Brasil), including the coastal zones of the Ceara and Coco rivers, were examined. The study was conducted during June, September and December 1993, and March 1994. The region was divided into two areas: (i) Direct Influence Area (DIA), consisting of 20 sampling stations located near to discharge zones of the submarine pipeline system, where collections were carried out at the surface, and (ii) Indirect Influence Area (IIA), located near to the coastal zone, including Barra do Ceara, Kartodromo, Volta de Jurema, Mucuripe, Farol and Caca e Pesca beaches, totalling 26 sampling stations. The most probable number (MPN) of both total and fecal coliforms in DIA was positive only in station number 6, near to the sewage discharge exit. The following bacteria were identified: Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter aerogenes and Escherichia coli. Kartodromo beach was contaminated throughout the sampling period. Results of total fecal MPN was essentially lower than 3.0 x 10(2) coliforms/100 ml at Caca e Pesca beach. In December, at both DIA and IIA, Salmonella was identified in several samples. In DIA, the spatial distribution for Salmonella suggests that there should be a coastal sea current from east to west along the coastline. In IIA, Salmonella was identified at Kartodromo and Farol beaches throughout the sampling period.
TI  - Purification and characterization of acid-type phosphatases from a heavy-metal-accumulating Citrobacter sp.
AB  - An acid phosphatase from a heavy-metal-accumulating strain of a Citrobacter sp. was resolved into two forms on the basis of their nonbinding (phosphatase I) or binding (phosphatase II) behaviour on the cation-exchange resin SP-Sephadex C50. Both holoenzymes had a molecular mass of 103-108 kDa as determined by Superose Q-6 column chromatography in the presence of 150 mM KCl and a subunit molecular mass of 27 kDa as determined by SDS-PAGE; the enzyme was tetrameric. Both enzymes had a pI approximately 9.0 and were immunologically cross-reactive. There were minor differences in amino acid composition and in peptide maps following tryptic digest. The pH optimum for phosphatases I and II was 5.5 and 6.25, respectively; phosphatase II alone retained activity at pH values up to 9.0. Phosphatase I was more resistant to mechanical shear, gamma-irradiation, high temperature, and toxins (F- and formaldehyde). Glycerol increased the thermostability of both enzymes, particularly the more thermosensitive phosphatase II. Phosphatase II had a lower Km and a lower Vmax for glycerol 2-phosphate hydrolysis. The production of enzyme isoforms is a phenomenon similar to that described previously for the alkaline phosphatase of Escherichia coli, where the isoforms relate to precursive and final processed forms of the enzyme. Acid phosphatase is physiologically distinct, with a role that is still obscure but that may relate to cellular stress responses.
TI  - Bacterial isolates from indigenous weaning foods in rural Ethiopian setting, Jimma Zone, south west Ethiopia.
AB  - A community based bacteriological study of weaning foods was conducted from November 1994 to August 1995 in six peasant associations, Jimma Zone. The households in the study community were found to be in poor sanitary conditions with cattle and pets living in the same room with humans, and the community gets water from unprotected sources. The predominant weaning foods in the study community were cereals. These and other foods given to weaning age children were found to be grossly contaminated, aerobic mesophilic bacterial counts being 10(5) cfu/ml of sample. The most frequent bacterial isolates were Enterobacter sp, Gram positive cocci including Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., and Escherichia coli in that order. Various factors such as unsafe water, unhygienic handling of food, storage of food at ambient temperature for a long time, poor domestic and personal hygiene may have contributed for the gross contamination of weaning foods in the study community. This calls for educating the community on the relationship between contamination of weaning foods and diarrhoeal diseases, and promoting measures such as reheating of weaning foods which have been kept at ambient temperature for a long time before serving infants and children.
TI  - The detection of verocytotoxins in bacterial cultures from human diarrhoeal samples with monoclonal antibody-based ELISAs.
AB  - Bacterial cultures from 1801 human diarrhoeal faecal specimens were examined for  verocytotoxins I and II by monoclonal antibody-based sandwich ELISAs. Of the 68 ELISA-positive cultures selected from initial screening, 32 were positive by ELISA on repeat or from freshly grown cultures. ELISA-positive pure cultures were obtained from 13 of these, of which seven were confirmed as verocytotoxin positive by cytotoxicity assay. These seven strains were typed as O26 (5) and O146 (2). The six false positive results were from isolates of Enterobacter sp. (1), Citrobacter Freundii (1) and Escherichia coli (4), one each of types O1, O18ac and O98 and an untypable strain. Despite the occurrence of false positive reactions, sandwich ELISA was a useful method for the rapid screening of samples, and detected verocytotoxin-positive E. coli strains, other than O157, from patients with clinical conditions in which they could be implicated.
TI  - [Enterobacteria in areas of water along the Crimean coast].
AB  - Characteristic of coliform bacteria in the coastal sea ecosystems is given. A decrease of Escherichia coli indicator value was ascertained and presence of Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter freundii was revealed, in the sea areas with high level of anthropogenic load. Wide distribution of bacteria of Enterobacter agglomerans kind was determined in the sea substrates and their stability to unfavourable influences was shown.
TI  - Aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the aerobic and anaerobic microbiologic characteristics of superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis. DESIGN: Retrospective review of microbiologic and clinical data. SETTING: Navy Hospital in Bethesda, Md. RESULTS: Sixty-one isolates, 36 aerobic and 25 anaerobic, were isolated from samples obtained from 42 patients. Aerobic bacteria only were found in 26 (62%) patients; anaerobic only, in 11 (26%); and mixed aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, in five (12%). The predominant aerobic bacteria were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 9), Escherichia coli (n = 7), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4), and Klebsiella sp (n = 3). The most frequently recovered anaerobic bacteria were Peptostreptococcus sp (n = 8), Propionibacterium acnes (n = 6), Bacteroides fragilis group (n = 5), Prevotella intermedia (n = 3), and Fusobacterium nucleatum (n = 3). Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus sp were associated with cannula-related superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis; B fragilis and Enterobacteriaceae, with abdominal surgery or pathology; and S aureus and P aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp, with burns. CONCLUSION: These data illustrate the importance of anaerobic bacteria in superficial suppurative thrombophlebitis.
TI  - SlyA, a regulatory protein from Salmonella typhimurium, induces a haemolytic and  pore-forming protein in Escherichia coli.
AB  - A chromosomal fragment from Salmonella typhimurium, when cloned in Escherichia coli, generates a haemolytic phenotype. This fragment carries two genes, termed slyA and slyB. The expression of slyA is sufficient for the haemolytic phenotype. The haemolytic activity of E. coli carrying multiple copies of slyA is found mainly in the cytoplasm, with some in the periplasm of cells grown to stationary phase, but overexpression of SlyB, a 15 kDa lipoprotein probably located in the outer membrane, may lead to enhanced, albeit unspecific, release of the haemolytic activity into the medium. Polyclonal antibodies raised against a purified SlyA-HlyA fusion protein identified the overexpressed monomeric 17 kDa SlyA protein mainly in the cytoplasm of E. coli grown to stationary phase, although smaller amounts were also found in the periplasm and even in the culture supernatant. However, the anti-SlyA antibodies reacted with the SlyA protein in a periplasmic fraction that did not contain the haemolytic activity. Conversely, the periplasmic fraction exhibiting haemolytic activity did not contain the 17 kDa SlyA protein. Furthermore, S. typhimurium transformed with multiple copies of the slyA gene did not show a haemolytic phenotype when grown in rich culture media, although the SlyA protein was expressed in amounts similar to those in the recombinant E. coli strain. These results indicate that SlyA is not itself a cytolysin but rather induces in E. coli (but not in S. typhimurium) the synthesis of an uncharacterised, haemolytically active protein which forms pores with a diameter of about 2.6 nm in an artificial lipid bilayer. The SlyA protein thus seems to represent a regulation factor in Salmonella, as is also suggested by the similarity of the SlyA protein to some other bacterial regulatory proteins. slyA- and slyB-related genes were also obtained by PCR from E. coli, Shigella sp. and Citrobacter diversus but not from several other gram-negative bacteria tested.
TI  - A comparative study of the BBL crystal enteric/nonfermenter identification system and the biomerieux API20E and API20NE identification systems after overnight incubation.
AB  - The BBL Crystal Enteric/Nonfermenter (Crystal, Becton Dickinson Microbiology Systems) is a new multi-test identification system for Gram negative rods requiring no oil overlay or addition of reagents. One hundred and three selected Gram negative rod isolates from routine clinical specimens were tested in parallel using the appropriate API20E or API20NE (BioMerieux) reading after overnight incubation. The isolates included in the study, and the number tested, were as follows: Acinetobacter sp, 8; Aeromonas hydrophila, 1; Citrobacter diversus, 1; Citrobacter freundii, 1; Escherichia coli, 13; Enterobacter aerogenes, 10; Enterobacter agglomerans, 2; Enterobacter cloacae, 6; Klebsiella oxytoca, 6; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 12; Morganella morganii, 2; Proteus mirabilis, 6; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 21; Salmonella sp, 2; Salmonella typhi, 1; Serratia marcescens, 1; Shigella sonnei, 2; Shigella sp, 2; Vibrio metschnikovii, 1; Xanthomonas maltophilia, 3; and, Yersinia enterocolitica, 2. The API20E and API20NE systems combined identified 74.8% (77/103) and the Crystal 97.1% (100/103) of isolates. Twenty six isolates required repeat and/or additional tests for correct identification with the API systems compared to 3 with the Crystal. Crystal is more convenient than API for routine clinical use because it requires fewer repeat and/or extra tests, and is easier and less time consuming to use.
TI  - Monoclonal antibodies that react with live Listeria spp.
AB  - Seven monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against Listeria spp. that were reactive with  live Listeria spp. were developed. Two of these MAbs (55-8 and 55-37) were members of the immunoglobulin M class, and all other MAbs were members of the immunoglobulin G class. MAb 55-23 reacted with 148 of 157 strains tested. MAb 34-51 reacted with serotype 1/2a, 1/2b, and 1/2c strains and exhibited a scattered reaction pattern with strains belonging to other serotypes. MAb 55-44 reacted with all of the strains belonging to serotype 4b tested. MAb 55-4 reacted with all of the serotype 1/2a isolates tested, although reactivity with other isolates also was observed. The other MAbs exhibited scattered reaction patterns. No correlation of reactivity pattern with serotype was found. Marked differences were observed between the reactivities of MAbs as determined by a magnetic immunoluminescence assay and a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Only MAb 55-23 exhibited minor reactivity with three Streptococcus spp. isolates, while no reactivity was observed with six Bacillus spp. strains, one Escherichia coli strain, and one Citrobacter sp. strain. In Western blots (immunoblots) MAbs 55-23, 55-44, and 34-9 exhibited reactivity; all other MAbs were negative in this assay.
TI  - Copper-resistant enteric bacteria from United Kingdom and Australian piggeries.
AB  - Thirty-three enteric isolates from Australian (Escherichia coli only) and United  Kingdom (U.K.) (Salmonella sp., Citrobacter spp., and E. coli) piggeries were characterized with respect to their copper resistance. The copper resistance phenotypes of four new Australian E. coli isolates were comparable with that of the previously studied E. coli K-12 strain ED8739(pRJ1004), in that the resistance level in rich media was high (up to 18 mM CuSO4) and resistance was inducible. Copper resistance was transferable by conjugation from the new Australian isolates to E. coli K-12 recipients. DNA similarity between the new Australian isolates and the pco copper resistance determinant located on plasmid pRJ1004 was strong as measured by DNA-DNA hybridization; however, the copper resistance plasmids were nonidentical as indicated by the presence of restriction fragment length polymorphisms between the plasmids. DNA-DNA hybridization and polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated DNA homology between the pco determinant and DNA from the U.K.E. coli, Salmonella sp., and Citrobacter freundii isolates. However, the copper resistance level and inducibility were variable among the U.K. strains. Of the U.K. E. coli isolates, 1 demonstrated a high level of copper resistance, 4 exhibited intermediate resistance, and 16 showed a low level of copper resistance; all of these resistances were expressed constitutively. A single U.K. C. freundii isolate, had a high level of copper resistance, inducible by subtoxic levels of copper. Transconjugants from one E. coli and one C. freundii donor, with E. coli K-12 strain UB1637 as a recipient, showed copper resistance levels and inducibility of resistance which differed from that expressed from plasmid pRJ1004.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Analysis of polar lipids from some representative enterobacteria, Plesiomonas and Acinetobacter by fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry.
AB  - Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry (FAB-MS) was used to analyse lipid extracts of bacteria to assess its usefulness for analysing anionic phospholipids of potential chemotaxonomic value. The following micro-organisms were tested: Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae (2 strains), Escherichia coli (3 strains), Hafnia alvei, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Plesiomonas shigelloides, Proteus mirabilis (3 strains), Serratia liquefaciens and Serratia marcescens. Negative-ion spectra provide data for twenty-seven major carboxylate anions (m/z 209-325) and for thirty-seven major phospholipid anions (m/z 645-774). Generally, the largest carboxylate peaks were due to 16:1, 16:0, cyc17 and 18:1 while the largest phospholipid anion peaks were due to PE(32:1), PE(33:1), PE(34:1), PE(34:2), PG(30:2), PG(31:2), PG(32:2), PG(34:1) and PS(33:0). However, quantitative differences were observed. For example, Acinetobacter lacked PE (33:1) but had exceptionally high peaks at m/z 748, PS(33:0), and m/z 281, octadecanoate. Unknown 'carboxylate' peaks were detected at m/z 254, 256, 261, 268, 282 and 301. In some cases, unknown peaks appeared to constitute possible homologous series being separated by delta m/z of 14(identical to methylene). For chemotaxonomic purposes, the complexity of the data required numerical analysis. Using the Pearson coefficient of linear correlation, as a measure of association, it was possible to compare all strains analysed. Typical results for strain comparisons were as follows: Ent. cloacae vs Ent. cloacae, r = 0.90 (Ent. cloacae vs Ac. calcoaceticus, r = 0.46). Thus FAB-MS represents an excellent means of obtaining large quantities of data on polar lipids of a range of bacterial isolates, which may be suitable for chemotaxonomic purposes.
TI  - Mobilization of nonconjugative pBR322-derivative plasmids from laboratory strains of Escherichia coli to bacteria isolated from seawater.
AB  - Mobilization of derivatives of plasmids pBR322 and pBR325 was shown to occur between Escherichia coli K12 strains in LB-broth at 37 degrees C, provided a mobilizer plasmid (F') was present either together with the nonconjugative plasmid or in a second donor strain. Evidence from restriction endonuclease analysis suggested that the mobilization was facilitated by a transposition phenomenon involving the "gamma-delta" sequence of F'. It was shown that mobilization of a derivative of pBR325 from E. coli K12 to bacteria isolated from seawater occurred in incubations in both LB-broth and filtered seawater and that Pseudomonas sp., Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, E. coli, and Citrobacter amalonaticus isolates were recipient-active.
TI  - Evaluation of coliforms as indicators of water quality in India.
AB  - The total and thermotolerant coliform counts in rural drinking water derived from ground water, piped supplies and surface water are reported for a number of areas in India. To evaluate these counts as indicators of recent faecal contamination the total coliforms and thermotolerant coliforms isolated have been identified. Thermotolerant Escherichia coli formed 11.7% of the total coliforms and 75.1% of the thermotolerant coliforms. Citrobacter sp. (20.4%) and Klebsiella sp. (50.9%) were the other common total coliforms isolated and, among the thermotolerant coliforms, Klebsiella sp. (16.4%) was the only other organism frequently encountered. The total coliform counts were significantly correlated with water temperature. The applicability in tropical areas of standards developed for temperate climates is discussed.
TI  - [Clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  - Fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (IPM/CS) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. There were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9 with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with fever of unknown origin. Forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. Clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. The overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. The efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. Bacteriologically, Staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (5), Streptococcus pyogenes (1), other Gram-positive coccus (1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8), Haemophilus influenzae (4), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), Serratia marcescens (3), Escherichia coli (3), Branhamella catarrhalis (1), Citrobacter freundii (1), Klebsiella oxytoca (1), Enterobacter sp. (1), and Peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. P. aeruginosa (3) and Acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. S. aureus (1), S. epidermidis (1), P. aeruginosa (5), and S. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. The eradication rate was 83.7%. Six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of S-GOT 2. But all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. These findings indicate that IPM/CS is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.
TI  - Antimicrobial contact activity of econazole sulfosalicylate.
AB  - The aim of this investigation was to compare the contact action of econazole sulfosalicylate (E-SSA) on mycetes (Candida albicans, Cryptococcus neoformans, Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton rubrum, T. cutaneum, Pityrosporum sp.), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis) and Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii) with that exerted by econazole nitrate (E-NIT). The results show E-SSA activity greater than E-NIT (in particular against mycetes and Gram-negative bacteria). The E-SSA contact activity trials illustrated certain properties of this imidazole sulfosolicylate such as: absence of latency time, antimicrobial activity proportional to its concentration, when a high concentration is used, given the limiting influence of pH and ionic strength of the medium. The higher E-SSA contact activity, in relation to E-NIT, can be correlated to its greater lipophylia considering also the lipophylic properties of SSA and the scarce dissociation of E-SSA.
TI  - Cefotaxime and aminoglycoside treatment of meningitis caused by gram-negative enteric organisms.
AB  - We reviewed cases of Gram-negative enteric bacillary meningitis in infants and children treated with cefotaxime at Texas Children's Hospital from January, 1984, through June, 1989. Seventeen of 20 children had an underlying condition predisposing to the development of meningitis. The etiologic organisms in these 20 children (2 days to 12 years old; median, 12 days old) were Klebsiella sp, 9; Escherichia coli, 4; Enterobacter cloacae, 3; Citrobacter diversus, 2; other, 2. With the exception of one isolate of Acinetobacter, all isolates were susceptible to cefotaxime. In addition to cefotaxime 17 children received an aminoglycoside intravenously. Children with meningitis caused by Klebsiella sp. or non-Klebsiella organisms received cefotaxime for 31 +/- 14 and 37 +/- 17 days, respectively. Aminoglycosides were administered for 16 +/- 10 days in both groups. Five children in each group also received intraventricular doses (1 to 25) of an aminoglycoside (9) or colistimethate (1). The mean durations of positive lumbar, ventricular cerebrospinal fluid or brain abscess cultures were 5.8 +/- 4.7 and 7.2 +/- 5.0 days after start of therapy in the Klebsiella and non-Klebsiella meningitis patients, respectively. Only three children were normal at the time of discharge or follow-up. Gram-negative enteric meningitis remains difficult to treat despite the excellent in vitro activity of cefotaxime against Gram-negative enterics, in part as a result of the predisposing conditions resulting in the development of this infection.
TI  - Infection with bacterial enteropathogens in Swedish travellers to South-East Asia--a prospective study.
AB  - Infection with potential bacterial enteropathogens was studied prospectively in 94 Swedish travellers. Three faecal samples were collected, regardless of diarrhoeal symptoms, after each of three 1-week stays in Singapore, Hong Kong and Japan. The specimens were analyzed for salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter and different enterotoxin-producing bacteria. A potential enteropathogen was identified in 30% (28/94) of the participants, i.e. in 26% of the healthy and in 39% of the travellers with diarrhoea. The most common isolates were enterotoxigenic bacteria of different species (14%), salmonella (11%) and campylobacter (7%). By performing enterotoxin-tests on six different colonies from the primary culture of each specimen enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) as well as enterotoxin-producing Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Morganella morganii were identified. The latter strains were as prevalent as ETEC. In the 33 participants with diarrhoea enterotoxigenic bacteria (18%) and campylobacter (18%) were the most common isolates. Campylobacter-infected travellers developed symptomatic disease (6/7) significantly (P less than 0.02) more often than those infected with salmonella (3/10) or enterotoxigenic bacteria (6/13; 2 ETEC, 4 other species).
TI  - [Effect of rokitamycin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Rokitamycin, a newly developed macrolide antibiotic was orally administered to 7  healthy male volunteers (22-25 years) for 7 consecutive days to study changes in bacterial flora and concentrations of the drug in feces, and to observe adverse reactions and laboratory test parameters. A dose of 200 mg (2 tablets: 100 mg/tablet) was given 3 times daily before meals and the fecal studies were done on the 5 days before administration (adm.) [b.a.], at the time of administration (0), and the 3rd, 5th, 7th (the final day of treatment) days during adm. [u.a.] and the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 20th, 30th days after adm. [a.a.]. The results obtained are summarized as follows. 1. Obvious changes in mean populations of total aerobes and enterobacteriaceae were not found. In changes of each bacteria of enterobacteriaceae, Escherichia coli was not observed in cases from initial day of treatment to the 3rd day a.a. Cases from which Citrobacter sp. was isolated tended to increase after 3 days u.a. and gradually decrease after 3 days a.a. Among Gram-negative bacilli, cases where isolation of Pseudomonas sp. was observed increased temporarily on the 3rd u.a., Gram-positive cocci did not show particular patterns of changes. No changes in mean count of total anaerobes were observed during the course of the experiment. Among individual anaerobes, numbers of Lactobacillus and Peptococcaceae decreased slightly from the 3rd day u.a. and returned on the 5th day a.a. 2. Clostridium difficile D-1 toxin was detected in feces at amounts approximately 500 ng/g in 2 cases each on 20th and 30th day a.a., with 1 incidence occurring in the same person on the 2 separate days. 3. The drug was detected in all 7 cases on the 3rd, 5th and 7th days u.a., and in 1 cases each on the 5th and the 30th day a.a. The mean peak level was 315.5 micrograms/g on the 7th day u.a. The reason for the detection of the drug in feces in 1 case on the 30th day a.a. at a value of 5.90 micrograms/g was not clear. 4. Adverse reactions and abnormal laboratory test results due to this drug were not observed in any cases.
TI  - Hemolysin as a marker for Serratia.
AB  - All Serratia marcescens strains (total of 33) of different sources were hemolytic including clinical strains previously classified as being nonhemolytic. DNA fragments of the two hemolysin genes hybridized with the chromosomal DNA of S. marcescens, S. liquefaciens, S. kiliensis, S. grimesii, S. proteamaculans, S. plymutica, S. rubridaea which were also hemolytic. The restriction pattern of the hemolysin locus differed in each strain. S. ficaria and S. marinorubra expressed a different hemolysin which was much smaller than the S. marcescens hemolysin since it diffused through dialysis membranes. The DNA of the latter strains did not hybridize with the S. marcescens hemolysin DNA probes. Some S. marcescens strains, S. kiliensis and S. liquefaciens also expressed in addition the small hemolysin. No hybridization was found with DNA of Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella arerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosus, Listeria sp., Aeromonas sp., Legionella sp. and a Meninococcus sp., indicating that the hemolysin DNA probes are specific for Serratia, or that the hemolysin genes occur rarely in genera other than Serratia.
TI  - Ticarcillin/clavulanate in the treatment of severe peritonitis.
AB  - A prospective study was performed on 50 consecutive patients with secondary peritonitis. All patients received ticarcillin/clavulanate 5.2 g three times daily as initial antibiotic therapy. In 30 patients a primary perforation was found in the gastro-intestinal tract and 20 had post-operative peritonitis. In two thirds of the patients a diffuse peritonitis was found which affected the whole abdomen. Thirty-six patients underwent one or two laparotomies and 11 patients had more than three laparotomies. Subsequently, 17 patients died. The cause of death was a therapeutic failure as a result of the surgical procedure in ten patients (nine patients with persisting intestinal fistulae, one patient with bleeding), whereas in seven cases antibiotic therapy failed. Micro-organisms found in the latter patients were producers of type 1 beta-lactamase (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter sp., Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens) and enterococci. Ticarcillin/clavulanate is characterized by its broad antimicrobial spectrum against anaerobic and aerobic bacteria and seems, therefore, to be well suited for initial chemotherapy in patients with diffuse peritonitis.
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro antibacterial activities of 9 antibiotics including aztreonam (AZT) against clinically isolated Gram-negative bacteria were determined using MIC-2000 plus system. Bacteria were isolated from clinical materials in Saga Medical School during a period from May 1987 to March 1988. Summarized results were as follows: 1. AZT showed excellent antibacterial activities against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus sp. and Haemophilus influenzae, and MIC80 values of AZT against these organisms were lower than 0.20 microgram/ml. 2. Antibacterial activities of AZT were superior to cephem antibiotics compared against Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. 3. The MIC50 and MIC80 of AZT against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 12.5 micrograms/ml and 25 micrograms/ml, respectively. 4. AZT did not show any antibacterial activity against Acinetobacter sp. and Xanthomonas maltophilia.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against multiresistant nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae.
AB  - Tigemonam, an oral monobactam that exhibits beta-lactamase stability similar to that of aztreonam, was tested in vitro against 240 species of Enterobacteriaceae (50 Escherichia coli, 48 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 52 Enterobacter cloacae, 32 Proteus mirabilis, 22 Proteus indole-positive [Providencia sp.], 24 Serratia sp., and 12 Citrobacter sp. All strains were resistant to ampicillin and first-generation cephalosporins. In addition, 77.4% were resistant to amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid, 46.8% to cefuroxime, 23.3% to ceftriaxone, 22.2% to aztreonam, 46.9% to cotrimoxazole, and 0.9% to norfloxacin. Tigemonam at a concentration of 4 micrograms/mL or less inhibited 72.7% of the strains with minimum inhibitory concentrations ranging from 0.03 or less to more than 512 micrograms/mL. The highest intrinsic activity was observed against Proteus sp. Tigemonam proved to be a bactericidal antibiotic. Cross-resistance was chiefly observed with aztreonam and ceftriaxone. It is concluded that tigemonam should play an important role in the treatment of nosocomial infections that do not require parenteral therapy and in the treatment of multiresistant community-acquired infections.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  - Tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. Thirty-two strains of Pseudomonas and 960 strains of Enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, and Salmonella enterica). Tigemonam displayed good activity against Enterobacteriaceae. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), were as follows: MIC50S were 0.01 mg/L for P. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/L for S. marcescens, MIC90S were 0.03 mg/L for P. mirabilis and P. vulgaris and 4 mg/L for Citrobacter freundii. Tigemonam inhibited E. coli and P. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. Despite MIC90S of 9.5 and 4 mg/L for Enterobacter and C. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. Tigemonam was found to be inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with MIC50S and MIC90S higher than 128 mg/L (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/L). Tigemonam's activity was found to be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. Of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against P. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (MIC90, 8 mg/L for norfloxacin; MIC50, 8 mg/L and MIC90, 32 mg/L for aztreonam). Cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the P. aeruginosa strains tested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of tigemonam dicholate (SQ 30836) and interaction with beta-lactamases of gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - SQ 30836 is an orally absorbed salt of tigemonam, a new monobactam similar to aztreonam in structure and microbiologic properties. When assayed against 400 clinical isolates, tigemonam's activity was similar to that of aztreonam and carumonam. It was highly effective against Enterobacteriaceae but showed poor activity against gram-positive organisms. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, Shigella, Yersinia, Proteus, Providencia, and Morganella strains at 0.5 micrograms/mL or less, and all Salmonella and Hafnia strains at 1 micrograms/mL or less. Citrobacter, Enterobacter, and Serratia strains were less susceptible (minimum inhibitory concentrations [MIC30] of 2, 32, and 8 micrograms/mL respectively). The activity of the new compound against Enterobacteriaceae is comparable with and often higher than that of third-generation cephalosporins and oral comparison compounds. In contrast to aztreonam, tigemonam had minimal activity against Pseudomonas sp and glucose nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria. Data suggest that poor penetration through the outer membranes of Pseudomonas sp may be responsible for this failure. Tigemonam was stable to hydrolysis by plasmid-mediated and chromosomal beta-lactamases. It was more stable than aztreonam to hydrolysis by the Kl enzyme of Klebsiella and by the Proteus vulgaris beta-lactamase. Also, measurement of the IC50 (concentration of inhibitor able to reduce the activity of the enzyme by 59%) showed that tigemonam has less affinity than aztreonam for class I cephalosporinases. However, only levels of beta-lactamase, not hydrolysis rates or affinity, correlated to MICs of the two monobactams for the resistant Enterobacter and Citrobacter strains.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Urinary tract infection.
AB  - Over two years, 9892 mid-stream urine samples from patients attending the Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi were cultured. Significant bacterial growth was seen in 23.5% samples. Further identification of these organisms revealed 40% of E. coli, 16% Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 11% Klebsiella aerogenes, 5.0% Enterobacter sp., 13% Proteus sp., 4.0% Serratia liquifaciens, 1.0% Acinetobacter sp., 3.0% Citrobacter sp., 4.0% Enterococci, 0.5% Staphylococcus aureus. Results of sensitivity tests performed with antibiotics Ampicillin, Cotrimoxazole, Nitrofurantoin, Nalidixic acid, Gentamicin, Amikacin, Pipemedic acid, Cefotaxime, Azactam and Carbenicillin did not reveal any distinct pattern.
TI  - [The rapid identification of E. coli by the detection of 3 enzymes].
AB  - 232 isolates of gram-negative, oxidase-negative bacteria, isolated from various samples of different animal species, were tested with help of RAPIDEC coli for the production of beta-glucuronidase, beta-galactosidase and indole. The test correctly identified 164 of 175 E. coli strains (sensitivity 93.7%) and correctly indicated that 57 of 57 isolates of the family Enterobacteriaceae (7 Citrobacter sp., 18 Enterobacter sp., 16 Klebsiella sp., 10 Proteus sp., 2 Providencia sp. and 4 Salmonella sp.) were not E. coli (specificity 100%).
TI  - [The rapid identification of Escherichia coli using Bactident E. coli].
AB  - 165 (93.7%) of 175 E. coli strains isolated from various materials of different animal species were correctly identified as E. coli with help of commercially available Bactident E. coli (E. Merck, D-6100 Darmstadt). Further 52 strains of the family of Enterobacteriaceae (2x Providencia sp., 2x Salmonella sp., 7 Citrobacter sp., 9 Proteus sp., 15 Klebsiella sp., 17 Enterobacter sp.) were correctly not identified as E. coli by this test. Bactident E. coli is a suitable test for rapid identification of E. coli in veterinary bacteriology.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - Survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  - The susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. Viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of Acanthamoeba castellanii and Tetrahymena pyriformis. Cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. Qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. Protozoa were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. Ingested coliforms Escherichia coli, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter agglomerans, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens Salmonella typhimurium, Yersinia enterocolitica, Shigella sonnei, Legionella gormanii, and Campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. Bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. All bacterial pathogens were greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by T. pyriformis. Escherichia coli ingested by a Cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. The mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within protozoan cells. This study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. This bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. We propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.
TI  - Lipid A precursor from Pseudomonas aeruginosa is completely acylated prior to addition of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate.
AB  - Inhibition of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa at the stage of incorporation of 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate (KDO) caused accumulation of a lipid A precursor which contained all of the fatty acids present on the lipid A of mature LPS. The enzyme CTP:CMP-3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate cytidylyltransferase (CMP-KDO synthetase) from P. aeruginosa is inhibited by the KDO analog alpha-C-[1,5-anhydro-8-amino-2,7,8-trideoxy-D-manno-octopyranosyl] carboxylate (I), and I is effectively delivered to P. aeruginosa following attachment by amide linkage to the carboxyl terminus of alanylalanine. Intracellular hydrolysis releases the free inhibitor (I) which then inhibits activation of KDO by CMP-KDO synthetase causing accumulation of lipid A precursor and subsequent growth stasis. The major lipid A precursor species accumulated was purified and found to contain glucosamine, phosphate, C12:O, 2OH-C12:O and 3OH-C10:0 (in ester linkage), and 3OH-C12:0 (in amide linkage) in molar ratios of 1:1:0.5:0.5:1:1. Analysis of precursor by fast atom bombardment mass spectroscopy yielded a major ion (M - H)- of mass 1616 and fragments which were consistent with the structure of lipid A from P. aeruginosa. In contrast, Salmonella typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae all accumulated underacylated lipid A precursors which only contained 3-OH-C14:0, glucosamine, and phosphate. This difference and species-specific patterns of major and minor precursor species show that early steps in the assembly of lipid A are similar, but not identical in enteric and nonenteric Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Carumonam's in-vitro activity against gram-negative bacteria and its stability to their beta-lactamases.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the novel monobactam carumonam (RO17-2301) was evaluated on 311 gram-negative clinical isolates in comparison to aztreonam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefotetan and ceftriaxone. Carumonam showed an antibacterial potency equal to or higher than any other reference compound; in particular it was the most effective against Proteus indole positive and Klebsiella sp. Its antipseudomonal activity was comparable to that of ceftazidime and it showed, together with aztreonam, the highest activity against the Citrobacter, Enterobacter and Escherichia coli isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations performed on permeability altered organisms indicated that carumonam has a penetration rate comparable to aztreonam and higher than cefotetan and ceftriaxone. Carumonam demonstrated excellent stability to chromosomal and plasmid-mediated beta-lactamases and that correlated with its antibacterial activity against the producing strains and inoculum size effect.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - [Effect of norfloxacin on bacterial flora in human feces].
AB  - Norfloxacin (NFLX), a synthetic oral antibacterial agent of quinolone carboxylic  acid, was given orally for 5 full days at a dose of 200 mg, three times daily after each meal to healthy normal men with ages between 22 and 25 years weighing 53.0 to 84.0 kg (average 67.0 kg). The actual regimen followed was that the drug was administered twice after lunch and supper on the first day of dosing, and once after breakfast on the last day of dosing. On the 5th day before the start of dosing, on the first, 3rd and 5th days (last dosing day) of dosing, and on the 3rd, 5th, 10th and 20th days after the end of dosing, effects of the drug on the fecal flora were examined and its fecal levels were determined. Susceptibilities against NFLX and nalidixic acid (NA) of various fecal isolates from 7 men were determined. Adverse effects and influences on clinical laboratory tests were also examined. The results obtained are summarized below. 1. Following the drug administration, a transient decrease or disappearance of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. of Enterobacteriaceae was noted. The 3 strains other than E. coli were isolated from increasing number of cases after the end of dosing. No constant trend was observed in the isolation of Proteus sp. Organisms belong to Enterobacteriaceae were isolated only in 4 and 2 cases after 3 and 5 days of the start of dosing, respectively, but then gradually increased to the predose level. Among other Gram-negative bacteria, no constant trend was noted in the isolation frequency of Plesiomonas sp. Pseudomonas sp. was isolated from 6 and 5 cases on the 3rd day after dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, respectively; the frequency of isolation increased after dosing. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus sp. were isolated with a reduced frequency on the 3rd day of dosing. However, the number of isolates increased in all cases both on the 5th day of dosing and on the 3rd day after the end of dosing, and then decreased. No change was noticed in the number of isolates of Enterococcus sp., and no constant trend was observed for Micrococcus sp. and YLO. The average count of the whole aerobic bacteria did not change. Some strains decreased significantly after the start of dosing. 2. Among anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides were isolated on every test day.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - [Susceptibility of clinical bacterial isolates to aztreonam].
AB  - In vitro activities of 7 antimicrobial agents against organisms (474 strains) isolated from patients with various infections in Ehime University Hospital from May to July 1986 were investigated. Summarized results are as follows: 1. Aztreonam (AZT) showed potent activities against Escherichia coli, Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Proteus sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae. 2. Antimicrobial activities of AZT were especially superior against Proteus sp. to the third generation cephem antibiotics. 3. Enterobacter sp. seemed more susceptible to AZT than to cephem antibiotics, but minimum inhibitory concentrations of AZT against may isolates of Enterobacter sp. were in wide ranges.
TI  - Bacterial survey of well water--Tehran, Iran.
AB  - One hundred twenty-one wells throughout the city of Tehran were monitored during  the four seasons of the year for the presence of bacterial indicators of fecal pollution. None of the sites monitored was connected to Tehran's main water distribution system but represented drinking water sources for small communities, individual factories, hospitals, etc. Only 17 samples showed no indication of fecal bacterial contamination throughout the study. The remaining sites were positive for at least one of the following at some season of the year: Escherichia coli, Shigella sp., Citrobacter sp., Klebsiella-Enterobacter group, Clostridium perfringens, or Streptococcus faecalis.
TI  - Occurrence of multiple antibiotic resistance and R-plasmids in gram-negative bacteria isolated from faecally contaminated fresh-water streams in Hong Kong.
AB  - The bacterial populations of six freshwater streams in populated areas of the Hong Kong New Territories were studied. There is considerable faecal contamination of these streams, with coliform counts as high as 10(5) c.f.u./ml and the contaminating organisms show a high prevalence of antibiotic resistance and multiple resistance. With direct plating of water samples onto antibiotic-containing media, an average of 49% of the gram-negative bacteria were ampicillin-resistant, 3% chloramphenicol-resistant and 1% gentamicin-resistant. At individual sites resistance to these drugs was as high as 98%, 8% and 3% respectively. More than 70% of strains were resistant to two or more antibiotics, 29% to five or more and 2% to eight or more. A total of 98 patterns of antibiotic resistance were detected with no one pattern predominating. Twenty-eight gram-negative bacterial species were identified as stream contaminants. Escherichia coli was the commonest bacterial species isolated and other frequent isolates were Enterobacter sp., Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp., but no enteric pathogens were detected. The greatest prevalence of resistance and multiple resistance was associated with the heaviest contamination by E. coli. Analysis of selected stream isolates revealed multiple plasmid bands arranged in many different patterns, but multiple antibiotic resistances were shown to be commonly mediated by single transferable plasmids. Faecally-contaminated freshwater streams in Hong Kong may be reservoirs of antibiotic resistance plasmids for clinically-important bacteria.
TI  - Inhibition of colonization of the chicken alimentary tract with Salmonella typhimurium gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Oral administration of strains of food poisoning salmonellas to day-old chickens  produced a profound inhibition in the subsequent colonization of the caeca by a strain of Salmonella typhimurium given one day later. Closely related genera were unable to produce a similar inhibition. The inhibition was not the result of bacteriophages produced by the first strain. Neither was it the result of an immunological response by the host induced by the first strain. In additional experiments in day-old chickens, inhibition of an Escherichia coli Nalr strain and of a Citrobacter sp. Nalr strain was produced by the antibiotic-sensitive forms of the homologous strains while strains from other genera did not produce any inhibition. When an avirulent mutant of S. typhimurium was used for pre-treatment a statistically significant reduction in the excretion of the super-infecting S. typhimurium Nalr strain over several weeks was produced. A genus specific inhibition was reproduced in vitro by mixed culture experiments. Live cultures were necessary for in vitro inhibition. Killed cells or a culture supernatant produced no inhibition.
TI  - A comparative study of the sensitivity of bacteria of various origin to ofloxacin.
AB  - The sensitivity of 6 antimicrobials (chloramphenicol, tetracycline, ampicillin, cephalothin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and ofloxacin) was tested on 174 bacteria isolated from three sources: 60 from wounds, 84 from urine and 30 from bronchial excretions. Hospital-borne bacteria were compared to those of non-hospital origin for their susceptibility. Consecutively, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (24 strains), Escherichia coli (58), Klebsiella sp. (13), Enterobacter sp. (3), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterococcus sp. (25) and Staphylococcus sp. (48) were tested. With the exception of 7.1% of bacteria (Enterococcus) isolated from urine, 96.6% of all strains tested were sensitive to ofloxacin.
TI  - [Practical recommendations for examining the pulmonary pleura of fetuses and newborn infants using contact microscopy].
AB  - It has been found that the pleura visceralis of fetuses and neonates is consistently involved in inflammatory processes occurring in pneumonias caused by Gram-negative organisms (Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia marcescens) and may display signs of infection when the pneumonia is not yet apparent. This property of the pleura as a filtration membrane may help the pathologist in the early diagnosis of infectious disorders in neonates. Recommendations are given on the excision of pulmonary pleura and the staining of its preparations for contact microscopy whereby these can be examined during or shortly after the autopsy. Morphologic features of the infections caused by the indicated organisms are detailed. Citrobacter infections, for example, show a preponderance of macrophage responses, Klebsiella-caused lesions are characterized by involvement of the lymphatic bed, while those due to S. marcescens have hemolysis in the lung tissue and pleura as their main feature.
TI  - Premarket evaluation of IDS RapID SS/u system for identification of urine isolates.
AB  - A total of 170 fresh clinical urine isolates were tested with a premarket configuration of the RapID SS/u system (Innovative Diagnostic Systems, Inc., Atlanta, Ga.), a qualitative micromethod for the identification of selected organisms commonly isolated from urine specimens. Results were compared with those obtained with conventional methods of identifying gram-positive isolates and with the AutoMicrobic system (Vitek Systems, Inc., Hazelwood, Mo.), utilizing Gram-Negative Identification cards for the identification of gram-negative rods. Organisms representing 12 taxa were included in the study. Of the 170 isolates, 163 (95.9%) were correctly identified. A total of 144 strains (84.7%) were correctly identified without additional testing, whereas 19 isolates (11.2%) required further testing. Seven isolates (4.1%) were incorrectly identified. The SS/u system required minimal hands-on time inoculate and interpret reactions. Discrepancies most often occurred with regard to misinterpretation of Escherichia coli and Enterobacter sp. as Citrobacter sp. The IDS RapID SS/u system may indeed prove valuable for the rapid manual identification of urine isolates.
TI  - [Pyogenic hepatic abscess].
AB  - Ten patients, 6 men and 4 women, with a mean age of 53 years, having pyogenic liver abscess, were studied to review the principal features of the clinical and bacteriological diagnosis. In 9 cases the abscess was located in the right hepatic lobe. Bacteriological diagnosis was made in 6 cases: the etiology was nonmicrobian in 3 and two microorganisms were found in the other 3 cases. The isolated pathogens were: Escherichia coli (3 cases), Staphylococcus sp (3 cases), Enterobacter agglomerans (1 case), Citrobacter sp (1 case), Streptococcus sp (1 case). The basic clinical pattern included fever in 9 patients, pain in upper right side of the abdomen in 8, jaundice in 5 and respiratory symptoms in 5. In 2 cases the diagnosis was confirmed by ultrasonography, in 2 by scintigraphy and in 3 both methods were used. Surgical drainage was practiced in 7 patients, with favorable course in 6. Three patients were not operated; 2 died and the third was cured with medical treatment. The importance of the clinical suspicion even with few data is pointed out, specially prolonged fever with painful syndrome in upper right side of the abdomen. The aid of the diagnosis imaging is valuable for verification. The precise bacteriological diagnosis by culture of the material obtained in surgery or by percutaneous drainage of the abscess allows the selection of the most suitable antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Use of aztreonam in patients suffering from urinary tract infections with contraindications for the use of aminoglycosides.
AB  - The clinical efficacy and safety of aztreonam were studied in 30 patients suffering from urinary tract infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. Aztreonam was given in a dose of 1 g i.m. at intervals of 12 or 24 hours. Duration of therapy was 2-8 days. Bacteria isolated in urine cultures were: Escherichia coli (60%); Proteus mirabilis (10%); Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Citrobacter sp. (7%); Proteus vulgaris, Serratia marcescens; Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas species (3%). At completion of therapy and at follow-up all patients were bacteriologically and clinically cured. No significant side effects or toxicity were observed in all patients treated. It is concluded from these data that aztreonam is highly effective and well tolerated in patients affected either by upper or lower urinary tract infections.
TI  - [Antibacterial activity of cephem antibiotics against isolates from clinical specimens at the Yokohama City University Hospital].
AB  - Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cephem antibiotics against 405 strains belonging to 17 species of clinical isolates were investigated using the standard method of the Japanese Congress of Chemotherapy. The results obtained are summarized below. Cephem antibiotics showed weak antibacterial activities against Enterococcus sp., B. fragilis and S. marcescens. S. pneumoniae, S. agalactiae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis were susceptible to cephem antibiotics. Cephem antibiotics of the 1st and the 2nd generations showed weak antibacterial activity against Citrobacter sp. and E. cloacae, while cephem antibiotics of 3rd generation had a good antibacterial activity against these species. Cephem antibiotics of the 2nd and the 3rd generations showed high antibacterial activity against H. influenzae and indole positive Proteus group. Cefoperazone showed high antibacterial activity against P. aeruginosa. Resistance to latamoxef, ceftizoxime and cefoxitin was observed among Staphylococcus sp., while the MICs of other antibiotics against Staphylococcus sp. were fairly low. Number of strains resistant to the 3rd cephem antibiotics seems to be increasing because the 3rd generation of cephem antibiotics have been used frequently. Further investigation will be required on resistant organism to these antibiotics including beta-lactamase producing strains.
TI  - In vitro activity of aztreonam against gram negative bacteria from clinical specimens and its comparison with other commonly used antibiotics.
AB  - A total of 755 gram negative bacteria isolated from clinical specimens were tested against aztreonam by the disc agar diffusion test. The strains of bacteria used in this study consisted of Escherichia coli (314), Enterobacter aerogenes (30), E. agglomerans (7), E. cloacae, (39), Citrobacter diversus (9), C. freundii (13), Hafnia alvei (3), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (10), Klebsiella oxytoca (6), K. ozaenae (5), K. pneumoniae (107), Morganella morganii (3), Moraxella sp. (10), Pasteurella multocida (1), Proteus mirabilis (66), P. vulgaris (4), Providencia rettgeri (12), P. stuartii (5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (85), P. fluorescens (2), P. maltophila (7), Salmonella sp. (1) and Serratia marcescens (17). In vitro activity against aztreonam was compared with amikacin, ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalosporin, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, gentamicin, nitrofurantoin, piperacillin, tetracycline, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim and tobramycin. Over 99% of E. coli and Enterobacter species were susceptible to aztreonam. All the 118 strains of Klebsiella, 87 strains of Proteus-Providencia and 17 strains of S. marcescens were also susceptible. Aztreonam also showed good activity against P. aeruginosa, inhibiting 90% of the 85 isolates tested.
TI  - In vitro activity of ciprofloxacin compared with other agents against recent hospital isolates.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin's in vitro activity was tested against 385 hospital isolates originating from three geographically distinct regions. Of all strains tested, only three (1 Acinetobacter sp. and 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa) were ciprofloxacin resistant. Ciprofloxacin was more active against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Acinetobacter sp., Proteus sp., Shigella sp. than gentamicin, mezlocillin and cefotaxime. It was more active than azlocillin and cefsulodin against P. aeruginosa. It was more active than cloxacillin and cefamandole against staphylococci. It was as active as cefotaxime against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens. Ciprofloxacin demonstrated similar activity in broth and solid agar. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC's) of all strains were similar to the minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBC's). Ciprofloxacin's MIC was not influenced by increase of the inoculum or addition of human serum and only slightly influenced by anaerobic conditions. Decrease of the medium pH increased the MIC substantially. Ciprofloxacin exhibited a rapid bactericidal effect and had only a minimal post-antibiotic effect. These favorable in vitro characteristics of ciprofloxacin warrant further studies.
TI  - In-vitro activity of ofloxacin, a quinolone carboxylic acid compared to other quinolones and other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Ofloxacin is a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound. Its activity against 900 bacterial isolates was determined. It inhibited 90% of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Citrobacter spp., Enterobacter spp., Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica at less than or equal to 0.8 mg/l. Branhamella catarrhalis, Haemophilus sp., Neisseria sp. were inhibited by less than or equal to 0.1 mg/l. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other Pseudomonas species were inhibited by less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. Although most staphylococcal species, including methicillin-resistant staphylococci were inhibited by 3.1 mg/l, many streptococcal species had higher MIC values, and most Bacteroides species were inhibited at less than or equal to 6.3 mg/l. The overall activity of ofloxacin was similar to enoxacin and norfloxacin. Ofloxacin inhibited organisms resistant to nalidixic acid, ampicillin, cephalexin, piperacillin, and gentamicin including Enterobacter spp., Citrobacter freundii and Serratia marcescens resistant to cefotaxime. The activity of ofloxacin was lower at an acid pH and in urine, but serum had no effect on MICs or MBCs. Increase in ofloxacin MICs for various bacteria could be achieved by repeated subculture in the presence of ofloxacin.
TI  - [Laboratory and clinical studies on cefminox].
AB  - Laboratory and clinical studies were performed on cefminox (CMNX, MT-141), a new  cephamycin antibiotic, and results were as follows. Antimicrobial activities. MICs of CMNX against various clinical isolates were determined with the inoculum size of 10(6) cells/ml. Percentages of strains susceptible to 12.5 micrograms/ml or less were 4% for S. aureus, 0% for E. faecalis, 100% for E. coli, 81% for K. pneumoniae, 3% for Enterobacter sp., 18% for S. marcescens, 90% for P. mirabilis, 88% for indole-positive Proteus sp. 100% for S. flexneri, 100% for Salmonella sp., 0% for Citrobacter sp. and 0% for P. aeruginosa. Most of those sensitive strains were inhibited by 0.39-0.78 microgram/ml. These activities were better than those of cefmetazole and cefazolin, but were not as good as those of cefoperazone. Clinical efficacy Three patients with pneumonia, 1 with pneumonia and sepsis, and 1 with urinary tract infection were treated with CMNX daily dose of 1-4 g for 7-31 days. Clinical responses were excellent in 1, good in 3, poor in 2 patients (contained a double case). Bacteriological effects were good for E. coli, K. pneumoniae and S. liquefaciens, poor for P. aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. C. freundii, A. calcoaceticus and E. faecalis were cultured after treatment. No side effect and no abnormal change of laboratory findings were seen in our cases.
TI  - [Effects of KS-R1 (ampicillin suppository) and ampicillin oral dosing on fecal flora of children].
AB  - A newly developed product, KS-R1 (a suppository containing 250 mg potency of ampicillin (ABPC)), was given to 7 children (5 boys and 2 girls) ranging from 4 years and 5 months to 8 years and 10 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 62.4 mg/kg) for 5 days. As a control, the same amount of ABPC dry syrup was given orally to 7 children (4 boys and 3 girls) ranging from 2 years and 8 months to 7 years and 7 months in age, 3 times a day (average daily dose, 55.3 mg/kg) for 5 days. The effects of these 2 preparations on the bacterial flora of the feces were investigated, and concentrations of ABPC in the feces and sensitivities of the isolated strains to ABPC were determined. The results were as follows. As for Gram-negative bacilli in the feces from children given KS-R1, there was no change in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp. and Enterobacter sp. which were isolated from many children 3 days after the end of treatment, but they did not show any constant pattern of change in mean number. Other species did not show any pattern of increase in the number of children from whom they were isolated, or in the number of bacteria during the course after the beginning of treatment. The total number of bacteria identified as Enterobacteriaceae was at the level of 10(8) cells/g on any day of examination. Of Gram-negative bacilli other than Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas sp. showed no constant pattern of change in number. On the other hand, of Gram-positive bacteria, there was no constant pattern of change in the number of Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci began to be isolated from many children 5 days after the beginning of treatment and were isolated from all children 5 days after the end of treatment, but there was no tendency for the mean number to increase. Enterococcus sp. was not isolated from 3 children 3 days after the beginning of treatment, and was decreased in number by one order in 3 out of other 4 children as compared with before-treatment. However, this species was isolated from all children 3 days after the end of treatment, and the mean number of bacteria was similar to that before-treatment although the number of bacteria was different in individual children.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - In vivo antibacterial activity of cefodizime, a new cephalosporin antibiotic.
AB  - The in vivo activity of cefodizime (HR 221) was compared with that of cefotaxime  (CTX), cefmenoxime, latamoxef, cefazolin and cefmetazole (CMZ). The protective effects of HR 221 on experimental infections in mice caused by Staphylococcus aureus Smith, Escherichia coli C-11, Proteus vulgaris GN-76 and Serratia marcescens No. 2 were directly related to its in vitro activity against these strains. In contrast, the compound showed the smallest ED50 values, among the 5 antibiotics tested (not including CMZ), for Klebsiella pneumoniae 3K-25 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa PI 67 against which it had relatively low in vitro activity, and its ED50 for Citrobacter freundii GN-346 was as small as 1.821 mg/mouse in spite of its MIC of greater than 100 micrograms/ml. HR 221 exerted potent bactericidal activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae Sp-1 inoculated into the mouse lung; the duration of action was prolonged. When tested against the E. coli Ec-89 infection induced in the rat uterus, the activity of HR 221 given to rats once daily was equal to that of CTX or CMZ given at the same dose twice daily.
TI  - Cefoperazone in the treatment of postsurgical wound infection, sepsis, and abscess of the spinal cord and brain.
AB  - Cefoperazone was used in the treatment of 23 cases of serious bacterial infection in 20 patients. Ten postoperative scalp wound infections, five infections at the site of tracheostomy, four cases of extradural spinal cord abscess, three cases of sepsis, and one abscess of the cerebellopontine angle were treated with cefoperazone (1 to 2 gm BID, usually for seven to 27 days). There were excellent or good clinical responses in 87% (20/23) of the cases (14 of the 15 postsurgical wound infections, three of the four cases of spinal cord abscess, and all three cases of sepsis). Most of the organisms isolated from the patients' cultures were sensitive to cefoperazone. Excellent or good responses occurred in ten of the 12 infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, in all three infections due to Pseudomonas sp, all three due to Citrobacter freundii, the two due to Serratia marcescens, one of the two due to Klebsiella sp, and the one due to Escherichia coli. Two patients with ventriculitis were clinically improved by three 1-gm infusions, via a shunt, of cefoperazone. No adverse effects of the antibiotic therapy were reported.
TI  - Inhibitory and bactericidal activities of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid, compared with those of seven other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - The activity of amifloxacin, a new quinolone carboxylic acid compound, against 147 strains of microorganisms was studied and was compared with the activities of cinoxacin, trimethoprim, amikacin, and four beta-lactam antimicrobials. The minimal concentration at which 90% of strains were inhibited by amifloxacin was lowest for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella sp (less than or equal to 0.125 microgram/ml), followed by Proteus sp (less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml), Enterobacter sp and Citrobacter sp (less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml), Providencia sp (less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia sp, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus var anitratus (less than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml). When compared with the ranges of activity of seven reference antimicrobials, the range of amifloxacin activity was lowest for P aeruginosa, Citrobacter sp, Proteus sp, and A calcoaceticus var anitratus and similar to aztreonam's activity against Enterobacter sp. For amikacin-resistant P aeruginosa, the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of amifloxacin ranged from 1 to 16 micrograms/ml. The MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of amifloxacin were similar. For all strains tested, microbial susceptibilities to amifloxacin were greater than those to currently available oral antimicrobial drugs, such as cinoxacin and trimethoprim.
TI  - Efficacy of ceftizoxime administered twice daily in hospitalized patients with respiratory tract infections.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ceftizoxime administered twice daily were evaluated in 215 hospitalized patients with documented lower respiratory tract infections. The majority of patients received 1 to 2 gm of ceftizoxime intramuscularly or intravenously every 12 hours; the mean dosage was 2 gm/day, and the mean duration of therapy was 8.9 days. Clinical cure was achieved in 204 (95%) of the 215 patients with lower respiratory tract infection. One hundred and thirty-eight patients were both clinically and bacteriologically evaluable. The clinical response rates, by organism, were: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100% (50/50); Haemophilus influenzae, 96% (25/26); gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Enterobacter sp, Serratia sp, Pseudomonas sp, Klebsiella sp, Citrobacter sp, and Morganella morganii), 86% (32/37); and Staphylococcus aureus, 92% (12/13). In the other 77 patients with clinical symptoms, no pathogen was isolated or insufficient follow-up data were collected to assess bacteriologic response. Adverse reactions, which were infrequent, were similar to those reported in other US trials of the drug. The findings indicate that ceftizoxime, 1 to 2 gm BID, is effective and safe in the treatment of lower respiratory tract infections in hospitalized patients. This low-dose regimen can significantly reduce the cost of cephalosporin therapy.
TI  - [TEM-type beta-lactamase coded by the plasmid from Citrobacter sp].
AB  - beta-Lactamase was isolated from the cells of E. coli, strain 1039, a transconjugant carrying the plasmid first detected in Citrobacter sp. beta-Lactamase was purified to obtain a homogeneous preparation. The activity of the enzyme was estimated by a modification of the potentiometric method providing determination of up to 0.1 mumol of penicilloinic acid. The activity of the pure enzyme was 206 mumol per 1 mg of protein per minute. The molecular weight determined by gel filtration was 21500. The substrate profile of beta-lactamase corresponded to the TEM type. Preliminary incubation with methicillin resulted in a significant decrease in the enzyme activity. Carbenicillin, dicloxacillin, oxacillin and cephalothin induced no decrease in the activity of the enzyme when subjected to preliminary incubation with it. The use of the functional group reagents allowed detecting residues of serine and lysine in the enzyme active centre or close to it. Km and Kcat for some antibiotics were evaluated. The ratio of alpha- and beta-structures in the molecule of beta-lactamase was determined with the method of circular dichroism (CD). The fraction of the alpha-spiral areas amounted to 30 +/- 5 per cent and the fraction of beta-structures amounted to 20 +/- 5 per cent. On attachment of methicillin to the molecule of the enzyme the ratio of alpha- and beta-structures did not change which may be considered as a preliminary indication of the centre "immobility" in the process of catalysis. Slow hydroysis of methicillin by beta-lactamase was shown with the method of CD.
TI  - Isolations of aerobic bacteria from wild desert bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni and O. c. mexicana) in Arizona.
AB  - Nasal, pharyngeal, cervical and vaginal swab specimens were obtained from 74 desert bighorn sheep for the purpose of investigating the normal aerobic bacterial flora of wild sheep. A total of 281 isolates was obtained and identified by standard microbiologic tests. One hundred seven of these isolates were gram positive and included Bacillus sp. (36%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (8%), S. aureus (4%), Corynebacterium sp. (diphtheroids, 4%), and Streptococcus sp. (48%). gram negative isolates totaled 174 and included Neisseria sp. (18%), Citrobacter sp. (3%), Enterobacter sp. (2%), Escherichia coli (2%), Proteus sp. (2%) and non-fermentative bacilli (NFB) (73%). Of the NFB isolates, Pseudomonas sp. (25%), Acinetobacter sp. (18%), Moraxella sp. (15%) were identified.
TI  - Plasmids encoding trimethoprim resistance in bacterial isolates from man and pigs.
AB  - Trimethoprim (Tp) resistant Gram negative bacteria were isolated from humans and  pigs. The bacterial hosts were characterized by their resistance pattern and biotype. The presence of transferable Tp plasmids was demonstrated in 86% of 59 porcine isolates and 37% of 49 human isolates. The Tp R-plasmids carried a diversity of resistance determinants such as Tc, Cm, Sp, Sm and Su. Incompatibility tests distinguished two major groups, Inc FIV and Inc N. Thirty of 99 Tp R-plasmids isolated from humans were grouped as Inc FIV and eight as Inc N. The results of molecular weight determination of Tp R-plasmids performed by agarose gel electrophoresis were consistent with the existence of two groups--larger R-plasmids (76 to 104 Md) belonging to Inc FIV and lower molecular weight R-plasmids (25 to 35 Md) belonging to Inc N. Results from this study indicate that the Tp R-plasmids isolated in Perth have evolved independently from those described in Europe and the United Kingdom. There is also evidence for their local spread between Escherichia, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter and Acinetobacter from man and animals.
TI  - In vitro activity of new cephalosporins against multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro sensitivities of 47 multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli against six third generation cephalosporins were investigated. Overall, moxalactam was the most active compound and cefoperazone the least active. Ceftizoxime and ceftazidime were very active against Enterobacteriaceae. Ceftriaxone and ceftizoxime were active against Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp., but were inactive against Pseudomonas spp.; Achromobacter sp. was resistant to all drugs, while Citrobacter freundii was sensitive to every antibiotic tested. These drugs may be clinically useful in infections with multi-resistant gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel.
AB  - A quantitative culture technique (hand washed in a glove containing broth for 30  s) was used to determine the frequency of hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by various groups of health care workers and 104 control subjects. Overall, 31% of health care workers carried aerobic Gram-negative rods on their hands compared to 59% of control subjects (P < 0.001). Enterobacter agglomerans accounted for 40% of the isolates, and other Enterobacter spp. 7%. Other organisms included Acinetobacter calcoaceticus 21%, Serratia spp. 11%, Klebsiella spp. 10%, Moraxella spp. 3%, Pseudomonas spp. 3%, Proteus spp. 1.5%, Escherichia coli 1%; Morganella morganii, Citrobacter freundii, Aeromonas sp. and an isolate that was not speciated accounted for 0.5% each. We conclude that endemic hand carriage of aerobic Gram-negative rods by health care personnel is common, but significantly less than that of control subjects. Enterobacter agglomerans is found so frequently on the hands of control subjects that it must be considered part of the normal hand flora.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - Dissimilatory Reduction of NO(2) to NH(4) and N(2)O by a Soil Citrobacter sp.
AB  - Dissimilatory reduction of NO(2) to N(2)O and NH(4) by a soil Citrobacter sp. was studied in an attempt to elucidate the physiological and ecological significance of N(2)O production by this mechanism. In batch cultures with defined media, NO(2) reduction to NH(4) was favored by high glucose and low NO(3) concentrations. Nitrous oxide production was greatest at high glucose and intermediate NO(3) concentrations. With succinate as the energy source, little or no NO(2) was reduced to NH(4) but N(2)O was produced. Resting cell suspensions reduced NO(2) simultaneously to N(2)O and free extracellular NH(4). Chloramphenicol prevented the induction of N(2)O-producing activity. The K(m) for NO(2) reduction to N(2)O was estimated to be 0.9 mM NO(2), yet the apparent K(m) for overall NO(2) reduction was considerably lower, no greater than 0.04 mM NO(2). Activities for N(2)O and NH(4) production increased markedly after depletion of NO(3) from the media. Amendment with NO(3) inhibited N(2)O and NH(4) production by molybdate-grown cells but not by tungstate-grown cells. Sulfite inhibited production of NH(4) but not of N(2)O. In a related experiment, three Escherichia coli mutants lacking NADH-dependent nitrite reductase produced N(2)O at rates equal to the wild type. These observations suggest that N(2)O is produced enzymatically but not by the same enzyme system responsible for dissimilatory reduction of NO(2) to NH(4).
TI  - [Histological and bacteriological examination of uterus from the repeat breeder gilt and sow (author's transl)].
AB  - The investigation comprised sexual organs from 25 gilts and 97 sows culled because of repeat breeding. Among the gilts 24.0 per cent and among the sows 25.8 per cent had endometritis. The following germs were present in uterus from gilts and sows with signs of endometritis: Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium pyogenes, alpha-hemolytiske streptococcer, Escherichia coli, Pasteurella sp., Aeromonas sp., Acinetobacter sp. and Citrobacter sp. Among gilts and sows with germs present in uterus 40.9 per cent had endometritis. The corresponding per cent among gilts and sows without germs present was 25.0.
TI  - Poly(adenylic acid) in small amounts, free or covalently linked to substrate, protects RNA from hydrolysis by ribonuclease.
AB  - Short lengths (18 residues) of poly(A), covalently linked to the 3'-termini of Escherichia coli 5 S rRNA, induce powerful inhibitions (38-87%) of the activities of RNAases (ribonucleases) from Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., bovine pancreas, human spleen and human plasma. As the polypurine chain length is extended, enzyme activity declines. Furthermore, poly(A) sequences, present only on a small subpopulation of RNA, and accounting for less than 1% of total RNA, serve to protect all RNA, polyadenylated or not, from enzyme-catalysed degradation. The quantity of 3'-terminal adenylic acid residues, relative to the amount of substrate, determines enzyme activity. The exact distribution of a fixed amount of poly(A) residues on the 3'-termini of substrate molecules is unimportant in this respect. Comparison of the efficacies of inhibition of RNAase activity, by using linked poly(A) and similar quantities of free poly(A), revealed that although the free polypurine inhibits RNAase activity, covalent linkage of poly(A) to RNA is more advantageous to the stability of an RNA substrate. However, the ratio of inhibited activities obtained by using linked or free poly(A) may change considerably with alterations in either substrate concentration or polyadenylic acid segment length.
TI  - Homology of the gene coding for outer membrane lipoprotein within various Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - The mRNA for a major outer membrane lipoprotein from Escherichia coli was found to hybridize specifically with one of the EcoRI and one of the HindIII restriction endonuclease-generated fragments of total DNA from nine bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Shigella dysenteriae, Salmonella typhimurium, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella aerogenes, Enterobacter aerogenes, Edwardsiella tarda, Serratia marcescens, and Erwinia amylovora. However, among the Enterobacteriaceae, DNA from two species of Proteus (P. mirabilis and P. morganii) did not contain any restriction endonuclease fragments that hybridized with the E. coli lipoprotein mRNA. Furthermore, no hybrid bands were detected in four other gram-negative bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter sp. HO1-N, Caulobacter crescentus, and Myxococcus xanthus. Envelope fractions from all bacteria in the family Enterobacteriaceae tested above cross-reacted with antiserum against the purified E. coli free-form lipoprotein in the Ouchterlony immunodiffusion test. Both species of Proteus, however, gave considerably weaker precipitation lines, in comparison with the intense lines produced by the other members of the family. All of the above four bacteria outside the family Enterobacteriaceae did not cross-react with anti-E. coli lipoprotein serum. From these results, the rate of evolutionary changes in the lipoprotein gene seems to be closely related to that observed for various soluble enzymes of the Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Combined activitiy of clavulanic acid and ticarcillin against ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli.
AB  - Fifty-one clinical isolates of ticarcillin-resistant, gram-negative bacilli were  tested for susceptibility to combinations of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid (BRL 14151), a potent beta-lactamase inhibitor. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measured by a microdilution method, and minimal bactericidal concentrations for selected strains were measured by the broth dilution method. Ticarcillin MICs were >/=128 mug/ml for all and >/=512 mug/ml for 38 (75%) of the strains. Thirty-nine strains of Enterobacteriaceae tested included Escherichia coli (14), Klebsiella pneumoniae (16), Citrobacter sp. (3), Enterobacter sp. (3), Salmonella enteritidis (1), Serratia marcescens (1), and Proteus mirabilis (1). Ticarcillin MICs for 34 strains (88%) were lowered at least threefold by the addition of 1.0 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Against 33 strains (85%), the MICs were 64 mug or less per ml in the presence of 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. In contrast, the MICs for seven of eight strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were unaffected by the addition of up to 10 mug of clavulanic acid per ml. Ticarcillin with 5 mug of clavulanic acid per ml was bactericidal against ticarcillin-resistant (MIC >/= 2,048 mug/ml) E. coli, K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter, and P. mirabilis.
TI  - [Efficacy, tolerance, and pharmacokinetics of sisomicin in urinary tract infections (author's transl)].
AB  - Since 1973 30 patients with urinary tract infections (UTI) or pyelonephritis have been treated with sisomicin, a new aminoglycoside, in a daily dose of 2 mg/kg for a period of seven to nine days. From a clinical point of view the result of treatment was good. Complete resolution was achieved in 17 patients, improvement in nine, and there was no effect in four patients. Thirty-five causative organisms (Escherichia coli = 23, Proteus sp. = 7, Klebsiella sp. = 3, Pseudomonas aeruginosa = 1, Citrobacter = 1) were isolated before treatment. Thirty of the organisms were eliminated during treatment, but seven reappeared during the follow-up period; five strains persisted. Side effects observed consisted of reversible increase of serum creatinine in four patients, excretion of granular casts in 14 patients, and a transient rise of alkaline phosphatase, SGOT and/or SGPT in five patients. No signs of ototoxicity or any other adverse reactions were found and local tolerance was good. In 20 patients blood samples for assay were obtained daily one hour after i. m. injection of 1.0 mg/kg. No evidence of drug accumulation in the serum was found: the mean serum concentrations one hour after injection remained between 3.4 and 3,9 microgram/ml during the entire treatment period. Sisomicin is a highly effective antibiotic for the treatment of UTI caused by gramnegative pathogens. On account of its potential toxicity however, it should be used, like other aminoglycosides, only in selected cases.
TI  - Gram-negative bacillary pneumonia in the compromised host.
AB  - The clinical and radiological characteristics of 217 consecutive episodes of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia occurring in 189 adult cancer patients between November 1968 and December 1974 were analyzed. The majority of patients had acute leukemia (54%). Fever larger than or equal to 101 degrees F was the single most common symptom and sign of the presence of infection (90%). Next in frequency were crepitant rales (65%), cough (41%), dyspnea (19%) and chest pain (18%). Radiographic evidence of pneumonia was found in 83% of cases and it consisted mainly of alveolar infiltrates involving both lung fields and predominantly the bases. Up to one-third of the patients had normal chestx-ray examinations at the onset of infection, though they subsequently became abnormal in 42% of them. The majority of patients (81%) whose initial chest x-rays did not reveal the presence of pneumonia were neutropenic (less than 1000 circumlating neutrophils/mm3). Klebsiella sp. and Pseudomonas sp. were the most common infecting organisms. The overall cure rate was 61%; 70% for Klebsiella sp. infections and 64% for Pseudomonas sp. infections. Pulmonary abscesses occurred in 14% of the cases. Cures were related to the antibiotic sensitivity of the infecting organisms and to the number of circulating neutrophils during the period of infection. Best results were obtained with the administration of gentamicin, the newer aminoglycoside antibiotic sisomicin, tobramycin and amikacin, or the combination of gentamicin with carbenicillin or with cephalosporins. Early and vigorous therapy of gram-negative bacillary pneumonia with appropriate antibiotics has improved the prognosis of this infection at our institution.
TI  - Two distinct types of trimethoprim-resistant dihydrofolate reductase specified by R-plasmids of different compatibility groups.
AB  - R-Plasmids from a number of trimethoprim-resistant Escherichia coli and Citrobacter sp. were studied after transfer to E. coli K12 hosts. Each was found to specify a dihydrofolate reductase which was resistant to trimethoprim and Methotrexate, and which could be completely separated from the host chromosomal enzyme by gel filtration. Two distinct types of R-plasmid dihydrofolate reductases were identified. Type I enzymes, typified by the R483 enzyme previously described (Skold, O., and Widh, A. (1974) J. Biol. Chem. 249, 4324-4325), are synthesized in amounts severalfold higher than the chromosomal enzyme. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (I50) of trimethoprim, Methotrexate, and aminopterin are increased several thousandfold over the corresponding values for the chromosomal enzyme. Type II R-plasmid dihydrofolate reductases are synthesized in about the same amount, or less, as the chromosomal enzyme, but are practically several hundredfold higher than those for the type I enzymes. Both types of R-plasmid dihydrofolate reductase showed little difference from the chromosomal enzyme in the binding of dihydrofolate, NADPH, folic acid, and 2,4-diaminopyrimidine.
TI  - Bactericidal factor produced by Haemophilus influenzae b: partial purification of the factor and transfer of its genetic determinant.
AB  - When aerobically grown on complex media, Haemophilus influenzae b and unencapsulated variants, Rb strains, produced a bactericidal factor that was active against other Haemophilus species and certain genera of the Enterobacteriaceae. A total of 341 clinical isolates of Haemophilus were tested for susceptibility to the factor. Ninety-three percent of H. influenzae (nontypable), 75% of H. haemolyticus, 71% of H. parainfluenzae, and 22% of H. parahaemolyticus were susceptible. H. influenaze b strains were resistant producers of the bactericidal factor and H. influenzae f strains were susceptible nonproducers. Only one strain each of H. aegyptius and H. aphrophilus was isolated and each was susceptible and resistant, respectively. 143 clinical isolates of the Enterobacteriaceae were tested and of those 82% of Escherichia coli, 85% of Salmonella sp., and all Citrobacter sp., Shigella sp., and Yersinia sp. were sensitive to the bactericidal factor produced by H. influenzae b. Attempts to isolate the bactericidal activity from mechanically disrupted, solubilized, or osmotically shocked cells failed to release active bactericidal factor. However, we partially purified the bactericidal factor from the spent culture medium of aerobically grown H. influenzae b by a series of extractions. The ability to produce the bactericidal factor was transferable to nonproducer strains without also genetically transforming for type b encapsulation. The converse was also true in that type b capsules were produced by transformed H. influenzae Rd strains but no bactericidal factor was detected from these strains. Additionally, nitrosoguanidine-induced mutants of H. influenzae b lost the ability to produce bactericidal factor without loss of their type-specific capsule, demonstrating that production of the bactericidal factor was genetically separable from production of the type capsule of H. influenzae b.
TI  - Biological values of the infant, juvenile, and adult agouti (Dasyprocta sp) with  emphasis on microbial flora.
AB  - Normal values for intestinal flora were determined on four adult, two juvenile, and four infant agoutis (Dasyprocta sp) maintained at our institution. Serologic, hematologic, biochemical, and histologic observations were also made on these same agoutis, and serologic, microbiologic, and endoparasitic tests were made on serum and fecal samples from agoutis maintained at other institutions. Streptococci, lactobacilli and nonenteropathogenic Escherichia coli were isolated from cecal contents of all age groups. Gaffkya tetragena and Bacillus sp were recovered from infant agoutis, Proteus mirabilis from juvenile agoutis, and Proteus mirabilis and Micrococcus sp from adult agoutis. Infant agoutis showed marginal antibody titers to reovirus type 3 and Toolan's H-1 viruses, and Theiler's GDVII antibodies were detected in juvenile agoutis, but no antibody titers to murine viruses were found in the adult agoutis maintained at our institution. Hematologic, biochemical, and histologic data for these agoutis were comparable to those of other hystricomorph rodents. Serologic tests of the agoutis maintained at other institutions disclosed antibodies for GDVII virus in all of 17 animals tested, while marginal titers were found for Sendai virus in four and for reovirus type 3 in eight of the 17 animals. Only low incidences of pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella, Pseudomonas, and Citrobacter) were isolated from the agoutis maintained elsewhere. The endoparasites found in these agoutis were Ascaris, Toxascaris, Strongyloides, Trichuris, and Trichomonas.
TI  - Immunological relationships of bacterial L-asparaginases.
AB  - Rabbit antisera against L-asparaginase preparations from Escherichia coli, Erwinia carotovora, Citrobacter sp. and Chromobacterium violaceum showed on immunoelectrophoresis that only the enzymes from E. coli and Citrobacter are immunologically related. Purified preparations had to be used to determine the immunological cross-reactions. Immunoelectrophoresis at different pH values yielded the zero mobility points of the enzymes. The activity of the Er. carotovora preparation was enhanced up to fourfold by homologous antiserum but not by normal sera. Heterologous antisera also enhanced, but only at a higher concentration. Less enhancement was observed for the other enzymes with antisera as well as with bovine serum albumin. Inhibition was not observed.
TI  - [In vitro examination on antibacterial activities of broad-spectrum antibiotics against gram-negative clinical isolates (author's transl)].
AB  - In vitro studies were undertaken on clinically isolated strains of various bacteria to examine the antibacterial activity of ampicillin (AB-PC), carbenicillin (CB-PC), sulbenicillin (SB-PC) cephalothin (CET), cefazolin (CEZ) and gentamicin (GM). Fifty three % of Escherichia coli strains 53.3% of Citrobacter sp., 80% of Proteus mirabilis, 42.9% of Morganella and 80% of Bacteroides sp. were susceptible (MIC being not higher than 12.5 mug/ml) to AB-PC. The eight other species were not so susceptible to this penicillin. CB-PC and SB-PC were almost as effective as AB-PC against Escherichia coli and Citrobacter sp. They were less active against Klebsiella sp., but more active against Enterobacter sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus group and Pseudomonas sp. than AB-PC, SB-PC was more effective than CB-PC against Pseudomonas sp. The strains of Pseudomonas sp. which were resistant to higher concentrations of CB-PC and SB-PC were pyocyanine-negative strains. All strains (100%) of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp. and Citrobacter sp. were susceptible to CET and CEZ, while none of Enterobacter sp. , Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris. Morganella, Rettgerella, Providencia and Pseudomonas sp. were susceptible to these cephalosporins. The MICs of CET and CEZ against Bacteroides sp. were moderately low. Some strains of Providencia and Alkaligenes sp. were resistant of GM but the other 10 species were not resistant to this antibiotic, though it showed comparatively high MICs against Bacteroides sp. When seen from the MIC distribution of each antibiotic, there was a tendency that the strains isolated from the pus were more resistant than those isolated from the other sources (urine, sputum and bile).
TI  - Susceptibility of clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin.
AB  - The susceptibility of 4,929 unselected clinical isolates of bacteria to cefoxitin and cephalothin was determined by the single-disk method, using a computer-associated electronic zone analyzer to obtain, record, and process measurements of sizes of zones of inhibition. Both cefoxitin and cephalothin were effective against most gram-positive strains, including Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, micrococci, and all streptococci except enterococci. The three strains of Listeria monocytogenes tested were susceptible to cephalothin but resistant to cefoxitin. There was little difference between the cefoxitin and cephalothin susceptibility of Salmonellae, Citrobacter sp., Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas sp. Cefoxitin was more effective then cephalothin against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Serratia sp., indole-positive Proteus sp., Providence sp., Flavobacter sp., Herellea vaginicola, and Mima polymorpha. Cefoxitin also appeared to exhibit enhanced activity, as compared with cephalothin, against Bacteroides sp. Thus cefoxitin appears to have a very broad antibacterial spectrum which is greater than that of cephalothin, especially against gram-negative strains.
TI  - Comparison of the rates of motility of Salmonella with those of other enteric bacteria.
AB  - Comparison of the rates of motility through a semisolid medium of 16 common Salmonella sp., 14 Escherichia coli serotypes, 4 Arizona strains, 2 Escherichia freundii (Citrobacter) isolates, 2 Proteus sp., and 2 Pseudomonas sp. revealed the following. (i) Very closely related bacteria could demonstrate markedly different rates of progression. (ii) All of the salmonellae tested advanced faster than the Proteus and Pseudomonas test cultures but some Salmonella sp., notably S. choleraesuis and S. typhi, progressed relatively slowly compared to many other test cultures. (iii) The mean rate of motility for the fastest 14 Salmonella sp. (1.49 cm/hr) was not statistically greater than the mean value for the 14 E. coli serotypes (1.31 cm/hr) at the 1% level of significance. Selective motility procedures may not be a reliable means of isolating all Salmonella sp. from materials contaminated with other bacteria.
