inhibitory activity of fermented milk with lactobacillus casei strain shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
objective: to determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with lactobacillus  casei strain shirota (fmlc) against common multi-drug-resistant (mdr) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. material and method: time-kill methods of fmlc and cell-free filtered fluid of fmlc (cf-fmlc) against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, esbl-producing escherichia coli & klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus were conducted. the control solutions were mueller hinton broth (mhb) and distilled water. the mixtures of fmlc, cf-fmlc, mhb and dw with 10(5) to 10(6) cfu/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees c. each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. the inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees c for 24-48 hr. bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. results: log cfus of each organism in mhb and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11 at 24 hr. log cfus of each organism in fmlc and cf-fmlc after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. conclusion: fmlc and cf-fmlc exerted slow inhibitory activity against mdr bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by lactobacillus casei strain shirota. clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of fmlc can prevent and treat colonization and infection with mdr bacteria in hospitalized patients.
probiotic activities of lactobacillus casei rhamnosus: in vitro adherence to intestinal cells and antimicrobial properties.
the interest of probiotics as remedies for a broad number of gastrointestinal and other infectious diseases has gained wide interest over the last few years, but little is known about their underlying mechanism of action. in this study, the probiotic activities of a human isolate of lactobacillus casei subsp. rhamnosus strain (lcr35) were investigated. using intestinal caco-2 cell line in an in vitro model, we demonstrated that this strain exhibited adhesive properties. the inhibitory effects of lcr35 organisms on the adherence of three pathogens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and klebsiella pneumoniae, were determined. a decrease in the number of adhering pathogens was observed, using either preincubation, postincubation or coincubation of the pathogens with lcr35. moreover, the antibacterial activities of cell-free lcr35 supernatant was examined against nine human pathogenic bacteria, etec, epec, k. pneumoniae, shigella flexneri, salmonella typhimurium, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and clostridium difficile. the growth of all strains was inhibited, as measured by determining the number of viable bacteria over time, but no bactericidal activity was detected in this in vitro assay. together, these findings suggest that this probiotic strain could be used to prevent colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by a large variety of pathogens.
