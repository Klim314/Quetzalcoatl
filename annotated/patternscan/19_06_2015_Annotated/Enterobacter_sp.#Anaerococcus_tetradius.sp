TI  == oropharynx microbiota among alcoholics and non-alcoholics.
AB  == context: the oropharynx microbiota plays an important role in the origin of infections, especially among alcoholics whose airway defenses are impaired. objective: to compare the normal oropharingeal flora in heavy alcohol drinker and non-alcoholics. patients: 117 persons, 58 heavy alcohol drinkers and 59 non-alcoholics. setting: santa casa de sao paulo emergency service. design: a blind prospective study. main outcomes measures: prevalence of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and fungi. results: the study of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy alcohol drinkers demonstrated the presence of anaerobic microorganisms in 84.5% of them, including: bacteroides sp, prevotella melaninogenica, fusobacterium sp, veilonella sp, peptostreptococcus sp, propionibacterium sp, bifidobacterium sp and clostridium sp, versus 30.5% (p < 0.005) of non-alcoholics. candida sp was present in 34.5% of heavy alcohol drinkers and 5.1% of non-alcoholics (p < 0.005). enterobacteria predominated among heavy alcohol drinkers (25%) compared with non-alcoholics (5.5%) only in the age group 14 to 34 years (p < 0.05). conclusion: based upon these results, it was possible to conclude that the knowledge of the oropharynx microbiota among heavy drinkers and non-alcoholics has an important predictive value concerning probable etiologic agents of lower airway infections. infections caused by anaerobic microorganisms and fungi should be taken into consideration during the  choice of empirical therapy for heavy alcohol drinkers.

TI  == [pharmacokinetic, bacteriological, and clinical studies on panipenem/betamipron in children].
AB  == pharmacokinetic, bacteriological and clinical studies were performed on panipenem/betamipron (papm/bp) in children. the results are summarized as follow: 1. twelve patients with various bacterial infectious diseases were treated with papm/bp. each dose was 20 mg/20 mg/kg, administered 3 times daily, in 30-minute intravenous drip infusion. treatments were continued for 5-22 days. clinical efficacies of papm/bp in 12 patients with bacterial infections (1 with suspected  sepsis, 5 with pneumonia, 1 with acute maxillary sinusitis, 2 with acute otitis media, 1 with cervical abscess and 2 with urinary tract infection complexed type) were evaluated as excellent in 7, good in 4 and fair in 1, with an efficacy rate  of 91.7%. seventeen causative organisms found in 10 patients (haemophilus influenzae in 4, branhamella catarrhalis in 3, streptococcus pneumoniae in 2, pseudomonas aeruginosa in 2, staphylococcus aureus in 1, alpha-streptococcus in 1, corynebacterium sp. in 1, peptostreptococcus micros in 1 and klebsiella pneumoniae in 2) were eradicated except 2 strains (s. aureus and p. aeruginosa) from 1 patient (patient no. 2). no adverse reactions were observed in any of the  12 patients. 2. mics of papm were examined against 22 clinical isolates (h. influenzae 5, b. catarrhalis 3, alpha-streptococcus 3, s. pneumoniae 2, corynebacterium sp. 2, s. aureus 1, p. aeruginosa 1, p. micros 1, enterobacter cloacae 1, escherichia coli 1, group d streptococcus 1 and staphylococcus epidermidis 1) from children with bacterial infections. papm showed a good antibacterial activity comparable to the activity of cefoperazone (cpz) against s. pneumoniae strains relatively tolerant to penicillins. however, the activity of papm against h. influenzae was somewhat weaker than that of cpz. 3. pharmacokinetic studies.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [clinical evaluation of imipenem/cilastatin sodium in the internal medicine].
AB  == fifty-two patients with moderate or severe infections associated with internal medicine were treated with imipenem/cilastatin sodium (ipm/cs) and the efficacy and the safety of this drug were evaluated. there were 20 patients with pneumonia, 10 with acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory tract infections, 9  with sepsis, 2 with pyothorax, 3 with intraabdominal infection, 2 with urinary tract infection, 1 with pulmonary abscess, 1 with infective endocarditis, 4 with  fever of unknown origin. forty-four patients were evaluable for the efficacy. clinical efficacies were excellent in 12 patients, good in 26, fair in 3 and poor in 3. the overall clinical efficacy was 86.4%. the efficacy rate was 63.6% in patients previously treated and 93.9% in patients previously untreated with other antibiotics. bacteriologically, staphylococcus aureus (8 strains), streptococcus  pneumoniae (5), streptococcus pyogenes (1), other gram-positive coccus (1), klebsiella pneumoniae (8), haemophilus influenzae (4), pseudomonas aeruginosa (3), serratia marcescens (3), escherichia coli (3), branhamella catarrhalis (1),  citrobacter freundii (1), klebsiella oxytoca (1), enterobacter sp. (1), and peptostreptococcus sp. (1) were eradicated. p. aeruginosa (3) and acinetobacter sp. (1) decreased. s. aureus (1), s. epidermidis (1), p. aeruginosa (5), and s. marcescens (1) persisted or appeared. the eradication rate was 83.7%. six patients showed adverse reactions including general fatigue 1, epigastralgia 1, eruption 1, eosinophilia 1 and elevation of s-got 2. but all of the adverse reactions were mild or slight, and transient. these findings indicate that ipm/cs is a useful and safe drug against bacterial infections in internal medicine.

TI  == oral associated bacterial infection in horses: studies on the normal anaerobic flora from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface and its association with lower respiratory tract and paraoral infections.
AB  == two hundred and seventy bacterial isolates were obtained from the pharyngeal tonsillar surface of 12 normal horses and 98 obligatory anaerobic bacteria were characterised. of these, 57 isolates belonging to 7 genera (peptostreptococcus (1); eubacterium (9); clostridium (6); veillonella (6); megasphera (1); bacteroides (28); fusobacterium (6)) were identified, and 16 of these were identified to species level (p. anaerobius (1); e. fossor (9); c. villosum (1); b. fragilis (1); b. tectum (2); b. heparinolyticus (2)). three hundred and twenty isolates were obtained from 23 samples from horses with lower respiratory tract (lrt) or paraoral (po) bacterial infections. of the 143 bacteria selected for detailed characterisation, obligate anaerobes accounted for 100 isolates, facultative anaerobes for 42 isolates and obligate aerobes for one isolate. phenotypic characterisation separated 99 of the isolates into 14 genera. among the obligately anaerobic species, gram-positive cocci including p. anaerobius comprised 25% of isolates, e. fossor 11% and other gram-positive rods (excluding  clostridium sp.) 18% of isolates. the gram-negative rods comprised b. fragilis 5%, b. heparinolyticus 5%, asaccharolytic pigmented bacteroides 3% and other bacteroides 13%, while a so-far unnamed species of fusobacterium (7%), and gram-negative corroding rods (3%) were isolated. among the facultatively anaerobic isolates, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus accounted for 31% of isolates, followed by pasteurella spp. 19%, escherichia coli 17%, actinomyces spp. 9%, streptococcus spp. 9%. incidental facultative isolates were enterococcus spp. 2%, enterobacter cloaceae 2%, actinobacillus spp. 2% and gram-negative corroding rods 5%. on the basis of the similarities (as determined by dna hybridization data and/or phenotypic characteristics) of some of the bacterial species (e.g. e. fossor and b. heparinolyticus) isolated from both the normal pharyngeal tonsillar surfaces and lrt and po diseases of horses, it is considered that the most likely source of bacteria involved in these disease processes is flora from the oral cavity.

TI  == [aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  == in a group of 600 patients treated in the metropolitan dermatological hospital in warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. in 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms  was obtained. coagulase-positive staphylococci (st. aureus) and gram-negative bacteria (pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris, enterobacter sp and e. coli)  prevailed. in 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. in the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes  exclusively was noted. pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. in the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were gram-negative bacteria such as bacteroides melaninogenicus, bacteroides sp, and bacteroides fragilis. among pathogenic anerobic cocci peptostreptococcus and peptococcus were most frequent. in 2 cases  spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (clostridium perfringens) were obtained. forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.

TI  == [bacterial infection agents in hospitalized patients].
AB  == during six months the pattern of microbial isolates has been analysed from 1492 urinary tract infections, from 1445 wound infections, from 451 bronchial secretions, from 3067 blood cultures, from 116 peritoneal swabs and from 39 cerebrospinal fluids. all the specimens investigated were taken from patients of  surgical, neurosurgical, internal wards and two intensive care units. in total, the most frequent isolates were grampositive microorganisms like staphylococus aureus, straphylococcus epidermidis and streptococcus sp. of different serotypes. out of the enterobacteriaceae escherichia coli and klebisella pneumoniae predominated followed by enterobacter cloacae and indolnegative and -positive proteus species. the over all isolation rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa in nosocomial infections was about 10%. in the last time pseudomonas maltophilia will be isolated more frequently as well as occasional streptococcus faecium and  corynebacterium jk. dependent from the site of infection anaerobic bacteria like  bacteroides sp., peptococcus- and peptostreptococcus sp. are really important in  the infectious diseases. the epidemiological data should be always transmitted to the infection control board. from there preventive measures must be induced.
