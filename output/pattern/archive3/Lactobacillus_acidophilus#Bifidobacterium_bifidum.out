a randomized double-blind controlled trial of lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum versus placebo in patients with hypercholesterolemia.
background: hypercholesterolemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease. not all patients respond well to traditional cholesterol lowering medications. probiotics have been evaluated for their cholesterol-lowering effects in humans with variable results. this study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of two probiotics in lowering the serum cholesterol of hypercholesterolemic patients. materials and methods: a randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted comparing placebo to lactobacillus acidophilus plus bifidobacterium bifidum in patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolemia. placebo or probiotic capsules were taken three times daily for six weeks. pre- and post-treatment total cholesterol (tc), hdl-cholesterol (hdl-c), ldl-cholesterol (ldl-c) and triglyceride (tg) levels and demographic parameters of the two groups were compared. from a total of 70 participants, 64 completed the assigned treatment (31 in probiotics group and 33 in the control group).the two treatment groups were matched for age, sex, weight, height, bmi, waist and hip circumferences, and blood pressure. results: baseline evaluation revealed no difference between the probiotics group and control group levels of tc, hdl-c, ldl-c and tg. tc levels in the probiotics group decreased during treatment (237.2 vs. 212.7 mg/dl, p<0.05). tc and ldl-c levels in the control group increased significantly from their baseline levels during treatment. tc (212.7 vs 252.8 mg/dl, p<0.001), hdl-c (52.0 vs 59.1 mg/dl, p=0.04) and ldl-c (153.9 vs 182.1 mg/dl, p<0.01) levels in the probiotics group were significantly lower at the end of treatment than the corresponding levels in the control group. conclusion: a combination of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum decreased serum total cholesterol, ldl-cholesterol and hdl-cholesterol levels in hypercholesterolemic patients over a six week period. there was no effect on serum triglyceride or fasting blood glucose levels.
effect of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum supplementation to standard triple therapy on helicobacter pylori eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora.
to investigate lactobacillus acidophilus (l. acidophilus) and bifidobacterium bifidum (b. bifidum) supplementation to triple therapy for helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) eradication and dynamic changes in intestinal flora in children with h. pylori infection. one hundred h. pylori-infected children were randomly assigned to two groups: treatment group (n = 43), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy plus probiotics of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum for 2 weeks followed by taking probiotics for another 4 weeks; control group (n = 45), standard triple anti-h. pylori therapy for 6 weeks. after 6-week treatment, (1)(3)c-urease breath test was performed and side effects were monitored during the observation period. quantitative pcr with 16s rrna-gene-targeted species-specific primers was carried out for the analysis of human intestinal b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and escherichia coli (e. coli). as expected, treatment group could significantly enhance the h. pylori eradication rate (83.7 vs. 64.4 %, p < 0.05). b. bifidum, l. acidophilus, and e. coli showed no statistical difference before or after therapy in the treatment group. the number of b. bifidum and l. acidophilus was significantly decreased after 2-week treatment in the control group, but after 6-week treatment it significantly increased and nearly returned to the level before treatment. the number of e. coli increased significantly after 2-week treatment, while after 6-week treatment, it nearly decreased to the level before treatment. l. acidophilus and b. bifidum supplementation is effective for h. pylori eradication compared with triple therapy alone.
role of probiotics in the prevention and treatment of meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus infections.
meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) is a multidrug-resistant micro-organism and is the principal nosocomial pathogen worldwide. following initial in vitro experiments demonstrating that lactobacillus acidophilus cl1285((r)) and lactobacillus casei lbc80r((r)) commercial strains exhibit antibacterial activity against clinical mrsa isolates, we conducted a literature search to find any evidence of probiotic efficacy in decolonisation or treatment of s. aureus infection. as summarised below, many strains of lactobacilli and bifidobacteria isolated from a variety of sources inhibited the growth of s. aureus and clinical isolates of mrsa in vitro. the most active strains were lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, propionibacterium freudenreichii, propionibacterium acnes, lactobacillus paracasei, l. acidophilus, l. casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus bulgaricus, lactobacillus fermentum and lactococcus lactis. their effects were mediated both by direct cell competitive exclusion as well as production of acids or bacteriocin-like inhibitors. l. acidophilus also inhibited s. aureus biofilm formation and lipase production. in vitro antimicrobial activity did not necessarily assure efficacy in vivo in animal infectious models, e.g. s. aureus 8325-4 was most sensitive in vitro to l. acidophilus, whilst in vivo bifidobacterium bifidum best inhibited experimental intravaginal staphylococcosis in mice. on the other hand, l. plantarum, which showed the highest inhibition activity against s. aureus in vitro, was also very effective topically in preventing skin wound infection with s. aureus in mice. very few clinical data were found on the interactions between probiotics and mrsa, but the few identified clinical cases pointed to the feasibility of elimination or reduction of mrsa colonisation with probiotic use.
probiotics lactobacillus rhamnosus gg, lactobacillus acidophilus suppresses dmh-induced procarcinogenic fecal enzymes and preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci in early colon carcinogenesis in sprague dawley rats.
diet makes an important contribution to colorectal cancer (crc) risk implying risks for crc are potentially reducible. therefore, the probiotics have been suggested as the prophylactic measure in colon cancer. in this study, different probiotics were used to compare their protective potential against 1,2 dimethylhydrazine dihydrochloride (dmh)-induced chemical colon carcinogenesis in sprague dawley rats. animals belonging to different probiotic groups were fed orally with 1 x 10(9) lactobacilli daily for 1 week, and then a weekly injection of dmh was given intraperitoneally for 6 wks with daily administration of probiotic. lactobacillus gg and l.acidophilus + dmh-treated animals had maximum percent reduction in acf counts. a significant decrease (p < 0.05) in fecal nitroreductase activity was observed in l.casei + dmh and l.plantarum + dmh-treated rats whereas beta-glucuronidase activity decreased in l.gg + dmh and l.acidophilus + dmh-treated rats. animals treated with bifidobacterium bifidum + dmh had significant decreased beta-glucosidase activity. however, not much difference was observed in the colon morphology of animals belonging to various probiotic + dmh-treated rats compared with dmh-treated alone. the results indicated that probiotics, l.gg, and l.acidophilus can be used as the better prophylactic agents for experimental colon carcinogenesis.
antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272, lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b. longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.
hypolipidemic effects of lactic acid bacteria fermented cereal in rats.
background: the objectives of the present study were to investigate the efficacy  of the mixed culture of lactobacillus acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lactobacillus helveticus (ck60) in the fermentation of maize and the evaluation of the effect of the fermented meal on the lipid profile of rats. methods: rats were randomly assigned to 3 groups and each group placed on a diet a (high fat diet into which a maize meal fermented with a mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) was incorporated), b (unfermented high fat diet) or c (commercial rat chow) respectively after the first group of 7 rats randomly selected were sacrificed to obtain the baseline data. thereafter 7 rats each from the experimental and control groups were sacrificed weekly for 4 weeks and the plasma, erythrocytes, lipoproteins and organs of the rats were assessed for cholesterol, triglyceride and phospholipids. results: our results revealed that the mixed culture of lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), b bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) were able to grow and ferment maize meal into 'ogi' of acceptable flavour. in addition to plasma and hepatic hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia, phospholipidosis in plasma, as well as cholesterogenesis, triglyceride constipation and phospholipidosis in extra-hepatic tissues characterized the consumption of unfermented hyperlipidemic diets. however, feeding the animals with the fermented maize diet reversed the dyslipidemia. conclusion: the findings of this study indicate that consumption of mixed culture lactic acid bacteria (lb acidophilus (dsm 20242), bifidobacterium bifidum (dsm 20082) and lb helveticus (ck 60) fermented food results in the inhibition of fat absorption. it also inhibits the activity of hmg coa reductase. this inhibition may be by feedback inhibition or repression of the transcription of the gene encoding the enzyme via activation of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (srebp) transcription factor. it is also possible that consumption of fermented food enhances conversion of cholesterol to bile acids by activating cholesterol-7alpha-hydroxylase.
bifidobacterium bifidum actively changes the gene expression profile induced by lactobacillus acidophilus in murine dendritic cells.
dendritic cells (dc) play a pivotal regulatory role in activation of both the innate as well as the adaptive immune system by responding to environmental microorganisms. we have previously shown that lactobacillus acidophilus induces a strong production of the pro-inflammatory and th1 polarizing cytokine il-12 in dc, whereas bifidobacteria do not induce il-12 but inhibit the il-12 production induced by lactobacilli. in the present study, genome-wide microarrays were used to investigate the gene expression pattern of murine dc stimulated with lactobacillus acidophilus ncfm and bifidobacterium bifidum z9. l. acidophilus ncfm strongly induced expression of interferon (ifn)-beta, other virus defence genes, and cytokine and chemokine genes related to the innate and the adaptive immune response. by contrast, b. bifidum z9 up-regulated genes encoding cytokines and chemokines related to the innate immune response. moreover, b. bifidum z9 inhibited the expression of the th1-promoting genes induced by l. acidophilus ncfm and had an additive effect on genes of the innate immune response and th2 skewing genes. the gene encoding jun dimerization protein 2 (jdp2), a transcription factor regulating the activation of jnk, was one of the few genes only induced by b. bifidum z9. neutralization of ifn-beta abrogated l. acidophilus ncfm-induced expression of th1-skewing genes, and blocking of the jnk pathway completely inhibited the expression of ifn-beta. our results indicate that b. bifidum z9 actively inhibits the expression of genes related to the adaptive immune system in murine dendritic cells and that jpd2 via blocking of ifn-beta plays a central role in this regulatory mechanism.
the effect of nonylphenol on the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum.
background and purpose: nonylphenol (np) is a well-known environmental hormone recognized as detrimental to the reproductive systems of aquatic animals and humans. the effect of np on probiotics in the human gastrointestinal tract remains unclear. this study investigated the effect of np on the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. methods: l. acidophilus and b. bifidum were grown in anaerobic cultures. both strains were incubated with and without np. the dose effects of np on the growth of both probiotics were compared, and the effects of np on the growth of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum in different concentrations were evaluated. results: np 5 to 10 microg/ml inhibited the growth of l. acidophilus (p < 0.05), but was ineffective at 2.5 microg/ml (p > 0.05). np significantly inhibited the growth of b. bifidum in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). np inhibited the growth of different concentrations of l. acidophilus (6.25 x 10(4); to 2.5 x 10(5); colony-forming units [cfu]/ml) and b. bifidum (1.25 x 10(9); to 5.0 x 10(9); cfu/ml) [p < 0.05]. conclusions: growth of l. acidophilus and b. bifidum was inhibited by np. this finding suggests that np may interfere with normal gastrointestinal microbiota. this may alter immunomodulation in the intestinal mucosa and may be correlated with an increase in the incidence of allergic diseases or other gastrointestinal disorders.
growth-inhibiting effects of cinnamomum cassia bark-derived materials on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of cinnamomum cassia (blume) bark-derived materials toward five intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as four commercially available compounds (cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, eugenol, and salicylaldehyde). the biologically active component of c. cassia bark was characterized as cinnamaldehyde by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. in a test using 1 and 0.5 mg/disks, cinnamaldehyde revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringensand bacteroides fragilis. at 1 and 0.5 mg/disk, growth of bifidobacterium bifidum was significantly inhibited, whereas weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against bifidobacterium longum or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in cl. perfringens, b. fragilis, and bi. bifidum, compared to bi. longum or l. acidophilus. salicylaldehyde exhibited moderate growth-inhibiting activity, but little or no inhibition was observed from treatments with cinnamyl alcohol, trans-cinnamic acid, and eugenol. in contrast, tetracycline and chloramphenicol significantly inhibited growth of all test bacteria as low as 0.01 mg/disk. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. cassia bark.
viability of probiotic (bifidobacterium, lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei) and nonprobiotic microflora in argentinian fresco cheese.
we evaluated the suitability of argentinian fresco cheese as a food carrier of probiotic cultures. we used cultures of bifidobacterium bifidum (two strains), bifidobacterium longum (two strains), bifidobacterium sp. (one strain), lactobacillus acidophilus (two strains), and lactobacillus casei (two strains) in different combinations, as probiotic adjuncts. probiotic, lactic starter (lactococcus lactis and streptococcus thermophilus), and contaminant (coliforms, yeasts, and molds) organisms were counted at 0, 30, and 60 d of refrigerated storage. furthermore, the acid resistance of probiotic and starter bacteria was determined from hydrochloric solutions (ph 2 and 3) of fresco cheese. the results showed that nine different combinations of bifidobacteria and l. acidophilus had a satisfactory viability (count decreases in 60 d <1 log order) in the cheese. both combinations of bifidobacteria and l. casei cultures assayed also showed a satisfactory survival (counts decreased <1 log order for bifidobacteria but no decrease was detected for l. casei). on the other hand, the three combinations of bifidobacteria, l. acidophilus, and l. casei tested adapted well to the fresco cheese environment. when a cheese homogenate at ph 3 was used to partially simulate the acidic conditions in the stomach, the probiotic cultures had an excellent ability to remain viable up to 3 h. at ph 2, the cell viability was more affected; b. bifidum was the most resistant organism. this study showed that the argentinian fresco cheese could be used as an adequate carrier of probiotic bacteria.
cordycepin: selective growth inhibitor derived from liquid culture of cordyceps militaris against clostridium spp.
the growth responses of nine human intestinal bacteria to liquid culture of cordyceps militaris link. pt. (ascomycotina: clavicipitaceae) collected from a pupa of bombyx mori l. (lepidoptera: bombycidae) were examined using spectrophotometric and impregnated paper disk methods and compared to those of tetracycline and chloramphenicol, as well as those of coptis japonica root-derived berberine chloride. the biologically active constituent of the cultures was characterized as cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine) by spectroscopic analysis. this compound revealed potent growth-inhibiting activity toward clostridium paraputrificum and clostridium perfringens at 10 microgram/disk without adverse effects on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus casei, whereas tetracycline and chloramphenicol inhibited the growth of these lactic acid-producing bacteria, clostridia and escherichia coli. however, c. militaris-derived materials revealed no growth stimulation on the bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of c. militaris. as a naturally occurring antibacterial agent, cordycepin could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by clostridia.
growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.
antiproliferative effect of fermented milk on the growth of a human breast cancer cell line.
in vivo and in vitro studies have shown an antitumor activity of lactobacilli in  colon cancer, and some epidemiologic studies have indicated a reduced risk of breast cancer in women who consume fermented milk products. we studied the direct effect of milk fermented by five bacteria strains (bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium animalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and lactobacillus paracasei) on the growth of the mcf7 breast cancer cell line. our results showed a growth inhibition induced by all fermented milks, even though b. infantis and l. acidophilus were the most effective (85% inhibition after 9 days). the antiproliferative effect was not related to the presence of bacteria in fermented milk, and neither whole milk (crude or ultrahigh temperature sterlizied) nor its main fractions (lactalbumin or beta-lactoglobulin fraction) affected cell growth. our findings suggest the presence of an ex novo soluble compound produced by lactic acid bacteria during milk fermentation or the microbial transformation of some milk components in a biologically active form. although the mechanism of the antitumor activity is not clear, the present study suggests the potentiality offered by fermented milk as producers of compounds with antiproliferative activity useful in the prevention and therapy of solid tumors like breast cancer.
in vitro fructooligosaccharide utilization and inhibition of salmonella spp. by selected bacteria.
in vitro experiments were conducted to determine: 1) inhibitory capacities of potential direct-fed microbial bacteria against salmonella serotypes; and 2) the ability of bifidobacterium bifidum, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus casei, lactococcus lactis, pediococcus sp., and salmonella spp. to grow in media containing fructooligosaccharides (fos-50 or fos pure formulation) as the only carbohydrate source. thirteen bacteria (two strains of bacillus coagulans, bacillus licheniformis, bacillus subtilis, b. bifidum, e. faecium, two strains of lactobacillus acidophilus, l. casei, pediococcus sp., propionibacterium acidopropionici, p. jensenii, and propionibacterium sp.) were tested for inhibition of six salmonella serotypes (s. california, s. enteritidis, s. heidelberg, s. mission, s. senftenberg, and s. typhimurium) using a spot-the-lawn technique. bifidobacterium bifidum, e. faecium, all lactobacilli, and pediococcus sp. clearly inhibited growth of all salmonella serotypes. in the growth experiments, e. faecium, l. lactis, and pediococcus sp. grew in media with either fos-50 or the pure formulation of fos as the sole carbohydrate source. all tested salmonella serotypes utilized fos-50 for growth; however growth varied among the serotypes. in contrast, none of the salmonella serotypes grew in media containing the pure formulation of fos as the only carbohydrate source.
[prevention of dysbacteriosis in the early neonatal period using a pure culture of acidophilic bacteria].
in order to prevent dysbacterioses occurring in the early neonatal period, 60 neonates classified with the risk group were administered, when they were still at the puerperal room, pure cultures of specially selected strains of lactobacillus acidophilus possessing marked anti-klebsiella activity and antagonistic activity against staphylococcus aureus. the cultures were instilled into the mouth and nasal passages. forty neonates administered bifidum-bacterin and 54 neonates not given biopreparations were used as control. application of the pure culture of lactobacillus acidophilus noticeably raised the efficacy of the preventive measures. over 60 percent of the neonates were discharged from the maternity home with a normally formed intestinal microflora, 60 percent had normal microflora in the fauces, 80 percent in the nose, and 70 percent of the neonates demonstrated normal skin microflora. the carriage of opportunistic microorganisms in the fauces and nose of the neonates had decreased substantially by the time of the discharge from the maternity home, while the incidence of pyo-inflammatory diseases had also reduced among them.
