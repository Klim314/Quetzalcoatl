using rapid diagnostic tests to optimize antimicrobial selection in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
new advances in rapid diagnostic tests provide several collaborative opportunities for stewardship teams, particularly in processes where delay in the initiation of appropriate therapy has significant consequences for patient outcomes. rapid molecular tests enhance one of the key functions of microbiology laboratories, which is to produce accurate organism identification and timely antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. these data are used to guide the choice of antimicrobial agents for treating infections in individual patients, and the aggregate data (i.e., hospital's antibiogram) are used to guide empiric therapy for infections before the availability of the patient's culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility testing data. in addition, accurate antimicrobial susceptibility testing data are critical for the overall success of a health care institution's antimicrobial stewardship program. tests that provide accurate organism identification and antimicrobial susceptibility not only benefit the individual patient but also increase the effectiveness of antimicrobial stewardship programs. this review focuses on the use of molecular diagnostic methods to rapidly identify staphylococcus species, enterococcus faecalis,enterococcus faecium, escherichia coli,klebsiella pneumoniae,pseudomonas aeruginosa,clostridium difficile, and candida species from clinical samples and summarizes studies that describe the application of rapid diagnostic tests in antimicrobial stewardship programs.
spectrum of activity and mode of action of rep3123, a new antibiotic to treat clostridium difficile infections.
objectives: the aim of this study was to characterize the antimicrobial profile of rep3123, a novel inhibitor of methionyl-trna synthetase (metrs) in development for the treatment of clostridium difficile infection. methods: the spectrum of activity of rep3123 was determined by susceptibility testing of c. difficile and non-target organisms. the mode of action was studied by enzyme inhibition assays, macromolecular synthesis assays, target overexpression and selection of spontaneous resistant mutants. results: rep3123 was active against a collection of 108 clinical isolates of c. difficile and against epidemic, moxifloxacin-resistant bi/nap1/027 strains (mic range=0.5-1 mg/l and mic(90) = 1 mg/l). the spectrum of activity included clinically important aerobic gram-positive cocci such as staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium (mic(90)s < 1 mg/l), but rep3123 was not active against most gram-negative bacteria. rep3123 targeted c. difficile metrs with a calculated inhibition constant (k(i)) of 0.020 nm, and selectivity was >1000-fold over human mitochondrial and cytoplasmic metrs. the specific mode of action within bacterial cells was demonstrated by macromolecular synthesis assays that showed inhibition of protein synthesis by rep3123, and by mets overexpression, which resulted in a 16-fold increase in mic for rep3123. spontaneous rep3123-resistant mutants of c. difficile (mics, 4-128 mg/l) arose with frequencies of 10(-8)-10(-9) and harboured distinct point mutations within the mets gene, resulting in 13 different amino acid substitutions. most of the metrs substitutions caused reduced catalytic efficiency and a growth fitness burden. conclusions: rep3123 demonstrated a favourable microbiological profile and was found to target c. difficile with high specificity and selectivity.
a comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
this article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (csssi), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for mrsa and csssi. while not available in the u.s., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vref) infections but inhibits cytochrome p450 a3p4, and has only modest activity against mrsa pneumonia. daptomycin effectively treats csssi but not pneumonia caused by mrsa, and is effective against all strains of staphylococcus. linezolid, available orally and intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, csssi, and infections caused by mrsa and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and vree tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the fda to treat csssi and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. dalbavancin, effective against mrsa and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action and is effective against mrsa and gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against mrsa, has few side effects. oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant staphylococcus and enterococci. ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat clostridium difficile colitis.
linezolid: a review of its use in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
linezolid is the first of a new class of antibacterial drugs, the oxazolidinones. it has inhibitory activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), glycopeptide-intermediate s. aureus (gisa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae. the drug also shows activity against certain anaerobes, including clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, peptostreptococcus spp. and bacteroidesfragilis. in controlled phase iii studies, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in the treatment of patients with infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococci and also demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. further phase iii studies have demonstrated that linezolid is an effective treatment for patients with nosocomial pneumonia, for hospitalised patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and for patients with complicated skin or soft tissue infections (sstis). in these studies, linezolid was as effective as established treatments, including third-generation cephalosporins in patients with pneumonia, and oxacillin in patients with complicated sstis. oral linezolid 400 or 600mg twice daily was as effective as clarithromycin 250mg twice daily or cefpodoxime proxetil 200mg twice daily in the treatment of patients with uncomplicated sstis or community-acquired pneumonia. linezolid is a generally well tolerated drug. the most frequently reported adverse events in linezolid recipients were diarrhoea, headache, nausea and vomiting. thrombocytopenia was also documented in a small proportion (about 2%) of patients treated with the drug. conclusions: linezolid has good activity against gram-positive bacteria, particularly multidrug resistant strains of s. aureus (including gisa), enterococcus faecium and e. faecalis (including vre). in controlled clinical trials, linezolid was as effective as vancomycin in eradicating infections caused by methicillin-resistant staphylococcus spp. and has demonstrated efficacy against infections caused by vre. as the level of resistance to vancomycin increases among s. aureus and enterococci, linezolid is poised to play an important role in the management of serious gram-positive infections.
the challenge of vancomycin-resistant enterococci: a clinical and epidemiologic study.
background: vancomycin-resistant enterococci have been recovered with increasing  frequency from hospitalized patients. risk factors, mode of nosocomial transmission, extent of colonization in hospitalized patients, and treatment options for these organisms have not been completely delineated. methods: we studied 53 patients (group a) with vancomycin-resistant enterococci isolated from various clinical specimens and also surveyed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci in stool specimens submitted for clostridium difficile toxin assays (group b). stool specimens submitted for identification of bacterial pathogens and stool specimens from hospital employees were also analyzed for vancomycin-resistant enterococci. results: seventy-six isolates of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were recovered in group a. five of these patients harbored vancomycin-resistant enterococci on admission. fifty-three of 289 group b stool specimens submitted for c. difficile toxin assays yielded vancomycin-resistant enterococci. cephalosporins and vancomycin were the most common antimicrobial agents received by both groups of patients. enterococcus faecium isolates were more resistant than enterococcus faecalis isolates to antimicrobial agents. all isolates exhibited high-level aminoglycoside resistance and were not beta-lactamase producers. there were at least 15 different molecular clones of e. faecium and three of e. faecalis. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a 100% in-hospital mortality rate. conclusions: multidrug-resistant and vancomycin-resistant enterococci have become important nosocomial pathogens that are difficult to treat. vancomycin-resistant enterococcal bacteremia was associated with a poor prognosis. we found a high rate of colonization in patients with suspected c. difficile toxin colitis. judicious use of vancomycin and broad-spectrum antibiotics is recommended, and strict infection control measures must be implemented to prevent nosocomial transmission of these organisms.
[the influence of cefpirome on intestinal bacterial flora].
cefpirome (cpr, hr810), a new parenteral cephalosporin antibiotic, was studied for its effect on the intestinal bacterial flora in pediatric patients. the subjects were children admitted for infections (6 males and 3 females, 1 month to 5 years 1 month old, weighted 3.94 to 21.0 kg). cpr was intravenously administered at a dose between 19.0 to 40.0 mg/kg, 3 to 4 doses daily over 6 to 12 days. the feces from these children were collected before, during, and after administration, and bacteria were identified and counted. cpr concentration, beta-lactamase activity, and clostridium difficile d-1 antigen were also assayed. bacterial flora changes in feces during cpr administration showed some variance, but generally 5 cases out of the 9 showed a significant decrease in enterobacteriaceae and enterococcus faecalis among aerobic bacteria. the other 4 cases showed some transient decrease, but no significant change was observed. no significant changes were recognized for enterococcus avium and enterococcus faecium, and the total aerobic bacterial count decreased in a transient manner in only one patient. regarding anaerobic bacteria, bifidobacterium and eubactrium revealed a significant decrease, a transient decrease or no change from case to case. bacteroides showed little change in count. consequently, the total anaerobic bacteria count did not reveal a large change aside from 1 case in which bacteroides was not detected before administration and a significant decrease of other bacteria was noted. in no case, glucose nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli or fungi were found dominant. although c. difficile and c. difficile d-1 antigen were detected in 3 and 4 cases, respectively, there was no exact relationship between the number of c. difficile and the characteristics of the feces. cpr was detected in fecal samples from 6 cases during administration with concentrations ranging between 1.20 to 22.4 micrograms/g. high values of cpr tended to be found in specimens with low beta-lactamase activity in the feces. when drug sensitivities of the bacteria isolated from feces before and after administration were compared, higher levels of resistance were found in some bacteria such as enterococci and bacteroides during or after administration than before administration. the above results suggest that cpr is a drug with a relatively small influence on the intestinal bacterial flora in children, but a particular attention is required for diarrhea and microbial replacement during a continuous, long-term administration of the drug.
