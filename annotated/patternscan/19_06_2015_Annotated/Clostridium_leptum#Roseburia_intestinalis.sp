TI  == senior thai fecal microbiota comparison between vegetarians and non-vegetarians using pcr-dgge and real-time pcr.
AB  == the fecal microbiotas were investigated in 13 healthy thai subjects using polymerase chain reaction denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge). among the 186 dna bands detected on the polyacrylamide gel, 37 bands were identified as representing 11 species: bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides  ovatus, bacteroides uniformis, bacteroides vulgatus, clostridium colicanis, eubacterium eligenes, e. rectale, faecalibacterium prausnitzii, megamonas funiformis, prevotella copri, and roseburia intestinalis, belonging mainly to the groups of bacteroides, prevotella, clostridium, and f. prausnitzii. a dendrogram  of the pcr-dgge divided the subjects; vegetarians and non-vegetarians. the fecal  microbiotas were also analyzed using a quantitative real-time pcr focused on bacteroides, bifidobacterium, enterobacteriaceae, clostrium coccoides-eubacterium rectale, c. leptum, lactobacillus, and prevotella. the nonvegetarian and vegetarian subjects were found to have significant differences in the high abundance of the bacteroides and prevotella genera, respectively. no significant  differences were found in the counts of bifidabacterium, enterobacteriaceae, c. coccoides-e. rectale group, c. leptum group, and lactobacillus. therefore, these  findings on the microbiota of healthy thais consuming different diets could provide helpful data for predicting the health of south east asians with similar  diets.

TI  == fluctuations in butyrate-producing bacteria in ulcerative colitis patients of north india.
AB  == aim: to study the interplay between butyrate concentration and butyrate-producing bacteria in fecal samples of ulcerative colitis (uc) patients vs control individuals. methods: fecal samples were collected from 14 control individuals (hemorrhoid patients only) and 26 uc patients (severe: n = 12, moderate: n = 6, remission: n = 8), recruited by the gastroenterologist at the department of gastroenterology, all india institute of medical sciences, new delhi, india. disease activity in uc patients was determined by clinical colitis activity index. we employed fluorescent in situ hybridization in combination with flow cytometry to enumerate the clostridium cluster population targeted by 16s rrna gene probe. major butyrate-producing species within this cluster were quantified  to see if any change existed in control vs uc patients with different disease activity. this observed change was further validated by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. in addition to this, we carried out gas chromatography to evaluate the changes in concentration of major short chain fatty acids (scfas), namely acetate, n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, in the above samples. student t test and graph pad prism-6 were used to compare the data statistically. results: there was a significant decrease of clostridium coccoides (control, 25.69% +/- 1.62% vs severe, 9.8% +/- 2.4%, p = 0.0001) and clostridium leptum clusters (control, 13.74% +/- 1.05% vs severe, 6.2% +/- 1.8%, p = 0.0001) in fecal samples of uc patients. furthermore, we demonstrated that some butyrate-producing members of the clostridial cluster, like fecalibacterium prausnitzii (control, 11.66% +/- 1.55% vs severe, 6.01% +/- 1.6%, p = 0.0001) and roseburia intestinalis (control, 14.48% +/- 1.52% vs severe, 9% +/- 1.83%, p = 0.02) were differentially present in patients with different disease activity. in addition, we also demonstrated decreased concentrations of fecal scfas, especially of n-butyrate (control, 24.32 +/- 1.86 mmol/mul vs severe, 12.74 +/- 2.75 mmol/mul, p = 0.003), iso-butyrate (control, 1.70 +/- 0.41 mmol/mul vs severe, 0.68 +/- 0.24 mmol/mul, p = 0.0441) and acetate (control, 39.51 +/- 1.76 mmol/mul vs severe, 32.12 +/- 2.95 mmol/mul, p = 0.047), in the fecal samples of uc patients. the observed decrease of predominant butyrate producers of clostridial clusters correlated with the reduced scfa levels in active uc patients. this was further confirmed by the restoration in the population of some butyrate producers with simultaneous increase in the level of scfa in remission samples. conclusion: our observations  indicate that decreases in members of the clostridial cluster resulting in reduced butyrate levels contribute to the etiology of uc.
