TI  == novel substrate specificity of glutathione synthesis enzymes from streptococcus agalactiae and clostridium acetobutylicum.
AB  == glutathione (gsh) is synthesized by gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase (gamma-gcs) and glutathione synthetase (gs) in living organisms. recently, bifunctional fusion protein, termed gamma-gcs-gs catalyzing both gamma-gcs and gs reactions from gram-positive firmicutes streptococcus agalactiae, has been reported. we revealed that in the gamma-gcs activity, s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs had different substrate specificities from those of escherichia coli gamma-gcs. furthermore, s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-glu-x(aa)-gly, from free three amino acids. in clostridium acetobutylicum,  the genes encoding gamma-gcs and putative gs were found to be immediately adjacent by blast search, and had amino acid sequence homology with s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs, respectively. we confirmed that the proteins expressed from each gene showed gamma-gcs and gs activity, respectively. c. acetobutylicum gs had broad substrate specificities and synthesized several kinds of gamma-glutamyltripeptide, gamma-glu-cys-x(aa). whereas the substrate specificities of gamma-gcs domain protein and gs domain protein of s. agalactiae  gamma-gcs-gs were the same as those of s. agalactiae gamma-gcs-gs.
