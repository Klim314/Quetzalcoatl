TI  == inhibitory activity of aloe vera gel on some clinically isolated cariogenic and periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == aloe vera is a medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antidiabetic and immune-boosting properties. in the present study we investigated the inhibitory activities of aloe vera gel on some cariogenic (streptococcus mutans), periodontopathic (aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis) and an opportunistic periodontopathogen (bacteroides fragilis) isolated from patients with dental caries and periodontal diseases. twenty isolates of each of these bacteria were investigated for their sensitivity to aloe vera gel using the disk diffusion and microdilution methods. s. mutans was the species most sensitive to aloe vera gel with a mic of 12.5 microg/ml, while a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. gingivalis, and b. fragilis were less sensitive, with a mic of 25-50 microg/ml (p < 0.01). based on our present findings it is concluded that aloe vera gel at optimum concentration could be used as an antiseptic for prevention of dental caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == new methods in the evaluation of chemical disinfectants used in health care services.
AB  == background: a considerable number of tests are recommended in the literature to evaluate in vitro commercial chemical solutions. the variety of tests reflects their limitations and the need to enhance disinfection process. methods: in this  study the efficacy of 4 chemical disinfectants selected by their practical use in health care services and by literature recommendation in aerobic and in strict anaerobic bacteria were evaluated by their practical use in health care services  and by literature recommendation in aerobic and in strict anaerobic bacteria. viability was tested in biofilms grown on glass and rubber tip carriers. results: the results showed microbial growth in chemical solutions at concentrations recommended by the literature or at very close concentrations to them. viable cells were recovered from biofilms after 30 minutes (bacteroides fragilis) and 60 minutes (streptococcus mutans and salmonella tiphymurium) contact with 2.4% glutaraldehyde and after 60 minutes (s tiphymurium) in 2.0% glutaraldehyde. in 70% ethyl alcohol, s tiphymurium was viable up to 10 minutes, escherichia coli up to 30 minutes, and s mutans up to 60 minutes. in 1% sodium hypochlorite, s mutans was viable up to 30 minutes and s tiphymurium up to 45 minutes. detection of cell viability could be related to methodologic differences, including biofilm formation, as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy. it should be emphasized that b fragilis, the most clinically relevant obligate anaerobe, remained viable in one routinely used solution. conclusion: these findings pointed out the need of periodic surveillance of disinfectants' activity used in  health care services and the need of reviewing routines of disinfection protocols.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus mutans gs-5 frua gene encoding exo-beta-d-fructosidase.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

TI  == the comparative antimicrobial effect of calcium hydroxide.
AB  == the antimicrobial effectiveness of calcium hydroxide, camphorated paramonochlorophenol, and formocresol in root canals of extracted human teeth was compared. canals in single-rooted teeth were enlarged and inoculated with streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and bacteroides gingivalis or bacteroides fragilis. after treatment with a test agent and sealing and incubation for 1 hour, the canal contents were analyzed for the number of viable  test bacteria and compared with that of inoculated teeth not treated with test agents. all test agents exhibited antimicrobial activity against all bacteria, with percent reductions in viable bacteria ranging from 64.3% to 100%. the combined data for pulpdent paste and calcium hydroxide showed significantly higher antimicrobial activity than the combined data for camphorated paramonochlorophenol and formocresol for s. mutans and b. gingivalis or b. fragilis but showed no difference for a. viscosus.

TI  == immunoglobulin a subclass distribution of naturally occurring salivary antibodies to microbial antigens.
AB  == the distribution of immunoglobulin a1 (iga1) and iga2 antibodies to various microbial antigens was determined in human parotid saliva by using monoclonal antibodies to the iga subclasses in a solid-phase radioimmunoassay. in 12 subjects examined, antibodies to streptococcus mutans glucosyl transferase, protein antigen i/ii, and cell wall carbohydrate, as well as dextrans b1355 fraction s and b512 and phosphorylcholine, occurred predominantly in the iga1 subclass. in contrast, antibodies to lipoteichoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes and whole lipopolysaccharides from bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis, and escherichia coli were predominantly of the iga2 subclass. the data  indicate that in most individuals naturally occurring antibodies to a given antigen are predominantly associated with one of the two subclasses of iga.

TI  == bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  == hematoporphyrin derivative (hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of  a specific wavelength. hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. this investigation assessed the effect of light-activated hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. light-activated hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus m-g intermedius, streptococcus mutans, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, peptococcus magnus, and clostridium perfringens, but did not affect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, or candida albicans. photoactivation of hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. combinations of light-activated hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular s. aureus. the ability of hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the  treatment of abscesses.

TI  == effect of linolenyl alcohol on the in-vitro growth of the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the effect of primary aliphatic alcohols of varying chain length and degree of unsaturation on bacterial growth was assessed, using strep. mutans bht as the main test organism. unsaturated alcohols, linoleyl and linolenyl, effectively inhibited bacterial growth. of the saturated alcohols, only lauryl and myristyl alcohols inhibited the growth of strep. mutans bht, but at concentrations much higher than those required for the unsaturated alcohols. all gram-positive organisms tested were sensitive to linolenyl alcohol. gram-negative bacteria did  not exhibit the sensitivity. linoleic and linolenic acid were inactive as antibacterial agents at the same concentration as the related alcohol. repeated exposure of strep. mutans bht to linolenyl alcohol produced no change in the sensitivity of the organism to the alcohol. significant amounts of linolenyl alcohol were found in bacteria grown in the presence of this lipid for 24 h but linolenic acid was not detected. thus the primary polyunsaturated aliphatic alcohols, particularly linolenyl alcohol, could be effective antibacterial agents for the prevention of dental caries and periodontal disease.

TI  == microbial surface interactions: reduction of the haemagglutination activity of the oral bacterium fusobacterium nucleatum by absorption with streptococcus and bacteroides.
AB  == oral strains of fusobacterium nucleatum showed haemagglutination (ha) of sheep red blood cells and attachment of ha-active f. nucleatum fragments to other microorganisms allowed a means of studying microbial surface interactions. ha-active sonicated fragments (sf) prepared from f. nucleatum were mixed with whole cell suspensions of 48 bacterial strains and, after incubation, the whole cells were separated from the non-absorbed fragments by differential centrifugation. attachment of f. nucleatum fragments to the cells was indicated by a reduction in the ha activity of the sf in the supernatant fluid remaining after absorption with whole cells. ha activity of the microbial cells used for absorption and the detection of f. nucleatum fragments on these cells by an indirect fluorescent antibody technique provided further evidence of attachment.  of the 48 strains tested, 10 absorbed f. nucleatum ha-active fragments. they included bacteroides gingivalis, bacteroides fragilis subsp. distasonis, bacteroides corrodens, streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus sanguis (blackburn and jc 74) and streptococcus mutans aht, bht, 10449 and 6715. chelators revealed that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a ca2+-dependent interaction. sugar inhibition demonstrated that f. nucleatum attached to the microorganisms via a d-galactose-containing moiety on their surface. a reduction in the absorption of f. nucleatum ha-active fragments by strep. mutans grown in a higher concentration of sucrose was observed.

TI  == effect of sonic treatment on pure cultures and aggregates of bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of a variety of bacteria were treated with ultrasonic energy using  a sonic probe. fractions of organisms killed at different sonic energies were calculated, and streptococcus mutans was 600 times more resistant than fusobacterium nucleatum, the most sensitive organism tested. the effects of sonic treatment on aggregates of bacteria were examined, and the results were interpreted as a model of the events that probably occur during the sonic dispersion of dental plaque.

TI  == effect of bacterial contamination on cecal size and cecal contents of gnotobiotic rodents.
AB  == in the present investigation the effect of various bacterial contaminations of gnotobiotic mice and rats on cecal size is presented. of the species tested, bacteroides oralis and fusobacterium nucleatum did not establish in germ-free mice. streptococcus mutans, clostridium difficile, a neisseria strain and two recent cecal isolates established, but failed to exert an effect upon the cecum of mice. a group k streptococcus and b. fragilis increased the cecal size apparently by increasing the levels of water-soluble protein, peptides, and carbohydrates in the cecal contents. mixed ileal bacteria decreased the cecal size by preventing accumulation of soluble proteins and carbohydrates in the cecum. a peptococcus strain caused a reduction by lowering the levels of insoluble material in the cecum. when this strain was combined with two clostridium isolates and introduced into gnotobiotic rats, 50 to 65% cecal reduction was observed. this polycontamination did not decrease the per cent water of the cecal contents but caused lower levels of both soluble and insoluble material to accumulate in the cecum. no net nitrogen absorption from the distal small intestine occurred in either the germ-free or polycontaminated rats.
