TI  - Liquid based microbiological transport systems: conformity assessment of two commercial devices.
AB  - We compared two types of liquid-based microbiology devices for microorganism viability according to standardized quantitative elution method CLSI M40-A2. The eSwab(R) met CLSI acceptance criteria of viability maintenance for all microorganisms tested. The Sigma-Transwab(R) failed to meet CLSI acceptance criteria for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Haemophilus influenzae.
TI  - A comparative antimicrobial analysis of various root canal irrigating solutions on endodontic pathogens: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evolution in understanding the poly-microbial environment of both endodontic infections and that of failed root canal treatments has been debatable over the years. The present study was designed to compare and analyze the effect of various root canal irrigation solutions on certain endodontic pathogens in vitro. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To analyze in vitro the zone of inhibition of the micro-organisms the following irrigating solutions were employed: a. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 5% b. Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) 3% c. Chlorhexidine 2% d. Chlorhexidine (CHX) 0.12% e. Doxycycline 0.01% f. Doxycycline 0.005% g. MTAD. An agar culture plate inoculated with four endodontic pathogens was used namely 1. Enterococcus faecalis (MTCC-439) 2. Candida albicans (MTCC-183) 3. Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC-25586) 4. Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC-27337) The inoculums were streaked out on the trypticase soy agar plate for discrete colonies with a wire loop using standard method. The inoculated plates carrying the antibiotic disks were incubated in an anaerobic jar in the following way-Anaerobic incubation-the following procedure was used to provide anaerobiosis with an increased concentration of carbon dioxide. By this method the zone of inhibition obtained by different irrigating solutions against different pathogens could be compared. RESULTS: MTAD showed maximum antibacterial activity. In case of C. albicans MTAD was less effective than 5% NaOCl, 3% NaOCl and 2% CHX, 0.12% CHX. However, it was more effective against E. faecalis, F. nuleatum and P. anaerobicus. In any case, antimicrobial activity is not the only prerequisite for an endodontic irrigant. E. faecalis strain used in this study showed resistance to doxycycline; also doxycycline was ineffective against C. albicans at 0.01% and 0.005% concentrations. CONCLUSION: It was found that MTAD was more antimicrobial than 5% NaOCl for some of the test micro-organisms; however the ability of MTAD to dissolve pulp tissue is not comparable to 5% NaOCl. In addition, 5 and 3% NaOCl showed signifcant antimicrobial activity against all test micro-organisms. The best option for a primary endodontic irrigant therefore is 5% NaOCl.
TI  - Preservation of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius DNA after loss of cell viability.
AB  - AIM: To investigate whether DNA from two obligate anaerobes, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, is recoverable after loss of cell viability induced by air exposure. METHODOLOGY: Harvested cultures of F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius were killed by exposure to air and stored in phosphate-buffered saline. Dead cells were incubated aerobically for up to 6 months. Every month, the presence of detectable DNA in the cell pellet and supernatant was assessed by conventional and quantitative PCR. Cell staining techniques were used to characterize the cell wall permeability of air-killed cells. Scanning electron microscopy was used to examine viable, freshly killed and stored cells. RESULTS: With conventional PCR, amplifiable DNA was detectable over 6 months in all samples. Quantitative PCR showed a progressive fall in DNA concentration in nonviable cell pellets and a concomitant rise in DNA concentration in the supernatant. DNA staining showed that some air-killed cells retained an intact cell wall. After storage, SEM of both air-killed species revealed shrivelling of the cells, but some cells of P. anaerobius retained their initial form. CONCLUSION: Amplifiable DNA from F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius was detectable 6 months after loss of viability. Air-killed anaerobes initially retained their cell form, but cells gradually shriveled over time. The morphological changes were more pronounced with the gram-negative F. nucleatum than the gram-positive P. anaerobius. Over 6 months, there was a gradual increase in cell wall permeability with progressive leakage of DNA. Bacterial DNA was recoverable long after loss of cell viability.
TI  - The effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer on the production of reactive oxygen species, nitrogen species and cytokines by two macrophage subtypes.
AB  - AIM: To test the effects of a mineral trioxide aggregate-based sealer (MTA Fillapex((R))) and MTA (MTA-Angelus((R))) on viability and on the production of cytokines, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen species (NO) by M1 and M2 inflammatory macrophages. METHODOLOGY: M1 (from C57BL/6 mice) and M2 (from BALB/c mice) peritoneal inflammatory macrophages were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of original and diluted extracts of MTA and MTA Fillapex (FLPX). The cell viability, ROS release and the release of tumour necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-12, IL-10 and NO in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. The data were analysed using the Mann-Whitney test and Student's t-test. RESULTS: Fillapex was cytotoxic at the highest concentrations (1:1;1:2) and decreased the viability (P < 0.05) of both macrophage types (<20%). MTA did not interfere with cellular viability. FLPX inhibited the release of ROS and decreased NO release in F. nucleatum and P. anaerobius -stimulated M1 and M2 macrophages (</=25 mu mol L(-1)). F. nucleatum-stimulated M2 macrophage cultures released lower levels of TNF-alpha when FLPX was added (</=1 ng mL(-1)). M2 macrophages released higher (>5 ng mL(-1)) levels of IL-10 than M1 macrophages. Only M1 macrophage cultures produced IL-12p70. CONCLUSIONS: Fillapex impaired effector immune responses during inflammation (M1 macrophages), as well as during healing (M2 macrophages) responses.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens in vitro.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the competition between probiotics in bio-yogurt and periodontal pathogens in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of bio-yogurt was studied by agar diffusion assays, using eight species of putative periodontal pathogens and a 'protective bacteria' as indicator strains. Four probiotic bacterial species (Lactobacillus bulgaricus, Streptococcus thermophilus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Bifidobacterium) were isolated from yogurt and used to rate the competitive exclusion between probiotics and periodontal pathogens. RESULTS: Fresh yogurt inhibited all the periodontal pathogens included in this work, showing inhibition zones ranging from 9.3 (standard deviation 0.6) mm to 17.3 (standard deviation 1.7) mm, whereas heat-treated yogurt showed lower antimicrobial activity. In addition, neither fresh yogurt nor heat-treated yogurt inhibited the 'protective bacteria', Streptococcus sanguinis. The competition between yogurt probiotics and periodontal pathogens depended on the sequence of inoculation. When probiotics were inoculated first, Bifidobacterium inhibited Porphyromonas gingivalis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas circumdentaria, and Prevotella nigrescens; L. acidophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. circumdentaria, P. nigrescens, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius; L. bulgaricus inhibited P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans, and P. nigrescens; and S. thermophilus inhibited P. gingivalis, F. nucleatum, and P. nigrescens. However, their antimicrobial properties were reduced when both species (probiotics and periodontal pathogens) were inoculated simultaneously. When periodontal pathogens were inoculated first, Prevotella intermedia inhibited Bifidobacterium and S. thermophilus. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that bio-yogurt and the probiotics that it contains are capable of inhibiting specific periodontal pathogens but have no effect on the periodontal protective bacteria.
TI  - Starvation response and growth in serum of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella intermedia, and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus.
AB  - The microbiota inhabiting the untreated root canal differ markedly from those found in post-treatment disease, yet there is limited information on the microbial characteristics distinguishing the different infections. We hypothesized that starvation survival is a key microbial property in species selection. This study analyzed starvation-survival behavior over 60 days of species representative of the untreated root canal infection: Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella intermedia and Pseudoramibacter alactolyticus. All species did not survive 1 day in water. In 1% serum, the 4 species could not survive beyond 2-3 weeks. They required a high initial cell density and >or=10% serum to survive the observation period. The results highlight a poor starvation-survival capacity of these 4 species compared with species prevalent in post-treatment infection, which are well equipped to endure starvation and survive in low numbers on minimal serum. These findings point to starvation-survival capacity as a selection factor for microbial participation in post-treatment disease.
TI  - The role of Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 on reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide production by macrophage cells stimulated with root canal pathogens.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Periapical lesions arise as a result of the activation and interaction of the host immune responses against root canal infection. Recently identified Toll-like receptors (TLR) seem to be involved in the recognition and development of immune responses against a myriad of microorganisms. However, very little information is available on the role of TLR in the induction of periapical lesions. METHOD: The role of TLR-2 and TLR-4 in the activation of murine macrophages stimulated using Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was investigated. The production of nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) was assessed. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that TLR-2 and TLR-4 are involved in the production of ROS by activated macrophages. The microorganisms induced similar levels of NO production by TLR-2-competent and TLR-2-deficient macrophages, regardless of the addition of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), ruling out a role for TLR-2 in the NO production induced by these bacteria. Only P. anaerobius induced NO production by TLR-4-competent macrophages without the addition of IFN-gamma. However, after IFN-gamma addition, F. nucleatum induced macrophage NO production. Therefore, NO production stimulated by IFN-gamma and these microorganisms seems to be TLR-4-independent. CONCLUSION: TLR-2 seems to be involved in the induction of ROS production by macrophages in response to prevalent root canal bacteria, while only F. nucleatum induced ROS production by TLR-4-competent macrophages. Both microorganisms significantly induced large amounts of NO independent of TLR-2 and TLR-4. We conclude that microorganisms may participate in the induction and progression of periapical lesions through NO and ROS production by activated macrophages.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensin-3 against pathogenic bacterial strains in human tooth root canal.
AB  - Human beta-defensin-3 (HBD3), an endogenous antimicrobial peptide, has strong broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. This study aimed to obtain recombinant HBD3 (rHBD3) and to test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial characteristics of HBD3 may offer an advantage over conventional medicine in reducing intracanal bacteria. Genetic engineering was used to obtain active rHBD3 and analysis revealed that it exhibited a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity at low micromolar concentrations against not only Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli but also against some critical pathogenic microbes in infected root canals, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Streptococcus mutans, Actinomyces naeslundii, Enterococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. In an in vitro antibacterial experiment, rHBD3 significantly eliminated pathogenic bacteria in root canals. The ratio of bacterial death was up to 98%. We conclude that HBD3 has the potential to eliminate bacteria effectively and rapidly in the local microenvironment of the root canal system and that it may contribute to successful endodontic treatment.
TI  - The influence of mineral trioxide aggregate on adaptive immune responses to endodontic pathogens in mice.
AB  - This study assessed the influence of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) on adaptive immune responses. BALB/c mice were immunized with heat-killed Fusobacterium nucleatum (Fn) in MTA or other control adjuvants, and serum IgG responses to Fn were measured. Either Fn- or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (Pa)-reactive memory T cells (Tm) were preincubated in vitro with/without MTA and restimulated with Fn or Pa. Tm proliferation and cytokine production were assessed. Compared with control groups, immunoglobulin G-antibody responses were upregulated in mice immunized with Fn in MTA in a similar manner to animals immunized with Fn in Freund's adjuvant or aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. Although MTA did not affect the upregulated expression of interleukin 10, tumor necrosis factor alpha, or RANKL by Tm, it suppressed the proliferation of Pa- or Fn-Tm and inhibited their production of Th1- or Th2-signature cytokines. MTA upregulated the adaptive humoral immune responses but had little or no effect on pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokine production by Tm.
TI  - [The development and in vitro experiment study of a bio-type root canal filling sealer using calcium phosphate cement].
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to develop a novel root canal filling sealers based on calcium phosphate cement (CPC), and to evaluate its physical-chemical properties and in vitro antibacterial activity on the predominant bacteria infecting root canal. METHODS: The fluidity and the setting time of the sealer were tested according to ISO 6876:2001(E) standards. The crystal size of the final product was determined. Its opacification with different composition were measured. The in vitro antibacterial property of the sealer was tested according to the Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing of Anaerobes recommended by National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLs). The involved bacteria included Actinomyces naeslundii(A. naeslundii), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (P. anaerobius), Porphyromonas gingivalis (P. gingivalis), Porphyromonas endodpntalis (P. endodpntalis) and Fusobacterium nucleatum (F. nucleatum). Twenty single-rooted human extracted teeth were selected to evaluate the sealing ability using dye microleakage technology. Dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed using SPSS12.0 software package. RESULTS: The new root canal filling sealer was primarily composed of hydroxyapatite in 279 nm after setting. Its liquidity was suitable, the operating time was over 30 minutes, and the controlled setting time was (1.0+/-0.5) hours. The opacification was acceptable. MIC<or=0.156-0.312. The dye penetration was significant different between two filling types (P<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The new root canal filling sealer is an ideal root canal filling sealer.

TI  - The effect of mineral trioxide aggregate on phagocytic activity and production of reactive oxygen, nitrogen species and arginase activity by M1 and M2 macrophages.
AB  - AIM: To assess the influence of co-culture with mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)  on phagocytosis and the production of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI) and nitrogen (NO) species and the arginase activity by M1 and M2 peritoneal macrophages. METHODOLOGY: Cellular viability, adherence and phagocytosis of Saccharomyces boulardii were assayed in the presence of MTA. Macrophages were stimulated with zymosan for ROI assays and with Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and IFN-gamma for NO production and arginase activity, when in contact with capillaries containing MTA. Data were analysed by T, anova, Kruskall-Wallis and Mann-Whitney tests. RESULTS: M2 macrophages displayed greater cellular viability in polypropylene tubes, greater ability to ingest yeast and smaller production of ROI and higher arginase activity when compared with M1 macrophages. Both macrophages, M1 and M2, presented similar cell adherence and NO production. The addition of bacterial preparations to macrophages interfered with NO and arginase productions. MTA did not interfere with any of the parameters measured. CONCLUSIONS: Phagocytosis and the ability of the two macrophage subtypes to eliminate microbes were not affected by MTA.
TI  - Production of antagonistic substance by Eikenella corrodens isolated from the oral cavity of human beings with and without periodontal disease.
AB  - AIMS: Antagonistic abilities may confer ecological advantages for micro-organisms in competitive ecosystems. However, reports regarding this phenomenon in Eikenella corrodens are not available. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nineteen E. corrodens strains, isolated from the oral cavity of human beings without periodontal disease (n = 5) and with aggressive (n = 9) and chronic (n = 5) periodontitis, as well as a reference strain (E. corrodens ATCC23834), were evaluated for antagonistic activity. The following indicators were used: Porphyromonas gingivalis FDC381, Prevotella intermedia ATCC25611, Actinomyces israelii ATCC12102, Eubacterium lentum ATCC25559, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC27337, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans FDCY4, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC10953, Streptococcus sanguinis ATCC10557, Streptococcus uberis ATCC9927, Streptococcus mutans IM/UFRJ, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC33591 and Candida albicans ATCC18804. All the strains showed antagonism against at least one of the indicator strains. This phenomenon was more frequently observed for strains isolated from patients with chronic periodontitis (36.4%), than those from healthy subjects (20.6%) and those with aggressive periodontitis (10.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The heterogeneous antagonistic spectrum exhibited by E. corrodens isolates suggests their ability to produce more than one antagonistic substance, whose ecological relevance is yet to be demonstrated. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This is the first description of antagonistic compound production by E. corrodens and its relationships with the clinical status of the patients.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of propolis samples from different geographical origins against certain oral pathogens.
AB  - Propolis is an agent having antimicrobial properties, however, its composition can vary depending on the area where it is collected. In the present study, the antimicrobial activity of five propolis samples, collected from four different regions in Turkey and from Brazil, against nine anaerobic strains was evaluated. Ethanol extracts of propolis (EEP) were prepared from propolis samples and we determined minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBC) of EEP on the growth of test microorganisms by using agar dilution method. All strains were susceptible and MIC values ranged from 4 to 512 microg/ml for propolis activity. Propolis from Kazan-Ankara showed most effective MIC values to the studied microorganisms. MBC values of Kazan-Ankara EEP samples were ranged from 8 to 512 microg/ml. Death was observed within 4 h of incubation for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and micros and Lactobacillus acidophilus and Actinomyces naeslundii, while 8 h for Prevotella oralis and Prevotella melaninogenica and Porphyromonas gingivalis, 12 h for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 16 h for Veillonella parvula. It was shown that propolis samples were more effective against Gram positive anaerobic bacteria than Gram negative ones. The organic chemical compositions of EEPs were determined by high-resolution gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The main compounds of EEPs were flavonoids such as pinobanksin, quercetin, naringenin, galangine, chrysin and aromatic acids such as cafeic acid. Because of increased antimicrobial resistance, propolis may be kept in mind in the treatment of oral cavity diseases.
TI  - Antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  - Agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most Gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some Clostridium difficile and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole MIC values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/mL. Ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive Gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though MIC values for piperacillin were often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. Carbapenems had MIC values < or =4 microg/L against all except some C. difficile and 2 strains of B. fragilis. All strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except C. difficile and a single Bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. Clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin MICs were found mainly among the B. fragilis and Prevotella groups, and a few C. difficile and F. nucleatum strains.
TI  - Coaggregation interactions between oral and endodontic Enterococcus faecalis and  bacterial species isolated from persistent apical periodontitis.
AB  - Interactions between Enterococcus faecalis and other species found in root canal  infections might be important for the development and persistence of periapical disease. The aim of this study was to investigate the coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis clinical isolates and species previously shown to survive and induce apical periodontitis in monkeys: Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Streptococcus anginosus. Intergeneric coaggregation assays were conducted in duplicate with observations scored immediately at 0 h, 1 h and 24 h after mixing of combinations of strains. All E. faecalis strains (n = 53) coaggregated with F. nucleatum; E. faecalis did not coaggregate with P. anaerobius or S. anginosus. One strain, E. faecalis E1, coaggregated with P. oralis, with aggregates visible at 1 h. Coaggregation interactions between E. faecalis and F. nucleatum observed in this study suggest a potential role for this combination in endodontic infections.
TI  - Anaerobic bacteria cultured from the tongue dorsum of subjects with oral malodor.
AB  - The bacteria on the dorsum of the tongue are the most frequent cause of oral malodor; however, the bacterial flora of the tongue has not been well defined. Although recent studies have used DNA probes to detect the presence of certain periodontal pathogens, cultural studies have been limited because of the complexity of the flora of the tongue dorsum. The purpose of this study was to grow and to identify maximum numbers of capnophylic Gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic micro-organisms by culturing tongue samples on to several selective and non-selective media. The most frequently isolated species included Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium group, Actinomyces spp., Eikenella corrodens, Veillonella spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, pigmented Prevotella spp. and Selenomonas spp. Reported for the first time are Actinomyces turicensis, Collinsella aerofaciens, Eubacterium saburreum, E. timidum, Prevotella tannerae, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter mucosalis, Leptotrichia buccalis, Selenomonas flueggei, and Centipeda periodontii. Species not previously reported in studies that used only molecular techniques were identified in the present study.
TI  - An in vitro time-kill assessment of linezolid and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Linezolid is a novel oxazolidinone antibacterial agent active against staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant strains), enterococci (including vancomycin-resistant strains), streptococci (including penicillin-intermediate and -resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae), and other aerobic and facultative bacteria. The agent has also demonstrated activity against a broad spectrum of Gram-positive and Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria. Previous time-kill assessments have shown linezolid to be generally bacteriostatic against staphylococci and enterococci, and bactericidal against streptococci. In this study, an anaerobic glovebox technique was employed to conduct time-kill assessments for four strains of anaerobic Gram-positive, and seven strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacteria. The time-kill experiment was performed using Anaerobe Broth medium. The drugs were tested at four-fold the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), or at the higher concentration of 8mg/L for linezolid, 2mg/L for clindamycin, and 8mg/L for metronidazole. Samples for viable count were taken at 0, 6, and 24h, and plated using the Bioscience International Autospiral DW. Exposure of samples to the aerobic environment during plating was held to less than 30min. Plates were counted after a 48h anaerobic incubation (37 degrees C). The species tested included Bacteroides fragilis (2), B. distasonis, B. thetaiotaomicron, Fusobacterium nucleatum, F. varium, Prevotella melaninogenica, Clostridium perfringens, Eubacterium lentum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (2). The activity of linezolid was compared to that of metronidazole and clindamycin, two standard anti-anaerobe agents. As expected, the control agents were very active in these assays. Metronidazole yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 3.0 or greater for nine of ten strains; clindamycin yielded log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for three strains. Linezolid also produced significant in vitro killing in this model achieving log(10)CFU/mL reductions of 2.0 or greater for six of 11 strains, and 3.0 or greater for four strains. The profile of activity was similar to that of clindamycin indicating that additional developmental studies of linezolid with anaerobic bacteria are warranted.
TI  - Evaluation of 4 swab transport systems for the recovery of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms.
AB  - Despite limitations of swab transport systems (STS), many clinical samples and bacterial isolates are sent on these devices. We evaluated the performance of 4 commercial STS: M40 Transystem (S1, Copan Italia, Bovezzo, Italy), UNI-TER (S2, MEUS, Piove di Sacco, Italy), Euromed (S3, LAB SERVICE, Surbo, Italy), and Eurotubo (S4, Deltalab, Rubi, Spain). Survival of ATCC and clinical strains with characterized resistance mechanisms, stored at room temperature and using the roll-plate method (NCCLS M40-A) after holding times of 0, 6, 24, 48, and 72 h, and 7 days, was assessed. After 24 h, only S1 was able to maintain Streptococcus pneumoniae (ATCC 6305), Haemophilus influenzae (10211), and Neisseria meningitidis (13090) viability with a percentage range of recovery with respect to the baseline count at zero time of 104-184%. Neisseria gonorrhoeae (43069) was uncultivable after 6 h with all STS except S1 (46% recovery). Eighteen percent recovery after 24 h and 7% after 6 h was observed for Fusobacterium nucleatum (25586) and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (27337), respectively, but only with S1. Resistance mechanisms in clinical isolates do not affect survival with any of the STS.
TI  - Anaerobic microbiology in 198 cases of pleural empyema: a Bulgarian study.
AB  - The aim of the study was to evaluate the incidence of anaerobic bacteria in 198 patients with pleural empyema and the susceptibility of isolates to eight antibacterial agents. Isolates were identified by the Crystal anaerobes identification system, API System rapid ID 32 A and/or routine methods. Susceptibility was tested by Sceptor MIC system for anaerobic bacteria and limited agar dilution method. Anaerobic bacteria were found in 74.2% of the patients and included 247 strains within 21 genera. The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive anaerobic cocci (52 isolates), Fusobacterium (51), microaerophilic streptococci (24), Prevotella (19) and Bacteroides species (11). Common species/groups were Fusobacterium nucleatum (in 27.2% of specimens yielding anaerobes), Micromonas micros (8.2%), Finegoldia magna (7.5%), Bacteroides fragilis group (6.8%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (6.1%) and F. necrophorum (5.4%). No resistance to chloramphenicol and ampicillin/sulbactam was detected. The susceptibility rates of Gram-negative anaerobic isolates to penicillin, cefoxitin, clindamycin, clarithromycin, metronidazole and tetracycline were 63.8%, 90.2%, 87.8%, 58.6%, 98.8% and 71%, and those of Gram-positive anaerobes were 79.2%, 100%, 84.3%, 68.4%, 41.9% and 75%, respectively. The wide diversity of isolated anaerobic genera and species and the susceptibility patterns of the isolates emphasize the role of the anaerobic microbiology in cases of pleural empyema.
TI  - Effect of mineral trioxide aggregate on cytokine production by peritoneal macrophages.
AB  - AIM: To test the effect of two commercial brands of grey mineral trioxide aggregate (ProRoot and MTA-Angelus) on cytokine production by M1 and M2 inflammatory macrophages. METHODOLOGY: M1 (from C57BL/6 mice) and M2 peritoneal inflammatory macrophages (from C57BL/6 IL12p40-/- mice) were obtained and cultured in vitro in the presence of MTA. The cellular viability and the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-12 and IL-10 in response to stimulation with interferon-gamma and Fusobacterium nucleatum or Peptostreptococcus anaerobius were evaluated. Data were analysed by Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and anova tests. RESULTS: The cements did not interfere with cellular viability or with cytokine production by either type of macrophage. However, M2 macrophages produced higher levels of IL-10 when stimulated with F. nucleatum than M1 macrophages (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The brands of MTA evaluated did not interfere in the cytokine response by M1 or M2 macrophages to the two bacteria tested. However, a difference in cytokine production between the two types of macrophages was found.
TI  - Apical periodontitis development and bacterial response to endodontic treatment.  Experimental root canal infections in monkeys with selected bacterial strains.
AB  - In six monkeys, 160 root canals were inoculated with a combination of four bacterial strains belonging to species Streptococcus milleri, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella oralis, and Fusobacterium nucleatum. In two other monkeys, 24 root canals were inoculated with a five-strain combination consisting of these strains and a strain of Enterococcus faecalis. All strains were previously isolated from an infected monkey root canal. After 8-12 months, survival of the strains was recorded bacteriologically, and the reaction in the periapical region was radiographed. From 180 of 184 root canals, one or more of the bacterial strains were reisolated. The two facultative strains were more frequently reisolated than the anaerobic strains. Apical periodontitis was registered in the periapical region of more than 96% of root canals with reisolated bacteria but in none of those without reisolated bacteria. Endodontic treatment was carried out in two sessions with an interval of 14 d without interappointment dressings, and the effect was evaluated bacteriologically before and after each treatment. The chemo-mechanical treatment reduced significantly the number of strains and bacterial cells. The facultative bacteria were more resistant to the treatment than the anaerobic bacteria. The five-strain combination had a higher survival rate than the four-strain combination.
TI  - Surveillance of susceptibility patterns in 1297 European and US anaerobic and capnophilic isolates to co-amoxiclav and five other antimicrobial agents.
AB  - In vitro susceptibility data were collected for co-amoxiclav and other antimicrobial agents against 1297 recent anaerobe isolates collected in Europe and the USA. The co-amoxiclav (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid) MIC(50/90)s (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid concentration in a ratio of 2:1, expressed in terms of amoxicillin concentration in mg/L) were 0.5/4 for Bacteroides fragilis, </=0.125/1 for Prevotella species, </=0.125/0.25 for Fusobacterium nucleatum, 0.5/1 for Eikenella corrodens, 0.25/8 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, </=0.125/0.5 for Micromonas (Peptostreptococcus) micros, </=0.25/0.5 for Fingoldia (Peptostreptococcus) magna, and </=0.125/0.125 for Porphyromonas species. The co-amoxiclav susceptibility rate for B. fragilis was 94.6%, for P. anaerobius 84.3% and for all other species tested 100%. These data indicate that co-amoxiclav remains an effective drug for the antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis of many anaerobic infections. Among the comparator drugs, metronidazole was very active against all bacterial species (>96% susceptible) except E. corrodens (MIC(50/90) of >32/>64 mg/L), which is a capnophilic organism. Imipenem was also highly active against all species (>98% susceptible). Levofloxacin and clindamycin were the least potent agents tested, particularly against Bacteroides, Prevotella and Peptostreptococcus (levofloxacin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 72.7%, Prevotella 71.5%, F. magna 72.4%; clindamycin susceptibility rates: Bacteroides 79.5%, Prevotella 92.1%, F. magna 84.7%).
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of self-etching primer-bonding systems.
AB  - Self-etching primers are now considered the new generation of dentin bonding systems that modify and incorporate the bacteria-containing smear layer into their bonding mechanism. The antibacterial effects of the self-etching primers Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond, Imperva FL Bond, One-Up BondF and Prompt L-Pop were evaluated using the bacteria Streptococcus mutans ATCC25175, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus catenaforme, Lactobacillus jensenii, Actinomyces odontolyticus, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Clostridium ramosum, Prevotella oris, Prevotella denticola and Fusobacterium nucleatum, with a disk diffusion method. A single-bottle total-etch dentin adhesive (Excite) was used for comparisons and chlorhexidine (0.2%) was used as the positive control. After incubation, zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed. One-Up BondF, Prompt L-Pop and Excite showed growth inhibition for all bacterial strains. The bonding agents of Clearfil SE Bond, Mac Bond and Imperva FL Bond were unable to inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus jensenii and Actinomyces odontolyticus, while the primers of these systems produced inhibition halos to all tested microorganisms greater than that of chlorhexidine.
TI  - In vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the NCCLS-approved reference method. Drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. Of the 176 strains of Bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem MICs of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem MICs of >32 micro g/ml. Faropenem had an MIC of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of B. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (MIC of 1 micro g/ml). Both faropenem and imipenem had MICs of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of Bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), Bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), Bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), Bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), Porphyromonas species (42 isolates), Prevotella species (78 isolates), Campylobacter species (25 isolates), Sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), Fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), Fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other Fusobacterium species (9 isolates). Faropenem and imipenem had MICs of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of Clostridium difficile; the MICs for all other strains of Clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. Faropenem had MICs of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (MICs of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). MICs were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). Other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. No metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than S. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. Some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.
TI  - Features of severe periodontal disease in a teenager with Chediak-Higashi syndrome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chediak-Higashi syndrome (C-HS) is a rare congenital disease characterized by defective neutrophil function with abnormal lysosomal inclusions, neutropenia, and reduced chemotaxis. The complete syndrome includes oculocutaneous albinism with photophobia, neurologic features, recurrent infections, and enterocolitis. METHODS: A 14-year-old male C-HS patient was referred to us because of serious periodontal destruction with acute inflamed gingiva and ulcers. Clinical and biological investigations were performed, leading to the diagnosis of C-HS. RESULTS: Laboratory findings included neutropenia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Peripheral blood smears showed giant granules in neutrophils, eosinophils, and granulocytes. Bone marrow smears showed giant inclusions in leukocyte precursor cells. These granules and inclusions were characteristic of Chediak-Higashi syndrome. Oral radiographic status showed extensive loss of alveolar bone leading, in most cases, to tooth exfoliation. Bacteria often associated with periodontitis were detected in subgingival plaque samples, including Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Prevotella melaninogenica, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Clostridium sp. Biopsies of periodontal tissues for light and electronic microscopic examinations revealed massive bacterial invasion of the epithelial tissue, epithelial cells, and connective tissue. Ultrastructural observations of periodontal polymorphonuclear leukocytes showed defective granulation, with abnormal granules not discharging their lysosomal content against engulfed bacteria. Viable dividing bacteria were found in the cytoplasm. CONCLUSIONS: In this case, early-onset periodontitis seems to be the expression of C-HS granulocyte deficiency. Periodontal treatment of these patients is often unsuccessful. This case report illustrates the importance of the dentist in initiating clinical and biological investigations in such early aggressive periodontitis in young patients.
TI  - In vitro activity of gemifloxacin (SB 265805) against anaerobes.
AB  - Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805), a new fluoronaphthyridone, was tested against  359 recent clinical anaerobic isolates by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards reference agar dilution method with supplemented brucella blood agar and an inoculum of 10(5) CFU/spot. Comparative antimicrobials tested included trovafloxacin, levofloxacin, grepafloxacin, sparfloxacin, sitafloxacin (DU-6859a), penicillin G, amoxicillin clavulanate, imipenem, cefoxitin, clindamycin, and metronidazole. The MIC(50) and MIC(90) (MICs at which 50 and 90% of the isolates were inhibited) of gemifloxacin against various organisms (with the number of strains tested in parentheses) were as follows (in micrograms per milliliter): for Bacteroides fragilis (28), 0.5 and 2; for Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (24), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides caccae (12), 1 and 16; for Bacteroides distasonis (12), 8 and >16; for Bacteroides ovatus (12), 4 and >16; for Bacteroides stercoris (12), 0.5 and 0.5; for Bacteroides uniformis (12), 1 and 4; for Bacteroides vulgatus (11), 4 and 4; for Clostridium clostridioforme (15), 0.5 and 0.5; for Clostridium difficile (15), 1 and >16; for Clostridium innocuum (13), 0.125 and 2; for Clostridium perfringens (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Clostridium ramosum (14), 0.25 and 8; for Fusobacterium nucleatum (12), 0.125 and 0.25; for Fusobacterium necrophorum (11), 0.25 and 0.5; for Fusobacterium varium (13), 0.5 and 1; for Fusobacterium spp. (12), 1 and 2; for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (13), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (13), 0.125 and 0.125; for Peptostreptococcus magnus (14), 0.03 and 0.03; for Peptostreptococcus micros (12), 0.06 and 0.06; for Peptostreptococcus prevotii (14), 0.06 and 0.25; for Porphyromonas asaccharolytica (11), 0.125 and 0.125; for Prevotella bivia (10), 8 and 16; for Prevotella buccae (10), 2 and 2; for Prevotella intermedia (10), 0.5 and 0.5; and for Prevotella melaninogenica (11), 1 and 1. Gemifloxacin mesylate (SB 265805) was 1 to 4 dilutions more active than trovafloxacin against fusobacteria and peptostreptococci, and the two drugs were equivalent against clostridia and P. asaccharolytica. Gemifloxacin was equivalent to sitafloxacin (DU 6859a) against peptostreptococci, C. perfringens, and C. ramosum, and sitafloxacin was 2 to 3 dilutions more active against fusobacteria. Sparfloxacin, grepafloxacin, and levofloxacin were generally less active than gemifloxacin against all anaerobes.
TI  - Coaggregation of Candida dubliniensis with Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - The binding of microorganisms to each other and oral surfaces contributes to the  progression of microbial infections in the oral cavity. Candida dubliniensis, a newly characterized species, has been identified in human immunodeficiency virus-seropositive patients and other immunocompromised individuals. C. dubliniensis phenotypically resembles Candida albicans in many respects yet can be identified and differentiated as a unique Candida species by phenotypic and genetic profiles. The purpose of this study was to determine oral coaggregation (CoAg) partners of C. dubliniensis and to compare these findings with CoAg of C. albicans under the same environmental conditions. Fifteen isolates of C. dubliniensis and 40 isolates of C. albicans were tested for their ability to coaggregate with strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus magnus, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonas gingivalis, and Prevotella intermedia. When C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 37 degrees C on Sabouraud dextrose agar, only C. dubliniensis strains coaggregated with F. nucleatum ATCC 49256 and no C. albicans strains showed CoAg. However, when the C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains were grown at 25 or 45 degrees C, both C. dubliniensis and C. albicans strains demonstrated CoAg with F. nucleatum. Heating the C. albicans strains (grown at 37 degrees C) at 85 degrees C for 30 min or treating them with dithiothreitol allowed the C. albicans strains grown at 37 degrees C to coaggregate with F. nucleatum. CoAg at all growth temperatures was inhibited by mannose and alpha-methyl mannoside but not by EDTA or arginine. The CoAg reaction between F. nucleatum and the Candida species involved a heat-labile component on F. nucleatum and a mannan-containing heat-stable receptor on the Candida species. The CoAg reactions between F. nucleatum and the Candida species may be important in the colonization of the yeast in the oral cavity, and the CoAg of C. dubliniensis by F. nucleatum when grown at 37 degrees C provides a rapid, specific, and inexpensive means to differentiate C. dubliniensis from C. albicans isolates in the clinical laboratory.
TI  - Experimental root canal infections in conventional and germ-free mice.
AB  - A small animal model was evaluated to study the interrelationships between microorganisms after their implantation in root canals (inferior central incisors) using germ-free (GF) and conventional (CV) mice. The selected microorganisms were: Porphyromonas endodontalis (ATCC 35406), Eubacterium lentum (ATCC 25559), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (ATCC 27337), Fusobacterium nucleatum (ATCC 10953), Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922), and Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 4083). Only P. anaerobius, E. coli, and E. faecalis, respectively, were able to colonize when inoculated alone into the root canal of both CV and GF mice. E. lentum, when inoculated alone colonized only in CV animals. P. endodontalis and F. nucleatum were unable to colonize in CV and GF animals after single inoculation. It is concluded that the experimental animal model presented herein is valuable for ecological studies of root canal infections and that only some strict anaerobic bacteria are able to colonize mice root canals when inoculated by themselves alone in pure culture.
TI  - Development of an anaerobic bacterial leakage model.
AB  - The majority of bacteria associated with infections of endodontic origin are strict anaerobes. The purpose of this study was to develop an endodontic microleakage model using strict anaerobic bacteria in a two-chamber system. Nine species of anaerobic bacteria were tested for viability and detection by either turbidity or color change of the broth. A survey of pH chromogenic substrates revealed that bromcresol purple (pH 5.2 = yellow, pH 6.8 = purple) could be used as a chromogenic indicator to detect the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Peptone-yeast extract-glucose broth (PYG) and brain heart infusion broth (BHI) were each used alone and with bromcresol purple (bpPYG, bpBHI) in this study. Fusobacterium nucleatum and F. necrophorum were viable in all four media for > 2 wk and produced both turbidity and a color change after only 1 day of incubation. Veillonella parvula in either bpBHI or BHI and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in either bpPYG or BHI were viable for > 2 wk and showed a color change or turbidity after 1 or 2 days. The results indicate that leakage of strict anaerobes may be evaluated in a two-chamber system.
TI  - Antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  - In addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. This investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol, Super EBA and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria Streptococcus fecalis, Streptococcus mitis, Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus salivarius, Lactobacillus species, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus subtilis, and Escherichia coli B and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, Prevotella (Bacteroides) buccae, Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella (Bacteroides) intermedia, Prevotella (Bacteroides) melaninogenica, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. After growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees C. Impregnated discs with the Super EBA liquid were used as positive controls. The antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and Scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials. Impregnated discs with Super EBA liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. Both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. Mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. Zinc oxide-eugenol and Super EBA pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - The gingival immune response to periodontal pathogens in juvenile periodontitis.
AB  - A gingival explant culture system was utilized to evaluate the reactivity of local immunoglobulins produced by juvenile periodontitis tissue. Gingival explant culture supernatant fluids were screened, via a standardized dot-immunobinding assay, for antibodies reactive to: Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, Campylobacter rectus, Eikenella corrodens, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Capnocytophaga ochracea, Eubacterium nodatum and Fusobacterium nucleatum and one nonoral microorganism, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica. Of the 75 juvenile periodontitis supernatant fluids tested, the organisms that reacted with the highest numbers of supernatant fluids were E. nodatum (72%) and A. actinomycetemcomitans (49%). More juvenile periodontitis than healthy tissue samples showed supernatant fluid reactivity to P. intermedia, C. ochracea, E. nodatum and P. micros. No significant difference was observed between the juvenile periodontitis group supernatant fluids reactivity and the supernatant fluids of the other periodontal disease groups tested. Cluster analysis revealed the association, as determined by supernatant fluid reactivity, of P. micros and C. ochracea in the juvenile periodontitis group. The data from this investigation are consistent with a hypothesis of multiple possible etiologies of periodontal destruction in juvenile periodontitis and other forms of periodontal diseases.
TI  - Peritonsillar abscess, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, and nonclostridial anaerobic myonecrosis: a case report.
AB  - Peritonsillar abscess is a potentially life-threatening complication of acute tonsillitis. On occasion, peritonsillar abscess can extend to neck spaces and/or to the mediastinum. We describe a case of a patient with a peritonsillar abscess that extended to the neck, producing bilateral retropharyngeal abscesses and myonecrosis of the strap muscles. Culture of a specimen of the necrotic muscle yielded Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella buccae, Lactobacillus catenaforme, another Lactobacillus species, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and some nonanaerobes. Culture of the peritonsillar abscess yielded P. intermedia and P. buccae plus P. anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Bifidobacterium dentium, viridans and group F streptococci, and Citrobacter diversus. Culture of the retropharyngeal abscess yielded Fusobacterium nucleatum and Actinomyces odontolyticus in addition to most of the aforementioned organisms. The patient underwent repeated drainage and debridement procedures and was treated with various antimicrobial agents and ultimately recovered. This case highlights the polymicrobial nature of peritonsillar abscess and the serious complications that this infection may lead to.
TI  - The normal vaginal flora, H2O2-producing lactobacilli, and bacterial vaginosis in pregnant women.
AB  - In this study of the vaginal flora of 171 pregnant women in labor at term, the flora was categorized as normal (Lactobacillus predominant), intermediate, or representative of bacterial vaginosis (BV) on the basis of a vaginal smear. BV was diagnosed in 39 women (23%); the vaginal flora was classified as normal in 50% of cases and as intermediate in 27%. H2O2-producing lactobacilli were recovered from 5% of women with BV, 37% of those with an intermediate flora, and 61% of those with a normal flora. H2O2-negative lactobacilli were equally frequent (57%-65%) in all three groups. The microorganisms most frequently recovered from women with BV included Gardnerella vaginalis, Prevotella bivia/disiens, Bacteroides ureolyticus, Prevotella corporis/Bacteroides levii, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Mobiluncus species, Peptostreptococcus prevotii, Peptostreptococcus tetradius, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, viridans streptococci, Ureaplasma urealyticum, and Mycoplasma hominis (P < .05 for each). The presence of all but three of these organisms was inversely related to vaginal colonization by H2O2-producing lactobacilli; the exceptions were B. ureolyticus, F. nucleatum, and P. prevotii. Other microorganisms were equally frequent among women with and without BV. We conclude that specific groups of anaerobes are associated with BV in this population and that a strong association exists between species associated with BV and those inhibited by H2O2-producing lactobacilli.
TI  - In vitro activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, against anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The activity of FK037, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with those of cefpirome, ceftazidime, and flomoxef against 322 recent clinical isolates of anaerobic bacteria. A fastidious facultative anaerobe, Gardnerella vaginalis, was also studied. FK037 inhibited 90% of isolates of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, Clostridium perfringens, Mobiluncus spp., G. vaginalis, and Porphyromonas gingivalis at < or = 0.78 micrograms/ml. The MICs of FK037 for 50 and 90% of Bacteroides fragilis isolates were 25 and > 200 micrograms/ml, respectively; the activity of FK037 was comparable to those of cefpirome and ceftazidime but lower than that of flomoxef. The activity of FK037 against Fusobacterium nucleatum, Fusobacterium varium, and Bilophila wadsworthia decreased when inoculum size was increased from 10(6) to 10(8) CFU/ml. Little influence of inoculum size on the activity of FK037 was observed for other isolates tested. Medium pH affected the activity of FK037 against F. varium (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 3.13 and 100 micrograms/ml, respectively) and Bacteroides gracilis (MICs at pHs 5 and 7, 12.5 and 1.56 micrograms/ml, respectively) but not against other organisms tested. FK037 was less resistant than flomoxef to hydrolysis by beta-lactamase group 2e derived from B. fragilis GAI 0558 and GAI 10150.
TI  - The influence of race and gender on periodontal microflora.
AB  - Previous studies have demonstrated that demographic characteristics of subject populations influence both the incidence of periodontal diseases and various aspects of host responses to periodontal bacteria. In this study we analyzed the components of the subgingival microflora from individuals with adult periodontitis, early onset periodontitis, gingivitis, and periodontal health as a function of gender and race (black and white). Clinical categories were analyzed individually so that there were no differences in the clinical characteristics of the sampled sites. No significant differences were noted in the subgingival microflora between males and females. When either the first two bacterial samples from each subject or all bacterial samples taken from each subject were included in the analysis, it was found that Porphyromonas gingivalis was more significantly associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group. When all samples were considered in the analysis, it was found that Peptostreptococcus anaerobius was associated with black subjects in the adult periodontitis group, while Fusobacterium nucleatum was associated with white subjects in both the adult periodontitis and early onset periodontitis groups. Thus a limited number of important bacterial components of the subgingival microflora are influenced by the race and diagnosis of the subject group.
TI  - Antibacterial efficacy of root canal medicaments.
AB  - The antibacterial efficacy of four endodontic medicaments was studied in vitro. Calcium hydroxide (CALACEPT), camphorated parachlorophenol (CPCP), Cresophene, and 2% iodine-potassium iodide (IKI) were tested against four anaerobic microorganisms, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Porphyromonus gingivalis and Fusobacterium nucleatum, for 10 or 15 min. IKI was effective only against F. nucleatum and P. gingivalis, and the others were effective against all four microorganisms.
TI  - Associations between microbial species in dental root canal infections.
AB  - The existence of commensal or antagonistic relationships between microorganisms in the root canals of teeth with apical periodontitis was investigated. Samples were taken from 65 infected human root canals and were analysed according to species, frequency of occurrence and proportion of the total isolated flora. The most frequent species were Fusobacterium nucleatum, Prevotella intermedia, Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Eubacterium alactolyticum, Eubacterium lentum and Wolinella recta. An odds ratio system was used to calculate positive or negative associations between the isolated bacteria. Strong positive associations were found between F. nucleatum and P. micros, Porphyromonas endodontalis, Selenomonas sputigena and W. recta. There was also a positive association between P. intermedia and P. micros, P. anaerobius and the eubacteria. In general, species of streptococci, Propionibacterium propionica, Capnocytophaga ochracea and Veillonella parvula showed no or negative associations with the other bacteria. The results are consistent with the concept of a special and selective environment occurring in the root canal that is due, in part, to the cooperative as well as antagonistic nature of the relationships between bacteria in the root canal.
TI  - Experimentally induced infection by oral anaerobic microorganisms in a mouse model.
AB  - A mouse model was developed to study the abscessogenic potential of pure and mixed cultures of oral anaerobes associated with infections of endodontic origin. Maximum subcutaneous lesions were seen on their backs between 3 and 14 d after inoculation. Strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Veillonella parvula were pathogenic in pure culture. A mixed culture of F. nucleatum with either Porphyromonas gingivalis or Prevotella intermedia was significantly more pathogenic than F. nucleatum in pure culture. Histopathological examination of tissue sections from control mice injected with India ink in the medium demonstrated a pathway of particulate migration from the backs of the mice to their abdomen.
TI  - Formation of nitrogen-containing metabolites from geniposide and gardenoside by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - During the course of our studies on the metabolism of iridoid glycosides by human intestinal bacteria, we found that geniposide (1) and gardenoside (4) were transformed to new nitrogen-containing compounds, genipinine (3) and gardenine (6), respectively, along with the known aglycones. Although the amounts of new metabolites were somewhat lower than those of the aglycones, they were quantitatively analyzed by means of liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Of 25 strains of human intestinal bacteria, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaotus produced appreciable amounts of 3, while a bacterial mixture of human feces produced 10 times or more higher amounts of 3, as compared to the individual strains.
TI  - Protein-kinase-C-independent activation of arachidonate release and prostaglandin E2 formation in macrophages interacting with certain bacteria.
AB  - Certain bacterial species, of which we selected Fusobacterium nucleatum, Gardnerella vaginalis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Propionibacterium acnes, were found to induce release of arachidonic acid in a dose- and time-dependent manner in mouse macrophages. The release of arachidonic acid showed a characteristic lag period of approximately 10 min and was accompanied by selective transformation into prostaglandin E2. Bacteria killed by various methods caused a similar response, indicating that bacterial surface structures rather than secreted products were involved. Down-regulation of protein kinase C by treatment of macrophages with 4 beta-phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate hardly affected the response to bacteria at all, except for a partial inhibition in the case of P. acnes. Furthermore, the generation of prostaglandin E2 was synergistically enhanced when macrophages were exposed to both bacteria and phorbol ester. It is also unlikely that bacterial activation was mediated exclusively via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+], since bacteria stimulated the release of arachidonic acid also when [Ca2+] was clamped at various levels and since the response to bacteria was enhanced in an additive to synergistic manner when combined with calcium ionophore. Changes in protein phosphorylation in macrophages exposed to F. nucleatum (Gram-negative) were virtually identical to those seen with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, while P. anaerobius (Gram-positive) induced enhanced labeling of a single detectable phosphoprotein. In both cases, the changes in protein phosphorylation showed a time lag of 4-8 min and occurred independently of protein kinase C, consistent with a possible role in signal transduction. These results demonstrate that certain bacteria cause activation of arachidonic acid release and prostaglandin E2 formation in mouse macrophages; that the response is independent of protein kinase C and that it is not wholly mediated via a rise in cytosolic [Ca2+].
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobes other than Bacteroides fragilis.
AB  - To assess the in vitro activity of cefpodoxime against anaerobic respiratory tract and oropharyngeal pathogens 77 strains belonging to 18 gram-negative and 7 gram-positive species were studied by means of agar dilution tests. For comparison cefuroxime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin + clavulanic acid and clindamycin were also tested. Cefpodoxime was found to be active at concentrations of less than or equal to 0.125 mg/l against Prevotella oralis, Prevotella buccalis, Prevotella bivia, Porphyromonas asaccharolytica, Bacteroides corporis, Bacteroides gracilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Fusobacterium naviforme and Propionibacterium acnes. Prevotella oris, Prevotella buccae, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus, and Ruminococcus bromii were inhibited at concentrations of less than or equal to 1 mg/l and Prevotella denticola, Prevotella melaninogenica, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Bacteroides pneumosintes, and Peptostreptococcus micros at concentrations of less than or equal to 4 mg/l. Strains of Veillonella parvula were inhibited by cefpodoxime at 0.25-8 mg/l, and single strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Peptostreptococcus magnus showed MICs of 32 and 64 mg/l, respectively. The results obtained warrant the use of cefpodoxime in therapy of anaerobic and mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract and similar infections not involving Bacteroides fragilis.
TI  - Tetracycline resistance in Peptostreptococcus species.
AB  - Of 15 Peptostreptococcus sp. strains isolated between 1975 and 1984, 13 hybridized with the Tet K, Tet M, or Tet O determinant. A donor Peptostreptococcus anaerobius strain carrying the three determinants could transfer Tet M to P. anaerobius and Fusobacterium nucleatum recipients but not to an Enterococcus faecalis recipient, while neither Tet K nor Tet O was transferred.
TI  - Reactivity of IgG from explant cultures of periapical lesions with implicated microorganisms.
AB  - The presence of IgG in periapical inflammatory lesions suggests that immune responses participate in the disease process. The purpose of this investigation was to study the reactivity of IgG from the supernatant fluids of explant cultures of periapical lesions with microorganisms implicated in infections of endodontic origin. Ninety periapical lesions that had been contiguous with the apex of a root were removed and maintained in explant cultures. A dot-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (dot-ELISA) was used to demonstrate the presence of IgG in the supernatant fluids of the explant cultures reactive with a panel of microorganisms associated with infections of endodontic origin. The percentages of reactivity by dot-ELISA follow: Bacteroides intermedius (84%), B. buccae (12%), Porphyromonas (Bacteroides) gingivalis (50%), P. endodontalis (58%), P. asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus micros (44%), P. anaerobius (26%), Eubacterium alactolyticum (34%), Fusobacterium nucleatum (14%), and Actinomyces israelii (6%). At least one of the three species of B. intermedius, P. gingivalis, or P. endodontalis tested gave a positive dot-ELISA with 89% of the supernatant fluids from explant cultures of periapical lesions. A lack of cross reactivity of IgG in supernatant fluids from explants of periapical lesions was demonstrated for the four strains of black-pigmented Bacteroides/Porphyromonas by dot-ELISA.
TI  - Transferable Tet M in Fusobacterium nucleatum.
AB  - Two tetracycline-resistant Fusobacterium nucleatum strains were able to transfer, by conjugation, tetracycline resistance and the Tet M determinant to recipient F. nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Enterococcus faecalis strains at a frequency of 10(-1) to 10(-8).
TI  - A rapid diagnosis of anaerobic infection in the oro-maxillary region by gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  - The relationship between volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in pus and infecting bacterial species was examined in order to establish a rapid identification system for anaerobic microorganisms in purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. VFAs were detected by the direct injection of pus into gas-liquid chromatography (GLC). Bacterial examination was carried out by anaerobic culture using blood agar plates. The bacterial identification was carried out mainly according to the VPI manual. Analysis of the direct VFA patterns of each sample resulted in 5 groups. The following bacterial species were the main isolates in each group: Streptococcus intermedius in Group A, Peptostreptococcus micros in Group B, Fusobacterium nucleatum in Group C, Bacteroides gingivalis in Group D, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius in Group E. The profile of VFAs produced in the PYG culture medium of the above isolated bacteria was compared with the direct VFA patterns. Agreement ratios between direct and PYG VFA patterns were as follows: Group A, 47.1%; Groups B and C, 45.0%; Group D, 87.5%; and Group E, 62.9%. The acetic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group B, the butyric acid concentration was more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group C, and the iso-caproic acid concentration was more than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml in Group E. In these cases, it was found that the agreement ratios between the direct and PYG FVA pattern were high. In Group D, irrespective of the concentration of iso-valeric acid detected, the agreement ratio was very high. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was studied. Efficiency rates of ABPC, PIPC, CCL, CEZ, CMZ, SBT/CPZ, JM, CLDM, MINO and GM were relatively low and resistant rates were high for the gram-negative rods.
TI  - Quantitative bacteriology of a case of acute parotitis.
AB  - It is generally assumed that the microorganisms responsible for acute suppurative parotitis are facultative anaerobes, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus viridans. A quantitative microbiologic investigation of an aspirate of pus from the case we report revealed a microbial flora (5.1 X 10(6) CFU/ml) consisting entirely of strict anaerobes (Fusobacterium nucleatum and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius). The strain of F. nucleatum was sensitive to metronidazole but resistant to penicillin, amoxicillin, and erythromycin (minimum inhibitory concentration greater than 16 micrograms/ml). P. anaerobius was sensitive to the antibiotics tested. It is concluded that a high concentration of viable anaerobic bacteria may be present in acute suppurative parotitis and thus pus obtained from cases of sialadenitis should be cultured with microbiologic methods capable of isolating strict anaerobes. Additionally, antibiotic sensitivity should be determined routinely.
TI  - Comparison of four commercial brucella agar media for growth of anaerobic organisms.
AB  - Four different commercial brucella blood agar plating media (Anaerobe Systems, BBL Microbiology Systems, Remel, and Scott Laboratories) were compared for the abilities to recover anaerobic organisms from clinical specimens and to support the growth of American Type Culture Collection anaerobic stock cultures. Following 24 h of incubation in an anaerobe chamber, Anaerobe Systems prereduced, anaerobically sterilized brucella plates yielded 63% of the total clinical anaerobe isolates, the Scott medium yielded 51%, the Remel medium yielded 42%, and the BBL medium yielded 37%. Poor growth of Peptostreptococcus magnus, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium necrophorum, F. nucleatum, and pigmented Bacteroides spp. was observed on brucella media obtained from BBL, Remel, and Scott. Data obtained with stock anaerobic cultures showed that Anaerobe Systems plates yielded good growth and produced a larger colony size with all of the strains tested in 1 day, whereas poor growth of Peptostreptococcus spp., B. melaninogenicus, and Fusobacterium spp. was noted on brucella media from BBL, Remel, and Scott.
TI  - [Studies on anaerobic infection in oro-maxillary region--rapid diagnosis by gas-liquid chromatography and antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Subject material for this study was pus collected from patients with purulent inflammation in the oro-maxillary region. Direct gas-liquid chromatography (GLC) analysis was made, bacterial isolation and identification were carried out, and comparisons were made with results from GLC analysis and anaerobic isolates in a PYG medium. In addition, antibiotic susceptibilities of anaerobic bacteria were examined. Results 1. Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 85 of 100 cases of obstructive abscesses. Of the 85, 49 were cases of mixed infection involving both anaerobic and aerobic bacteria; and 64 cases were involved with more than 2 species of anaerobic bacteria. Of the 184 strains of anaerobic isolates, 53 were Bacteroides sp. and 51 were Peptostreptococcus sp. The 2 groups accounted for more than half of the isolates. 2. Group A, in which no VFA was detected, accounted for 17 out of 100 cases. Group B, in which acetic acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group C, in which butyric acid was detected, accounted for 20 cases; and Group D, in which iso-valeric acid was detected, accounted for 8 cases. Direct GLC analysis revealed iso-caproic and caproic acids in the 35 cases constituting Group E. 3. Whereas the percentage of anaerobic bacteria was 64.7% in Group A and 60% in Group B, significantly higher percentages were noted in Group C (95%), Group D (100%) and Group E (100%). The following species were isolated as major member in the groups; Group A--Streptococcus intermedius, Group B--Peptostreptococcus micros, Group C--Fusobacterium nucleatum, Group D--Bacteroides gingivalis, and Group E--Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. 4. In all cases, the sum of VFA produced in the PYG medium by anaerobic isolates was classified into Group A' to E'. Ratios of agreement between VFA as revealed by direct GLC and VFA as revealed by PYG.GLC were as follows: Group A-A'; 47.1%, Group B-B' and C-C'; 45%, Group D-D'; 87.5%, and Group E-E'; 62.9%. 5. In Group B, no propionic acid was detected. The 2 cases in which acetic acid occurred in a concentration greater than 14 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group B'. In Group C, no isobutyric acid was detected; and the 5 cases in which butyric acid was detected in a concentration of more than 7 x 10(-4) meq/ml belonged to Group C'. Varelic acid was not detected in Group D; and 7 out of the 8 cases in which iso-valeric acid, irrespective of concentration, was detected belonged to Group D'.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)
TI  - Tetracycline resistance and TetM in oral anaerobic bacteria and Neisseria perflava-N. sicca.
AB  - Tetracycline-resistant organisms isolated from six patients with periodontal disease included Bacteroides spp., Eubacterium spp., Fusobacterium nucleatum, Neisseria perflava-N. sicca, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Veillonella parvula, and facultative streptococci. All but the Bacteroides spp. and Eubacterium spp. hybridized with the TetM determinant. An additional 417 bacterial strains were screened, and 4% of both the oral streptococci and the Fusobacterium spp. hybridized with the TetM probe.
TI  - Recovery of anaerobic bacteria from clinical specimens in 12 years at two military hospitals.
AB  - Examination of 15,844 clinical specimens submitted over 12 years (1973 to 1985) to the anaerobic microbiology laboratories in two military hospitals demonstrated the recovery of anaerobic bacteria in 4,458 (28.1%) specimens. The specimens yielded 6,557 anaerobic isolates (1.47 isolates per specimen). Bacteroides spp. accounted for 43% of all isolates; anaerobic gram-positive cocci, 26%; Clostridium spp., 7%; and Fusobacterium spp., 4%. Bacteroides spp. predominated in abscesses, obstetrical and gynecological (OBG) infections, abdominal infections, cysts, wounds, and tumors. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group accounted for 44% of all Bacteroides spp., and of them, B. fragilis was mostly isolated in abscesses, wounds, abdomen, and blood. Pigmented Bacteroides spp. accounted for 21% of all Bacteroides sp. isolates and were mostly isolated in sinus, eye, chest, bone, and ear infections. Bacteroides melaninogenicus accounted for 42% of this group's isolates. Bacteroides bivius accounted for 9% of Bacteroides spp., and most isolates were found in OBG infections. Anaerobic gram-positive cocci were mostly isolated in OBG infections, abscesses, and wounds. The predominant anaerobic gram-positive cocci were Peptostreptococcus magnus (18%), Peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus (17%), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (16%), and Peptostreptococcus prevotii (13%). Clostridium spp. were mostly isolated from wounds, abscesses, abdominal infections, and blood. The predominant strain was Clostridium perfringens (48%). Fusobacterium spp. were recovered in abscesses and abdominal and OBG infections. The predominant isolate was Fusobacterium nucleatum (47%). These data illustrate the relative frequency of the different anaerobic bacteria in a variety of infections and demonstrate the predominance of certain isolates at different sites.
TI  - Osteomyelitis in dogs and cats caused by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Localised osteomyelitis was diagnosed in 2 dogs and 2 cats. The disease was caused by fight wounds in 3 cases. Radiographic examination demonstrated a circumscribed zone of cortical bone lysis, sequestra and periosteal new bone. Each case was treated surgically by sequestrectomy and debridement. Infection was due mainly to anaerobic bacteria. The pathogenic bacteria isolated from the lesions of dogs were Actinomyces viscosus, Fusobacterium nucleatum and Bacteroides spp, and from the lesions in cats were Clostridium villosum , Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Wolinella recta and Bacteroides gingivalis. As all the bacteria were sensitive to penicillin, each case was treated with penicillin and by irrigation of the wound. This resulted in resolution of the disease, within 4 weeks, in all cases.
TI  - Death of an African elephant from probable toxemia attributed to chronic pulpitis.
AB  - A 31-year-old captive male African elephant (Loxodonta africana) of 5,000-kg body weight died suddenly in ventral recumbency. Lesions seen at necropsy were bilateral purulent pulpitis and periodontitis of both tusks, serous atrophy of coronary groove fat, Grammocephalus cholangitis, myocardial and skeletal lipofuscinosis, and scattered segmental necrosis in the pectoral muscles. Nonhemolytic streptococci, Corynebacterium sp, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Bacteroides sp, were recovered from the exudate around one or both tusks. We postulated that the elephant died of hypoxia from prolonged ventral recumbency because of weakness and inability to rise secondary to toxemia from bilateral pulpitis and periodontitis.
TI  - In vitro activity of U-57930E against anaerobic bacteria and its comparison with  clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline.
AB  - The in vitro activity of U-57930E, a pipecolic acid amide of clindamycin, was compared with those of clindamycin, ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline against 321 anaerobic clinical isolates. The MIC (micrograms/ml) of U-57930E that inhibited 95% Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus prevotii, B. melaninogenicus and P. asaccharolyticus was 0.0625; 0.03125 for Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, B. vulgatus, Propionibacterium and Peptococcus species. Clindamycin, on the other hand, gave MIC values of 0.5 microgram/ml for B. fragilis, P. prevotii and P. asaccharolyticus, 0.25 for Propionibacterium sp. All strains of Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 0.5 microgram/ml of U-57930E. Both clindamycin and U-57930E showed similar MIC values for all strains of Fusobacterium nucleatum and Propionibacterium acnes tested. The MIC values for ampicillin, carbenicillin and tetracycline were within the expected range. U-57930E had a 4 approximately 8 fold lower MIC than clindamycin and is significantly active against anaerobic bacteria.
TI  - Circulating antibodies after experimental chronic infection in the root canal of  teeth in monkeys.
AB  - Root canals of 49 teeth with necrotic pulp tissue in five monkeys were infected with Streptococcus faecalis ss liquefaciens, Actinomyces bovis, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Bacteroides oralis in various combinations. After 6 months the root canals and the periapical tissues were subjected to radiographic, bacteriologic, and histologic examinations. Signs of periapical inflammation were radiographically registered in 41 teeth, most frequently in teeth inoculated with a mixed flora. In 11 out of 16 teeth infected separately with Strep. faecalis ss liquefaciens, apical periodontitis was observed. Sera from the monkeys prior to and after the experimental inoculation were analyzed by means of gel diffusion, hemagglutination (HA), and complement binding test for antibodies against different antigen preparations of the homologous bacterial strains used for the inoculation. Detectable antibodies were seen with antigens of B. oralis in all five monkeys. Agglutinating antibodies were demonstrated with lipopolysaccharide-antigen of B. oralis in titers between 1:40 and 1:320. A marked reduction of the antibody level against lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigen after mercaptoethanol treatment indicated that a main part of the antibodies registered was of IgM-class. The study shows that certain antigens of bacterial origin from infected root canals, while affecting the periapical tissues, also stimulate the production of circulating antibodies.
TI  - The use of an anaerobic incubator for the isolation of anaerobes from clinical samples.
AB  - An anaerobic incubator was compared with a standard jar system for the isolation  of anaerobes from clinical material. Seventy specimens were selected as likely to yield anaerobes: 342 different anaerobes were isolated in the incubator and 347 in anaebrobic jars. These included Bacteroides spp (43%), Peptococcus spp (26%), Peptostreptococcus spp (13%), Veillonella spp (7%), Fusobacterium spp (7%), Clostridium spp (2%) and miscellaneous Gram-positive nonsporing bacilli (2%). Differences in isolation rates for each system were inconsistent and minor. Sixteen anaerobes were chosen for quantitative tests at the beginning and end of the study period. Miles and Misra counts showed a slight advantage of the incubator for F nucleatum, but no difference for B fragilis, B thetaiomicron, B uniformis, B bivius, B corrodens, F mortiferum, Ps anaerobius, P prevotii or Propionibacterium acnes. In almost all cases, colonies in anaerobic jars were slightly larger than those in the incubator. Disc antibiotic sensitivity tests gave the same results in each system, at the beginning and end of the study period. The anaerobic incubator provides an effective means of isolation of anaerobes in a clinical laboratory. However, several design features of the prototype would require change if the system were introduced.
TI  - Biotransformation of 1-nitropyrene in intestinal anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Mutagenic nitroaromatic compounds have recently been found in photocopies, urban  atmosphere, automobile exhaust and wastewater. 1-Nitropyrene (1-NP) is readily formed when pyrene, ubiquitous in the environment, is exposed to nitrogen dioxide in the urban atmosphere or in automobile exhaust, and is highly mutagenic, inducing 449 his+ revertants/plate/nmol from Salmonella typhimurium strain TA98 in the absence of S9 fraction in the Salmonella-microsome test. It is possible to swallow sputum or some food containing 1-NP and it would come into contact with the normal bacterial flora. We determined the 1-NP nitroreductase activity in environmental and laboratory bacterial strains. We found that the mutagenicity of 1-NP mixed with the feces of a healthy man or a culture of anaerobic bacteria was decreased. The product proved to be 1-aminopyrene (1-AP), based on its fluorescence spectrum, its mass spectrum, and its characteristic thin layer chromatographic and high performance liquid chromatographic patterns. The 1-NP nitroreductase activity of aerobic bacteria was low, but crude extracts from the anaerobic bacteria, i.e., Bacteroides fragilis, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, Fusobacterium mortiferum, F. nucleatum, Clostridium perfringens, C. sporogenes, Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, Eubacterium lentum, E. limosum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, all easily converted 1-NP to 1-AP and proportionally decreased the mutagenic activity of 1-NP.
TI  - Bacteriologic evaluation of the efficacy of mechanical root canal instrumentation in endodontic therapy.
AB  - The presence of bacteria in 17 single-rooted teeth, with periapical lesions, was  studied throughout a whole period of treatment. The root canals were irrigated with physiologic saline solution during instrumentation. No antibacterial solutions or dressings were used. Bacteria were found in all initial specimens from the teeth (median number of bacterial cells 4 x 10(5), range 10(2) - 10(7)) and the number of strains in the specimens ranged from 1 to 10.88% of the strains were anaerobic. The most commonly isolated species were: Peptostreptococcus micros, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Bacteroides oralis, Bacteroides melaninogenicus subsp intermedius and Eubacterium alactolyticum. Mechanical instrumentation reduced the number of bacteria considerably. Specimens taken at the beginning of each appointment usually contained 10(4) - 10(6) bacterial cells and at the end 10(2) - 10(3) fewer. Bacteria were eliminated from the root canals of eight teeth during the treatment. In seven root canals bacteria persisted despite treatment on five successive occasions. There was no evidence that specific microorganisms were implicated in these persistent infections. Teeth where the infection persisted despite being treated five times were those with a high number of bacteria in the initial sample.
TI  - Neutrophil chemotaxis induced by anaerobic bacteria isolated from necrotic dental pulps.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria belonging to the species Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and Eubacterium alactolyticum, isolated from necrotic dental pulps, were tested for their capacity to induce neutrophil leukocyte chemotaxis. Generation of chemotactic factors in serum by whole bacterial cells and chemotaxis induced by bacterial extracts were studied in vitro by the Boyden technique. Subcutaneously implanted wound chambers in guinea pigs were used for testing leukocyte migration in vivo. All bacterial strains had a similar high capacity to induce neutrophil chemotaxis. The heavy accumulation of polymorhponuclear neutrophil leukocytes associated with clinical and experimental infections by B. melaninogenicus or B. asaccharolyticus cannot be ascribed to any extreme ability of these organisms to generate chemotactic factors.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
