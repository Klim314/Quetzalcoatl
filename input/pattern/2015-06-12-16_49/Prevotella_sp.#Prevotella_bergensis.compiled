TI  - Prevotella bergensis sp. nov., isolated from human infections.
AB  - Eight strains of anaerobic Gram-negative bacilli isolated from infections of the  skin and soft tissues were subjected to a comprehensive range of phenotypic and genotypic tests. 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed the strains to constitute a homogeneous group, distinct from species with validly published names but related to a cluster including Prevotella buccae, Prevotella dentalis and Prevotella baroniae. A novel species, Prevotella bergensis sp. nov., is proposed to accommodate these strains. Prevotella bergensis is saccharolytic and produces acetic and succinic acids as end products of fermentation. The G + C content of the DNA of the type strain is 48 mol%. The type strain of Prevotella bergensis is 94067913T (= DSM 17361T = CCUG 51224T).
