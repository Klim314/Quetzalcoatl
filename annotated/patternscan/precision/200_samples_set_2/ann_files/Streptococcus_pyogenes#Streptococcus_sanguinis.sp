TI  == essential genes in the core genome of the human pathogen streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus, gas) remains a major public health burden worldwide, infecting over 750 million people leading to over 500,000 deaths annually. gas pathogenesis is complex, involving genetically distinct gas  strains and multiple infection sites. to overcome fastidious genetic manipulations and accelerate pathogenesis investigations in gas, we developed a mariner-based system (krmit) for en masse monitoring of complex mutant pools by transposon sequencing (tn-seq). highly saturated transposant libraries (krmit insertions in ca. every 25 nucleotides) were generated in two distinct gas clinical isolates, a serotype m1t1 invasive strain 5448 and a nephritogenic serotype m49 strain nz131, and analyzed using a bayesian statistical model to predict gas essential genes, identifying sets of 227 and 241 of those genes in 5448 and nz131, respectively. a large proportion of gas essential genes corresponded to key cellular processes and metabolic pathways, and 177 were found conserved within the gas core genome established from 20 available gas genomes. selected essential genes were validated using conditional-expression mutants. finally, comparison to previous essentiality analyses in s. sanguinis and s. pneumoniae revealed significant overlaps, providing valuable insights for the development of new antimicrobials to treat infections by gas and other pathogenic streptococci.

TI  == novel bacteriophage lysin with broad lytic activity protects against mixed infection by streptococcus pyogenes and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.
AB  == methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus [gras]) cause serious and sometimes fatal human diseases.  they are among the many gram-positive pathogens for which resistance to leading antibiotics has emerged. as a result, alternative therapies need to be developed  to combat these pathogens. we have identified a novel bacteriophage lysin (plyss2), derived from a streptococcus suis phage, with broad lytic activity against mrsa, vancomycin-intermediate s. aureus (visa), streptococcus suis, listeria, staphylococcus simulans, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus [gbs]), s. pyogenes, streptococcus sanguinis, group g streptococci (ggs), group e streptococci (ges),  and streptococcus pneumoniae. plyss2 has an n-terminal cysteine-histidine aminopeptidase (chap) catalytic domain and a c-terminal sh3b binding domain. it is stable at 50 degrees c for 30 min, 37 degrees c for >24 h, 4 degrees c for 15  days, and -80 degrees c for >7 months; it maintained full activity after 10 freeze-thaw cycles. plyss2 at 128 mug/ml in vitro reduced mrsa and s. pyogenes growth by 5 logs and 3 logs within 1 h, respectively, and exhibited a mic of 16 mug/ml for mrsa. a single, 2-mg dose of plyss2 protected 92% (22/24) of the mice  in a bacteremia model of mixed mrsa and s. pyogenes infection. serially increasing exposure of mrsa and s. pyogenes to plyss2 or mupirocin resulted in no observed resistance to plyss2 and resistance to mupirocin. to date, no other lysin has shown such notable broad lytic activity, stability, and efficacy against multiple, leading, human bacterial pathogens; as such, plyss2 has all the characteristics to be an effective therapeutic.

TI  == synthesis, antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity of novel silver(i) tris(pyrazolyl)methanesulfonate and 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane complexes.
AB  == five new silver(i) complexes of formulas [ag(tpms)] (1), [ag(tpms)(pph(3))] (2),  [ag(tpms)(pcy(3))] (3), [ag(pta)][bf(4)] (4), and [ag(tpms)(pta)] (5) {tpms = tris(pyrazol-1-yl)methanesulfonate, pph(3) = triphenylphosphane, pcy(3) = tricyclohexylphosphane, pta = 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphaadamantane} have been synthesized and fully characterized by elemental analyses, (1)h, (13)c, and (31)p nmr, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms), and ir spectroscopic techniques. the single crystal x-ray diffraction study of 3 shows the tpms ligand acting in the n(3)-facially coordinating mode, while in 2 and 5 a n(2)o-coordination is found, with the so(3) group bonded to silver and a pendant  free pyrazolyl ring. features of the tilting in the coordinated pyrazolyl rings in these cases suggest that this inequivalence is related with the cone angles of the phosphanes. a detailed study of antimycobacterial and antiproliferative properties of all compounds has been carried out. they were screened for their in vitro antimicrobial activities against the standard strains enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29922), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), streptococcus pneumoniae (atcc  49619), streptococcus pyogenes (sf37), streptococcus sanguinis (sk36), streptococcus mutans (ua159), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), and the fungus candida albicans (atcc 24443). complexes 1-5 have been found to display effective antimicrobial activity against the series of bacteria and fungi, and some of them are potential candidates for antiseptic or disinfectant drugs. interaction of ag  complexes with deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) has been studied by fluorescence spectroscopic techniques, using ethidium bromide (eb) as a fluorescence probe of  dna. the decrease in the fluorescence of dna-eb system on addition of ag complexes shows that the fluorescence quenching of dna-eb complex occurs and compound 3 is particularly active. complexes 1-5 exhibit pronounced antiproliferative activity against human malignant melanoma (a375) with an activity often higher than that of agno(3), which has been used as a control, following the same order of activity inhibition on dna, i.e., 3 > 2 > 1 > 5 > agno(3)>> 4.

TI  == the effects of titanium nitride-coating on the topographic and biological features of tps implant surfaces.
AB  == objectives: titanium nitride (tin) coating has been proposed as an adjunctive surface treatment aimed to increase the physico-mechanical and aesthetic properties of dental implants. in this study we investigated the surface characteristics of tin-coated titanium plasma sprayed (tin-tps) and uncoated titanium plasma sprayed (tps) surfaces and their biological features towards both primary human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (bm-msc) and bacterial cultures. methods: 15 mmx1 mm tps and tin-tps disks (p.h.i. s.r.l., san vittore olona, milano, italy) were topographically analysed by confocal optical profilometry. primary human bm-msc were obtained from healthy donors, isolated and expanded. cells were seeded on the titanium disks and cell adhesion, proliferation, protein synthesis and osteoblastic differentiation in terms of alkaline phosphatase activity, osteocalcin synthesis and extracellular mineralization, were evaluated. furthermore, adhesion and proliferation of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus sanguinis on both surfaces were also analysed. results: tin-tps disks showed a decreased roughness (about 50%, p < 0.05) and a decreased bacterial adhesion and proliferation compared to tps ones. no difference (p > 0.05) in terms of bm-msc adhesion, proliferation and osteoblastic differentiation between tps and tin-tps surfaces was found. conclusions: tin coating showed to modify the topographical characteristics of tps titanium surfaces and to significantly reduce bacterial adhesion and proliferation, although maintaining their biological affinity towards bone cell precursors.

TI  == streptococcus
AB  == the genus streptococcus , a heterogeneous group of gram-positive bacteria, has broad significance in medicine and industry. various streptococci are important ecologically as part of the normal microbial flora of animals and humans; some can also cause diseases that range from subacute to acute or even chronic. among  the significant human diseases attributable to streptococci are scarlet fever, rheumatic heart disease, glomerulonephritis, and pneumococcal pneumonia. streptococci are essential in industrial and dairy processes and as indicators of pollution. the nomenclature for streptococci, especially the nomenclature in medical use, has been based largely on serogroup identification of cell wall components rather than on species names. for several decades, interest has focused on two major species that cause severe infections: s pyogenes (group a streptococci) and s pneumoniae (pneumococci). in 1984, two members were assigned  a new genus - the group d enterococcal species (which account for 98% of human enterococcal infections) became enterococcus faecalis (the majority of human clinical isolates) and e faecium (associated with a remarkable capacity for antibiotic resistance). in recent years, increasing attention has been given to other streptococcal species, partly because innovations in serogrouping methods have led to advances in understanding the pathogenetic and epidemiologic significance of these species. a variety of cell-associated and extracellular products are produced by streptococci, but their cause-effect relationship with pathogenesis has not been defined. some of the other medically important streptococci are s agalactiae (group b), an etiologic agent of neonatal disease;  e faecalis (group d), a major cause of endocarditis, and the viridans streptococci. particularly for the viridans streptococci, taxonomy and nomenclature are not yet fully reliable or consistent. important members of the viridans streptococci, normal commensals, include s mutans and s sanguis (involved in dental caries), s mitis (associated with bacteremia, meningitis, periodontal disease and pneumonia), and "s milleri" (associated with suppurative  infections in children and adults). there remains persistent taxonomic confusion  regarding "s milleri." these and other streptococci of medical importance are listed intable 13-1by serogroup designation, normal ecologic niche, and associated disease.

TI  == myeloperoxidase selectively binds and selectively kills microbes.
AB  == myeloperoxidase (mpo) is reported to selectively bind to bacteria. the present study provides direct evidence of mpo binding selectivity and tests the relationship of selective binding to selective killing. the microbicidal effectiveness of h(2)o(2) and of ocl(-) was compared to that of mpo plus h(2)o(2). synergistic microbicidal action was investigated by combining streptococcus sanguinis, a h(2)o(2)-producing microbe showing low mpo binding, with high-mpo-binding escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, or pseudomonas aeruginosa without exogenous h(2)o(2), with and without mpo, and with and without erythrocytes (red blood cells [rbcs]). selectivity of mpo microbicidal action was conventionally measured as the mpo mic and minimal bactericidal concentration (mbc) for 82 bacteria including e. coli, p. aeruginosa, s. aureus, enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and viridans streptococci. both h(2)o(2) and ocl(-) destroyed rbcs at submicrobicidal concentrations. nanomolar concentrations of mpo increased h(2)o(2) microbicidal action 1,000-fold. streptococci plus mpo produced potent synergistic microbicidal action against all microbes tested, and rbcs caused only a small decrease in potency without erythrocyte damage. mpo directly killed h(2)o(2)-producing s. pyogenes but was ineffective against non-h(2)o(2)-producing e. faecalis. the mpo  mics and mbcs for e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus were significantly lower  than those for e. faecalis. the streptococcal studies showed much higher mic/mbc  results, but such testing required lysed horse blood-supplemented medium, thus preventing valid comparison of these results to those for the other microbes. e.  faecalis mpo binding is reportedly weak compared to binding of e. coli, p. aeruginosa, and s. aureus but strong compared to binding of streptococci. selective mpo binding results in selective killing.

TI  == mechanisms of oral bacteria-induced platelet activation.
AB  == the oral cavity is inhabited by over 500 different bacterial species that normally exist in ecological balance both with each other and with the host. when this equilibrium is disturbed, an overgrowth of individual organisms can occur, which, in turn, can lead to the onset of pathological processes, notably dental caries and periodontitis. generally, bacteraemias occur more frequently in individuals with periodontal disease, and these bacteraemias have been implicated in the development of a range of systemic diseases, including atherothrombotic disorders. the mechanism underlying this relationship remains to be precisely defined, although studies have shown a link between bacteria of oral origin and platelet activation. several orally derived species of bacteria interact with platelets, including those of the streptococcus (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis) and staphylococcus (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus capitis) genera, as well as pseudomonas aeruginosa and porphyromonas gingivalis. in addition, some members of both the streptococcus and the staphylococcus genera, as well as porphyromonas gingivalis, can activate platelets in vitro. the current review describes the heterogeneous mechanisms of platelet activation employed by individual bacterial species. the pathological and clinical implications of platelet activation by orally derived bacteria are discussed.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time polymerase chain reaction assay for identification of bovine mastitis pathogens.
AB  == intramammary infection (imi), also known as mastitis, is the most frequently occurring and economically the most important infectious disease in dairy cattle. this study provides a validation of the analytical specificity and sensitivity of a real-time pcr-based assay that identifies 11 major pathogen species or species  groups responsible for imi, and a gene coding for staphylococcal beta-lactamase production (penicillin resistance). altogether, 643 culture isolates originating  from clinical bovine mastitis, human, and companion animal samples were analyzed  using the assay. the isolates represented 83 different species, groups, or families, and originated from 6 countries in europe and north america. the analytical specificity and sensitivity of the assay was 100% in bacterial and beta-lactamase identification across all isolates originating from bovine mastitis (n = 454). when considering the entire culture collection (including also the isolates originating from human and companion animal samples), 4 streptococcus pyogenes, 1 streptococcus salivarius, and 1 streptococcus sanguis strain of human origin were identified as streptococcus uberis, and 3 shigella spp. strains were identified as escherichia coli, decreasing specificity to 99% in strep. uberis and to 99.5% in e. coli. these false-positive results were confirmed by sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. specificity and sensitivity remained at 100% for all other bacterial targets across the entire culture collection. in conclusion, the real-time pcr assay shows excellent analytical accuracy and holds much promise for use in routine bovine imi testing programs. this study provides the basis for evaluating the assay's diagnostic performance against the conventional bacterial culture method in clinical field trials using  mastitis milk samples.

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == identification of a novel streptococcal gene cassette mediating sos mutagenesis in streptococcus uberis.
AB  == streptococci have been considered to lack the classical sos response, defined by  increased mutation after uv exposure and regulation by lexa. here we report the identification of a potential self-regulated sos mutagenesis gene cassette in the streptococcaceae family. exposure to uv light was found to increase mutations to  antibiotic resistance in streptococcus uberis cultures. the mutational spectra revealed mainly g:c-->a:t transitions, and northern analyses demonstrated increased expression of a y-family dna polymerase resembling umuc under dna-damaging conditions. in the absence of the y-family polymerase, s. uberis cells were sensitive to uv light and to mitomycin c. furthermore, the uv-induced  mutagenesis was almost completely abolished in cells deficient in the y-family polymerase. the gene encoding the y-family polymerase was localized in a four-gene operon including two hypothetical genes and a gene encoding a hdir homolog. electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated that s. uberis hdir binds specifically to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter region of the four-gene operon. database searches revealed conservation of the gene cassette in several streptococcus species, including at least one genome each of streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus thermophilus strains. in addition, the umuc operon was localized in several mobile dna elements of streptococcus and lactococcus species. we conclude that the hdir-umuc-orf3-orf4 operon represents a novel gene cassette capable of mediating sos mutagenesis among members of the streptococcaceae.

TI  == binding of porcine ficolin-alpha to lipopolysaccharides from gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acids from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == protein(s) reactive with n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (glcnac) was isolated from porcine nonimmune serum. the molecular weight of the purified protein was found to be mainly 40 kda on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  under reducing conditions. the n-terminal 10 amino acid sequence of the purified  protein were found to be identical to that of porcine ficolin-alpha reported previously. in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the purified protein was found  to react with lipopolysaccharides (lps) from different gram-negative bacteria such as esherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella abortus equi, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexeneri, and serratia marcescens and with lipoteichoic acid (lta) from gram-positive bacteria such as streptococcus sanguis, bacillus subtilis, streptococcus pyogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. the purified protein also reacted with e. coli o26 isolated from food poisoning and bovine feces and heat-treated gram-positive bacteria such as s. aureus, b. cereus, b. subtilis, enterococcus faecium, and corynebacterum bovis. on the other hand, porcine igg isolated from nonimmune serum showed different reactivity with these lps, lta, and heat-treated bacterial cells. from the present findings, purified porcine serum protein reactive with glcnac is concluded to be ficolin-alpha playing an important role(s) in innate immunity against microbial infection with gram-positive and -negative bacteria.

TI  == single species biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates on gutta-percha points.
AB  == the participation of bacterial biofilms in the over-filled gutta-percha points associated with refractory periapical periodontitis has recently been reported. this study investigated the initial biofilm-forming ability of root canal isolates (enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus, fusobacterium nucleatum, propionibacterium acnes, porphyromonas gingivalis and prevotella intermedia) on gutta-percha points in vitro. each bacterial strain was suspended in 100% cell culture medium or in culture medium containing 4.5, 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the bacterial suspensions were then co-incubated anaerobically with gutta-percha  points for 7 d. the gutta-percha points were processed for scanning electron microscopic observation and examined for biofilm presence and thickness. e. faecalis, strep. sanguis, strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus biofilms were generated on the surfaces of the specimens incubated in culture medium supplemented with 45 or 90% (vol/vol) serum. the e. faecalis and strep. sanguis biofilms were significantly thicker than those of strep. intermedius, strep. pyogenes and staph. aureus. no biofilms were detected on the specimens incubated with f. nucleatum, prop. acnes, porph. gingivalis and prev. intermedia. these findings suggest that gram-positive facultative anaerobes have the ability  to colonize and form extracellular matrices on gutta-percha points, while serum plays a crucial role in biofilm formation.

TI  == in vitro activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin against selected bacterial pathogens isolated in italy.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin, a new injectable streptogramin, against 732 clinical strains recently isolated in italy. methods: susceptibility tests were performed according to nccls-guided mic methodology. pathogens included in the evaluation included 108 staphylococcus aureus isolates, 124 coagulase-negative staphylococcal isolates, 158 streptococcus pyogenes isolates, 30 streptococcus agalactiae isolates, 30 b-hemolytic streptococcal isolates, 18 streptococcus sanguis isolates, 80 streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, 69 enterococcal isolates, 40 haemophilus influenzae isolates, 30 moraxella catarrhalis isolates and, finally, 30 gram-positive and 25 gram-negative anaerobes. results: quinupristin/dalfopristin  inhibited staphylococcus aureus and other staphylococcus spp., irrespective of their oxacillin or erythromycin resistance phenotypes. similarly, streptococci were fully inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin. enterococcus faecalis was not  included in the spectrum of this streptogramin, while isolates of enterococcus faecium were inhibited by the new compound. respiratory pathogens such as h. influenzae and m. catarrhalis were inhibited by quinupristin/dalfopristin as well as all gram-negative anaerobes tested. conclusions: these findings suggest a putative role for quinupristin/dalfopristin in the empirical treatment of severe  nosocomial and community-acquired infections caused by pathogens often displaying resistance to multiple antibiotics. this drug may provide an alternative to glycopeptide compounds.

TI  == ph-regulated secretion of a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase from streptococcus gordonii fss2: purification, characterization, and cloning of the gene encoding this enzyme.
AB  == streptococcus gordonii and other viridans streptococci (vs) are primary etiologic agents of infective endocarditis, despite being part of the normal oral microflora. recently, a surface-bound glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) has been found on the cells of all tested streptococcal species, where it has been implicated as a virulence factor. in contrast, we observed that a soluble extracellular gapdh was the major secreted protein from s. gordonii fss2, an endocarditis strain. the biochemical properties and gene sequence of s. gordonii gapdh are almost identical to those of other streptococcal gapdhs. growth at defined phs showed that secretion of gapdh is regulated by environmental ph. gapdh was primarily surface-associated at growth ph 6.5 and shifted to > 90% secreted at growth ph 7.5. others have identified s. gordonii promoters that are up-regulated by a ph shift similar to that experienced by organisms entering the blood stream (neutral) from the oral cavity (slightly acid). analysis of our results suggests that secretion of gapdh may be a similar  adaptation by s. gordonii.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine the in vitro susceptibility to cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for various aerobic and anaerobic micro-organisms responsible for oral and pharyngeal diseases by assessing the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations  (mbcs) or minimum fungicidal concentrations (mfcs) and by determining kill-times. the mics of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate for 46 tested strains (25 reference strains and 21 clinical isolates) ranged from 8 to 500 micrograms/ml. the mic was found to be 31.25 micrograms/ml for 36% of the reference strains. even lower mic values (15.63 micrograms/ml) were observed for some anaerobic strains, for haemophilus influenzae and for candida tropicalis. mic and mbc values corresponded for the majority of strains tested while the mfc for c. tropicalis and c. albicans was much higher. only 9.5% of the clinical isolates gave a mic value of 31.25 micrograms/ml. enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus pyogenes and staphylococcus aureus showed mic at 62.5 micrograms/ml. the mic and  mbc values among the isolates were comparable, while the mfc value for the yeasts was greater. a concentration of 125 micrograms/ml of cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate inhibited the growth of all bacteria, except enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonaceae, and yeasts. cetyltrimethylammonium naproxenate shows very rapid kill-time for s. sanguis (0"), and rapid (15") for s. pyogenes, s. dysgalactiae and s. mutans and for moraxella catarrhalis, while a longer kill-time was necessary for the other microbes tested.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == the in vitro activity of moxifloxacin was compared with that of 15 antibacterial  agents against 513 gram-positive microorganisms. the mic(90) (mg/l) of moxifloxacin was 0.06 for quinolone-susceptible staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.12 for streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus agalactiae; 0.25 for streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus anginosus and actinomyces pyogenes; 0.5 for streptococcus sanguis and listeria monocytogenes, 2 for corynebacterium jekeium and bifidobacterium bivius. over 50% of enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium,  quinolone-resistant staphylococci, nocardia steroides and clostridium difficile were susceptible to 2 mg/l moxifloxacin. moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin demonstrated comparably high activity towards gram-positive cocci; moxifloxacin and clinafloxacin were most active against gram-positive bacilli.

TI  == increased interleukin-6, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-alpha production by tonsillar mononuclear cells stimulated with alpha-streptococci in patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris.
AB  == in vitro cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells under culture conditions with or without lyophilized streptococcal antigens was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). under culture conditions without any stimulus, a certain amount of interferon (ifn)-gamma, tumour necrosis factor (tnf)-alpha, and interleukin (il)-6, was detected in the supernatant culture fluids from all 29 donors tested and just detectable levels of il-1alpha and il-2 were identified in 5 of 12 donors tested; but il-4 and il-5 were not detected in  any supernatants from 21 donors tested. in 16 patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), all three alpha-streptococcal antigens from streptococcus, (s.) sanguis, s. salivarius and s. mitis induced production of il-6. ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha by tonsillar mononuclear cells at a significant level. however, no  significant induction of such cytokines by alpha-streptococcal stimulus was seen  in 13 donors without ppp. no significant difference in cytokine production by tonsillar mononuclear cells was seen between the ppp and non-ppp subjects, when stimulated with s. pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus cowan i and pokeweed mitogen.  in the experiments using tonsillar cell subsets, the cytokine inductions by alpha-streptococcal stimulus were found in monocyte-depleted cells as well as in  purified t-cells. but not in b-cells. these data suggest that il-6, ifn-gamma and tnf-alpha may play an important role in immunological reactions in the tonsils and that a hyper-immune response to some of alpha-streptococcal antigens through  increased production of such cytokines by tonsillar mononuclear cells, to which t-cells mainly contribute, may play a key role in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == [analysis of serum antibodies to alpha-streptococci in patients with tonsil-related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris].
AB  == to determine the systemic immune response to alpha-streptococci (str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis) and beta streptococcus (str. pyogenes t12) in patients with tonsil related pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp), we measured  serum antibody levels to whole cell body antigens of streptococcus (str.) sanguis, str. salivarius, str. mitis or str. pyogenes by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the serum igg antibody levels to alpha-streptococci, str. sanguis and str. salivarius were significantly higher in patients with ppp (n = 44) than in patients with recurrent tonsillitis (rt: n = 25) and in healthy  adults (n = 17). serum antibody igg level to str. pyogenes was not different among the 3 groups. the iga antibody levels against any streptococcus strain were not different among the 3 groups. the igm antibody levels to str. pyogenes were significantly higher in patients with rt than in patients with ppp. in western blot analysis, the serum igg antibodies against 25-27 kda protein from whole cell body of str. sanguis, str. salivarius and str. mitis were found more frequently in patients with ppp than in healthy adults. however, the western blot profile in str. pyogenes was not different between ppp and healthy adults. no significant difference was seen in the western blot profile of igm or igm antibodies to any streptococcal whole cell bodies. these data suggest that systemic hyper immune response to alpha-streptococci may be present in patients with tonsil-related ppp and the 25-27 kda protein of the organism may be the target for this immunologic  abnormality.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

TI  == identification of streptococci to species level by sequencing the gene encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase.
AB  == we have used a pcr assay based on the use of degenerate primers in order to characterize an internal fragment (soda(int)) representing approximately 85% of the genes encoding the manganese-dependent superoxide dismutase in various streptococcal type strains (s. acidominimus, s. agalactiae, s. alactolyticus, s.  anginosus, s. bovis, s. constellatus, s. canis, s. cricetus, s. downei, s. dysgalactiae, s. equi subsp. equi, s. equi subsp. zooepidemicus, s. equinus, s. gordonii, s. iniae, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguis, s. pneumoniae, s. porcinus, s. pyogenes, s. salivarius, s. sanguis,  s. sobrinus, s. suis, s. thermophilus, and s. vestibularis). phylogenetic analysis of these soda(int) fragments yields an evolutionary tree having a topology similar to that of the tree constructed with the 16s rrna sequences. we  have shown that clinical isolates could be identified by determining the positions of their soda(int) fragments on the phylogenetic tree of the soda(int)  fragments of the type species. we propose this method for the characterization of strains that cannot be assigned to a species on the basis of their conventional phenotypic reactions.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of gv129606, a new broad-spectrum trinem.
AB  == gv129606 is a new parenteral trinem antibiotic belonging to the beta-lactam class. it combines broad-spectrum activity (against gram-negative and -positive bacteria, aerobes and anaerobes), with high potency and resistance to beta-lactamases. comparative in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities were determined for gv129606 against more than 400 recent clinical isolates (aerobes,  including beta-lactamase producers, and anaerobes), using representative antibacterial agents (meropenem, piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin for aerobes and metronidazole, cefoxitin, piperacillin, and clindamycin for anaerobes). against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococci, gv129606 and meropenem were the most active of the drugs tested. gv129606 showed an mic for 90% of strains tested (mic90) ranging from < or =0.015 to 0.06 microg/ml against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus agalactiae. against penicillin-susceptible and -resistant streptococcus pneumoniae isolates, gv129606, meropenem, and cefpirome showed mic90s of < or =0.015 and 1 microg/ml, respectively. meropenem was the most active compound against members of the family enterobacteriaceae with mic90s of < or =0.5 microg/ml. against these species, gv129606 possessed activity superior to those of piperacillin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, and gentamicin, with mic90s of < or =8 microg/ml, but its activity was two- to sixfold less than that of ciprofloxacin (with the exception of proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii).  haemophilus spp., moraxella catarrhalis, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also included in the spectrum of gv129606. gv129606 showed good antianaerobe activity, similar to metronidazole. it was stable against all clinically relevant beta-lactamases (similar to meropenem). the in vitro activity was confirmed in vivo against septicemia infections induced in mice by selected gram-positive and -negative bacteria with 50% effective doses (ed50s) of < or =0.05 and < or =0.5 mg/kg of body weight/dose, respectively. gv129606 was as effective as meropenem against septicemia in mice caused by ceftazidime-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, exhibiting an ed50 of 0.33 mg/kg/dose.

TI  == exclusion of bioactive contaminations in streptococcus pyogenes erythrogenic toxin a preparations by recombinant expression in escherichia coli.
AB  == the streptococcal erythrogenic exotoxin a (spea) belongs to the family of bacterial superantigens and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a toxic shock-like syndrome and scarlet fever. concerning its biological activity, mainly t-cell-stimulatory properties, conflicting data exist. in this study, we show that most of the spea preparations used so far contain biologically active contaminations. natural spea from the culture supernatant of streptococcus pyogenes ny-5 and recombinant spea purified from the culture filtrate of s. sanguis are strongly contaminated with dnases. we show that natural spea induces  more tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) than recombinant spea, but we also show that dnases are able to induce tnf-alpha. in commercial spea preparations, we identified a highly active protease, which was shown not to be speb. to exclude these contaminations, we overexpressed spea cloned in the effective high-level expression vector pin-iii-ompa2 in escherichia coli. the expressed spea shows the same amino acid composition as natural spea, whereas functional studies reported so far were carried out with toxins containing an incorrect amino terminus. we describe the rapid purification of lipopolysaccharide-, dnase-, and protease-free spea in two steps from the host's periplasm and its structural characterization by circular dichroism. our results represent for the  first time the production in e. coli of recombinant spea with the authentic n-terminal sequence and a proven superantigenic activity. collectively, our results indicate that immunological studies of superantigens require highly purified substances free of biologically active contaminations.

TI  == interaction between oral alpha-streptococci and group a streptococci in patients  with tonsillitis.
AB  == the incidence of oral alpha-streptococci with inhibitory activity against group a streptococci, as a defense mechanism against bacterial infection in the oral cavity, was investigated in 141 patients with streptococcal tonsillitis. the study population included both children (n = 79) and adults (n = 62). infection by group a streptococci appeared to be more common in children than in adults, as the detection rates of inhibitory alpha-streptococci in healthy children (29.7%), as well as pediatric patients with tonsillitis (14.9%), were lower than those in  adults (63.0%; p < .01). it is possible to consider oral alpha-streptococci with  inhibitory activity to be among the indications for tonsillectomy in patients with streptococcal tonsillitis, since the detection rate of inhibitory alpha-streptococci in surgical cases (10.9%) was significantly lower than that in nonsurgical cases (31.1%; p < .01). the high detection rate of these strains during the postoperative state supported the observation that the incidence of group a streptococcal infection was decreased postoperatively. accordingly, it is useful to investigate bacterial interference between oral alpha-streptococci and  group a streptococci in patients scheduled for tonsillectomy.

TI  == post-antibiotic effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on streptococcal susceptibility to phagocytosis.
AB  == the effect of azithromycin and erythromycin on growth, cell surface hydrophobicity and the susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmnl) was examined in four streptococcus species. exposure to either 10 x mic azithromycin or erythromycin induced a post-antibiotic effect (pae) of between 2.4 and 4.3 h. erythromycin caused a longer pae for s. sanguis than azithromycin under the same conditions. the cell surface charge (hydrophobic or hydrophilic) of the streptococci was altered significantly during pae; loss of hydrophobicity was induced by both macrolides,  and this effect was variable amongst the species. the decrease in hydrophobicity  was not related to inhibition of growth. the effect of each drug during pae on the interaction of opsonised suspensions of the streptococci with human pmnl revealed that erythromycin, and to a lesser extent azithromycin, increased susceptibility to the bactericidal activity of human pmnl; this effect was abolished following pae. the present study clearly showed that pae should not only be considered as delayed bacterial growth, but also as modulation of bacterial susceptibility to phagocytosis which may influence the outcome of the host-parasite relationship.

TI  == bacterial interference in vitro. comparison between a quantitative kinetic and a  cocultivation blood agar test method.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to compare two methods for estimation of bacterial growth interference between various bacteria using a bioscreen robot analyzer, allowing kinetic documentation, and a cocultivation test on blood agar  plates. six laboratory strains with different virulence and growth requirements were used: actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, streptococcus mitis, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis. the interference activity was correlated with a reference system of streptococcus sanguis (strain alpha 89) and streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococci, gas serotypes t 9 and t 22). the methods used and results obtained were as follows: 1. estimation of synergistic and antagonistic bacterial interferences using a bioscreen robot analyzer. suspensions of viable bacteria were added to microtiter plates with different concentrations of uv light-killed bacteria in liquid media. the bioscreen analyzer monitored bacterial growth every 10 min for 24 h giving kinetic data during the growth period. synergisms as well as antagonisms were demonstrated between the tested bacterial  strains which have not earlier been reported in the literature. however, the antagonistic effect observed between the six strains was less than that induced by the s. sanguis strain on the two strains of s. pyogenes. 2. cocultivation of bacterial strains on blood agar surface with precultivated or simultaneously stamped interfering bacteria indicated no detectable interference between the six tested bacterial strains, while the s. sanguis strain inhibited the growth of s.  pyogenes strains as well as the hemolysis around the colonies. the bioscreen method was found more sensitive for testing bacterial interference compared to the commonly used blood agar test.

AB  == since serious sequelae may follow streptococcal infections, eradication is viewed as necessary for successful therapy. studies were therefore conducted to compare  the effectiveness of azithromycin with other macrolide antibiotics and amoxycillin to eliminate these organisms in experimental localized infections. in a streptococcus pneumoniae lung infection induced by transtracheal challenge, the pathogen was not recovered after therapy with azithromycin (ed50 7.9 mg/kg), while clarithromycin was not effective (ed50 > 100 mg/kg). however, in a s. pneumoniae middle ear infection, azithromycin and clarithromycin were effective (ed50 2.9 and 6.3 mg/kg, respectively) in eradicating the pathogen from this closed space infection. against a localized streptococcus pyogenes infection (implanted inoculated disc), azithromycin effectively eradicated the pathogen, while clarithromycin, roxithromycin and erythromycin did not. eradication of a viridans streptococcus or streptococcus gordonii (formerly streptococcus sanguis) from heart tissue in experimental bacterial endocarditis was also evaluated. azithromycin given prophylactically or therapeutically was efficacious in eliminating the viridans streptococcus and s. gordonii in the bacterial endocarditis model of infection; erythromycin was only marginally effective in the same studies. all studies provided evidence of the bactericidal action of azithromycin in vivo and demonstrated the ability of the compound to eradicate streptococcal pathogens in localized infections.

TI  == interfering alpha-streptococci as a protection against recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis in children.
AB  == recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis/pharyngitis is a great problem, especially in certain epidemiological situations. patients treated with antibiotics often have  a disturbed normal throat flora and may lack, e.g., alpha-streptococci known in vitro to have an interfering activity against group a streptococci. thirty-one patients with recurrent streptococcal tonsillitis were given antibiotics for 10 days. at the end of this treatment they were sprayed in their mouths with four selected alpha-streptococcal strains known to have strong growth inhibiting activity in vitro against most beta-streptococci group a. the follow-up period after this colonization was 3 months. after alpha-streptococcal treatment, none of the patients attracted a new tonsillitis during the follow-up period while 8%  of the controls had a second tonsillitis. treatment of streptococcal tonsillitis/pharyngitis with antibiotics followed by recolonization with alpha-streptococci seems to hinder further recurrences.

TI  == macrophage response to bacteria: induction of marked secretory and cellular activities by lipoteichoic acids.
AB  == lipoteichoic acids (ltas) from various bacterial species, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes, were examined for the ability  to induce secretory and cellular responses in a pure population of bone marrow-derived mononuclear phagocytes. some of the highly purified ltas, in particular ltas from bacillus subtilis, s. pyogenes, e. faecalis, and enterococcus hirae, were able to affect each of the macrophage parameters measured, i.e., reductive capacity, secretion of tumor necrosis factor and nitrite, and tumoricidal activity. as after stimulation with whole organisms or other bacterial products, secretion of tumor necrosis factor induced by these ltas reached its maximum within the first few hours of the interaction, while secretion of nitrite and tumoricidal activity required 24 to 36 h for full expression. other purified ltas, i.e., ltas from streptococcus sanguis, s. pneumoniae, and l. monocytogenes, as well as lipomannan from micrococcus luteus affected only some of these parameters, while native lta from s. aureus was inactive. there was no obvious correlation between biological activity and chain  length, kind of glycosyl substituents, glycolipid structures, or fatty acid composition of ltas. deacylation of ltas resulted in a complete loss of activity, and deacylated ltas did not impair the activity of their acylated counterparts, suggesting that acyl chains may be essential for binding of lta to the cell surface. the results demonstrate that some lta species are potent inducers of macrophage secretory and cellular activities.

AB  == the m6 protein of streptococcus pyogenes was expressed on the cell surface and secreted in streptococcus gordonii challis (formerly streptococcus sanguis) after chromosomal integration of a promoterless m6 protein gene (emm-6.1). the ermc gene, conferring resistance to erythromycin, was cloned downstream of emm-6.1, within the same clai fragment. the initiation codon of emm-6.1 was 19 bp downstream of a clai site, so that clai cleavage would leave the gene promoterless. the clai fragment containing the promoterless emm-6.1 and ermc was  ligated in vitro with a clai digest of s. gordonii chromosomal dna. random chromosomal integration of the heterologous dna was obtained by using the ligation mixture to transform the naturally competent s. gordonii challis. twenty-eight percent of transformants selected for erythromycin resistance also expressed m6. among the best m6 producers, 10 clones were selected for the stability of their phenotype. nine of the 10 clones were shown to harbour one intact copy of the emm-6.1/ermc clai fragment integrated into the chromosome. these strains both expressed m6 protein on the surface and secreted different amounts of the molecule, since in each case the protein was produced after a transcriptional fusion of emm-6.1 with a different chromosomal promoter. a s. gordonii strain expressing large amounts of surface m6 protein, as judged by immunofluorescence and western blot, was compared to the m- parental strain in a  standard opsonophagocytosis assay. of the isogenic pair, m6+ s. gordonii survived better in human blood and was phagocytosed at a slower rate.

TI  == etiology and antibiotic susceptibility of bloodstream streptococcus sp.
AB  == 249 episodes of streptococcus bacteraemia in hospitalized patients were evaluated for both clinical and microbiological features. specification of the isolates demonstrated that infective endocarditis was predominantly associated with streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus bovis whereas streptococcus pyogenes and  streptococcus milleri were the most common cause of local and/or systemic infections. in vitro-susceptibility tests towards 9 selected antibiotics proved that beta-lactam antibiotics are potent compounds for the treatment of streptococcus sp. with the exception of enterococci; that ampicillin turned out to be highly effective against enterococci; and that vancomycin may be regarded as a potent alternative in the treatment of streptococcal infections.

TI  == aggregation of group a streptococci by human saliva and effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells.
AB  == the aggregation of group a streptococci by whole, stimulated human saliva (whs) and the effect of saliva on streptococcal adherence to host cells was investigated. whs samples from 11 individuals were found to aggregate both m+ and m- group a streptococci to various degrees. the aggregating activity was sensitive to heat, edta, egta [ethylene glycol-bis(beta-aminoethyl ether)-n,n,n',n'-tetraacetic acid], sodium dodecyl sulfate, and lipoteichoic acid. none of the simple sugars tested, mercaptoethanol, albumin, or nonionic detergents had any effect on aggregation. the aggregating activity of edta-treated saliva was restored by 0.1 mm ca2+ and 1.0 mm mn2+ but not by up to  5 mm mg2+. only streptococci from the stationary phase were aggregated. hyaluronidase treatment of streptococci from the exponential phase of growth restored their ability to be aggregated, suggesting that the hyaluronic acid capsule interferes with agglutination. adsorption of whs by one strain of streptococcus pyogenes removed aggregating activity for other strains of s. pyogenes and streptococcus sanguis but not agglutinins for escherichia coli, suggesting that the agglutinin is specific for certain gram-positive bacteria. molecular sieve chromatography of whs and identification of streptococcus-binding components of saliva suggest that either a glycoprotein of approximately 360 kda  or a mucin of saliva of greater than 1,000 kda mediates aggregation of streptococci. whs also inhibited adherence of s. pyogenes to buccal epithelial cells.

TI  == association between the 65-kilodalton heat shock protein, streptococcus sanguis,  and the corresponding antibodies in behcet's syndrome.
AB  == the etiology of behcet's syndrome (bs) is unknown, but a number of streptococcal  species have been implicated. a hypothesis was postulated that a shared antigen,  such as a stress protein, might account for some of these findings. indeed, a rabbit antiserum against a 65-kda heat shock protein of mycobacterium tuberculosis revealed a corresponding 65-kda band with all six streptococcus sanguis strains examined and s. pyogenes but not with s. salivarius. by applying  a panel of nine monoclonal antibodies to the mycobacterial 65-kda heat shock protein, an approximately 65-kda antigen was identified in the uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis st3 and h.83 and one with a different mr was identified in kth-1 and s. pyogenes. monoclonal antibodies y1.2, c1.1, ii h9, and ml30, which reacted with these streptococci, recognize residues 11 to 27, 88 to 123, 107 to 122, and  276 to 297 of the 65-kda heat shock protein, respectively, suggesting that these  residues are conserved among some uncommon serotypes of s. sanguis and s. pyogenes. immunoblot analyses of sera from patients with bs for immunoglobulin a  (iga) and igg antibodies revealed bands of 65 to 70 kda with the mycobacterial heat shock protein, s. sanguis strains, and s. pyogenes, although these reactivities were also found to a lesser extent in controls. a 65- to 70-kda band was found more frequently with s. sanguis kth-2 or kth-3 and iga in serum from patients with bs than with serum from controls (p less than 0.02). antibodies in  serum were then studied by a radioimmunoassay, and in patients with bs this revealed significantly raised iga antibodies to the recombinant 65-kda mycobacterial heat shock protein and to soluble protein extracts of s. sanguis st3, kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3. whereas significant anti-65-kda heat shock protein  and anti-s. sanguis st3 antibodies were also found in sera from patients with rheumatoid arthritis and recurrent oral ulcers, the anti-s. sanguis kth-1, kth-2, and kth-3 antibodies were confined to bs. the results are consistent with the hypothesis that some of the streptococcal antigens are associated with heat shock or stress proteins, which will need to be formally established by isolating heat  shock proteins from streptococci.

TI  == mutacin activity of strains isolated from children with varying levels of mutants streptococci and caries.
AB  == a total of 157 isolates of mutants streptococci from plaque and saliva of 94 children were studied for their serotypes, mutacin production, frequency and spectrum of activity. of these isolates 71% were identified as serotype c and 22% as serotype e. serotypes f, d and g, and one untypable strain made up about 7% of the isolates. more than one serotype was found in 13% of the children. mutacin was produced by 83% of the isolates against one or more of the 14 indicator strains representing mutants streptococci. streptococcus sanguis, strep. oralis,  strep. gordonii, strep. salivarius and strep. pyogenes. isolates that had a broad inhibitory spectrum also produced larger inhibition zones than isolates that inhibited fewer strains. when evaluating the effect of mutacin in vivo on plaque  ecology, it was found that the counts of mutans streptococci or the proportion of mutans streptococci in the total streptococcal count of plaque did not differ between plaques containing strains that produced much mutacin and those with little production. the findings also failed to reveal an association between caries experience and mutacin activity.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the etiological role of immune responses in tonsillar lymphocytes of the patients with pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). in order to determine their immune response to s. pyogenes t4, s. pyogenes t12, s mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. pneumoniae, tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp, ct, and sleep apnea syndrome (control) were cultured with formalinized streptococcal cellular antigens. blastoid transformation was investigated by [3h] -thymidine uptake, while antistreptococcal antibody production were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients underwent blastoid transformation and accelerated the production of immunoglobulin g following the addition of s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii s. mitis, s. pyogenes t4, and s. pyogenes t12, while those form ct patients and controls did so only with s. pyogenes t4 and s. pyogenes t12. 2. the spontaneous production of specific igg against various streptococci, including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mitis by tonsillar lymphocytes from patients with ppp was already higher than that from ct patients and controls. the specific igm  production was also increased above that in ppp patients without any antigens. 3. s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. salivarius antigens stimulated antigen-specific igm production in tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients. 4. the levels of specific igg production against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii by tonsillar lymphocytes from ppp patients showed a relationship with the serum levels of the ppp patients. these results suggested that the sensitization of alpha-streptococci, especially s. sanguis, in the tonsillar lacunae may lead to the specific production of anti-s. sanguis antibodies in patients with ppp, and these may be involved in the pathogenesis of ppp.

TI  == streptococcal-host interactions. structural and functional analysis of a streptococcus sanguis receptor for a human salivary glycoprotein.
AB  == colonization of oral tissues by streptococcus sanguis may be influenced by a mucin-like salivary glycoprotein (sag) through a calcium-dependent interaction with a specific bacterial receptor. we report the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of the s. sanguis receptor (ssp-5) and show that this protein may bind sialic acid residues of sag. the ssp-5 protein contains three unique structural domains, two of which consist of repetitive amino acid sequences. the  n-terminal domain is comprised of four tandem copies of an 82-residue repeat which exhibits homology to m protein of streptococcus pyogenes. this region is highly charged and predicted to be alpha-helical. a second hydrophilic repetitive domain consists of three copies of a 39-amino acid sequence containing 30% proline flanked by nonrepetitive proline-rich sequence. the third domain consists of 48% proline and resides near the c terminus of the protein. secondary structure analysis of the ssp-5 sequence also identified four potential helix-turn-helix motifs that resembled e-f hand calcium binding domains. the ssp-5 protein is highly homologous to a surface antigen expressed by the mutans streptococci and the domain structure of ssp-5 is conserved within this family of proteins. the interactions of ssp-5 and of intact s. sanguis with sag were inhibited by neuraminidase digestion of the salivary glycoprotein and by simple sugars containing sialic acid, suggesting that sialic acid is the primary ligand  involved in the binding reaction.

AB  == the purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between bacterial flora in tonsillar lacunae and antistreptococcal antibody in sera of the patients with  pustulosis palmaris et plantaris (ppp). since the pustules develops or worsens after tonsillitis in many patients with ppp, a pathogenic role of tonsillar bacteria is suggested, but no significant association has been proven so far. in  this study, the aerobes in the tonsillar lacunae were identified and quantitated  in 15 adult patients with ppp and 9 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis (ct). in addition, serum streptococcal antigen-specific antibody levels in 40 adult patients with ppp, 18 adult patients with chronic tonsillitis, and 11 healthy volunteers (controls) were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa). the results were as follows. 1. a total of 53 strains (17 species) of aerobes were isolated and identified from the tonsillar lacunae in patients with ppp, while 35 strains (12 species) of aerobes were found in the patients with ct. 2. s. salivarius and s. pneumoniae were the dominant aerobes isolated from patients  with ppp or ct. 3. although the rates of isolation for staphylococcus and s. pneumoniae were lower in ppp patients than in ct patients, the rate for s. sanguis i was higher in ppp patients than in ct patients. 4. the percentage of alpha, gamma-streptococci to total aerobes in ppp patients was higher than in ct  patients. 5. the igg antibody titers against s. sanguis and s. mitis, and the igm antibody titers against all streptococci investigated in ppp patients were higher than those in both ct patients and controls. 6. moreover, both the igg antibody titers against s. pyogenes t4 and s. sanguis i and the igm antibody titers against s. sanguis i and s. sanguis ii of the patients in which ppp markedly improved after tonsillectomy were higher than those in which ppp showed less improvement postoperatively.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == [immunological analysis of streptococcus sanguis antigens].
AB  == the exact cause of behcet's disease is still unknown. recently, advanced bacterial studies revealed that behcet's disease was related to streptococcus (s.) sanguis. however, the antigenicity of s. sanguis has not been fully studied. in this study, we clarified the antigenicity of s. sanguis. we made s. sanguis antigens: mechanical braun extract (mbe) and crude cell wall (ccw) from the whole cells, membrane fraction (mf) and cytoplasmic fraction (cf) from mbe, cell wall fragment (cwf) and lipoteichoic acid (lta) from mbe. we found that the major antigenicity of s. sanguis was present in cf by use of the ouchterlony method and the elisa method. however, apart from s. pyogenes, we could not recognize a common antigenicity among s. sanguis and several other antigens, such as s-ag, irbp, retinal soluble fraction, retinal insoluble fraction and enterococcus faecalis, by the ouchterlony method. since we have clarified the antigenicity of  s. sanguis in this study, we can now perform detailed examinations with samples from patients with behcet's disease for s. sanguis antigens.

AB  == a total of 287 clinical isolates of streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) were  tested for their ability to undergo autolysis when treated with sodium deoxycholate. the test was positive for all but one isolate, strain doc-1. this autolysis required the activity of an enzyme which is unique and characteristic of s. pneumoniae: a choline-dependent n-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase, the gene product of the lyta gene. we used lyta as a dna probe to test the distribution of the autolysin gene among clinical isolates of s. pneumoniae. in dot blot hybridization experiments our probe reacted with the dna of 60 of 60 strains tested, including the autolysis-deficient clinical isolate doc-1. no hybridization occurred when strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecalis, streptococcus (enterococcus) faecium, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus bovis were tested. the lyta gene appears to be an ideal candidate for use as a dna probe for the identification of s. pneumoniae.

AB  == the adherence of streptococcus sanguis to specific receptors exposed or deposited at the site of endothelial damage may play an important role in the development of infective endocarditis. adherence of the challis strain of s. sanguis to gelatin (or collagen) and gelatin-binding components of plasma was examined with  an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. s. sanguis adhered poorly to immobilized gelatin and to molecular or fibrillar collagen. however, in the presence of fresh human plasma, the adherence of s. sanguis to all three substrates increased as much as eightfold. removal of gelatin-binding proteins eliminates the ability of  plasma to enhance adherence of s. sanguis to the substrates. addition of purified human plasma fibronectin (fn) to the absorbed plasma restored the adherence-promoting ability in a dose-dependent manner. a similar dose-dependent  increase in s. sanguis adherence was observed when increasing concentrations of fn alone were added to the gelatin-coated assay wells. s. sanguis adherence to immobilized fibronectin could not be inhibited by preincubating either the bacteria or the gelatin-coated assay wells with fn or by including excess soluble fn in the assay mixture. studies with peptides purified from trypsin digests of fn indicated that the 160- to 180-kilodalton (kda) fragments which retain both the gelatin-binding and the cell-binding regions of the intact molecule support adherence of s. sanguis to gelatin. the 160- to 180-kda fragments inhibited the interaction of s. sanguis with immobilized fn. in contrast, intact fn and the 31-kda amino-terminal fragment were unable to inhibit the adherence when used in  equivalent or greater molar amounts. these in vitro results suggest that in the presence of whole plasma, s. sanguis binds to immobilized gelatin or collagen via fn bound to the immobilized substrates. our finding that adherence of s. sanguis  to immobilized fn can occur in the presence of large concentrations of fn, whether in plasma or purified, indicates that a s. sanguis-binding domain is cryptic in the fn molecule while in solution and is exposed by a conformational change when the fn becomes bound to gelatin-coated plastic. the ability of peptide fragments of fn to inhibit s. sanguis adherence is consistent with this hypothesis.

TI  == effect of spiramycin on adhesiveness and phagocytosis of gram-positive cocci.
AB  == three strains of staphylococcus aureus, serotype 18, cowan i and serotype 66438,  and different species of streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes, str, mutans, str.  sanguis and str. faecalis) were tested for their adherence to buccal cells (as measured by interference contrast microscopy) and phagocytosis by rat polymorphonuclear leucocytes (pmns) (as measured by fluorescence microscopy with  a vital fluorochrome, acridine orange). pretreatment of cocci with serial two-fold dilutions of spiramycin (from 1/2 to 1/1024 the mic), increased the diameter of bacterial cells and decreased the adherence of staphylococci and streptococci to buccal cells. exposure of streptococci to 1/4 the mic of spiramycin led to an increase of the phagocytic capacity of pmns. pretreatment of pmns with a therapeutic concentration (2 mg/l) also stimulated the phagocytosis of streptococci. action of spiramycin on the phagocytosis of staphylococci varied according to the strain tested. although in-vitro results cannot be directly compared with in-vivo data, it is of interest that spiramycin decreases adherence of different gram-positive cocci and enhances phagocytic capacity of pmns.

TI  == host-vector system for integration of recombinant dna into chromosomes of transformable and nontransformable streptococci.
AB  == we describe a genetic system in which transformation of streptococcus pneumoniae  and streptococcus sanguis was used to insert recombinant dna into the conjugative chromosomal element omega (cat tetm) 6001 (omega 6001). the element containing the recombinant dna was then transferred by conjugation to the chromosome of transformable and nontransformable streptococci. when escherichia coli plasmid pdp36 was used as donor in transformation, it was capable of inserting 5.9 kilobases of heterologous dna into the chromosome of competent streptococcal strains carrying omega 6001; the transformants were scored for erythromycin resistance. genetic analysis showed that in a fraction of the erythromycin-resistant transformants the integration via flanking homology of the heterologous dna caused inactivation of the tetm gene of omega 6001. by analyzing the stability of the resistance markers, we found that stable integration of heterologous dna was achieved only in the erythromycin-resistant, tetracycline-sensitive transformants. it was possible to detect conjugal transfer of the heterologous sequences from stable transformants to strains of s. pneumoniae, s. sanguis, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus faecalis. the omega 6001-pdp36 host-vector system opens new possibilities for gene transfer in  streptococci. by this method cloned streptococcal dna (possibly mutagenized in vitro) can be returned to the original host, greatly facilitating complementation tests and fine physiological studies.

AB  == receptors for erythrogenic toxin a (eta) of streptococcus pyogenes (strain ny-5)  were demonstrated on human peripheral blood lymphocytes by binding of eta-gold conjugates to the cell surface. the specificity of the binding was proved in control experiments. the dark-red granules observed by light microscopy on unfixed cells were revealed by transmission electron microscopy to be patches of  gold particles. by light microscopy on samples from 48 blood donors a mean value  of 34 +/- 13% of eta-receptor bearing lymphocytes was ascertained. the predominant part of the cells exhibited only a weak or moderate labelling. transmission electron microscopy of prefixed cells revealed an attachment of single gold particles distributed over the whole cell surface. counts of gold particles on serial sections yielded depending on prefixation values of 50-600 receptors/cell (1% glutaraldehyde) and 1000-7000 receptors/cell (0.26% glutaraldehyde), respectively. eta cloned in streptococcus sanguis as well as the toxoid of eta exhibited a comparable binding as eta (ny-5).

TI  == extracellular matrix proteins (fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen) bind and aggregate bacteria.
AB  == the normal microbial colonization of sites in the body's tissues by certain bacteria requires that the bacteria first bind to extracellular secreted constituents, cell-surface membranes, or cell matrixes. this study examines two interactions of a variety of bacteria with the cell matrix noncollagenous proteins fibronectin and laminin and with basement membrane (type iv) collagen. adherence of bacteria to matrix proteins coated on tissue culture wells was examined with the use of radiolabeled bacteria. staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and streptococcus sanguis bound well to fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen, whereas a variety of gram-negative organisms did not bind. the interaction of soluble laminin, fibronectin, and type iv collagen with bacteria was monitored by nephelometry with the use of a platelet aggregometer. s. aureus aggregated in response to fibronectin, laminin, or type iv collagen. in contrast, gram-negative organisms did not aggregate with these proteins. it appears that fibronectin, laminin, and type iv collagen can bind and aggregate certain gram-positive bacteria, and this binding is dependent on the surface characteristics of the organism. these adhesion molecules may play a role in the normal colonization of sites by microorganisms and in invasion during infections.

TI  == molecular genetics of resistance to macrolides, lincosamides and streptogramin b  (mls) in streptococci.
AB  == resistance to macrolides-lincosamides-streptogramin b (mls phenotype) appears in  almost all streptococcal species isolated from man. genes coding for mls resistance are located on plasmids and one mls resistance transposon has been described. mls resistance genes have also been found in a large number of plasmid-free strains. plasmids of 17 to 20 megadaltons (mdal) that code either for mls or for both mls and chloramphenicol resistance are found in streptococci  of groups a, b, c, d (streptococcus faecalis) and g. these plasmids have broad host ranges (conjugative intraspecies, interspecies and intergeneric transfer), display similar restriction enzyme patterns and share a considerable degree of homology (78 to 95%). one smaller non-conjugative mls resistance plasmid has been isolated from str. sanguis (4.5 mdal). in group d (str. faecalis, str. faecium) streptococci, mls resistance genes are also found on plasmids that carry other antibiotic resistance (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, high-levels of streptomycin and kanamycin). these multi-resistance plasmids are either conjugative or non-conjugative and are of various sizes and molecular species and those that have been tested have narrow host-ranges. the mls resistance genes of one multi-resistant plasmid, isolated from a strain of str. faecalis, are located on  a transposon of 3.3 mdal, tn917. hybridization studies, with mls determinants as  probes, reveal homologies among various plasmid-borne mls resistance sequences. elements that are thought to be chromosome-borne mediate multiple antibiotic resistance (including mls) in streptococci of groups a, b, c, d (str. bovis), f,  g, str. pneumoniae, str. mitis, str. sanguis and str. milleri. strains harbouring such elements contain no detectable plasmid dna. in some of the strains these elements are conjugative; their resistance markers transfer en bloc at low frequency and display narrow host ranges. such elements, from str. pyogenes and str. agalactiae, were found to translocate onto various streptococcal haemolysin-bacteriocin plasmids.

TI  == the gene for type a streptococcal exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) is located in bacteriophage t12.
AB  == the infection of streptococcus pyogenes t25(3) with the temperate bacteriophage t12 results in the conversion of the nontoxigenic strain to type a streptococcal  exotoxin (erythrogenic toxin) production. although previous research has established that integration of the bacteriophage genome into the host chromosome is not essential for exotoxin production, the location of the gene on the bacteriophage or bacterial chromosome had not been determined. in the present investigation, recombinant dna techniques were used to determine whether the gene specifying type a streptococcal exotoxin (spea) production is located on the bacteriophage chromosome. bacteriophage t12 was obtained from s. pyogenes t25(3)(t12) by induction with mitomycin c, and after isolation of bacteriophage dna by phenol-chloroform extraction, the dna was digested with restriction enzymes and ligated with escherichia coli plasmid php34 or the streptococcus-e. coli shuttle vector psa3. transformation of e. coli hb101 with the recombinant molecules allowed selection of e. coli clones containing bacteriophage t12 genes. immunological assays with specific antibody revealed the presence of type a streptococcal exotoxin in sonicates of e. coli transformants. subcloning experiments localized the spea gene to a 1.7-kilobase segment of the bacteriophage t12 genome flanked by sali and hindiii sites. introduction of the psa3 vector containing the spea gene into streptococcus sanguis (challis) resulted in transformants that secreted the type a exotoxin. immunological analysis showed that the type a streptococcal exotoxin produced by e. coli and s. sanguis transformants was identical to the type a exotoxin produced by s. pyogenes t25(3)(t12). southern blot hybridizations with the cloned fragment confirmed its presence in the bacteriophage t12 genome and its absence in the t25(3) nonlysogen. therefore, the gene for type a streptococcal exotoxin is located in the bacteriophage genome, and conversion of s. pyogenes t25(3) to toxigenicity occurs in a manner similar to the conversion of corynebacterium diphtheriae to toxigenicity by bacteriophage beta.

AB  == injection of sterile aqueous preparations of the peptidoglycan-polysaccharide of  group a streptococci (pg-aps) produces chronic inflammation in several animal models. chronic bacterial infection may be involved in some aspects of the pathogenesis of inflammation associated with the accumulation of pg-aps. accordingly, the effect of pg-aps on human neutrophil (polymorphonuclear leukocyte [pmn]) bactericidal activity was studied with the supposition that this interaction may contribute to the inflammation observed. concentrations of pg-aps greater than 10 micrograms/ml inhibited the ability of pmns to kill staphylococcus aureus. this inhibition was not due to a cytotoxic effect of pg-aps on pmns, nor did pg-aps inhibit pmn metabolism required for the formation  of microbicidal oxygen reduction products. pg-aps concentrations of 10 micrograms/ml or greater in the presence of 10% normal serum inhibited the attachment of bacteria to pmns by 49% as compared with control cell populations.  the concentrations of pg-aps required to inhibit uptake of staphylococcus aureus  were identical to those required for inhibition of pmn bactericidal activity. this inhibition did not occur in the presence of serum-free medium or medium with sera that had been heated to inactivate complement. these results show that pg-aps interacts with serum to inhibit pmn-mediated killing of s. aureus, most probably by interfering with bacterial uptake.

AB  == a numerical taxonomic study of strains of streptococcus, together with representatives of allied genera, showed 28 reasonably distinct phenons. the major areas, with their phenons, were: (a) enterococcal species group (s. faecalis, s. faecium, 's. avium' and a proposed new species 's. gallinarum'); (b) paraviridans species group (s. bovis, s. equinus, s. salivarius, 's. casseliflavus', s. mutans, s. raffinolactis and an unidentified oral group i); (c) lactic species group (s. lactis including s. cremoris); (d) thermophilic species group (s. thermophilus); (e) viridans species group (s. mitis, s. sanguis, a proposed new species 's. oralis' and 's. milleri'); (f) pyogenic species group (s. agalactiae, s. pyogenes, s. equi, 's. equisimilis' including 's. zooepidemicus, and a cluster of lancefield group b strains of human origin);  (g) parapyogenic species group (s. uberis, 's. dysgalactiae', and a cluster of strains of lancefield groups r, s and t). species of aerococcus, gemella, leuconostoc and pediococcus are very closely related to the streptococci.

TI  == bacteriocin production by streptococcus salivarius strain p.
AB  == a bacteriocin, streptococcin sal-p, was isolated by freeze-thaw elution from cultures of streptococcus salivarius strain p grown on tryptic soy agar plus 1% neopeptone. the inhibitor could also be extracted with either 7 m urea of 1 m nacl from cells grown on this medium, but little activity was recovered from cells grown in liquid media of from the supernatants of these cultures. streptococcin sal-p was found to be a proteinaceous substance of molecular weight approximately 8000. it was remarkably stable at extremes of ph or temperature and appeared to adsorb nonspecifically to both sensitive and resistant bacterial cells and also to cellulose membranes. the range of its inhibitory activity was almost entirely against gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci, including strains of s. pyogenes and s. sanguis, but not s. mutans or group d streptococci. streptococcin sal-p was bactericidal for actively metabolizing susceptible strains.

TI  == new method that uses binding of immunoglobulin a to group a streptococcal immunoglobulin a fc receptors for demonstration of microbial immunoglobulin a protease activity.
AB  == a new method is described for the detection of bacterial immunoglobulin a (iga) protease which splits iga into fab and fc fragments. the method takes advantage of a recent finding that receptors for iga fragments occur commonly among type 4  group a streptococci. the bacterial preparation to be tested for protease activity was first incubated with radiolabeled purified iga1 myeloma protein, and the proportion of radioactivity bound to a standard suspension of the streptococci was then measured. since isolated fab fragments do not bind to streptococcal iga receptors, a decrease in the amount of radioactivity bound to the streptococci, as compared with the amount before digestion, indicates the presence of protease in the test preparation. using this method, protease activity was detected in neisseria gonorrhoeae, neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, and streptococcus sanguis, but  not in escherichia coli or branhamella catarrhalis.

TI  == bacterial adherence: adhesin-receptor interactions mediating the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surface.
AB  == recent studies have indicated that the attachment of bacteria to mucosal surfaces is the initial event in the pathogenesis of most infectious diseases due to bacteria in animals and humans. an understanding of the mechanisms of attachment  and a definition of the adhesive molecules on the surfaces of bacteria (adhesins) as well as those on host cell membranes (receptors) have suggested new approaches to the prevention of serious bacterial infections: (1) application of purified adhesion or receptor materials or their analogues as competitive inhibitors of bacterial adherence; (2) administration of sublethal concentrations of antibiotics that suppress the formation and expression of bacterial adhesins; and (3) development of vaccines against bacterial surface components involved in adhesion to mucosal surfaces. progress has already been made in the development of antiadhesive vaccines directed against the fimbrial adhesins of several human  bacterial pathogens.

TI  == genetic study of plasmid-associated zonal resistance to lincomycin in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == the phenomenon of zonal resistance to lincomycin, which is characteristic of most clinical isolates with lincomycin resistance in streptococcus pyogenes, has been  studied. these strains grow within a defined concentration range of lincomycin (approximately 60 to 200 microgram/ml), or at lincomycin concentrations below the minimal inhibitory concentration for susceptible strains. it is shown that the zonal growth phenomenon is a stable phenotype and results from induction of resistance only within the zonal concentration range of lincomycin. these strains also possess inducible resistance to erythromycin which is nonzonal in character. one-step mutations to constitutive resistance have been isolated which are of two types: constitutive for lincomycin or for erythromycin, but not for both. those strains with constitutive erythromycin resistance retain their zonal resistance for lincomycin. mutants doubly constitutive for both lincomycin and erythromycin  can be obtained by a second mutational step from either of the singly constitutive mutants. satellite deoxyribonucleic acid has been shown to be present in the zonal resistant strains. a plasmid, psm10419, of 14.9 megadaltons, has been isolated from one of the doubly constitutive mutants and used to jointly transform streptococcus sanguis strain challis to constitutive resistance to both lincomycin and erythromycin. from this, a multicopy plasmid of reduced size, psm10 (5.4 megadaltons), which retains its resistance phenotype, has been isolated and mapped with restriction endonucleases hindiii (three sites), ecori (one site), kpni (one site), and hpai (one site). the staphylococcal plasmid pc221 (2.9 megadaltons; chloramphenicol resistant) has been fused to psm10 at the ecori site resulting in a chimeric plasmid, psm10221 (8.3 megadaltons), which retains resistance to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, and lincomycin. psm10 is therefore suggestive as an effective cloning vehicle for the genus streptococcus.

TI  == binding of streptococcal antigens to muscle tissue in vitro.
AB  == antigens extracted from cells of streptococcus pyogenes t6 and streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, 10449, omz175, and k1r adsorbed to the sarcolemmal sheath of cardiac muscle cells in vitro. similar preparations from s. salivarius, s. sanguis, staphylococcus aureus, and lactobacillus casei had weak or negligible tissue-binding activity. tissue-bound bacterial antigens were detected with homologous rabbit antisera with both indirect immunofluorescence tests and an indirect radioimmunoassay. serological cross-reactivity was observed between the  tissue-binding factors of s. pyogenes and s. mutans cells but not between the bacteria and muscle tissue. in a comparative study of extraction procedures, the  greatest yield of tissue-binding factors was obtained from group a streptococci by cell disruption in buffer at 4 degrees c. hot aqueous phenol and hot water extracts were inactive. antibodies specific for the tissue-binding factor(s) were readily adsorbed from rabbit anti-s. pyogenes serum by a preparation of isolated  cytoplasmic membranes but not by a suspension of cell wall fragments. the heart-binding component of s. pyogenes cell extracts was inactivated by protease  digestion and heat treatment and to a lesser extent by periodic acid oxidation. the capacity of heart cell components to adsorb streptococcal antigens was reduced by protease treatment but not by the action of neuraminidase, hyaluronidase, organic solvents, or detergents.

TI  == deoxyribonucleases of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == three dnases, designated 1, 2 and 3 have been isolated from lysates of old (incompetent in genetic transformation) and logarithmic phase (competent) streptococcus sanguis strain challis cells. these dnases have different electrophoretic mobilities and immunological properties. influence of some activators and inhibitors on their activity was determined. molecular weights of  3 dnases are in the range of 52,000--57,000. all these enzymes are endonucleases  which degrade native dna; thermally denatured dna is a poor substrate. the enzymes described in this paper differ from the previously known dnases of streptococcus pyogenes and streptococcus pneumoniae. nucleases similar or identical to the challis strain enzymes have been found in two other s. sanguis strains--wicky and blackburn.

TI  == [persistency and resistance of streptococci isolated from periodontal pockets].
AB  == intradermal injection of cell walls or cell wall constituents (peptidoglycane) of streptococcus sanguis ii in experimental animals caused a similarly severe inflammatory reaction as with streptococcus a. the three "viridans" species of streptococci proved to be resistant to complement (active serum) as well as to lysozyme and were superior to streptococcus a in their capacity for resistance to another type of muralytic enzyme isolated from streptomyces albus. the new acylureido penicillins (mezlocillin, azlocillin) had an almost equally inhibitory effect on the growth of the various species of bacteria. the "viridans" and beta-haemolytic types of streptococci which induce a chemotactic reaction in vitro were about equally rapidly and effectively killed in the phagocytes (granulocytes, monocytes) isolated from a patient.

TI  == secretion of lipids induced by inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis in streptococci.
AB  == inhibition of peptidoglycan synthesis causes an immediate and massive secretion of both newly synthesized and "old" lipids from several species of bacteria, including streptococci, staphylococcus epidermidis, and bacillus subtilis. lipid  secretion occurs in the absence of detectable bacterial lysis. this novel phenomenon was examined in more detail in three strains of streptococci: s. sanguis (group h), s. pyogenes (group a), and s. pneumoniae. the secretion of lipids is specifically induced by inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis; it is not caused by inhibitors of protein, ribonucleic acid, or deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis. the occurrence appears to be reversible since penicillin-induced secretion comes to a halt upon the timely addition of penicillinase, correlating  with resumption of culture growth. all cellular lipids are secreted in essentially the same proportions as those found in the drug treated bacteria. it  is suggested that continued peptidoglycan synthesis may be essential for the integration and retention of lipid material in the plasma membrane.

TI  == comparison of cellular and humoral immunity against streptococcal and adult human oral mucosa antigens in relation to exacerbation or recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == cell-mediated immunity (cmi) and humoral mediated immunity (hmi) against streptococcal and adult human oral mucosa (ahom) antigens were investigated in patients with inactive and active recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras). the cmi and hmi were examined by means of the leucocyte migration test (lmt) and a double layer immunofluorescence (if) technique. the cmi against streptococcus sanguis strain 2a, streptococcus pyogenes strain m5, and ahom was significantly increased in inactive and active ras. significant difference between active and inactive ras was only demonstrated when strep. 2a was used as antigen in the leucocyte migration cultures. longitudinal observations in relation to exacerbation of ras  revealed significant changes in the migration indices (mi) when strep. 2a and ahom were used as antigens. extracts of strep. m5 and other tissues as kidney and uterus did not show any significant changes of mi in relation to the exacerbation of ras. the if-investigations detected significantly raised igg antibodies against washed whole cells of streptococcus sanguis strain 2a and streptococcus pyogenes strain m5 in sera from patients with ras. the autoantibodies in ras belonged to the immunoglobulin classes igg and igm. the detected antibodies were  able to blind serum complement (c3). the distribution of endpoint titres (ept) against strep. 2a, strep. m5, and ahom antigens did not differ significantly in patients with active ras in relation to those with inactive ras. furthermore, the ept against strep. 2a and ahom were not significantly changed in relation to exacerbation of ras. the present investigations show that cmi and hmi against streptococcal and ahom antigens are characteristic features of ras and indicate that the cmi against strep. 2a and ahom is significantly increased in relation to exacerbation of ras.

TI  == streptococci and aerococci associated with systemic infection in man.
AB  == a collection of 820 isolates of streptococci and aerococci from human blood or internal organs was classified by means of a set of cultural and biochemical tests. of these, 719 (712 streptococci and 7 aerococci) were from patients believed to be suffering from a systemic infection: endocarditis 317; a purulent  lesion in an internal organ ("purulent disease") 152; bacteriaemia 250. the endocarditis streptococci included members of all recognisable taxa, but only certain of these were common: streptococcus sanguis, 16-4%; dextran-positive and  usually mannitol-fermenting strains of s. bovis (s. bovis i), 15-1%; s. mutans, 14-2%; s. mitior, 13-2%. streptococci of the "alpha-haemolytic" taxa (s. sanguis, s. mitior and related strains) formed only 44-8% of the total. when the percentage frequency of streptococcal taxa among the endocarditis and "non-endocarditis" isolates was compared, the dextran-forming taxa (s. mutans, s. bovis i, s. sanguis, and dextran-positive streptococci otherwise resembling s. mitior) all had higher "endocarditis : non-endocarditis" ratios than did any of the non-dextran-producing taxa. endocarditis increased in frequency with age, and showed an excess of males over females up to the age of 65 years. in young patients (less than 35 years), "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci predominated; with increasing age, the proportion of other streptococci increased progressively but  the absolute numbers of isolations of "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci did not fall. infections with s. mutans were prominent in the age-group 35-54 years and with s. bovis i at ages greater than or equal to 55 years. a history of previous  heart disease was more often obtained in endocarditis due to "alpha-haemolytic" streptococci than in other streptococcal endocarditis. the streptococcus most often isolated from purulent lesions in internal organs was s. milleri (29-3%). it was associated with brain abscess, meningitis, pleural empyema and a variety of intra-abdominal abscesses. the only common predisposing factor in endocarditis was previous heart damage. in other systemic streptococcal diseases, other general or local predisposing causes could be observed, mainly in infections with the "pyogenic" groupable streptococci, the enterococci and s. milleri.

TI  == a leucocyte migration study on the cell-mediated immunity against adult human oral mucosa and streptococcal antigens in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis.
AB  == in vitro demonstration of cell-mediated immunity (cmi) against adult human oral mucosa antigen (ahom) and streptococcal antigens was accomplished by means of the leucocyte migration test (lmt) in patients with recurrent aphthous stomatitis (ras). if antigenic extracts of ahom, streptococcus sanguis strain 2a or streptococcus pyogenes strain m5 were used in the lmt experiments, the distribution of migration indices (mi) over patients with ras differed significantly from the distribution over the controls. in patients with other oral lesions, these mi-distributions did not differ significantly from those among the controls. extracts of other tissues such as kidney and uterus tissues or of other bacterial antigens such as brucella abortus and escherichia coli did  not reveal any significant differences between the lmt responses in ras and controls. the present findings show that cim against ahom antigen and streptococcal antigens are features characteristic of ras. furthermore, the results indicate that common antigenic determinants might be shared by ahom and streptococci.

TI  == selective adherence as a determinant of the host tropisms of certain indigenous and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the selective abilities of bacteria to adhere and their  predilections for colonizing different mammalian hosts was investigated by using  bacteria indigenous to the tongue dorsum of humans and rats as models. streptococcus salivarius and s. sanguis averaged 22.6 and 2.8%, respectively, of  the cultivable bacteria recovered from swab samples of the tonges of five humans, but these organisms were not indigenous on the tongues of rats (charles river strain). s. faecalis and serum-requiring diphtheroids were consistently prominant on the tongues of rats, but they were not detected on the tongues of the humans examined. the ability of these organisms to adhere to the tongue surface of the hosts was compared by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains into the mouths of human volunteers and rats. s. salivarius adhered in higher proportions to the dorsal tongue surface of humans than did strains of s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid. s. sanguis also adhered to human tongues better than the serum-requiring diphtheroid. however, s. faecalis and the serum-requiring diphtheroid sorbed in higher proportions to the tongues of rats.  in an in vivo assay, human strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius attached in higher numbers to buccal epithelial cells derived from humans than to those obtained from rats, whereas the reverse was observed with a serum-requiring diphtheroid derived from rats. collectively, these studies show that bacteria sorb with a high degree of specificity to the tissues of different mammalian hosts, and the relative adherence of the organisms studied correlated with their  natural host tropisms. the selective adherence of s. salvarius and s. faecalis was similar to the tongues of conventional and germ-free rats, suggesting that the presence of an indigenous bacterial flora did not significantly influence their attachment selectivity. moreover, the ability of these organisms to colonize the tongues of gnotobiotic rats lacking an indigenous flora paralleled their adherence selectivity. direct scanning microscopic observations indicated that the tongue dorsum of conventional rats is highly papillated but contains relatively sparse bacterial populations. indigenous organisms colonized the bases of papillae on the anterior tip and lateral edges of the tongue as discrete microcolonies, but bacteria were rarely observed on other papillae. this localized and restricted pattern of colonization and the spatial distribution of  the microcolonies of indigenous bacteria present also suggest that antagonistic interactions are unlikely to account for the bacterial tropisms observed for colonization of the tongues of rats.

AB  == a study was made of the species composition of symbiotic microbial flora of the nasopharynx in healthy persons and meningococcus carriers, inhibiting in vitro the growth of the test strains of miningococci. saprophytic streptococci and particularly str. salivarius served as the principal and the most active antagonists of meningococci in both groups of the persons examined. comparison of the inhibitory activity of antagonists in the groups examined revealed no significant differences. however, there were seen differences in the quantitative composition of the isolated antagonists: saprophytic streptococci, particularly str. salivarius were isolated in great amounts, and more frequently from healthy  individuals, and nondifferentiated gram positive cocci of conditionally distinguished group--from carriers. taking into consideration the high inhibitory activity of str. salivarius it is supposed that it can be used as an indicator of the state of insensitiveness of the human organism to the meningococcus infection.
