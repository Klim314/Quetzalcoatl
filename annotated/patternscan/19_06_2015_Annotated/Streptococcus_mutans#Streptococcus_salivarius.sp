TI  == oral lactic acid bacteria related to the occurrence and/or progression of dental  caries in japanese preschool children.
AB  == previous studies have demonstrated that the presence of lactic acid bacteria (lab), especially those classified into the genus lactobacillus, is associated with the progression of dental caries in preschool children. nevertheless, the kinds of species of lab and the characteristics that are important for dental caries have been unclear. the aims of this study were: (1) to investigate the distribution of oral lab among japanese preschool children with various prevalence levels of caries; and (2) to reveal the characteristics of these isolated lab species. seventy-four japanese preschool children were examined for  caries scores and caries progression, and their dental cavity samples were collected for lab isolation and identification. the saliva-induced agglutination  rate and the resistance to acidic environments of the identified strains were measured. statistical analysis showed that preschool children carrying lactobacillus (l.) salivarius or streptococcus mutans have a significantly higher prevalence of dental caries, the growth ability in acidic environments correlates with the caries scores of individuals with l. salivarius, and the caries scores exhibit positive correlation with saliva-induced agglutination in l. salivarius.  these results show that specific lactobacillus species are associated with dental caries based on the level of carious lesion severity. the present study suggests  that these specific lactobacillus species, especially those with easily agglutinated properties and acid resistance, affect the dental caries scores of preschool children, and that these properties may provide useful information for  research into the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == recolonization of mutans streptococci after application of chlorhexidine gel.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is specifically suppressed by intensive treatment with chlorhexidine gel, but the time for recolonization and the effect on other oral bacteria are not totally clear. in this study, recolonization of mutans streptococci was evaluated in nine healthy adult volunteers, who were highly colonized with this microorganism. stimulated saliva was collected before (baseline) and at 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days after application of 1% chlorhexidine  gel on volunteers' teeth for two consecutive days. on each day, the gel was applied using disposable trays for 3 x 5 min with intervals of 5 min between each application. saliva was plated on blood agar to determine total microorganisms (tm); on mitis salivarius agar to determine total streptococci (ts) and on mitis  salivarius agar plus bacitracin to determine mutans streptococci (ms). chlorhexidine was capable of reducing the counts of ms and the proportion of ms with regard to total microorganisms (%ms/tm) (p<0.05), but these values did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after 14 days for ms and 21 days for  %ms/tm. the counts of tm and ts and the proportion of ms to total streptococci did not differ statistically from baseline (p>0.05) after chlorhexidine treatment. the results suggest that the effect of chlorhexidine gel treatment on  suppression of mutans streptococci is limited to less than a month in highly colonized individuals.

TI  == comparative genomics of the bacterial genus streptococcus illuminates evolutionary implications of species groups.
AB  == members of the genus streptococcus within the phylum firmicutes are among the most diverse and significant zoonotic pathogens. this genus has gone through considerable taxonomic revision due to increasing improvements of chemotaxonomic  approaches, dna hybridization and 16s rrna gene sequencing. it is proposed to place the majority of streptococci into "species groups". however, the evolutionary implications of species groups are not clear presently. we use comparative genomic approaches to yield a better understanding of the evolution of streptococcus through genome dynamics, population structure, phylogenies and virulence factor distribution of species groups. genome dynamics analyses indicate that the pan-genome size increases with the addition of newly sequenced  strains, while the core genome size decreases with sequential addition at the genus level and species group level. population structure analysis reveals two distinct lineages, one including pyogenic, bovis, mutans and salivarius groups, and the other including mitis, anginosus and unknown groups. phylogenetic dendrograms show that species within the same species group cluster together, and infer two main clades in accordance with population structure analysis. distribution of streptococcal virulence factors has no obvious patterns among the species groups; however, the evolution of some common virulence factors is congruous with the evolution of species groups, according to phylogenetic inference. we suggest that the proposed streptococcal species groups are reasonable from the viewpoints of comparative genomics; evolution of the genus is congruent with the individual evolutionary trajectories of different species groups.

TI  == inhibitory effect of lactobacillus salivarius on streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == dental caries arises from an imbalance of metabolic activities in dental biofilms developed primarily by streptococcus mutans. this study was conducted to isolate  potential oral probiotics with antagonistic activities against s. mutans biofilm  formation from lactobacillus salivarius, frequently found in human saliva. we analysed 64 l. salivarius strains and found that two, k35 and k43, significantly  inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation with inhibitory activities more pronounced  than those of lactobacillus rhamnosus gg (lgg), a prototypical probiotic that shows anti-caries activity. scanning electron microscopy showed that co-culture of s. mutans with k35 or k43 resulted in significantly reduced amounts of attached bacteria and network-like structures, typically comprising exopolysaccharides. spot assay for s. mutans indicated that k35 and k43 strains possessed a stronger bactericidal activity against s. mutans than lgg. moreover,  quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the expression of genes encoding glucosyltransferases, gtfb, gtfc, and gtfd was reduced when s. mutans were co-cultured with k35 or k43. however, lgg activated the expression of gtfb and gtfc, but did not influence the expression of gtfd in the co-culture. a  transwell-based biofilm assay indicated that these lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans biofilm formation in a contact-independent manner. in conclusion, we identified two l. salivarius strains with inhibitory activities on the growth and expression of s. mutans virulence genes to reduce its biofilm formation. this is  not a general characteristic of the species, so presents a potential strategy for in vivo alteration of plaque biofilm and caries.

TI  == propolis varnish: antimicrobial properties against cariogenic bacteria, cytotoxicity, and sustained-release profile.
AB  == varnishes are preparations that differ in the polymeric matrix and therapeutical  agents. in dentistry they are used to prevent caries. in this study we developed  a propolis varnish, considering propolis properties against cariogenic bacteria.  to a chitosan polymeric base (chv) was added ethanolic propolis extract in different concentrations: pv1 (5%), pv2 (10%), and pv3 (15%). antimicrobial activity was carried out against streptococcus mutans (sm), streptococcus sanguinis (sg), streptococcus salivarius (ss), and lactobacillus casei (lc) through agar diffusion method. the three propolis concentrations incorporated were effective in inhibiting the growth of all microorganisms, but without significant difference between the zones of inhibition observed. cytotoxicity assay was done by mtt method. data were analyzed by one-way anova and bonferroni  test. none of the varnishes were cytotoxic, keeping 80% of viable cells, while chv allowed cellular proliferation (120%). sustained-release test was carried out by applying 40 mu l of each varnish in the buccal surface of bovine teeth and kept in an ethanol/water solution removed in regular times. according to the "independent model approach," the release profiles were distinct from each varnish and the most prolonged was pv3 (8 weeks). varnish formulations had satisfactory antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria and have a low cytotoxicity (<50%).

AB  == oral veillonella, veillonella atypica, veillonella denticariosi, veillonella dispar, veillonella parvula, veillonella rogosae, and veillonella tobetsuensis are known as early colonizers in oral biofilm formation. to investigate the role  of oral veillonella, biofilms formed by the co-culture of streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or streptococcus sanguinis, with  oral veillonella were examined at the species level. the amount of biofilm formed by s. mutans, s. gordonii, and s. salivarius in the presence of the six veillonella species was greater than that formed in the control experiments, with the exception of s. mutans with v. dispar. in contrast, in the case of biofilm formation by s. sanguinis, the presence of veillonella species reduced the amount of the biofilm, with the exception of v. parvula and v. dispar. the time-dependent changes in the amount of biofilm and the number of planktonic cells were grouped into four patterns over the 24 combinations. only that of s. gordonii with v. tobetsuensis showed a unique pattern. these results indicate that the mode of action of this combination differed from that of the other combinations with respect to biofilm formation. it is possible that there may be  several factors involved in the interaction between streptococcus and veillonella species.

TI  == control of natural transformation in salivarius streptococci through specific degradation of sigmax by the meca-clpcp protease complex.
AB  == competence for natural dna transformation is a tightly controlled developmental process in streptococci. in mutans and salivarius species, the abundance of the central competence regulator sigma(x) is regulated at two levels: transcriptional, by the comrs signaling system via the sigma(x)/comx/sigx-inducing peptide (xip), and posttranscriptional, by the adaptor protein meca and its associated clp atpase, clpc. in this study, we further investigated the mechanism and function of the meca-clpc control system in the salivarius species streptococcus thermophilus. using in vitro approaches,  we showed that meca specifically interacts with both sigma(x) and clpc, suggesting the formation of a ternary sigma(x)-meca-clpc complex. moreover, we demonstrated that meca ultimately targets sigma(x) for its degradation by the clpcp protease in an atp-dependent manner. we also identify a short sequence (18  amino acids) in the n-terminal domain of sigma(x) as essential for the interaction with meca and subsequent sigma(x) degradation. finally, increased transformability of a meca-deficient strain in the presence of subinducing xip concentrations suggests that the meca-clpcp proteolytic complex acts as an additional locking device to prevent competence under inappropriate conditions. a model of the interplay between comrs and meca-clpcp in the control of sigma(x) activity is proposed.

TI  == the influence of a glucosyltransferase, encoded by gtfp, on biofilm formation by  streptococcus sanguinis in a dual-species model.
AB  == streptococcus sanguinis is an early colonizer of tooth surfaces and forms biofilms with other species of microorganisms. in vitro, s. sanguinis produces water-soluble glucans from sucrose and releases them into the culture supernatant; however, the role played by these glucans in biofilm formation is unclear. the present study examined both the effect of glucans on biofilm formation by s. sanguinis and the proportion of this bacterial species within the biofilms. inactivation of the gtfp gene, annotated as glucosyltransferase in the  s. sanguinis genome database, caused a marked reduction in the amount of water-soluble glucans in the culture supernatant, but not in the amount of water-insoluble glucans expressed on the bacterial cell surface. scanning electron microscopy revealed that wild-type s. sanguinis, but not the gtfp-deficient mutant, produced large amounts of sticky material in the presence  of 1% (w/v) sucrose. in addition, biofilm production by wild-type bacteria was greater than that by the mutant strain. by contrast, co-culture of mutant bacteria with streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. oralis, s. gordonii, s. anginosus, or s. salivarius showed that inactivating the gtfp gene had little effect on the amount of biofilm produced. furthermore, inactivating the gtfp gene did not greatly alter the proportion of s. sanguinis in the biofilms formed by the co-cultures. thus, despite the role of s. sanguinis glucosyltransferase in formation of water-soluble glucans and biofilms in monoculture, the functional gene contributed little to biofilms in co-culture experiments.

TI  == pcr applications in identification of saliva samples exposed to different conditions (streptococci detection based).
AB  == oral streptococci represent about 20% of the total oral bacteria, so if it is possible to detect the presence of oral specific bacteria from a forensic specimen by polymerase chain reaction, this could be used to verify the presence  of saliva. aim of this study is detection of streptococcus salivarius which is one of the most common streptococci in oral bacteria and streptococcus mutans which is common in cases of dental caries in various body fluids and skin swabs and assessment of which one of both organisms is more reliable in saliva identification, cross sectional study on egypt population. negative control samples (15 samples) were taken from various body fluids (urine, semen) and skin  swabs. mock forensic samples (85 samples) included fresh saliva, saliva, cotton fabrics contaminated with saliva, cigarette butts, bitten apple and semen mixed with saliva samples). dna extraction was done using dneasy blood and tissue kit (qiagen, tokyo, japan). polymerase chain reaction was done for dna amplification  using polymerase chain reaction master mix then gel electrophoresis was done for  samples qualification. control bacteria were s. salivarius and streptococcus mutans. streptococcus salivarius was detected in 83.5% of all saliva contained samples and s. mutans was detected in 67% of saliva contained samples. both bacteria were not detected in other body fluids and skin swabs, so s. salivarius  is more reliable in saliva identification as well as differentiating it from other body fluids. polymerase chain reaction is valuable in detection of saliva by detecting s. salivarius.

TI  == [evaluation of biocidal properties of silver nanoparticles against cariogenic bacteria].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial properties of silver nanoparticles (snp's) have been  recentl well evaluated, and now are being considered as excellent candidates for  therapeutic purposes. it is confirmed, that various solutions of colloidal snp's  possess significant antibacterial properties against such species as: staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, escherichia coli, pseudomonas  aeruginosa even at low concentrations, although there have been so far only a few researches evaluating antimicrobial activity of snp's against cariogenic bacteria: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis  responsible for initiation of dental carries. tooth decay is infectious disease an worldwide, which may occur in patients of every age. nanotechnology creates a  new approach of designing of medical devices preventing or reducing bacterial colonization. methods: colloidal silver solution (css) of concentration 350 ppm was used in this research. nanoparticles size, shape and solution stability were  evaluated. 16 strains of cariogenic bacteria, 4 isolates of each species: s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis and s, mitis were obtained from plaque swabs  of 7 patients treated for dental carries at department of conservative dentistry, medical university of warsaw. mic and mbc values for css's were evaluated. results: css used in this research is of good stability. no agglomeration or coalescence was observed during 24 hours of experiment. silver nanoparticles were of round shape and had mean size of 67 nm. mic values were: 12-25 ppm for s. salivarius, 25 ppm for s. sanguinis, 50-100 ppm for s. mitis and 50 ppm for s. mutans, while mbc values after 1 hour of bacterial contact with nanoparticles were 200-350 ppm for all cariogenic bacterial species. after 24 hours of contact  mbc values were: 25-50 ppm for s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, 100-200 ppm for s. mitis and 200 ppmfor s. mutans. conclusions: antimicrobial properties of css depend on nanoparticles concentration and interaction time with bacteria. the susceptibility of cariogenic oral streptococci to silver nanoparticles is diversified. sufficient concentration which inhibited all cariogenic bacteria in  our research was 200 ppm after long (24 hours) period of silver nanoparticles interaction with bacteria.

TI  == in vitro evaluation of the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection  treatment with photolysis of hydrogen peroxide.
AB  == the purpose of the present study was to evaluate the risk of inducing bacterial resistance to disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 and comparing this with existing antibacterial agents. we tested seven antibacterial agents, including amoxicillin, cefepime hydrochloride, erythromycin, ofloxacin, clindamycin hydrochloride, ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, and minocycline hydrochloride, as positive controls for validation of the assay protocol. for all of the agents tested, at least one of the four bacterial species (staphylococcus  aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, and streptococcus salivarius) was resistant to these agents by repeated exposure to subinhibitory concentrations of the agents up to 10 times. in contrast, antibacterial activity  against any of the bacterial species tested (s. aureus, e. faecalis, e. coli, s.  salivarius, pseudomonas aeruginosa, streptococcus mutans, and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans) was not affected by repeated exposure to the disinfection  treatment up to 40 times. this finding suggested that the risk of inducing bacterial resistance by disinfection treatment was low. the active ingredient of  this disinfection treatment is hydroxyl radicals generated by photolysis of h2o2. therefore, hydroxyl radicals interact with several cell structures and different  metabolic pathways in microbial cells, probably resulting in a lack of development of bacterial resistance. in conclusion, disinfection treatment with photolysis of h2o2 appears to be a potential alternative for existing antimicrobial agents in terms of a low risk of inducing bacterial resistance.

TI  == phenotypic diversity of multicellular filamentation in oral streptococci.
AB  == filamentous multicellular bacteria are among the most ancient multicellular organisms. they inhabit a great variety of environments and are present in the human body, including the oral cavity. beside the selective advantages related to the larger size achieved through filamentation, the development of multicellular  bacteria can be also driven by simple ecological factors such as birth and death  rates at the cellular level. in order to extend earlier results obtained in aquatic species, we investigate the filamentation process of four different strains of oral streptococci, namely s. mutans, s. salivarius, s. oralis and s. anginosus. the results indicate differences in the capacities of different streptococcus species to form filaments, manifested in terms of length and the time-scale of filament elongation. the filamentation pattern of these oral streptococci resembles that of aquatic bacteria, whereby filaments reach a peak length during exponential growth and become short when the population reaches a steady state. hence, this study validates that multicellularity can be an emergent property of filamentous bacteria of different ecological niches, and that phenotypic differences in filamentation can occur within species of the same genus, in this case oral streptococci. moreover, given the role that specific oral streptococci can play in the etiology of oral diseases, these results can possibly open new perspectives in the study of the virulence properties of these  species.

TI  == in vitro antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus salivarius and their fermentative broth on periodontal pathogens.
AB  == as lactobacilli possess an antagonistic growth property, these bacteria may be beneficial as bioprotective agents for infection control. however, whether the antagonistic growth effects are attributed to the lactobacilli themselves or their fermentative broth remains unclear. the antagonistic growth effects of lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum as well as their fermentative broth were thus tested using both disc agar diffusion test and broth dilution method, and their effects on periodontal pathogens, including streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis in vitro at different concentrations and for different time periods were also compared. both lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus fermentum and their concentrated fermentative broth were shown to inhibit significantly the growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, and porphyromonas gingivalis, although different inhibitory effects were observed for different pathogens. the  higher the counts of lactobacilli and the higher the folds of concentrated fermentative broth, the stronger the inhibitory effects are observed. the inhibitory effect is demonstrated to be dose-dependent. moreover, for the lactobacilli themselves, lactobacillus fermentum showed stronger inhibitory effects than lactobacillus salivarius. however, the fermentative broth of lactobacillus fermentum showed weaker inhibitory effects than that of lactobacillus salivarius. these data suggested that lactobacilli and their fermentative broth exhibit antagonistic growth activity, and consumption of probiotics or their broth containing lactobacilli may benefit oral health.

AB  == background: the tobacco plant, nicotiana tabacum, has been responsible for more deaths than any other herb. however, the literature has also been endowed with its use as "holy herb" since the pre-columbian era. used for treating pain, poisonous bites, ulcers, nasal polyps, and basal cell carcinoma; it also acts as  an important ingredient of commercially available toothpastes; and even used as tobacco vaccines against streptococcus species as highlighted in the literature.  aims and objectives: (1) to elicit the anti-microbial property of tobacco against streptococcus mutans, if any, in raw smokeless tobacco. (2) to study the relationship of duration and growth inhibition efficacy of smokeless tobacco. materials and methods: extracts were prepared by centrifugation of mixed raw smokeless tobacco with ringer's lactate solution and with saliva. the extracts were placed in wells prepared on mitis salivarius culture plate and incubated at  37 degrees c for 24 h after 0 h, 1 h, and 2 h of extract preparation. the inhibition zones were measured on the underside of plate using the vernier calipers. results: smokeless tobacco has a statistically significant zone of inhibition, which proves its anti-microbial activity against s. mutans. however,  the mean zones of inhibition were greater for ringer's lactate and tobacco group  as compared to test samples (saliva and tobacco) with subsequent reduction of inhibition zones with an increase in duration. conclusion: the anti-microbial property of extensive tobacco resources can be utilized from their extracts in order to balance the deterioration it had caused to mankind.

TI  == effect of metalloporphyrins on red autofluorescence from oral bacteria.
AB  == the aim of this study was to assess the red autofluorescence from bacterial species related to dental caries and periodontitis in the presence of different nutrients in the growth medium. bacteria were grown anaerobically on tryptic soy  agar (tsa) supplemented with nutrients, including magnesium-porphyrins from spinach and iron-porphyrins from heme. the autofluorescence was then assessed at  405 nm excitation. on the tsa without additives, no autofluorescence was observed from any of the species tested. on the tsa containing sheep blood, red autofluorescence was observed only from parvimonas micra. when the tsa was supplemented with blood, hemin, and vitamin k, red autofluorescence was observed  from actinomyces naeslundii, bifidobacterium dentium, and streptococcus mutans. finally, on the tsa supplemented with spinach extract, red autofluorescence was observed from aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, a. naeslundii, enterococcus  faecalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, lactobacillus salivarius, s. mutans, and veillonella parvula. we conclude that the bacteria related to dental caries and periodontal disease exhibit red autofluorescence. the autofluorescence characteristics of the tested strains depended on the nutrients present, such as  metalloporphyrins, suggesting that the metabolic products of the oral biofilm could be responsible for red autofluorescence.

TI  == inhibition of attachment of oral bacteria to immortalized human gingival fibroblasts (hgf-1) by tea extracts and tea components.
AB  == background: tea has been suggested to promote oral health by inhibiting bacterial attachment to the oral cavity. most studies have focused on prevention of bacterial attachment to hard surfaces such as enamel. findings: this study investigated the effect of five commercial tea (green, oolong, black, pu-erh and  chrysanthemum) extracts and tea components (epigallocatechin gallate and gallic acid) on the attachment of five oral pathogens (streptococcus mutans atcc 25175,  streptococcus mutans atcc 35668, streptococcus mitis atcc 49456, streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 and actinomyces naeslundii atcc 51655) to the hgf-1 gingival cell line. extracts of two of the teas (pu-erh and chrysanthemum) significantly (p < 0.05) reduced attachment of all the streptococcus strains by up to 4 log cfu/well but effects of other teas and components were small. conclusions: pu-erh and chrysanthemum tea may have the potential to reduce attachment of oral pathogens to gingival tissue and improve the health of oral soft tissues.

TI  == colonization of streptococcus mutans on esthetic brackets: self-ligating vs conventional.
AB  == introduction: self-ligating orthodontic brackets rely on clips, rather than ligatures, to hold the archwire in place. it is unknown whether replacing ligatures with clips affects the adherence of streptococcus mutans. the aim of this research was to evaluate whether self-ligating brackets have an advantage over conventional brackets as determined by the adherence of s mutans. methods: the sample consisted of 50 esthetic brackets, divided into 3 experimental groups  and 2 control groups of 10 brackets each. two experimental groups were active self-ligating brackets (quicklear; forestadent, pforzheim, germany; and in-ovation c; dentsply gac, bohemia, ny); the other was a passive self-ligating bracket (damon 3; ormco, glendora, calif). the 2 control groups were conventional brackets (mystique; dentsply gac; and clarity; 3m unitek, monrovia, calif). the brackets were randomly bonded to the canines, first and second premolars, and first and second molars in the mandibular left hemiarch of 10 male participants.  biofilm was collected from the tooth surfaces before bonding and from the brackets on day 21 and placed in petri dishes containing mitis salivarius agar. the brackets were removed on day 28 and examined by using scanning electron microscopy. statistical analysis, analysis of variance, and the tukey correction  with a p value of 0.05 were used. results: the greatest numbers of colonies were  found in an active self-ligating bracket group (in-ovation c), and the fewest colonies were in a conventional bracket group (clarity). the largest colonies formed on active self-ligating brackets. in the slot, the greatest formation was  in a control group (mystique). conclusions: self-ligating esthetic brackets do not promote greater or lesser s mutans colonization when compared with conventional brackets. differences were found to be related to the material composition of the bracket.

TI  == insight into the evolution of the histidine triad protein (htp) family in streptococcus.
AB  == the histidine triad proteins (htps), also known as pht proteins in streptococcus  pneumoniae, constitute a family of surface-exposed proteins that exist in many pathogenic streptococcal species. although many studies have revealed the importance of htps in streptococcal physiology and pathogenicity, little is known about their origin and evolution. in this study, after identifying all htp homologs from 105 streptococcal genomes representing 38 different species/subspecies, we analyzed their domain structures, positions in genome, and most importantly, their evolutionary histories. by further projecting this information onto the streptococcal phylogeny, we made several major findings. first, htp genes originated earlier than the streptococcus genus and gene-loss events have occurred among three streptococcal groups, resulting in the absence of the htp gene in the bovis, mutans and salivarius groups. second, the copy number of htp genes in other groups of streptococcus is variable, ranging from one to four functional copies. third, both phylogenetic evidence and domain structure analyses support the division of two htp subfamilies, designated as htp i and htp ii. although present mainly in the pyogenic group and in streptococcus  suis, htp ii members are distinct from htp i due to the presence of an additional leucine-rich-repeat domain at the c-terminus. finally, htp genes exhibit a faster nucleotide substitution rate than do housekeeping genes. specifically, the regions outside the htp domains are under strong positive selection. this distinct evolutionary pattern likely helped streptococcus to easily escape from recognition by host immunity.

TI  == inhibitory effect on streptococcus mutans and mechanical properties of the chitosan containing composite resin.
AB  == objectives: this study evaluated the antibacterial effect and mechanical properties of composite resins (lcr, mcr, hcr) incorporating chitosan with three  different molecular weights (l, low; m, medium; h, high). materials and methods:  streptococcus (s). mutans 100 ml and each chitosan powder were inoculated in sterilized 10 ml brain-heart infusion (bhi) solution, and was centrifuged for 12  hr. absorbance of the supernatent was measured at od660 to estimate the antibacterial activities of chitosan. after s. mutans was inoculated in the disc  shaped chitosan-containing composite resins, the disc was cleansed with bhi and diluted with serial dilution method. s. mutans was spread on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar. after then, colony forming unit (cfu) was measured to verify the inhibitory effect on s. mutans biofilm. to ascertain the effect on the mechanical properties of composite resin, 3-point bending and vickers hardness tests were done after 1 and 3 wk water storage, respectively. using 2-way analysis of variance (anova) and scheffe test, statistical analysis was done with 95% significance level. results: all chitosan powder showed inhibition effect against s. mutans. cfu number in chitosan-containing composite resins was smaller than that of control resin without chitosan. the chitosan containing composite resins  did not show any significant difference in flexural strength and vickers hardness in comparison with the control resin. however, the composite resin, mcr showed a  slightly decreased flexural strength and the maximum load than those of control and the other composite resins hcr and lcr. conclusions: lcr and hcr would be recommended as a feasible antibacterial restorative due to its antibacterial nature and mechanical properties.

TI  == early in vitro and in vivo development of high-level daptomycin resistance is common in mitis group streptococci after exposure to daptomycin.
AB  == the development of high-level daptomycin resistance (hldr; mic of >/= 256 mg/liter) after exposure to daptomycin has recently been reported in viridans group streptococcus (vgs) isolates. our study objectives were as follows: to know whether in vitro development of hldr after exposure to daptomycin was common among clinical isolates of vgs and streptococcus bovis; to determine whether hldr also developed during the administration of daptomycin to treat experimental endocarditis caused by the daptomycin-susceptible, penicillin-resistant streptococcus mitis strain s. mitis 351; and to establish whether combination with gentamicin prevented the development of hldr in vitro and in vivo. in vitro  studies were performed with 114 vgs strains (mitis group, 92; anginosus group, 10; mutans group, 8; and salivarius group, 4) and 54 streptococcus bovis strains  isolated from 168 consecutive patients with infective endocarditis diagnosed between 1995 and 2010. hldr was only observed after 24 h of exposure to daptomycin in 27% of the mitis group, including 27% of s. mitis isolates, 47% of  s. oralis isolates, and 13% of s. sanguis isolates. in our experimental model, hldr was detected in 7/11 (63%) and 8/12 (67%) isolates recovered from vegetations after 48 h of daptomycin administered at 6 mg/kg of body weight/24 h  and 10 mg/kg/24 h, respectively. in vitro, time-kill experiments showed that daptomycin plus gentamicin was bactericidal against s. mitis 351 at tested concentrations of 0.5 and 1 times the mic and prevented the development of hldr.  in vivo, the addition of gentamicin at 1 mg/kg/8 h to both daptomycin arms prevented hldr in 21 out of 23 (91%) rabbits. daptomycin plus gentamicin was at least as effective as vancomycin plus gentamicin. in conclusion, hldr develops rapidly and frequently in vitro and in vivo among mitis group streptococci. combining daptomycin with gentamicin enhanced its activity and prevented the development of hldr in most cases.

TI  == organo-selenium-containing dental sealant inhibits bacterial biofilm.
AB  == oral bacteria, including streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, contribute to tooth decay and plaque formation; therefore, it is essential to develop strategies to prevent dental caries and plaque formation. we recently showed that organo-selenium compounds covalently attached to different biomaterials inhibited bacterial biofilms. our current study investigates the efficacy of an organo-selenium dental sealant (select-defense(tm) sealant) in inhibiting s. mutans and s. salivarius biofilm formation in vitro. the organo-selenium was synthesized and covalently attached to dental sealant material via standard polymer chemistry. by colony-forming unit (cfu) assay and confocal microscopy, select-defense(tm) sealant was found to completely inhibit the development of s. mutans and s. salivarius biofilms. to assess the durability of the anti-biofilm effect, we soaked the select-defense(tm) sealant in pbs for 2 mos at 37 degrees c and found that the biofilm-inhibitory effect was not diminished after soaking. to determine if organo-selenium inhibits bacterial growth under the sealant, we placed select-defense sealant over a lawn of s. mutans. in contrast to a control sealant, select-defense(tm) sealant completely inhibited the growth of s. mutans. these results suggest that the inhibitory effect of select-defense(tm) sealant against s. mutans and s. salivarius biofilms is very effective and durable.

TI  == influence of the probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain m18 on indices of dental health in children: a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
AB  == the prevalence of dental caries continues to increase, and novel strategies to reverse this trend appear necessary. the probiotic streptococcus salivarius strain m18 offers the potential to confer oral health benefits as it produces bacteriocins targeting the important cariogenic species streptococcus mutans, as  well as the enzymes dextranase and urease, which could help reduce dental plaque  accumulation and acidification, respectively. in a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 100 dental caries-active children, treatment with m18 was administered for 3 months and the participants were assessed for changes to their plaque score and gingival and soft-tissue health and to their salivary levels of s. salivarius, s. mutans, lactobacilli, beta-haemolytic streptococci and candida species. at treatment end, the plaque scores were significantly (p =  0.05) lower for children in the m18-treated group, especially in subjects having  high initial plaque scores. the absence of any significant adverse events supported the safety of the probiotic treatment. cell-culture analyses of sequential saliva samples showed no differences between the probiotic and placebo groups in counts of the specifically enumerated oral micro-organisms, with the exception of the subgroup of the m18-treated children who appeared to have been colonized most effectively with m18. this subgroup exhibited reduced s. mutans counts, indicating that the anti-caries activity of m18 probiotic treatments may  be enhanced if the efficiency of colonization is increased. it was concluded that s. salivarius m18 can provide oral health benefits when taken regularly.

TI  == a defined-multispecies microbial model for studying enamel caries development.
AB  == the aims of this study were to describe and validate an in vitro multispecies microbial biofilm model for caries development by evaluating the effects of varying medium concentration of sucrose (0.5 and 1.0%) and fluoride (0.4, 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f) in study 1, and calcium (1.0 and 2.0 mm ca) in study 2. defined-multispecies biofilms, formed by lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, were grown on the surface of salivary-pellicle-coated enamel slabs, with known baseline surface hardness; growth medium was changed daily. counts of viable cells on biofilms and the percentage of surface microhardness change (%smc), lesion depth (ld) and integrated mineral loss (iml) on enamel slabs were assessed after 4 days of biofilm formation under the tested conditions. counts of viable cells on biofilms were significantly affected by sucrose, fluoride and calcium concentrations (p <  0.05). there was a decrease in %smc in response to increased fluoride and calcium concentrations (p < 0.001). lower iml (p < 0.001) and ld (p < 0.05) were found in the presence of 0.8 and 1.0 ppm f. a negative correlation was found between the response variables (%smc, ld and iml) and fluoride and calcium concentrations. the results suggest that the microbial caries model developed was able to show distinct levels of caries inhibition in response to fluoride and calcium concentrations, corroborating clinical observations. an effect of sucrose concentration on caries development was found only in the presence of the lowest  fluoride concentration.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 against oral streptococci.
AB  == the peptide lys-[trp(6)]-hy-a1 (lys-a1) is a synthetic derivative of the peptide  hy-a1, initially isolated from the frog species hypsiboas albopunctatus. according to previous research, it is a molecule with broad antimicrobial activity. the objective of this study was to evaluate the antimicrobial activity  of the synthetic peptide lys-a1 (kifgaiwplalgalknlik-nh2) on the planktonic and biofilm growth of oral bacteria. the methods used to evaluate antimicrobial activity include the following: determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) in microtiter plates for growth in suspension and quantification of biomass by crystal violet staining and counting of colony forming units for biofilm growth. the microorganisms streptococcus oralis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were grown in brain heart infusion broth at 37 degrees c under atmospheric pressure with 10% co2. the peptide was solubilized in 0.1% acetic acid (v/v) at various concentrations (500-1.9 mug ml(-1)). chlorhexidine gluconate 0.12% was used as the positive control, and bhi culture medium was used as the negative control. the tested peptide demonstrated a remarkable antimicrobial effect, inhibiting the planktonic and biofilm growth of all strains tested, even at low concentrations. thus, the peptide lys-a1 is an important source for potential antimicrobial agents, especially for the control and prevention of microbial biofilms, which is one of the most important factors in cariogenic processes.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriocin-producing bacteria from the intestinal microbiota of elderly irish subjects.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterize bacteriocins produced by predominant species of lactic acid bacteria from faeces of elderly subjects. methods and results: screening over 70,000 colonies, from faecal samples collected from 266 subjects,  using the indicator organisms lactobacillus bulgaricus lmg 6901 and listeria innocua dpc 3572, identified 55 antimicrobial-producing bacteria. genomic fingerprinting following apai digestion revealed 15 distinct strains. the antimicrobial activities associated with 13 of the 15 strains were sensitive to protease treatment. the predominant antimicrobial-producing species were identified as lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus crispatus and enterococcus spp. a number of previously characterized bacteriocins, including abp-118 and salivaricin b (from lact. salivarius), enterocin b (enterococcus faecium), lactacin b (lact. acidophilus),  gassericin t and a variant of gassericin a (lact. gasseri), were identified. interestingly, two antimicrobial-producing species, not generally associated with intestinally derived microorganisms were also isolated: lactococcus lactis producing nisin z and streptococcus mutans producing mutacin ii. conclusion: these data suggest that bacteriocin production by intestinal isolates against our chosen targets under the screening conditions used was not frequent (0.08%). significance and impact of the study: the results presented are important due to  growing evidence indicating bacteriocin production as a potential probiotic trait by virtue of strain dominance and/or pathogen inhibition in the mammalian intestine.

TI  == recovery of mutans streptococci on msb, sb-20 and sb-20m agar media.
AB  == objective: the recovery of mutans streptococci in saliva and dental biofilm samples depends, in part, on the culture medium used. in this study, we compared  (i) the culture media sucrose-bacitracin agar (sb-20), modified sb-20 (sb-20m) and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb) in the count of colony forming units (cfu) of mutans streptococci and (ii) in the morphological and biochemical differentiation between streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. design:  samples of non-stimulated saliva from 20 children were plated on sb-20, sb-20m and msb, and incubated in microaerophilia at 37 degrees c for 72h. identification of microorganisms was based on analysis of colony morphology under stereomicroscopy. the biochemical identification of colonies was done by biochemical tests using sugar fermentation, resistance to bacitracin and hydrogen peroxide production. results: there was no significant difference (p>0.05) in the number of cfu of mutans streptococci recovered on sb-20 and sb-20m agar. comparing the media, sb-20 and sb-20m yielded a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies (p<0.05) and were more effective than msb in the identification of s. sobrinus (p<0.05), but not of s. mutans (p>0.05). conclusion: there was no significant difference between sb-20 and sb-20m culture  media in the count of mutans streptococci, demonstrating that the replacement of  sucrose by coarse granular cane sugar did not alter the efficacy of the medium. compared with msb, sb-20 and sb-20m allowed counting a larger number of mutans streptococci colonies and a more effective morphological identification of s. sobrinus.

TI  == beyond streptococcus mutans: dental caries onset linked to multiple species by 16s rrna community analysis.
AB  == dental caries in very young children may be severe, result in serious infection,  and require general anesthesia for treatment. dental caries results from a shift  within the biofilm community specific to the tooth surface, and acidogenic species are responsible for caries. streptococcus mutans, the most common acid producer in caries, is not always present and occurs as part of a complex microbial community. understanding the degree to which multiple acidogenic species provide functional redundancy and resilience to caries-associated communities will be important for developing biologic interventions. in addition, microbial community interactions in health and caries pathogenesis are not well understood. the purpose of this study was to investigate bacterial community profiles associated with the onset of caries in the primary dentition. in a combination cross-sectional and longitudinal design, bacterial community profiles at progressive stages of caries and over time were examined and compared to those of health. 16s rrna gene sequencing was used for bacterial community analysis. streptococcus mutans was the dominant species in many, but not all, subjects with caries. elevated levels of s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and s. parasanguinis were  also associated with caries, especially in subjects with no or low levels of s. mutans, suggesting these species are alternative pathogens, and that multiple species may need to be targeted for interventions. veillonella, which metabolizes lactate, was associated with caries and was highly correlated with total acid producing species. among children without previous history of caries, veillonella, but not s. mutans or other acid-producing species, predicted future  caries. bacterial community diversity was reduced in caries as compared to health, as many species appeared to occur at lower levels or be lost as caries advanced, including the streptococcus mitis group, neisseria, and streptococcus sanguinis. this may have implications for bacterial community resilience and the  restoration of oral health.

TI  == reduced salivary flow and colonization by mutans streptococci in children with down syndrome.
AB  == objectives: although individuals with down syndrome have considerable oral disease, the prevalence of dental caries in this group is low. the present study  aimed to compare known risk factors for dental caries development in children with down syndrome and a matched population (siblings). in both populations, the  number of acidogenic microorganisms, such as mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species, and the paraffin-stimulated ph, flow rate and iga concentration in whole saliva were evaluated and compared. method: saliva was collected, and the caries index was evaluated in 45 sibling pairs aged between 6  and 18 years old. the salivary iga concentration was determined by immunoturbidimetry. salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida species were quantified on mitis salivarius agar containing bacitracin and 20% sucrose, rogosa agar supplemented with glacial acetic acid and sabouraud agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, respectively. results: down syndrome children  had a higher caries-free rate (p<0.05) and lower salivary mutans streptococci counts (p<0.03) compared to their siblings. similar numbers of lactobacilli and candida species were found in both groups. salivary flow rates were 36% lower in  down syndrome children compared to their siblings (p<0.05). the salivary ph did not differ between down syndrome children and controls. the down syndrome children had an iga secretion rate 29% lower than that of their siblings, but this difference was not statistically significant. conclusions: in conclusion, the lower number of mutans streptococci in the saliva may be one of the factors contributing to the lower caries rate observed in down syndrome children, despite evidence of hyposalivation.

TI  == effect of xylitol on cariogenic and beneficial oral streptococci: a randomized, double-blind crossover trial.
AB  == background/purpose: although habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels, its effect on beneficial oral streptococci is less clear. the main aim of the study is to investigate the effect of short-term xylitol consumption on the oral beneficial streptococci level of saliva, streptococcus sanguinis and s. mitis. material and methods: twenty four volunteers with a median age of 23.7 years (range: 20-28) harboring streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. mitis participated in the randomized, double-blind, cross-over study. the experimental chewing gum (1.5 g/pellet) contained 70% xylitol w/w while the control gum contained 63% sorbitol w/w. saliva samples were collected before and after two three-week test periods with a four-week washout interval. colony-forming units (cfu)/ml were enumerated for the estimation of s.  mutans levels on mitis salivarius-mutans valinomycin (ms-mutv), s. sobrinus on mitis salivarius-sobrinus (ms-sob), s. sanguinis on modified medium 10-sucrose (mm10-s) and s. mitis on mitis salivarius agar with tellurite (msat) media. results: the s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts of the saliva samples decreased significantly (p = 0.01 and p = 0.011, respectively) in the xylitol gum group but not in the sorbitol gum group. the salivary s. sanguinis and s. mitis counts did  not decrease in both xylitol and sorbitol gum groups. conclusions: based on the findings of this study, xylitol consumption reduced s. mutans and s. sobrinus counts in saliva but appeared not to effect numbers of s. sanguinis and s. mitis  in saliva. so, habitual consumption of xylitol reduces cariogenic streptococci levels without any effect on beneficial sterptococci for the oral cavity.

TI  == uv-c-irradiation sublethal stress does not alter antibiotic susceptibility of the viridans group streptococci to beta-lactam, macrolide, and fluoroquinolone antibiotic agents.
AB  == aim: previous work has indicated that environmental stresses on bacteria might lead to an upregulation of stress response. led curing lights (315-400 nm) and other uv lights used in tooth whitening cosmetic procedures might act as stresses. we examined the effect of uv-c light, as a high-energy surrogate to the lower-energy uv-a light used in such instruments, to examine its effect on the antibiotic susceptibility of viridans group streptococci. methods: twelve species of viridans group streptococci were examined in this study: streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus australis, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis. these organisms were exposed to varying degrees of sublethal uv-c radiation, and their minimum inhibitory concentration susceptibility was determined by broth dilution assay against three classes of commonly-used antibiotics: beta-lactams (penicillin), macrolides (erythromycin), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin). results: there was no significant difference between antibiotic susceptibility before uv-c exposure and following maximum sublethal stress, prior to cell death due to fatal uv-c exposure. conclusions: exposure to uv-c light will not result in altered antibiotic susceptibility patterns on viridans group streptococci. given that uv-c is more toxic and mutagenic than uv-a light, it is unlikely than uv-a light  would yield any difference in response to such exposure.

TI  == a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay system using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against glucosyltransferase-b from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == streptococcus mutans has been considered the principal etiological agent of dental caries in humans. s. mutans can secrete three kinds of glucosyltransferases (gtfs). one of these, gtf-b, which synthesizes water-insoluble glucans from sucrose, has been considered to be one of the most important factors of cariogenic dental plaque formation. therefore, determination of whether gtf-b is present in plaque and saliva samples may contribute to the evaluation of individual virulence potential (caries risk). the aim of this study was to develop a feasible enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for the routine quantification of gtf-b in plaque-derived cultures and clinical samples,  and to apply this assay to an epidemiological study. to determine the presence of gtf-b in plaque samples, a sandwich-elisa was devised, consisting of mouse monoclonal and rabbit polyclonal antibodies against gtf-b and a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody. the developed elisa allowed for quantification of the amounts of purified gtf-b with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity; this method was not affected by other components such as plaque and  saliva. plaque samples from healthy volunteers were examined using this elisa method and microbial analysis to apply the assay to an epidemiological study. a correlation was observed between the amount of extracted gtf-b and s. mutans levels as determined by elisa and cultivated with mitis salivarius bacitracin agar plates derived from plaque samples, although there were some exceptions. in  this regard, this elisa system has the advantage of estimating both the individual numbers of s. mutans and the productivity of gtf-b, namely, the cariogenic potential of s. mutans simultaneously. these results indicate that this elisa method is a useful tool for the diagnosis of caries risk.

TI  == purification and genetic characterisation of the novel bacteriocin ls2 produced by the human oral strain lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the antimicrobial potential of lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral strain with probiotic characteristics and a broad inhibitory spectrum both against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. here we present the bacteriocin ls2, an extremely ph- and heat-stable peptide with antilisterial activity. ls2 is a novel member of the class iid bacteriocins, unique among all currently characterised bacteriocins. it is somewhat similar to putative bacteriocins from several oral streptococci, including the cariogenic streptococcus mutans. ls2 is a 41-amino-acid, highly hydrophobic cationic peptide of 4115.1da that is sensitive to proteolytic enzymes. ls2 was purified from cells of strain bgho1 by solvent extraction and reverse-phase chromatography. mass spectrometry was used to determine the molecular mass of the purified peptide. n-terminal amino acid sequencing enabled  identification of the ls2 structural gene bacls2 by a reverse genetics approach.  downstream of the bacls2 gene, two bacteriocin-like genes were found, named blp1a and blp1b, and one putative bacteriocin immunity gene named bimlp. we also present the identification of the 242-kb megaplasmid pmpho1 by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, which harbours the genes bacls2, blp1a, blp1b and bimlp. two peptides with antimicrobial activity, whose approximate sizes corresponded to those of blp1a and blp1b, were identified only after culturing strain bgho1 in a  chemically defined medium. this study demonstrated the capacity of lactobacillus  salivarius bgho1 to produce multiple bacteriocins and further established this strain as a promising probiotic candidate.

TI  == inhibition of candida albicans yeast-hyphal transition and biofilm formation by solidago virgaurea water extracts.
AB  == xerostomia is a decrease of saliva secretion, which can unbalance the oral microflora, mainly to the benefit of candida albicans. the aim of the present study was to find a plant extract that could create an unfavourable environment for candida, and would, therefore, be appropriate for use in a dry-mouth daily-care mouthwash. water extract from the herbaceous plant solidago virgaurea  (goldenrod) was selected due to its saponin content (plant detergents). saponin concentrations reached 0.7 and 0.95 mg ml(-1) in s. virgaurea subsp. virgaurea and s. virgaurea subsp. alpestris extracts, respectively. c. albicans was grown in liquid medium and cells were counted by microscopic examination after 0, 4 and 24 h of incubation. solidago extracts did not inhibit the growth of c. albicans (four strains), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus,  streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius or enterococcus faecalis. when inocula were incubated with solidago extract for 4 and 24 h, we observed a decrease in candida yeast-hyphal transition. candida biofilms were then prepared  in microtitre plates and treated with plant extracts at 0 h, to estimate biofilm  formation, or at 18 h to estimate the effect of the saponin on pre-formed biofilms. biofilm formation and pre-formed biofilms were both strongly inhibited. in conclusion, the s. virgaurea extract was efficient against two key virulence factors of c. albicans: the yeast-hyphal transition phase and biofilm formation.

AB  == purpose: ethanol, human papilloma virus (hpv), and poor oral hygiene are risk factors that have been attributed to oral carcinogenesis. streptococci sp and hpv infections are common in the head and neck, often associated with sexual activity. although hpv is linked to head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, it is  unclear whether there is a similar role for streptococci sp. this cell study examines whether streptococci sp and hpv-16 with exposure to ethyl alcohol (etoh) can act as cofactors in the malignant transformation of oral keratinocytes. materials and methods: etoh (0.1%-20% vol/vol) was used to investigate streptococci sp attachment with immortalized e6-expressing hpv/hok-16b cells, human oral buccal keratinocytes, and foreskin keratinocytes. streptococci sp (streptococci mutans [lt11]) and various strains of acetaldehyde (aa) producer and nonproducer streptococcus salivarius (110-1, 109-2, 101-7, and 107-1) and a lactic acid producer bacterium, lactobacillus rhamnosus (24-1 and 25-2), were examined for interactions with keratinocytes by use of a green dye (percent of cells with colonies after 24 hours). carcinogens, aa, malondialdehyde, dna damage, and proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine) among keratinocytes were also quantified. results: aa and malondialdehyde production from permissible streptococci sp significantly increased with attachment to keratinocytes, whereas l rhamnosus did not significantly attach to keratinocytes. this attachment was associated with enhanced levels of aa adduct formation, proliferation (5'-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation), and enhanced migration through integrin-coated basement membrane by hpv oral keratinocytes, which are characteristics of a malignant phenotype. conclusions: these cell studies suggest that oral streptococci sp and hpv (hpv-16) cooperate to transform oral keratinocytes after low-level etoh (1%) exposure. these results appear to suggest a significant clinical interaction, but further validation is warranted.

TI  == anticariogenic potentials of clove, tobacco and bitter kola.
AB  == objective: to investigate three tropical plant materials - clove seeds [syzygium  aromaticum (s. aromaticum)], bitter kola fruits [garcinia kola (g. kola)] and tobacco leaves (nicotiana species) as potential targeted killers of streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), a cavity-causing bacterium (gram-positive, facultative anaerobe) that resides in a multispecies microbial community (dental plaque) for  the treatment of dental caries (tooth decay). methods: thirty one (31) teeth samples were collected from patients with obvious signs of tooth decay (swollen gum, weak or fallen tooth, etc.) using sterile swab sticks. these samples were collected from two major dental clinics in nsukka, enugu state, nigeria and investigated by spread inoculation onto sterile blood agar and mueller hinton agar (mha) respectively and incubated at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the discrete colonies obtained were further re-inoculated onto sterile mitis salivarius agar (msa) plates and incubated as above. the isolates were characterized by gram staining and catalase test. tobacco leaves, clove seeds and bitter kola fruits were ground into powder, extracted with three different solvents (n-hexane, hot water and ethanol), filtered, dried and stored in clean containers, corked and kept until used. the plant extracts were investigated for phytochemistry, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic), minimum cidal concentration (mcc) and compared with some conventional antibiotics commonly used against tooth decay. antibiotic  sensitivity test was also carried out. the results were statistically analyzed. results: the extracts showed varied phytochemical composition but most abundantly the flavonoids. our result also shows that females (16) have more tooth decay than males (15) and that 16 samples were very bloody while 15 were slightly bloody. the microbial characterization showed that 18 samples were catalase-positive indicating the presence of s. mutans while 13 were catalase-negative suspected to be staphylococcus spp. the gram reaction confirmed 13 gram-negative and 18 gram-positive organisms. the n-hexane extract had the best antimicrobial activity followed by the ethanol and lastly hot water. mic showed that n-hexane clove extract had the largest inhibition zone diameter, followed by bitter kola extract and lastly tobacco extract. the antibiotic sensitivity test credited ciprofloxacin the best because it exhibited broad spectrum of action. conclusions: since the n-hexane extract of clove seeds demonstrated preferential growth-inhibitory activity against the causal cariogenic pathogens (s. mutans) in dental caries, we therefore, report here that clove extract be henceforth considered as a potential ingredient in toothpaste preparation.

TI  == rapid detection and identification of streptococcus ratti by a species-specific pcr method.
AB  == to establish a rapid and species-specific detection and identification method of  streptococcus ratti by polymerase chain reaction, two pcr primer pairs specific to s. ratti were designed on the basis of the nucleotide sequence of the dextranase gene (dex) of s. ratti atcc19645(t). the primer pairs specifically detected s. ratti, but none of the other mutans streptococci (16 strains of 6 species). the pcr procedure was capable of detecting 1 pg of genomic dna purified from s. ratti atcc19645. we developed the streptococcus mutans-, streptococcus sobrinus-, streptococcus downei- and streptococcus salivarius-specific pcr methods (the dex pcr methods) with the primer pairs specific for a portion of the dex gene of each species. the mixture of these primer pairs including s. ratti (this study) successfully differentiated the five species of mutans streptococci  by species-specific amplicons of different lengths. these results suggest that the present pcr method is suitable for the specific detection and identification  of s. ratti, and that the mixture of primer pairs for the dex pcr methods is useful for species-specific detection and rapid discrimination of each species in mutans streptococci.

TI  == establishment of streptococcus mutans in infants induces decrease in the proportion of salivary alpha-haemolytic bacteria.
AB  == objective: for paediatric dentists, an indicator to assess caries risk of infants is very important. conventionally, the number and/or proportions of streptococcus mutans have been employed as risk indicator; however, because such figures reflect the existing situation, they are not suitable for assessing caries risk of infants that have not yet been infected with s. mutans. thus, we searched for  an indicator for the establishment of s. mutans. methods: to evaluate the changes caused by the establishment of s. mutans in the microbiota of the infant oral cavity, we monitored changes in the oral microbiota of two pre-dentate infants over a 3-year period and in a cross-sectional study of 40 nursery school-aged children by cultivation of saliva on nonselective blood agar, mitis-salivarius agar, and mitis-salivarius agar supplemented with bacitracin combined with identification of selected isolates. results: two longitudinal observations suggested that the establishment of s. mutans would induce a decrease in alpha-haemolytic bacteria in the microbial population of the oral cavity. this suggestion was compensated with the results of cross-sectional study, and it was  revealed that the establishment of 10(3) cfu/ml of mutans streptococci in saliva  might be predicted by a microbiota comprising less than approximately 55% of alpha-haemolytic. conclusion: decrease in the proportion of alpha-haemolytic bacteria in saliva of infant was found to be applicable as an indicator to predict the establishment of s. mutans and to assess dental caries risk as a background for planning of dental care and treatment in the infants before infection with s. mutans.

TI  == clinical use of photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy for the treatment of deep carious lesions.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (pact) via irradiation, using a low power laser associated with a photosensitization dye, as an alternative to remove cariogenic microorganisms by  drilling. remaining dentinal samples in deep carious lesions on permanent molars  (n = 26) were treated with 0.01% methylene blue dye and irradiated with a low power laser (ingaaip - indium gallium aluminum phosphide; lambda = 660 nm; 100 mw; 320 jcm(-2); 90 s; 9j). samples of dentin from the pulpal wall region were collected with a micropunch before and immediately after pact and kept in a transport medium for microbiological analysis. samples were cultured in plates of brucella blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and rogosa sl agar to determine the total viable bacteria, mutans streptococci and lactobacillus spp. counts, respectively. after incubation, colony-forming units were counted and microbial reduction was calculated for each group of bacteria. pact led to statistically significant reductions in mutans streptococci (1.38 log), lactobacillus spp. (0.93 log), and total viable bacteria (0.91 log). this therapy may be an appropriate approach for the treatment of deep carious lesions using minimally invasive procedures.

TI  == a comparative evaluation of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci counts in  indian children.
AB  == aim: probiotics and their effect on oral health have been a focus of numerous trials in recent times. no documented trials have been reported from developing countries such as india with its focus on probiotic use, especially in the paediatric population. the aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of probiotics on salivary mutans streptococci (ms) counts of children using the two  commercially and widely available preparations and to explore their anti-caries potential. study design: a placebo controlled study was undertaken with 3 parallel arms comprising a total of 150 healthy children (7-14 years). the subjects were randomly divided into the groups (each comprising 50 children): group a - placebo powder, group b - a freeze dried powdered combination of lactobacillus rhamnosus and bifidobacterium species, group c - a freeze dried powdered preparation of bacillus coagulans. the subjects were instructed to mix the preparation in 20 ml of water and to follow a swish and swallow method for 14 days. mutans streptococci colony counts per ml of saliva were performed on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar collected on the first day and 14 days post-intervention. results: a statistically significant reduction (p<0.001) in salivary mutans streptococci counts was recorded in both groups b and c after 14  days of probiotic ingestion. conclusion: a cost-effective probiotic such as bacillus coagulans might be a subject for further research for prevention of caries in children.

TI  == [can dental problems have influence on difficulties in treating paranasal sinusitis in children?].
AB  == paranasal sinusitis is a condition that is treated by a general practitioner and  in case it fails it requires specialistic therapy. in most cases the inflammation is connected with nasal mucosa infection. however, in older children and adolescents sinusitis caused by spreading of tooth and gingiva inflammatory process can be an essential therapeutic and diagnostic problem. it is most often  connected with periapical lesions, complications following dental procedures and  oroantral fistula inflammation. inflammatory process originally concerns maxillary sinus, however, it often undergoes generalization and it affects all or most of sinuses unilaterally or bilaterally. in microbiology of odontogenic sinusitis the dominant bacteria are the bacteria typical for peridental lesions (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and anaerobic bacteria). odontogenic sinusitis frequently causes life threatening complications that require heroic drug and surgical treatment. therapeutic and diagnostic problems are presented in case studies of 5 children aged from 10 to 17, who are treated in children's otolaryngology, audiology and phoniatrics clinic in lodz. there seems to be the need to emphasize the importance of thorough examination of oral cavity in all the children suffering from sinusitis, especially unilateral sinusitis. it is so essential on account of the gravity of  the problem and serious complications that accompany the conditions.

TI  == evaluating the in-vitro antibacterial effect of iranian propolis on oral microorganisms.
AB  == propolis has traditionally been used in curing infections and healing wounds and  burns. current researches have shown that propolis has antibacterial, antifungal  and antiviral actions however, the pharmacological activity of propolis is highly variable depending on its geographic origin. there have been few studies on the effects of iranian propolis on the oral microorganisms. in this in-vitro study, the antimicrobial activity of the ethanolic and water extracts of the iranian propolis (10%, w/v) from north-east area of tehran was evaluated. susceptibility  of the oral strains tested (streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 9222; staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923; enterococcus faecalis atcc 9854 and lactobacillus casei atcc 39392) was evaluated using the agar diffusion method at a concentration of 20 mg/ml of propolis and the zones of growth inhibition were measured. antibacterial activity was determined by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) and minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) at different concentrations of propolis. the ethanolic extract showed bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against all the strains, with mic and mbc ranges of 250-500 microg/ml. the mic concentration of the water extract was 500 microg/ml against s. mutans and e. faecalis. the water extract showed bactericidal activity only against s. mutans (20 mg/ml). these results indicate that the ethanolic extract is probably more useful in the control of oral biofilms and subsequent dental caries development. however, to determine the consequence of the ethanolic extract of iranian propolis on the oral mucosa, in-vivo studies of its possible effects are needed.

TI  == inhibition of streptococcus mutans biofilm formation by streptococcus salivarius  frua.
AB  == the oral microbial flora consists of many beneficial species of bacteria that are associated with a healthy condition and control the progression of oral disease.  cooperative interactions between oral streptococci and the pathogens play important roles in the development of dental biofilms in the oral cavity. to determine the roles of oral streptococci in multispecies biofilm development and  the effects of the streptococci in biofilm formation, the active substances inhibiting streptococcus mutans biofilm formation were purified from streptococcus salivarius atcc 9759 and ht9r culture supernatants using ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (maldi-tof) mass spectrometry analysis was performed, and the results were compared to databases. the s. salivarius ht9r genome sequence was determined and used to indentify candidate proteins for inhibition.  the candidates inhibiting biofilms were identified as s. salivarius fructosyltransferase (ftf) and exo-beta-d-fructosidase (frua). the activity of the inhibitors was elevated in the presence of sucrose, and the inhibitory effects were dependent on the sucrose concentration in the biofilm formation assay medium. purified and commercial frua from aspergillus niger (31.6% identity and 59.6% similarity to the amino acid sequence of frua from s. salivarius ht9r)  completely inhibited s. mutans gs-5 biofilm formation on saliva-coated polystyrene and hydroxyapatite surfaces. inhibition was induced by decreasing polysaccharide production, which is dependent on sucrose digestion rather than fructan digestion. the data indicate that s. salivarius produces large quantities of frua and that frua alone may play an important role in multispecies microbial  interactions for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation in the oral cavity.

TI  == invasion of human aortic endothelial cells by oral viridans group streptococci and induction of inflammatory cytokine production.
AB  == oral viridans group streptococci are the major commensal bacteria of the supragingival oral biofilm and have been detected in human atheromatous plaque. atherosclerosis involves an ongoing inflammatory response, reportedly involving chronic infection caused by multiple pathogens. the aim of this study was to examine the invasion of human aortic endothelial cells (haecs) by oral viridans group streptococci and the subsequent cytokine production by viable invaded haecs. the invasion of haecs by bacteria was examined using antibiotic protection assays and was visualized by confocal scanning laser microscopy. the inhibitory effects of catalase and cytochalasin d on the invasion of haecs were also examined. the production of cytokines by invaded or infected haecs was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, and a real-time polymerase chain reaction method was used to evaluate the expression of cytokine messenger rna. the oral streptococci tested were capable of invading haecs. the number of invasive bacteria increased with the length of the co-culture period. after a certain co-culture period, some organisms were cytotoxic to the haecs. catalase and cytochalasin d inhibited the invasion of haecs by the organism. haecs invaded by streptococcus mutans xc, streptococcus gordonii dl1 (challis), streptococcus gordonii atcc 10558 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419 produced more cytokine(s) (interleukin-6, interleukin-8, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1) than non-invaded haecs. the haecs invaded by s. mutans xc produced the largest amounts of cytokines, and the messenger rna expression of cytokines by invaded haecs increased markedly compared with that by non-invaded haecs. these results suggest that oral streptococci may participate in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.

TI  == molecular characterization and phylogenetic analysis of quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs) of gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci in  viridans group streptococci isolated from adult patients with cystic fibrosis.
AB  == objectives: ciprofloxacin is the most frequently used member of the fluoroquinolones during initial eradication therapy of pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as during acute pulmonary exacerbations. however, its long-term effect on the susceptibility of the commensal flora within the cystic fibrosis (cf) airways has not yet been examined. the aim of this study was therefore to examine the consequence of oral ciprofloxacin usage on the resistance of the commensal viridans group streptococci (vgs), in terms of mics and mutational analysis of the quinolone resistance-determining regions (qrdrs). methods: the mics of ciprofloxacin, efflux activities and amino acid substitutions in the qrdrs for 190 isolates of vgs, originating from the sputa of adult cf patients who had been exposed constantly to ciprofloxacin, were examined. vgs organisms included streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus parasanguinis, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus australis and streptococcus mutans. ciprofloxacin susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution and qrdrs within the gyra, gyrb, parc and pare gene loci were explored using sequence analysis. results: twenty-seven (14.2%) streptococcal isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin (mics >/=8 mg/l) and 21 (11.1%) had reduced susceptibility (mics 4 mg/l). as a comparator, clinically non-significant and non-invasive vgs organisms were examined in 12 consecutive non-cf patients in the community, where no resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed. five novel qrdr pcr assays were developed to elucidate mutations within the cf vgs population, where there were six positions, which corresponded to previously reported quinolone resistance responsible mutations, and eight novel potential qrdr resistance mutations. double mutations  in gyra and parc/pare led to mics of 16 to >64 mg/l, while single mutations in parc or pare resulted in mics of 8-32 mg/l and 8 mg/l, respectively. the mean homologies of each species to streptococcus pneumoniae r6 were: gyra, 70.3%-95%;  gyrb, 69.6%-96.2%; parc, 76.1%-94.8%; and pare, 70.7%-94.7%. the close relatives  of s. pneumoniae, s. mitis and s. oralis, showed high similarity for all four genes (more than 86%). conclusions: treatment of p. aeruginosa with oral ciprofloxacin in patients with cf may concurrently reduce antibiotic susceptibility in the commensal vgs flora, where these organisms may potentially  act as a reservoir of fluoroquinolone resistance gene determinants for newly acquired and antibiotic-susceptible pathogens, particularly the streptococcus milleri group.

TI  == antibacterial activity of the essential oil from rosmarinus officinalis and its major components against oral pathogens.
AB  == the essential oil of rosmarinus officinalis l. (rosemary) was obtained by hydro-distillation and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. sixty-two constituents were identified, representing 98.06% of the total oil content. oxygenated monoterpenes were the predominant components. the rosemary oil was characterized as having prominent (> 5%) contents of camphor (18.9%), verbenone (11.3%), a-pinene (9.6%), beta-myrcene (8.6%), 1,8-cineole (8.0%), and  beta-caryophyllene (5.1%). the antimicrobial activity of the oil as well as of its major constituents was tested against the following microorganisms: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sobrinus, and enterococcus faecalis, which are potentially responsible for the formation of dental caries in humans. the microdilution method was used for determination of the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) during evaluation of the antibacterial activity. the essential oil displayed low activity against the selected microorganisms. in the  present study, the pure major compounds were more active than the essential oil.  among all the microorganisms tested, the pathogen s. mitis was the most susceptible and e. faecalis was the most resistant to the evaluated samples. this is the first report on antimicrobial activity of the major components of rosemary oil against oral pathogens.

TI  == anticariogenic properties of ent-pimarane diterpenes obtained by microbial transformation.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of three pimarane-type diterpenes obtained by fungal biotransformation were investigated. among these metabolites, ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol was the most active compound, displaying very promising mic values (ranging from 1.5 to 4.0 mug ml(-1)) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius,  s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol against the primary causative agent s. mutans revealed that this compound only avoids growth of the inoculum in the first 12 h (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). the curve profile obtained by combining ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol and chlorhexidine revealed a  significant reduction in the time necessary for killing s. mutans compared with each of these two chemicals alone. however, no synergistic effect was observed using the same combination in the checkerboard assays against this microorganism. in conclusion, our results point out that ent-8(14),15-pimaradien-19-ol is an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == [classical and new approaches in laboratory diagnosis of viridans streptococci].
AB  == viridans group streptococci (vgs) are gram-positive microorganisms that can form  alpha-hemolytic colonies on sheep blood agar. they reside as normal flora in oral cavity, respiratory, gastrointestinal, urogenital tract and on skin. they can cause bacteremia, endocarditis, meningitis and septicemia following dental procedures. the diagnosis of vgs are difficult since the taxonomic classification and species na-mes may change due in time. viridans group streptococci are classified into 5 groups (sanguinis, mitis, mutans, salivarius, anginosus) according to biochemical reactions and 16s rrna sequencing. since streptococcus pneumoniae is a member of the mitis group, the other important species in this group deserves investigation. genetic exchange between streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis and s.pneumoniae by transformation and lysis mechanisms occur continously as they share the same anatomical region. these mechanisms play role in exchanging capsular and antibiotic resistance genes between these species. the cultivation of vgs usually starts with the inoculation of various patient specimens into sheep blood agar and the detection of alpha-hemolytic colonies. observation of gram-positive cocci microscopically, the detection of optochin-resistant and bile insoluble colonies with few exceptions are the further important steps in laboratory diagnosis. vgs are then identified at species level by using biochemical reactions, automated diagnostic systems and molecular methods. the last step in the laboratory diagnosis of vgs is antibiotic susceptibility testing which is of outmost importance as penicillin and erythromycin resistance are on rise. in this review article, classification of vgs, similarities between s.pneumoniae and mitis group streptococci and the laboratory diagnosis of vgs have been discussed.

TI  == setup of an in vitro test system for basic studies on biofilm behavior of mixed-species cultures with dental and periodontal pathogens.
AB  == background: caries and periodontitis are important human diseases associated with formation of multi-species biofilms. the involved bacteria are intensively studied to understand the molecular basis of the interactions in such biofilms. this study established a basic in vitro single and mixed-species culture model for oral bacteria combining three complimentary methods. the setup allows a rapid screening for effects in the mutual species interaction. furthermore, it is easy  to handle, inexpensive, and reproducible. methods: streptococcus mitis, s. salivarius and s. sanguinis, typical inhabitants of the healthy oral cavity, s. mutans as main carriogenic species, and porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, parvimonas micra, s. intermedius and aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans as periodontitis-associated bacteria, were investigated for their biofilm forming ability. different liquid growth media were evaluated. safranin-staining allowed monitoring of biofilm formation under the chosen conditions. viable counts and microscopy permitted investigation of biofilm behavior in mixed-species and transwell setups. findings: s. mitis, f. nucleatum, p. gingivalis and p. micra failed to form biofilm structures. s. mutans, s. sanguinis, s. intermedius and s. salivarius established abundant biofilm masses in cdm/sucrose. a. actinomycetemcomitans formed patchy monolayers. for in depth analysis s. mitis, s. mutans and a. actinomycetemcomitans were chosen, because i) they are representatives of the physiological-, cariogenic and periodontitis-associated bacterial flora, respectively and ii) their difference in their biofilm forming ability. microscopic analysis confirmed the results of safranin staining. investigation of two species combinations of s. mitis with either s. mutans or a. actinomycetemcomitans revealed bacterial interactions influencing biofilm mass, biofilm structure and cell viability. conclusions: this setup shows safranin staining, microscopic analysis and viable counts together are crucial for basic examination and evaluation of biofilms. our experiment generated meaningful results, exemplified by the noted s. mitis influence, and allows a fast decision about the most important bacterial interactions which should be investigated in depth.

TI  == streptococcus salivarius mutants defective in mannose phosphotransferase systems  show reduced sensitivity to mutacins i-t9 and r-3b.
AB  == twenty-four mutacin-producing streptococcus mutans strains were screened for their propensity to produce class ii one-peptide bacteriocin using a deferred antagonism assay. streptococcus salivarius and 3 mutants defective in their mannose phosphotransferase systems (mannose-pts) were used as sensitive strains to identify which mannose-pts could act as the docking site for class ii one-peptide bacteriocin activity. we observed that only 2 strains of s. mutans, t9 and 3b, potentially produce class ii one-peptide bacteriocin, namely mutacins  i-t9 and r-3b, but with no preference for any mannose-pts complex as a target.

TI  == effects of probiotic lactobacillus salivarius wb21 on halitosis and oral health:  an open-label pilot trial.
AB  == objective: the objective of this study was to evaluate whether oral administration of lactobacilli alters the degree of halitosis and clinical conditions associated with halitosis. study design: twenty patients with genuine  halitosis were given 2.0 x 10(9)lactobacillus salivarius wb21 and xylitol in tablet form daily. oral malodor and clinical parameters were evaluated at the same time of day for each patient after 2 and 4 weeks. results: all 20 patients were positive for l. salivarius dna in their saliva at 2 weeks, although 12 patients were negative for this organism at baseline. oral malodor parameters significantly decreased at 2 weeks in the subjects with physiologic halitosis. the scores of an organoleptic test and bleeding on probing significantly decreased at 4 weeks in the subjects with oral pathologic halitosis. conclusions: oral administration of probiotic lactobacilli primarily improved physiologic halitosis and also showed beneficial effects on bleeding on probing from the periodontal pocket.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of rosmarinus officinalis against oral pathogens: relevance of carnosic acid and carnosol.
AB  == the in vitro inhibitory activity of crude etoh/h2o extracts from the leaves and stems of rosmarinus officinalis l. was evaluated against the following microorganisms responsible for initiating dental caries: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and enterococcus faecalis. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined with the broth microdilution method. the bioassay-guided fractionation of the leaf extract, which displayed the higher antibacterial activity than the stem extract, led to the identification of carnosic acid (2) and carnosol (3) as the major compounds in the fraction displaying the highest activity, as identified by hplc analysis.  rosmarinic acid (1), detected in another fraction, did not display any activity against the selected microorganisms. hplc analysis revealed the presence of low amounts of ursolic acid (4) and oleanolic acid (5) in the obtained fractions. the results suggest that the antimicrobial activity of the extract from the leaves of r. officinalis may be ascribed mainly to the action of 2 and 3.

TI  == alkali production associated with malolactic fermentation by oral streptococci and protection against acid, oxidative, or starvation damage.
AB  == alkali production by oral streptococci is considered important for dental plaque  ecology and caries moderation. recently, malolactic fermentation (mlf) was identified as a major system for alkali production by oral streptococci, including streptococcus mutans. our major objectives in the work described in this paper were to further define the physiology and genetics of mlf of oral streptococci and its roles in protection against metabolic stress damage. l-malic acid was rapidly fermented to l-lactic acid and co(2) by induced cells of wild-type s. mutans, but not by deletion mutants for mles (malolactic enzyme) or  mlep (malate permease). mutants for mler (the contiguous regulator gene) had intermediate capacities for mlf. loss of capacity to catalyze mlf resulted in loss of capacity for protection against lethal acidification. mlf was also found  to be protective against oxidative and starvation damage. the capacity of s. mutans to produce alkali from malate was greater than its capacity to produce acid from glycolysis at low ph values of 4 or 5. mlf acted additively with the arginine deiminase system for alkali production by streptococcus sanguinis, but not with urease of streptococcus salivarius. malolactic fermentation is clearly a major process for alkali generation by oral streptococci and for protection against environmental stresses.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terpenoids from copaifera langsdorffii desf. against cariogenic bacteria.
AB  == in the present work, the anticariogenic activities of nine labdane type-diterpenes and four sesquiterpenes were investigated. among these metabolites, (-)-copalic acid (ca) was the most active compound displaying mic values very promising (ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 microg/ml) against the main microorganisms responsible for dental caries: streptococcus salivarius, s. sobrinus, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. sanguinis and lactobacillus casei. time kill assays performed with ca against the primary causative agent (s. mutans) revealed that, in the first 12 h, this compound only inhibits the growth of the inoculum (bacteriostatic effect). however, its bactericidal effect is clearly noted thereafter (between 12 and 24 h). also, ca did not show a synergistic effect when combined with the anticariogenic gold standard (chlorhexidine, chd) in the checkerboard assays against s. mutans. in conclusion, the results points out ca as an important metabolite in the search for new effective anticariogenic agents.

TI  == a preliminary study of biological characteristics of streptococcus oligofermentans in oral microecology.
AB  == this study was designed to explore the biological characteristics of a new oral streptococcus species streptococcus oligofermentans. plaque samples were collected from caries-free and caries-active subjects. s. oligofermentans was selectively grown on mitis salivarius agar plates and identified by using 2-step  pcr and was isolated from 38% of 18 subjects. isolates were found mostly on healthy tooth surfaces. s. oligofermentans had weaker abilities in acid production and demineralizing hydroxyapatite. when streptococcus mutans was coincubated with s. oligofermentans, total number, acid production and calcium release were significantly inhibited. in conclusion, inhibition of s. mutans could be a beneficial biological characteristic of s. oligofermentans in oral microecology.

TI  == potent anticariogenic activity of aceriphyllum rossii and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid.
AB  == aceriphyllum rossii engler (saxifragaceae) have been used as a nutritious food in korea. we found that the methanol extract of a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, potently inhibited the growth of the key cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans, with mic of 2 to 4 microg/ml. they also showed antibacterial activity against other cariogenic bacteria such as s. oralis, s. sobrinus, and s. salivarius with the similar potency. in the time-kill study, aceriphyllic acid a reduced the viable counts of s. mutans by 90% in 1 min at 8 microg/ml, indicating that aceriphyllic acid a had the fast bacteriostatic activity. severe damages of the cell surface of s. mutans by aceriphyllic acid a were observed by transmission electron microscopy, suggesting with its fast antibacterial activity that its mechanism of action might be membrane disruption. these results suggest that the methanol extract of  a. rossii root and its components, aceriphyllic acid a and 3-oxoolean-12-en-27-oic acid, could have the great potential as natural agents for preventing dental caries.

TI  == degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity of etch-and-rinse versus self-etching adhesives.
AB  == purpose: this study was designed to compare the self-etching with the etch-and-rinse adhesives regarding the degree of conversion and antimicrobial activity against cariogenic bacteria. materials and methods: the materials used were adhese (two-step self-etching), adper prompt l-pop (self-etching, single-step) and excite (etch-and-rinse) adhesives. the degree of conversion was  measured using fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. the absorbance peaks of infrared rays by the aliphatic c=c was detected at 1632 to 1637cm-1 and the aromatic c=c peak at 1610 to 1500 cm-1.the antimicrobial activity was evaluated using the microorganisms streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces odontolyticus, with a disk diffusion method. chlorhexidine digluconate solution 0.2% was used as a positive control. zones of inhibited bacterial growth were observed and measured. results: adhese showed the highest degree of conversion, followed by excite, while adper prompt l-pop had the lowest values. a significant difference in the degree of conversion was found between excite and adper prompt l-pop as well as adhese and adper prompt l-pop. on the other hand, there was no significant difference between excite and adhese. adper  prompt l-pop showed an antimicrobial effect against streptococcus mutans and actinomyces odontolyticus while it was unable to inhibit the growth of lactobacillus salivarius. adhese could inhibit the growth of streptococcus mutans only. excite did not produce inhibition zones to the tested microorganisms. conclusion: adper prompt l-pop showed the worst degree of conversion. adhese and  excite had the highest degree of conversion. appreciable antimicrobial activity was noted with self-etching adhesives, while the etch-and-rinse demonstrated no antimicrobial action.

TI  == diagnodent measurements of cultures of selected oral bacteria and demineralized enamel.
AB  == objective: carious tissue fluoresces with a wavelength different from sound tissue when stimulated by light with a wavelength of 655 nm. this difference is thought to have a bacterial origin rather than indicating demineralization. this  study aimed to measure fluorescence emitted by normal cultivable caries-associated bacterial flora and typical porphyrin-producing bacteria with diagnodent, and to verify earlier findings that demineralization of the dental hard tissue does not affect diagnodent readings. material and methods: bacterial  samples were collected from five occlusal caries lesions in three subjects. from  these, mixed anaerobic flora, lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were cultured  in up to three different kinds of culture medium. colonies of lactobacilli and mutans streptococci were also measured after transferring them to glass slides. laboratory teaching strains of prevotella spp., porphyromonas gingivalis and actinomyces odontolyticus were cultured anaerobically and fluorescence measured directly after an appropriate incubation period. sound enamel surfaces of 15 extracted premolars were demineralized and changes in fluorescence measured. results: diagnodent readings > 20 were only obtained from young colonies of prevotella and from colonies of mutans streptococci cultured on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. higher measurements were obtained as the bacterial colonies aged. lower measurements were obtained after transferring colonies to glass slides. demineralization of enamel did not affect the diagnodent measurements. conclusions: the change in fluorescence measured with diagnodent has a bacterial origin rather than occurring as a result of demineralization. the measurements are presumably dependent on bacterial metabolites rather than bacteria themselves, and probably record synergistic effects during the carious process rather than the quantity or species of bacteria involved.

TI  == the effect of sucrose on plaque and saliva urease levels in vivo.
AB  == objective: dietary sugar exposures induce an immediate drop of the plaque ph. based on in vitro observations, it was hypothesized that oral bacteria may rapidly respond to this environmental change by increasing the activity or expression of alkali-generating pathways, such as the urease pathway. the objective of this exploratory in vivo study was to determine the short-term effect of a brief sucrose exposure on plaque and saliva urease activity and expression, and to relate this effect to caries experience. methods: urease activity levels were measured in plaque and saliva samples collected from 20 children during fasting conditions and 30 min after rinsing with a sucrose solution. streptococcus salivarius urec-specific mrna in saliva was quantified using real-time rt-pcr. the impact of host-related factors, such as age, gender,  sugar consumption, salivary mutans streptococci levels and caries status on urease activity was evaluated. results: plaque urease activity under fasting conditions was higher in subjects with low caries and mutans streptococci levels. this difference was not observed after the sucrose exposure. the response of urease to sucrose in vivo did not depend on caries experience or salivary mutans  levels. significant increase in urease activity of plaque and saliva after exposure to sucrose was observed only in the subjects who had low urease levels at baseline. conclusions: the findings of this exploratory study suggest that plaque urease activity may have an important long-term influence in caries development but not during a cariogenic challenge.

TI  == infective endocarditis: identification of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci  from blood cultures by partial 16s rrna gene analysis and by vitek 2 examination.
AB  == streptococci, enterococci and streptococcus-like bacteria are frequent etiologic  agents of infective endocarditis and correct species identification can be a laboratory challenge. viridans streptococci (vs) not seldomly cause contamination of blood cultures. vitek 2 and partial sequencing of the 16s rrna gene were applied in order to compare the results of both methods. strains originated from  two groups of patients: 149 strains from patients with infective endocarditis and 181 strains assessed as blood culture contaminants. of the 330 strains, based on  partial 16s rrna gene sequencing results, 251 (76%) were vs strains, 10 (3%) were pyogenic streptococcal strains, 54 (16%) were e. faecalis strains and 15 (5%) strains belonged to a group of miscellaneous catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci. among vs strains, respectively, 220 (87,6%) and 31 (12,3%) obtained agreeing and non-agreeing identifications with the two methods with respect to allocation to the same vs group. non-agreeing species identification mostly occurred among strains in the contaminant group, while for endocarditis strains notably fewer disagreeing results were observed.only 67 of 150 strains in the mitis group strains obtained identical species identifications by the two methods. most vs strains belonging to the groups of salivarius, anginosus, and mutans obtained agreeing species identifications with the two methods, while this only was the case for 13 of the 21 bovis strains. pyogenic strains (n=10), enterococcus faecalis strains (n=54) and a miscellaneous group of catalase-negative, gram-positive cocci (n=15) seemed well identified by both methods, except that disagreements in identifications in the miscellaneous group  of strains occurred for 6 of 15 strains.

TI  == a novel pheromone quorum-sensing system controls the development of natural competence in streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == in streptococcal species, the key step of competence development is the transcriptional induction of comx, which encodes the alternative sigma factor sigma(x), which positively regulates genes necessary for dna transformation. in streptococcus species belonging to the mitis and mutans groups, induction of comx relies on the activation of a three-component system consisting of a secreted pheromone, a histidine kinase, and a response regulator. in streptococcus thermophilus, a species belonging to the salivarius group, the oligopeptide transporter ami is essential for comx expression under competence-inducing conditions. this suggests a different regulation pathway of competence based on the production and reimportation of a signal peptide. the objective of our work was to identify the main actors involved in the early steps of comx induction in  s. thermophilus lmd-9. using a transcriptomic approach, four highly induced early competence operons were identified. among them, we found a rgg-like regulator (ster_0316) associated with a nonannotated gene encoding a 24-amino-acid hydrophobic peptide (shp0316). through genetic deletions, we showed that these two genes are essential for comx induction. moreover, addition to the medium of synthetic peptides derived from the c-terminal part of shp0316 restored comx induction and transformation of a shp0316-deficient strain. these peptides also induced competence in s. thermophilus and streptococcus salivarius strains that are poorly transformable or not transformable. altogether, our results show that  ster_0316 and shp0316, renamed comrs, are the two members of a novel quorum-sensing system responsible for comx induction in species from the salivarius group, which differs from the classical phosphorelay three-component system identified previously in streptococci.

AB  == aim: dental plaque has a harmful influence on periodontal tissue. when a porcelain restoration is fabricated and refinishing of the glazed surface is inevitable, the increase in surface roughness facilitates the adhesion of plaque  and its components. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effect of  surface roughness of glazed or polished porcelain on the adhesion of oral streptococcus mutans. methods and materials: a total of 80 metal-ceramic specimens were prepared in the form of disks from two porcelain materials and divided into four groups according to the method of surface finishing. surface roughness values (ra-microm) for all specimens were recorded using a profilometer. s. mutans bacteria were isolated from saliva and all specimens were inoculated in test tubes containing a bacterial suspension allowing adhesion of the microorganisms to the specimens to occur. after incubation for 24 hours at 37 degrees c, the specimens were transferred to a sterile saline solution and an inoculum of 0.1 ml from each selected dilution was spread on the selective medium, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msb). bacterial counts, expressed in colony forming unit (cfu) taking into consideration the dilution factor, were recorded. results: there was significant correlation (p<0.05) between surface roughness values (ra-microm) and the amount of bacterial adhesion (cfu x 10(3)).  the glazed surface was the smoothest and exhibited the least amount of bacterial  adhesion. conclusion: a positive correlation between surface roughness and the amount of s. mutans adhesion was observed. the glazed porcelain surface was considered more biocompatible than other methods of porcelain surface finishing.  clinical significance: chairside adjustments of the cervical contour or occlusal  surface of porcelain restorations are sometimes necessary before or after cementation. ideally, an uncemented restoration should be returned to the laboratory for reglazing after all adjustments have been completed. it is important to evaluate various polishing procedures used for these adjusted surfaces to achieve a finished surface that as closely as possible approximates the quality of glazed porcelain.

TI  == horizontal transmission of mutans streptococci in children.
AB  == it has not been established whether transmission of mutans streptococci occurs between unrelated children older than 4 years of age. the aim of the study was to investigate the possible transmission of mutans streptococci genotypes from child to child in kindergarten. we studied 96 children (ages 5-6 yrs) in three san francisco bay area public schools. mutans streptococci colonies from each child were isolated from selective culture on mitis salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. we used arbitrary primed polymerase chain reactions to determine the mutans streptococci genotypes. two children (not siblings) in each of the three schools  (6%) shared an identical amplitype of s. mutans, unique to each pair. the 19 s. sobrinus amplitypes were found in 12 children, and all were unique to each child. the presence of matching genotypes of s. mutans demonstrates horizontal transmission of this species between unrelated children aged 5-6 years.

TI  == screening of quercus infectoria gall extracts as anti-bacterial agents against dental pathogens.
AB  == background and objectives: a number of bacteria have now become antibiotic-resistant. this increases the importance of ayurvedic drugs. we report, here, the activity of different extracts (petroleum ether, chloroform, methanol and water) of quercus infectoria galls against dental pathogens -- streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus acidophilus (designated) and streptococcus sanguis (isolated). materials and methods: the cup-plate method was used in anti-bacterial activity of the extracts at concentration of 200 mg/ml against dental pathogens. minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of most effective extracts against the most susceptible bacteria were determined using a two-fold serial micro dilution method. results: methanolic extract showed maximum anti-bacterial activity against all the bacteria. the most susceptible bacteria were s. sanguis followed  by s. aureus, s. mutans, s. salivarius and l. acidophilus. the mic values showed  that methanolic extract was more effective than water extract. conclusion: the plant has the potential to generate herbal metabolites. the crude extracts demonstrating anti-dental caries activity could result in the discovery of new chemical classes of antibiotics. these chemical classes of antibiotics could serve as selective agents for the maintenance of human health and provide bio-chemical tools for the study of infectious diseases.

TI  == partial recn gene sequencing: a new tool for identification and phylogeny within  the genus streptococcus.
AB  == partial sequences of the recn gene (1249 bp), which encodes a recombination and repair protein, were analysed to determine the phylogenetic relationship and identification of streptococci. the partial sequences presented interspecies nucleotide similarity of 56.4-98.2 % and intersubspecies similarity of 89.8-98 %. the mean dna sequence similarity of recn gene sequences (66.6 %) was found to be  lower than those of the 16s rrna gene (94.1 %), rpob (84.6 %), soda (74.8 %), groel (78.1 %) and gyrb (73.2 %). phylogenetically derived trees revealed six statistically supported groups: streptococcus salivarius, s. equinus, s. hyovaginalis/s. pluranimalium/s. thoraltensis, s. pyogenes, s. mutans and s. suis. the 'mitis' group was not supported by a significant bootstrap value, but three statistically supported subgroups were noted: streptococcus sanguinis/s. cristatus/s. sinensis, s. anginosus/s. intermedius/s. constellatus (the 'anginosus' subgroup) and s. mitis/s. infantis/s. peroris/s. oralis/s. oligofermentans/s. pneumoniae/s. pseudopneumoniae. the partial recn gene sequence comparison highlighted a high percentage of divergence between streptococcus dysgalactiae subsp. dysgalactiae and s. dysgalactiae subsp. equisimilis. this observation is confirmed by other gene sequence comparisons (groel, gyrb, rpob and soda). a high percentage of similarity was found between s. intermedius and s. constellatus after sequence comparison of the recn gene. to study the genetic  diversity among the 'anginosus' subgroup, recn, groel, soda, gyrb and rpob sequences were determined for 36 clinical isolates. the results that were obtained confirmed the high genetic diversity within this group of streptococci.

TI  == evolutionary relationships among salivarius streptococci as inferred from multilocus phylogenies based on 16s rrna-encoding, reca, seca, and secy gene sequences.
AB  == background: streptococci are divided into six phylogenetic groups, i.e, anginosus, bovis, mitis, mutans, pyogenic, and salivarius, with the salivarius group consisting of only three distinct species. two of these species, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis, are members of the normal human oral microflora whereas the third, streptococcus thermophilus, is found in bovine milk. given that s. salivarius and s. vestibularis share several  physiological characteristics, in addition to inhabiting the same ecosystem, one  would assume that they would be more closely related to each other than to s. thermophilus. however, the few phylogenetic trees published so far suggest that s. vestibularis is more closely related to s. thermophilus. to determine whether  this phylogenetic relationship is genuine, we performed phylogenetic inferences derived from seca and secy, the general secretion housekeeping genes, reca, a gene from a separate genetic locus that encodes a major component of the homologous recombinational apparatus, and 16s rrna-encoding gene sequences using  other streptococcal species as outgroups. results: the maximum likelihood (ml) and maximum parsimony (mp) phylogenetic inferences derived from the seca and reca gene sequences provided strong support for the s. vestibularis/s. thermophilus sister-relationship, whereas 16s rrna-encoding and secy-based analyses could not  discriminate between alternate topologies. phylogenetic analyses derived from the concatenation of these sequences unambiguously supported the close affiliation of s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus. conclusion: our results corroborated the sister-relationship between s. vestibularis and s. thermophilus and the concomitant early divergence of s. salivarius at the base of the salivarius lineage.

TI  == antagonistic action of indigenous streptococcus mutans strains.
AB  == dental caries is an infectious process which ultimately destroys the tooth. streptococcus mutans is considered to be the main agent causing this disease. if  microorganisms with antagonistic action on s. mutans were found, they might provide a way of avoiding or controlling the disease. within the framework of the oral microbial ecology approach, the aim of this project was to identify s. mutans strains with antagonistic effect upon s. mutans. saliva samples were taken from 66 children and cultured on blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. they were incubated at 37 degrees c in anaerobic atmosphere for 48 hours, after which bacteria were counted and biochemical tests performed on colonies compatible with s. mutans. antagonistic effect was determined using the double layer in agar technique. in children without and with caries, the frequency of s. mutans was 91.7% and 96.7%, respectively. in the group of patients without caries, only two strains had no antagonistic action, and three strains had full antagonistic action (100%), while the rest showed different kinds of inhibitory action. in the group of patients with caries, only 5 strains had no antagonistic  action, 32 strains had full antagonistic action (100%) and the rest had variable  inhibitory action. to conclude, 112 s. mutans strains with high antagonistic potential were identified, which, after other requirements are fulfilled, could be used in caries prevention or control strategies.

TI  == oral streptococcus species in pre-term and full-term children - a longitudinal study.
AB  == background: despite high clinical significance, the microbiology of the dental biofilm in young children remains poorly understood. aim: the aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate five streptoccocus species commonly found in the oral biofilm of children, namely streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and streptococcus salivarius to determine their relative numbers in caries-free pre-term children,  and age-matched full-term controls. design: plaque and saliva samples were obtained from 15 pre-term children and 15 age-matched controls at ages 3, 6, 12,  18, and 24 months. a quantitative real-time pcr technique was used to determine the numbers of five species of streptococcus using probes and primers specific for each bacterial species. results: all species of streptococcus generally increased from ages 3 to 24 months. the relative ratios of the bacteria remained  fairly constant at all ages studied (p > 0.1). there were no significant differences in numbers of all streptococcus species between pre-term children and full-term controls at all the ages investigated between. conclusion: the results  show that the relative numbers of s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. mitis, s. sanguinis, and s. salivarius remain relatively constant from 3 to 24 months of age in caries-free pre- and full-term children.

TI  == frequency and distribution of mutans streptococci in dental plaque from caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children.
AB  == mutans streptococci, in particular s. mutans and s. sobrinus, are generally considered to be the prime etiological bacteria of human dental caries. the aim of this study was to determine the frequency of mutans streptococci in dental plaque in three groups of caries-free and caries-affected venezuelan children aged 2-6, 7-12, 13-19 years, and their possible association with dental caries. the frequency of mutans streptococci was determined in samples of pooled dental plaque collected from all detectable sources of 30 (62.5%) caries-affected and 18 (37.5%) caries-free children. the samples were collected from all available tooth sites using a hollenbak probe and immediately suspended in ringer's solution, serially diluted and cultured in mitis salivarius (ms) agar for total streptococci determination and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) for isolation of mutans streptococci. the bacterial identification procedure was done using the api rapid strep system. the criteria used to determine dmft and dmft was established by klein and palmer (1941). mean dmft and dmft were 6.4 +/- 3.2 and 4.4 +/- 2.9, respectively. ten (33%) out of 30 caries-affected children harbored  mutans streptococci. the species most frequently found were s. mutans (20%), s. sobrinus (10%) and s. rattus (3.3%). meanwhile, in the caries-free group only 6 out of 18 children (33%) harbored mutans streptococci, specifically s. mutans and s. sobrinus, both at 17%, with no significant difference between the two groups.  these results indicate that the percentage of children that harbored mutans streptococci was similar in both groups, suggesting that other acidogenic species may be responsible for caries development.

TI  == association of streptococcus pluranimalium with valvular endocarditis and septicaemia in adult broiler parents.
AB  == the genus streptococcus consists of more than 60 species, but only streptococcus  equi subspecies zooepidemicus, streptococcus gallolyticus ssp. gallolyticus, streptococcus gallinaceus, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus suis have been isolated from poultry. during investigations of the  aetiology of increased mortality in broiler parent stock at the end of production, pure cultures of streptococcal-like organisms that could not be classified among these six species were obtained from 24 cases of septicaemia or  valvular endocarditis and septicaemia. phenotypic characterization using the api20 strep kit identified the isolates as aerococcus viridans (10), aerococcus urinae (2), leuconostoc species (4), streptococcus salivarius (2), streptococcus  bovis ii 3 (1), enterococcus avium (3), enterococcus faecium (1) or gemella morbillorum (1). however, this identification was misleading as subsequent genetic investigations using pulse field gel electrophoresis and sequencing of 16s rrna genes showed that 19 isolates were classified as streptococcus pluranimalium, while the remaining isolates were e. avium (3), e. faecium (1) or  lactobacillus species (1). misidentification by api20 strep was related to the database provided by the manufacturer, as the phenotypic characteristics could identify these organisms as s. pluranimalium. the isolates of s. pluranimalium belonged to at least three different clones as determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dna. the capacity that these isolates had to colonize the valvular endothelium was suggested by the occurrence of valvular endocarditis in 12 of 19 cases. demonstration of the same clone in all four houses on a farm suggested the pathogenic potential of this organism.

TI  == inhibiting effects of streptococcus salivarius on competence-stimulating peptide-dependent biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans.
AB  == introduction: the effects of streptococcus salivarius on the competence-stimulating peptide (csp)-dependent biofilm formation by streptococcus mutans were investigated. methods: biofilms were grown on 96-well microtiter plates coated with salivary components in tryptic soy broth without dextrose supplemented with 0.25% sucrose. biofilm formations were stained using safranin and quantification of stained biofilms was performed by measuring absorbance at 492 nm. results: s. mutans formed substantial biofilms, whereas biofilms of s. salivarius were formed poorly in the medium conditions used. furthermore, in combination cultures, s. salivarius strongly inhibited biofilm formation when cultured with s. mutans. this inhibition occurred in the early phase of biofilm formation and was dependent on inactivation of the csp of s. mutans, which is associated with competence, biofilm formation, and antimicrobial activity of the  bacterium, and is induced by expression of the comc gene. comparisons between the s. mutans clinical strains fsc-3 and fsc-3deltaglra in separate dual-species cultures with s. salivarius indicated that the presence of the bacitracin transport atp-binding protein gene glra caused susceptibility to inhibition of s. mutans biofilm formation by s. salivarius, and was also associated with the regulation of csp production by com gene-dependent quorum sensing systems. conclusion: it is considered that regulation of csp by glra in s. mutans and csp  inactivation by s. salivarius are important functions for cell-to-cell communication between biofilm bacteria and oral streptococci such as s. salivarius. our results provide useful information for understanding the ecosystem of oral streptococcal biofilms, as well as the competition between and  coexistence of multiple species in the oral cavity.

AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the levels of secretory iga (siga), ph, flow rates, mutans streptococci (ms) and candida in saliva of children with rampant caries compared to those caries-free. thirty children (age 62-123 months) were enrolled and divided into two groups: group i, children with rampant caries, group ii, caries-free children. the average salivary flow rate was measured from  the volume yielded within 5 minutes and the ph was determined using a ph-electrode. measurement of siga was performed using an immunoassay kit. the levels of ms and candida were determined by culture on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. it was found that children with rampant caries presented with significantly higher levels of salivary siga, ms and candida. however, the mean values for salivary flow rates and ph were similar between the groups. the results reveal that children with rampant caries had significantly higher levels of siga, ms and candida in their oral cavities. this  finding tends to support the hypothesis that higher levels of salivary siga may reflect a past exposure of the host to cariogenic microorganisms.

TI  == a novel method for the identification of saliva by detecting oral streptococci using pcr.
AB  == we have used dna amplification methods to detect common oral bacterial strains to test for the presence of saliva in forensic samples. streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans were detected in various forms of saliva samples, whereas these streptococci were not detected in semen, urine, vaginal fluid, or on skin surfaces. therefore, we demonstrated that these streptococci are promising new marker for the forensic identification of saliva. our data indicated that s. salivarius is more reliable than s. mutans as an indicator of saliva presence, because the detection rates for s. salivarius and s. mutans by this method were 100% and 90%, respectively. furthermore, s. salivarius was detected in all saliva stain samples, whereas s. mutans was only identified in 60% of the stains. finally, using this method we were able to successfully detect s. salivarius and  s. mutans in mock forensic samples. we therefore suggested that this method is useful for the identification of saliva in forensic science.

AB  == objective: we aimed to compare the effect of sodium fluoride and chlorhexidine on salivary levels of mutans streptococci (ms), in a double-blind, randomized clinical trial. methods: thirty-five healthy volunteers, aged 4-8 years, with at  least one active carious lesion and no previous history of allergies were selected to participate in the study. a gel formulation containing either 1.23% sodium fluoride or 1% chlorhexidine was topically administered to the dentition every 24 h for 6 consecutive days. salivary ms levels were measured at baseline (d1) and on the 6th (d6), 15th (d15), and 30th (d30) days. for microbiological analysis, mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar medium was used. results: difference between treatments was only verified on d6. on the last day of treatment 1% chlorhexidine gel was significantly more effective than fluoride (p = 0.0000). the use of sodium fluoride did not cause a statistically significant variation in salivary ms levels throughout the duration of the study. following treatment, a subsequent increase in ms counts between d6 and d15 (p = 0.0001) was observed with chlorhexidine. conclusion: a 6-day treatment with a 1% chlorhexidine gel was effective in reducing salivary ms; there was a significant ms increase once treatment was suspended. the use of 1.23% sodium fluoride under the same regimen  was not able to reduce salivary ms levels. our results suggest repeated treatment with 1% chlorhexidine as a means for maintaining low salivary ms levels in children with dental caries.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of kaurane diterpenes against oral pathogens.
AB  == two kaurane diterpenes, ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka) and 15-beta-isovaleryloxy-ent-kaur-16(17)-en-19-oic acid (ka-ival), isolated from aspilia foliacea, and the methyl ester derivative of ka (ka-me) were evaluated against oral pathogens. ka was the most active compound, with mic values of 10 microg ml(-1) against the following microorganisms: streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus sanguinis, and lactobacillus casei. however, ka did not show significant activity against streptococcus salivarius and enterococcus faecalis, with mic values equal to 100  and 200 microg ml(-1), respectively. our results show that ka has potential to be used as a prototype for the discovery of new effective anti-infection agents against microorganisms responsible for caries and periodontal diseases. moreover, these results allow to conclude that minor structural differences among these diterpenes significantly influence their antimicrobial activity, bringing new perspectives to studies on the structure-activity relationship of this type of metabolites with respect to caries and periodontal diseases.

TI  == short-term relative antibacterial effect of octenidine dihydrochloride on the oral microflora in orthodontically treated patients.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the efficacy of common antiseptic mouth rinses and octenidine dihydrochloride (oct). methods: the antibacterial activities of antiseptics against total and cariogenic bacteria (streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus species) in saliva were studied in vitro and in vivo. after unstimulated saliva was collected, one of the mouth rinse solutions was applied for 30seconds. saliva samples were collected 15, 30, 60, and 120min later and evaluated for their bacterial count. results: oct had a significantly greater inhibitory effect on the studied bacteria than 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (chx) and 7.5% polyvinylpyrrolidone-iodine complex (pvp-i) from 15min to 120min following the application (p<0.01). the antiseptic efficacy of 0.2% chx on total  bacteria and lactobacillus species was very similar to the efficacy observed with 7.5% pvp-i mouth solution from 15min up to 120min. streptococcus mutans was completely inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i, 0.5mg/ml chx, and 0.1mg/ml oct concentrations, while streptococcus salivarius was inhibited by 0.15mg/ml pvp-i,  2mg/ml chx, and 0.8mg/ml oct concentrations. lactococcus lactis subspecies lactis was inhibited with 0.00313mg/ml oct, 30mg/ml pvp-i, and 0.0063mg/ml chx concentrations. conclusions: oct compared favorably with chx and pvp-i in its antibacterial effects, both in vitro and in vivo (p<0.01).

TI  == a quantitative approach to the effectiveness of ozone against microbiota organisms colonizing toothbrushes.
AB  == objectives: toothbrushes are rapidly contaminated with different microorganisms,  which colonize the oral cavity and interdental spaces. this can represent a possible cause of infection or reinfection. in this study, the ozone experimental effect upon toothbrushes microflora was estimated microbiologically before and after saturation with ozone gas. methods: fifty used toothbrushes coming from children and adults were entered our study. microorganisms were enumerated and identified. bristles from each brush were soaked in ozone saturated pbs solution  for 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 min and the total microbial population was reassessed. results: counts of microorganisms isolated per brush varied between 10(2) and 10(7) cfu. candida albicans was present in used toothbrushes. no obligate anaerobes were isolated. members of streptococcaceae family were regularly found  (65.2%) belonging to the following species: streptococcus pyogenes, s. mutans, s. mitis, s. oralis, s. sobrinus, s. viridans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, aerococcus viridans. a. viridans and s. mutans were more frequently isolated on children toothbrushes while staphylococcus aureus and s. epidermidis were found on adults  brushes. escherichia coli, pseudomonas sp. and enterococcus sp., were also recovered. we found that the ozone treatment decreased gradually the microbial load. however, a bacterial re-growth was effective following short ozonation period. decontamination was complete after an extended exposure to ozone for 30 min. conclusions: ozone application was found to remove the toothbrushes bristles microbiota following conventional brushing. maximum decontamination efficacy of ozone treatment was observed after 30 min while exposure for short time periods seems to be inefficient which probably reflect the low dose of ozone used in this study.

TI  == colonization of mutans streptococci in costa rican children from a high-risk population.
AB  == purpose: the aim of the study was to determine the colonization of mutans streptococci (ms) in dental biofilm and saliva of children from a high-risk population with low socioeconomic status from san jose, costa rica. methods: a total of 68 healthy babies from 8 to 20 months of age (mean age=13 months), with  caries-free status and cariogenic feeding habits (eg, nursing bottle- or breast-feeding on demand) were examined. children divided in two groups (<13 months and 14-20 months). samples from dental biofilm and saliva from each subject were processed and plated in blood agar (ba) and mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb) to determine ms percentage. statistical analysis included the analysis of variance test, and stratification by age of ms  levels. results: detectable ms levels in dental biofilm and saliva were found in  75% and 72% of children, respectively. counts higher than 20000 colony forming units (cfu) per ml were found in 4% of saliva and in 35% of biofilm samples. the  two groups showed significant differences in ms levels for dental biofilm (p=.036) and saliva (p=.009). children older than 17 months presented higher ms levels (p<.05). analysis by ms levels (<0.1%; 0.1-1.0%;>1.0% of ms) the two groups showed an insignificant association with increasing mean age. ms density was associated with mean number of erupted primary molars. conclusions: mutans streptococci colonization of dental biofilm and saliva from high caries risk infants is associated with age and dental development.

TI  == [effects of oral streptococci on biofilm formation by cariogenic bacteria in dual species cultures].
AB  == the effects of oral commensal streptococci (streptococcus sanguinis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus salivarius) on biofilm formation by cariogenic mutans streptococci (streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus) were investigated. cell suspensions were cultured on 96-well microtiter plates coated with or without salivary components (sc), and in flow cell systems coated with sc in tryptic soy broth including 0.25% sucrose without dextrose (tsb). the resultant biofilm formations were stained using safranin or a live/dead baclight viability kit, and examined with absorbance at 492 nm or using confocal laser scanning microscopy. mutans streptococci and s. sanguinis biofilms were formed significantly on the polystyrene surfaces in tsb.  further, in combination cultures, s. sanguinis formed a sufficient biofilm when cultured with s. mutans. however, when s. sanguinis was cultured with s. sobrinus, biofilm formation was slightly inhibited. s. gordonii also inhibited biofilm formation in the culture with s. sobrinus, but not when cultured with s.  mutans. s. mitis and s. salivarius collapsed the biofilm morphology and inhibited volume development in some conditions when cultured with s. mutans or s. sobrinus. biofilm formation by mutans streptococci was challenged and collapsed on the whole by culturing with each of the other oral streptococci. these results indicate that co-culturing of multiple species of mutans streptococci and other oral streptococci has physical effects related to previous attachment and colonization on the surface, as well as biological effects to regulate biofilm formation.

TI  == purification of bacteriocin ls1 produced by human oral isolate lactobacillus salivarius bgho1.
AB  == introduction: lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, a human oral isolate with antagonistic activity against growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, and salmonella enteritidis, probably produces more than one proteinaceous antimicrobial substance. the objective of this study was the purification of a bacteriocin, named ls1, produced by l. salivarius bgho1. methods: a simple and fast procedure for bacteriocin purification was developed, consisting of reverse-phase chromatography of the ammonium sulfate precipitate of cell-free culture supernatant by fast protein liquid chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography, followed by tricine sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide  gel electrophoresis (sds-page), with the subsequent extraction of bacteriocin from the gel. results: the supernatant of l. salivarius bgho1 culture retained its antimicrobial activity after boiling in a water bath for 15 min. its antimicrobial activity was also maintained even after treatment for 20 min at 121 degrees c in an autoclave. bacteriocin ls1 was purified to homogeneity. the molecular mass of bacteriocin ls1 was estimated to be approximately 10 kda, based on tricine sds-page. during purification, another compound with antimicrobial activity, produced by l. salivarius bgho1, was detected. the molecular mass of this compound was estimated to be approximately 5 kda, based on tricine sds-page. conclusion: our results imply that ls1 is most probably a new bacteriocin, different from previously described bacteriocins produced by l. salivarius strains. the purification of bacteriocin ls1 enabled the further characterization of ls1 on both the molecular and genetic levels.

TI  == characterization of oral lactobacilli as potential probiotics for oral health.
AB  == introduction: intestinal lactobacilli have been successfully used as probiotics to treat gastrointestinal disorders, but only limited data are available for the  probiotic properties of oral lactobacilli to combat oral diseases. we aimed to characterize oral lactobacilli for their potential probiotic properties according to the international guidelines for the evaluation of probiotics, and to select potential probiotic strains for oral health. methods: the study included 67 salivary and subgingival lactobacilli of 10 species, isolated from healthy humans. all strains were identified using amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis, tested for antimicrobial activity against oral pathogens, tolerance of  low ph and bile content. thereafter, the lysozyme tolerance and antibiotic susceptibility of 22 potential probiotic strains were assessed. results: the majority of strains suppressed the growth of aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, and streptococcus mutans, but none inhibited candida albicans. the lowest ph tolerated by lactobacilli following 4 h of incubation was ph 2.5, but none of the strains grew at this ph. all strains tolerated a high concentration of lysozyme (10 mg/ml) and half of the strains tolerated a high concentration of human bile [5% volume/volume (v/v)]. four lactobacillus plantarum and two lactobacillus oris strains expressed resistance to tetracycline and/or doxycycline. conclusions: strains of l. plantarum, lactobacillus paracasei, lactobacillus salivarius, and lactobacillus rhamnosus expressed both high antimicrobial activity and high tolerance of environmental stress. the absence of transferable antibiotic-resistance genes in l. plantarum strains remains to be confirmed. these results suggest a potential for oral lactobacilli to be used as probiotics  for oral health.

TI  == new culture media for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus in  the saliva of head- and neck-irradiated patients.
AB  == the reduction in salivary flow in patients subjected to head and neck irradiation induces changes in the oral microflora and increases the risk of oral mucosal infections. the frequent presence of fungi, particularly candida, in the oral environment of these patients complicates identification of the most important cariogenic bacteria with the commercial crt bacteria (ivoclar vivadent) culture media. such identification is important for the application of chemical measures  to control cariogenic bacteria in these patients, since it has been shown that simple fluoride application is unable to control caries in this population. objective: the aim of this study was to obtain a simple medium that inhibits candida spp. growth and allows the specific growth of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus spp. thus, reliable counts of cariogenic species can be achieved. materials and methods: stimulated saliva samples from 30 head- and neck-radiotherapy patients were seeded in commercial crt bacteria culture medium  and in two different media designed by our group: mitis salivarius bacitracin agar (msba), containing 5% potassium tellurite and fluconazole 64 microg/ml (msbtpf) for the isolation of streptococcus; and man, rogosa and sharpe (mrs) agar, containing bacitracin 0.2 u/ml and fluconazole 32 microg/ml (mrsbf) for the isolation of lactobacillus spp. results: candida growth was inhibited 100% in the media developed in this study. in all the samples seeded, growing of colonies in  mrsbf was identified as lactobacillus, while in crt bacteria for lactobacillus spp. this species was only isolated in 48.1% of the samples. s. mutans was identified in 71.4% of the colonies that grown in msbtpf medium, while in crt bacteria for s. mutans, this species was only identified in 35% of the colonies obtained. conclusion: the culture medium developed in the present study was able  to inhibit the 100% of candida spp. growth. these new media permit reliable counts of cariogenic bacteria in irradiated patients.

TI  == isolation and characterization of the mutans streptococci from the dental plaques in koreans.
AB  == mutans streptococci have been implicated as cariogenic bacteria in dental caries  because they can produce high levels of dental caries-causing lactic acid and extracellular polysaccharide. the aim of this study was to isolate and characterize the mutans streptococci from the dental plaque obtained from koreans. the dental plaque samples were collected from the anterior and molar teeth of both jaws in 155 subjects (aged 2 to 33.2 years, average age 13.7+/-4.7  years). the samples were diluted by 100-fold in 1x pbs and plated on mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar plates. the mutans streptococci grown on msb plates were screened by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dextranase gene (dex). the mutans streptococci  were identified at the species level using a 16s rdna sequencing comparison method. the biochemical tests were carried out to biotype the mutans streptococci. ninety-five strains of the mutans streptococci out of 358 colonies, which were derived from 141 subjects, were isolated. of them, 77 strains and 18 strains were streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, respectively. the biotyping data showed that 62, 1, 20, 10, and 2 strains were biotypes i, ii, iv,  v and variant, respectively. of the two strains of variant biotype, one strains was similar to biotype iv except that it was positive to the arginine hydrolysis  test. we considered this one strain a new biotype, and classified it as biotype vii. in conclusion, s. mutans and its biotype i was most frequently isolated in korean dental plaque. the mutans streptococci strains isolated in this study might be useful for the study of the pathogenesis and the prevention of dental caries.

TI  == molecular and biochemical characterizations of human oral lactobacilli as putative probiotic candidates.
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to characterize the lactobacilli from the human oral cavity as a potential source of probiotic strains. methods: samples were collected from four different locations within the oral cavity: surface of healthy tooth, oral mucous membrane, surface of tooth decay and deep tooth decay. on the basis of morphological and biochemical properties eight categories were formed and 26 isolates were selected for further characterization. the isolates were determined as lactobacillus sp. using primers specific for 16s rdna. sequencing of 16s rdna genes and repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reactions were used for determination to species and subspecies  levels. results: predominant species were lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus  plantarum, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei, while lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus cellobiosus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis and lactobacillus gasseri were also present. the isolates lactobacillus salivarius bgho1, lactobacillus fermentum bgho36 and bgho64, lactobacillus gasseri bgho89 and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. lactis  bgho99 exhibited antagonistic action on the growth of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, micrococcus flavus, salmonella enteritidis, streptococcus  pneumoniae and streptococcus mutans, but not on growth of candida albicans. moreover, the isolates l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 were tolerant to low ph and high concentration of bile salts. conclusion: taken together, these findings imply that l. salivarius bgho1 and l. gasseri bgho89 might be subjects for additional investigation as potential probiotic strains.

TI  == production of monoclonal antibodies against streptococcus mutans antigens.
AB  == several studies have been conducted in the last decades aiming to obtain an anti-caries vaccine, however some studies have demonstrated cross reactivity between streptococcus mutans surface antigens and the human cardiac tissue. in this work, the reactivity of five anti-streptococcus mutans monoclonal antibodies (moab) (24a, 56g, c8, e8 and f6) was tested against oral streptococci, cardiac antigens and skeletal and cardiac myosins, aiming to evaluate the specificity of  these moab. the hybrid producers of immunoglobulins of the igg2b class were cloned by limit dilution and expanded in vivo. moab were tested by elisa. the hybrid 24a reacted with s. mutans cct 1910, s. salivarius cct 0365 and s. pyogenes t23. no reactivity difference was observed among the tested species. cross reactivity with heart and cardiac myosin was not confirmed and only reaction with myosin of skeletal muscle was observed (p = 0.0381). the hybrid 56g reacted with all the tested microorganisms and there was statistically significant difference between s. mutans and s. pyogenes t23 (p < 0.001). this hybrid also reacted with myosin of skeletal muscle (p = 0.0095). c8, e8 and f6 presented low reactivity against oral streptococci strains and no reactivity against cardiac antigens. the data of this study showed that the 24a and 56g anti-s. mutans moab presented reactivity with s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, reinforcing the occurrence of common antigens between these species. the tested moab presented low cross-reactivity with myosin of skeletal muscle, but anti-heart activity could not be confirmed.

TI  == clinical and microbiological effect of calcium hydroxide protection in indirect pulp capping in primary teeth.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effect of calcium hydroxide (ch) on carious dentin on primary teeth submitted to indirect pulp capping (ipc). methods: twenty 4-7 year-old subjects with 42 treated teeth participated in the study. the treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of a ch or gutta-percha (gp) layer and sealing with a resin-based composite for 4-7 months. after cavity preparation and sealing, the dentin was evaluated clinically (color and consistency) and microbiologically. dentin samples were cultured on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar and rogosa sl agar. results: 39 teeth (20 in the ch group and 19 in the gp group) were reopened 4-7 months post-treatment for clinical and microbiological evaluation. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was wet and soft or leathery. in the ch group, 10% of the lesions were yellow, 80% light brown and 10% dark brown and in the gp group, 94.7% were light brown and 5.3% dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, 90% (group ch) and 84.2% (group gp) were dark brown. the final consistency was either leathery or hard. three samples in the ch group and five in group gp changed from soft to leathery; only one sample (gp) remained leathery. 85% in the ch group and 68.4% in gp group turned hard after treatment.  all bacterial counts decreased significantly by the end of treatment. in the ch group, the bacterial (log10 cfu + 1) anaerobic growth decreased from 4.84 +/- 1.31 to 1.35 +/- 1.54, aerobic from 4.09 +/- 1.04 to 0.92 +/- 1.30 and lactobacilli from 3.24 +/- 1.22 to 0.36 +/- 0.89, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 2.05 +/- 1.84 to 0.14 +/- 0.60. in gp group, anaerobic growth decreased from 5.22 +/- 0.96 to 2.02 +/- 1.65 and aerobic from 4.23 +/- 1.37 to 1.08 +/- 1.29 and lactobacilli from 2.06 +/- 1.81 to 0.00 +/- 0.00, respectively; the mutans streptococci from 3.16 +/- 1.59 to 0.28 +/- 0.84.

TI  == comparative analysis of a monoclonal antibody-based streptococcus mutans detection method with selective culture assays using polymerase chain reaction as a gold standard.
AB  == the aim of this study was to compare a recently developed monoclonal antibody (mab)-based salivary streptococcus mutans detection method with various selective media using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) as the gold standard. salivary s. mutans cells were enumerated with a mab-based method, along with three commonly used selective media, mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar (msb), trypticase yeast-extract cystine sucrose bacitracin agar (tycsb), and glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) agar. statistical analysis  showed no significant correlations between each method. with pcr as the standard, a mab-based detection method was found to provide the highest sensitivity (91%) and specificity (96%) among these four methods. this study demonstrates that the  mab-based detection method may provide more accurate enumeration of salivary s. mutans than selective media.

TI  == a modified dip-slide test for microbiological risk in caries assessment.
AB  == this study was undertaken to evaluate the validity of a new modified dip-slide test kit for the estimation of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels by comparison with the results obtained from conventional agar plate counts. five milliliters of paraffin-stimulated saliva sample was collected from 118 6-12-year old children attending 4 primary schools in thailand. saliva was poured over a 3-compartment slide containing mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar, rogosa agar and sabouraud dextrose agar. a slide was incubated in a 5% co2  incubator for 48 hours. the results of the modified test kit were compared with those from the conventional saliva sampling with dilution method. the salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida counts obtained from the conventional methods were significantly correlated (p < 0.0001) with the modified dip-slide estimates of these organisms. (kendall tau = 0.71, 0.58 and 0.76, respectively). the correlation between a modified dip-slide test kit and the conventional method indicates that this new test kit is suitable for the screening of salivary mutans streptococci, lactobacilli and candida levels in patients. the test is simple and would be useful for the early selection of patients for dental examination. in addition, it would be a valuable educational  aid for the motivation and dietary counseling among children.

TI  == calcium modulates interactions between bacteria and hydroxyapatite.
AB  == bacterial adhesion onto hydroxyapatite is known to depend on the surface properties of both the biomaterial and the bacterial strain, but less is known about the influence of the composition of the aqueous medium. here, the adhesion  of streptococcus mutans and 3 different lactobacilli on powdered hydroxyapatite was shown to change with ca2+ concentration. the effect depends on the surface properties of each strain. adhesion of lactobacillus fermentum and salivarius (and of streptococcus mutans at low ca2+) was enhanced with increasing ca2+ concentration. lactobacillus casei was efficiently removed by adhesion on hydroxyapatite, even without ca2+ addition, and the effect of this ion was only marginal. the results are interpreted in terms of ca2+-mediated adhesion, and relative to the hydrophobic properties of each strain and the electrical properties of the bacterial and solid surfaces (electrophoretic mobility).

TI  == influence of a fluoride mouthrinse on mutans streptococci in schoolchildren.
AB  == this study aimed to determine whether the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse  affects the salivary levels of mutans streptococci. two hundred and fifteen schoolchildren (aged 9-10 years) participated. one hundred and forty-nine of these children had used a fluoride mouthrinse since 5 years of age at nursery school, and the remaining 66 children had not. dft (decayed and filled teeth) was recorded, and the salivary levels of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus were measured using mitis salivarius bacitracin agar. the group that had used a fluoride mouthrinse had a significantly lower prevalence of both s. mutans and s. sobrinus (p = 0.038) and a significantly lower dft score (p < 0.001) than  the other group. using logistic regression analysis including caries experience at baseline as a dependent variable, the odds ratio of carrying s. mutans alone was 8.0 (p = 0.066) and that of carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus was 16.5  (p = 0.022) in the group that had not used the fluoride mouthrinse. children carrying both s. mutans and s. sobrinus had a higher caries incidence in 1 year than the others, with odds ratios of 5.73 (p = 0.067) in the group with a fluoride mouthrinse and 3.47 (p = 0.035) in the group without it. these results show that the long-term use of a fluoride mouthrinse is associated with reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci and this bacterial reduction may partly contribute to the suppression of dental caries in children using a long-term fluoride mouthrinse.

TI  == tigecycline (gar-936) activity against streptococcus gallolyticus (bovis) and viridans group streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci including streptococcus gallolyticus (formerly s. bovis) represent serious invasive pathogens often associated with endocarditis or sepsis among immunocompromised or cancer patients. tigecycline (gar-936), the first clinically studied glycylcycline, has a potent gram-positive activity with  a potential treatment option for these streptococcal infections. the studied collection (848 strains) included 100 isolates each of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and fewer  strains of s. gallolyticus (98 strains) and streptococcus mutans (50 strains). these strains were isolated from patients on 3 continents in the sentry antimicrobial surveillance program and tested for susceptibility and interpreted  by clinical and laboratory standards institute broth microdilution methods and criteria (< or = 0.25 microg/ml for tigecycline per us food and drug administration). penicillin susceptibility rates for the entire collection varied from 61% (s. sanguis) to 98% (s. constellatus), and macrolide susceptibility was  also compromised (49-88%; average, 69%). tigecycline was active against all isolates tested, in contrast to tetracycline resistance rates of 8-66%, and highest for s. gallolyticus. in conclusion tigecycline was quite active against bacteremic isolates of viridans group streptococci species and s. gallolyticus with an overall mic90 at < or = 0.06 microg/ml; the highest mic was only 0.25 microg/ml.

TI  == comparison of culture media and chairside assays for enumerating mutans streptococci.
AB  == aim: this study compared several traditional culture-based media and chairside cultural assays for ability to recover mutans streptococci (ms) from pure cultures and from saliva samples. methods and results: when pure cultures were used with traditional culture-based media, mitis-salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar demonstrated less support for bacterial recovery than trypticase-yeast extract-cysteine sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agar and the modified medium of ritz  (hlr-s). one species of ms, streptococcus ferus (c), was not recovered on msb medium. chairside cultural tests displayed considerable disparity between tests in recovering bacteria from pure cultures. on the glass adherence assay (mucount), s. ferus was not detected and streptococcus criceti was not detected on the dipslide assay (cariescreen sm) or on the plastic adherence assay (dentocult sm strip mutans). the frequency of isolation of pure strains of bacteria other than ms was common. from saliva samples, the frequency of isolation of ms on hlr-s and tycsb media and the glass adherence assay was 91-97%. the frequency of isolation on msb medium and on the dip-slide and plastic adherence assays was significantly decreased (37, 47 and 69%, respectively). recovery scores varied considerably among the culture methods studied and tended  to be highest on the hlr-s medium and on the glass adherence assay. conclusions:  growth and recovery profiles of pure bacterial cultures and of saliva samples for the ms varied according to different media. significance and impact of the study: caution should be exercised in comparing results between studies that employ different cultural methods for ms enumeration.

TI  == a lacticin 3147 enriched food ingredient reduces streptococcus mutans isolated from the human oral cavity in saliva.
AB  == aims: to isolate and characterise streptococcus mutans from irish saliva samples  and to assess their sensitivity to a food-grade preparation of the lantibiotic, lacticin 3147, produced by lactococcus lactis dpc3147. methods and results: saliva samples collected from children with varying oral health status were screened on mitis salivarius agar for the presence of pathogenic streptococci. following selective plating, 16s rdna sequencing and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (pfge), 15 distinct strains of strep. mutans were identified. these were grouped according to their relative sensitivity to lacticin 3147 which ranged from 0.78 to 6.25%; relative to a sensitive indicator strain, lactococcus  lactis ssp. lactis hp. inhibition of indicator strep. mutans strains from sensitive, intermediate and tolerant groupings were assessed in microtitre plate  assays with increasing concentrations of lacticin 3147. the concentration of lacticin 3147 required to give 50% growth inhibition correlated with their relative sensitivities (as assayed by well diffusion methodology) and ranged from 1280 to 5120 au ml(-1). concentrated preparations of lacticin 3147 caused a rapid killing of strep. mutans strains in broth. moreover, in human saliva deliberately spiked with strep. mutans, the pathogen was eliminated (initial inoculum of 10(5)) in the presence of 40,000 au ml(-1) of lacticin 3147. furthermore, a food-grade lacticin 3147 spray dried powder ingredient was assessed for the inhibition of strep. mutans in human saliva, spiked with a strain of intermediate sensitivity, resulting in up to a 4-log reduction in counts after 20 min. conclusion: a food grade preparation of lacticin 3147 was effective in the inhibition of oral strep. mutans. significance and impact of the study: the inhibition of oral streptococci by food grade preparations of lacticin 3147 may offer novel opportunities for the development of lacticin 3147 as an anti-cariogenic agent particularly in the area of functional foods for the improvement of oral health.

TI  == early acquisition of streptococcus mutans for children.
AB  == existing evidence reveals that in early oral infection the main route of transmission of streptococcus mutans is mother-child saliva contacts and that initial acquisition takes place during a specific period of time denominated "window of infectivity" that lapses between 6 and 30 months of the child's life,  with a higher risk between 18 and 30 months of age. the aim of the present study  was to analyze early oral infection. the levels of streptococcus mutans in saliva and bacterial plaque in the binomial mother-child 6 to 18 months after childbirth were evaluated. twenty-four mother-child binomials that attended the university hospital of maternity and neonatology of cordoba participated in the study. samples of saliva and dental plaque were taken from mother and child and seeded in selective agar mitis salivarius bacitracin medium (0.28 mg/ml) and cultured for 48 hours at 37 degrees c and in 5% co2 to allow for the growth of streptococcus mutans. the colonies were identified morphologically and biochemically. at 6 months after childbirth: 58.33% of the samples of the mother's saliva were positive, while the presence of the microorganism was not detected in 100% of the samples of the infants' saliva. at 18 months of after childbirth: 79.16% of the samples of saliva and 100% of the samples of the mothers' dental plaque were positive, whereas the samples of saliva and dental plaque of the infants were positive for streptococcus mutans in 20.83% and 70.83% of the cases respectively. the initial acquisition of streptococcus mutans would  have occurred in 20.8% of the children at the age of 18 months. eruption of primary molars occurs at this age.

TI  == effects of sonic energy on monospecific biofilms of cariogenic microorganisms.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the in vitro differential effect of sonic energy, delivered  by sonicare advance, on cariogenic and non-cariogenic bacteria biofilms. methods: a wild strain of streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus salivarius and veillonella alcalescens was isolated from human dental plaque. for each of the four microorganisms a biofilm adherent to bovine enamel disks, coated with artificial saliva, was obtained. biofilms were divided into four groups and  were exposed to acoustic energy delivered by sonicare for 0 (control group), 5, 15 and 30 seconds. the distance between the end of the bristles and the disk surface was set to 7 mm, to ensure that the biofilm removal was simply due to fluid forces and not to the contact with the bristle tips during the brushing cycle. a colorimetric technique (mtt assay), based on the reduction of a yellow tetrazolium salt to a purple formazan, was used to evaluate the reduction of the  adherent biomass after the exposure to the sonic energy. results: anova results showed that sonic energy exposure significantly reduced the biomass of s. mutans  and s. salivarius adherent to the disks, while l. acidophilus and v. alcalescens  seemed to remain basically unaffected. in the two streptococcal groups, the increase of the exposure time led to different reduction trends; while s. salivarius exhibited a progressive decrease over time, s. mutans showed a rapid reduction of the adherent biomass after a 15-second exposure to sonicare.

TI  == anticariogenic activity of macelignan isolated from myristica fragrans (nutmeg) against streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the occurrence of dental caries is mainly associated with oral pathogens, especially cariogenic streptococcus mutans. preliminary antibacterial screening revealed that the extract of myristica fragrans, widely cultivated for the spice  and flavor of foods, possessed strong inhibitory activity against s. mutans. the  anticariogenic compound was successfully isolated from the methanol extract of m. fragrans by repeated silica gel chromatography, and its structure was identified  as macelignan by instrumental analysis using 1d-nmr, 2d-nmr and ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macelignan against s. mutans was 3.9 microg/ml, which was much lower than those of other natural anticariogenic agents such as 15.6 microg/ml of sanguinarine, 250 microg/ml of eucalyptol, 500 microg/ml of menthol and thymol, and 1000 microg/ml of methyl salicylate. macelignan also possessed preferential activity against other oral microorganisms such as streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis,  lactobacillus acidophilus and lactobacillus casei in the mic range of 2-31.3 microg/ml. in particular, the bactericidal test showed that macelignan, at a concentration of 20 microg/ml, completely inactivated s. mutans in 1 min. the specific activity and fast-effectiveness of macelignan against oral bacteria strongly suggest that it could be employed as a natural antibacterial agent in functional foods or oral care products.

TI  == the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence.
AB  == some novel caries detection and excavation devices rely on the ability of bacteria to produce red fluorescing compounds. the aim of this study was to examine the ability of selected oral microorganisms to emit red fluorescence. streptococcus mutans, s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, lactobacillus fermentans, l. casei, l. rhamnosus, actinomyces naeslundi, a. israelii, prevotella intermedia, and fusobacterium nucleatum were inoculated onto columbia  agar with haemin and vitamin k and incubated anaerobically for up to 7 days in the dark. the resulting bacterial colonies were excited using filtered xenon light (405 +/- 20 nm) and digitally photographed through a 530-nm high-pass filter. the red and green portions of the colony fluorescence were analyzed using a computer program and the red/green ratio was calculated. all colonies emitted both red and green fluorescence. the green outweighed the red portion for the following species (in descending order) s. oralis, s. salivarius, s. mutans, f. nucleatum and s. sobrinus. the red portion was higher for the following species (in descending order) p. intermedia, a. naeslundi, a. israelii, l. fermentans, l. rhamnosus and l. casei. with all the bacteria examined, one color portion generally outweighed the other, giving the visual impression of either red or green fluorescence. we conclude that red fluorescence is well suited to detection of the bacteria which cause dentin caries but it is not suitable as an indicator  of the presence and activity of the streptococci involved in initial caries.

AB  == background and objective: dental caries is associated with oral pathogens and streptococcus mutans (s. mutans) is one of the primary cariogenic organisms. mastic gum, from pistacia lentiscus, has been shown to have antibacterial properties. the objective of this study was to determine antibacterial activity of mastic chewing gum against s. mutans and mutans streptococci in vitro and in vivo conditions. setting: cukurova university, dental school, in 2002. materials  and methods: antimicrobial activity of mastic gum was evaluated using standard s. mutans strain by disc diffusion method in vitro. cytotoxicity effect of mastic gum on hep-2 cells was evaluated by conventional haemocytometer using the trypan  blue exclusion method. clinical studies were then performed on 25 periodontally healthy volunteers. the inhibitory effect of chewing mastic gum against mutans streptococci in saliva was compared to a placebo gum. saliva samples were taken from the subjects immediately before and after chewing the mastic gum and the placebo gum for 15 min. additional saliva samples were collected every 30 min. the samples were inoculated onto mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and incubated for 48 h anaerobically at 37 degrees c. the total number of viable bacteria was then counted. results: among tested solvents (chloroform, acetone, petrolium ether and ethanol), it was found that the acetone was found to be more convenient than the others to dissolve the mastic gum. in the cytotoxicity assay, concentrations up to 75 mg/ml of the mastic gum were not toxic for the replication of hep-2 cells. thus, lower concentrations of mastic gum (20 and 50 mg/ml) were used for the experiments. in vitro experiments, the diameters of growth inhibition zones of mastic gum were in the range 9.0-27.0 mm. in the clinical trials, the mean number of bacteria in samples taken after chewing the mastic gum and placebo gum were following; at minute 15 was 112 x 10(4)+/-268 x 10(3) and 175 x 10(4)+/-417 x 10(3)cfu/ml, for minute 45 was 85 x 10(4)+/-219 x 10(3) and 165 x 10(4)+/-329 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 75 was 65 x 10(4)+/-100 x 10(3) and 160 x 10(4)+/-216 x 10(3)cfu/ml, at minute 105 was 60 x 10(4)+/-127 x 10(3) and 150 x 10(4)+/-138 x 10(3)cfu/ml, and at minute 135 was 55 x 10(4)+/-65  x 10(3) and 145 x 10(4)+/-354 x 10(3)cfu/ml, respectively. significantly fewer bacteria was found in saliva samples collected after chewing mastic gum compared  to those after chewing paraffin (p<0.001). conclusions: this preliminary study showed that mastic gum had significant antibacterial activity against s. mutans and mutans streptococci and it may be a useful adjunct in the prevention of caries.

TI  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells by using chitosan-immobilized silica.
AB  == cell adsorption and selective desorption for separation of microbial cells were conducted by using chitosan-immobilized silica (cis). when chitosan was immobilized onto silica surfaces with glutaraldehyde, bacterial cells adsorbed well and retained viability. testing of the adsorption and desorption ability of  cis using various microbes such as escherichia coli, aeromonas hydrophila, pseudomonas aeruginosa, bacillus subtilis, micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, lactobacillus casei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius, saccharomyces cerevisiae, saccharomyces ludwigii, and schizosaccharomyces pombe revealed that most microbes could be adsorbed and selectively desorbed under different conditions. in particular, recovery was improved when l-cysteine was added. a mixture of two bacterial strains adsorbed onto cis could also be successfully separated by use of specific solutions for each strain. most of the desorbed cells were alive. thus, quantitative and selective fractionation of cells is readily achievable by  employing chitosan, a known antibacterial material.

TI  == [comparison of galla chinesis and sodium fluoride on growth and metabolism of bacteria in biofilm model].
AB  == objective: to compare the antibacterial effect between sodium fluoride and galla  chinesis in bioflim model. to evaluate the feasibility of application of gala chinesis in the clinical practice of caries prevention. methods: streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and actinomyces naeslundii had been chosen as the experimental bacteria. in the experiment, biofilmn model was constructed, and two agents were added in the media. after a period of continuous culture, the number of bacteria adhering on the ha disc was  examed, the planktonic ph in the flow cell was recorded continuously, and the morphology of the biofilmn formed on the ha disc was observed by sem. results: (1) galla chinesis could inhibit the growth of the four oral bacteria in the biofilm just as sodium fluoride. (2) galla chinesis and sodium fluoride could prevent the descent of the planktonic ph in the flow cell, but galla chinesis was less efficient than sodium fluoride. (3) the biofilms formed after application of galla chinesis and fluoride, but the bacterial cells had less matrix than those applicated with sucrose. conclusion: galla chinesis is one kind of effective cariostatic natural agents.

TI  == cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius in rats.
AB  == probiotic bacteria such as lactobacilli and bifidobacteria are considered to be non-pathogenic and non-toxigenic on the basis of long years of safe usage. however, some species of lactobacilli are thought to be associated with the development of dental caries. the purpose of the present study was to examine the cariogenicity of the probiotic bacterium lactobacillus salivarius in rats. rats were divided into six groups, and infected with l. salivarius ls1952r and/or streptococcus mutans mt8148r. l. salivarius ls1952r became established in the oral cavity of rats and induced significant level of dental caries even when infected for only 5 days from 18 to 22 days of age. in addition, the caries scores of rats superinfected with both streptococcus mutans mt8148r and l. salivarius ls1952r from 18 days of age were significantly higher than those infected with either l. salivarius ls1952r or s. mutans mt8148r alone. since strain ls1952r can adhere to saliva-coated hydroxyapatites, it is concluded that  l. salivarius strain ls1952r possesses an inherent cariogenic activity following  adherence to the tooth surface.

TI  == oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontal health: species composition and antimicrobial activity.
AB  == background/aims: lactobacilli are known to play an important role in the maintenance of health by stimulating natural immunity and contributing to the balance of microflora. however, their role in chronic periodontitis is unclear. we aimed to identify oral lactobacilli in chronic periodontitis and periodontally healthy subjects, and to determine their antimicrobial activity against putative  oral pathogens. methods: a total of 238 lactobacillus isolates from the saliva and subgingival sites of 20 chronic periodontitis and 15 healthy subjects were collected. in all, 115 strains were identified using rapid amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis. antimicrobial activity against streptococcus mutans, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, porphyromonas gingivalis, and prevotella intermedia was assessed. results: lactobacilli belonging to 10 species were identified. the most prevalent strains in healthy persons were lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus fermentum and in chronic periodontitis patients, lactobacillus plantarum. obligately homofermentatives, particularly l. gasseri, were less prevalent in chronic periodontitis patients compared with healthy subjects (8% vs. 64% for l. gasseri, p < 0.01). sixty-nine percent of tested lactobacilli inhibited s. mutans, 88% a. actinomycetemcomitans, 82% p. gingivalis and 65% p. intermedia. the strongest antimicrobial activity was associated with lactobacillus paracasei, l. plantarum, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and lactobacillus salivarius. the strains from periodontally healthy patients showed a lower antimicrobial activity against s. mutans than the strains from chronic periodontitis patients. conclusion: the composition of oral lactoflora in chronic periodontitis and healthy subjects differs, with a higher prevalence of homofermentative lactobacilli, particularly l. gasseri, in the latter group. both homo- and heterofermentative oral lactobacilli suppress the growth of periodontal pathogens, but the antimicrobial properties are strain, species and origin specific.

TI  == in vitro activity of daptomycin against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == we determined the activity of daptomycin, a recently fda-approved antimicrobial agent, against clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria, including viridans group streptococci (16 streptococcus mitis species group, 12 s. mutans species group, 9 s. anginosus species group, 8 s. sanguinis species group, 5 s. salivarius species group) from patients with infective endocarditis, 32 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, 32 high-level penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 38 vancomycin-resistant enterococci (including 1 linezolid-resistant isolate), and the following unusual gram-positive bacteria: 3 listeria monocytogenes, 4 erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae, 9 corynebacterium species, 10 abiotrophia/granulicatella species, 2 rothia (stomatococcus) mucilaginosus, and 4 gemella morbillorum. daptomycin minimum inhibitory concentration (mic)(90) values for the viridans group streptococci, methicillin-resistant s. aureus, penicillin-resistant s. pneumoniae, and enterococcus species were 0.5, 0.5, < or =0.125, and 4 microg/ml, respectively. the daptomycin mic range for the unusual gram-positive bacteria was < or =0.125-2 microg/ml. we conclude that daptomycin has in vitro activity against viridans group streptococci associated with endocarditis as well as against several types  of unusual gram-positive bacteria that can cause endocarditis.

TI  == differentiation of mutans streptococci by intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry.
AB  == it is difficult to distinguish mutans streptococci on the species level, and even more so on the subspecies level. intact cell matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms) (icm) was applied to reference strains of five of the species of the mutans group (streptococcus criceti, streptococcus downei, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus ratti, streptococcus sobrinus), nonmutans streptococci (streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguinis), and  177 mutans streptococci isolated from saliva of 10 children. from the analysis of the reference strains, readily distinguishable icm mass spectra were obtained for the different species. based on multivariate statistical analysis, a correct and  unambiguous assignment was made of the spectra of 159 isolated mutans streptococci to s. mutans and 16 isolates to s. sobrinus. two isolates were sorted out and were identified by sequencing of their 16s rrna genes as streptococcus anginosus. in addition, icm indicated a misclassification for some  reference strains (aht, v 100 and e 49) and re-classified aht and e 49 as s. ratti and v 100 as s. sobrinus. this was confirmed by 16s rdna sequencing. based  on a statistical similarity analysis of the spectra of reference strains and a quantitative assessment of the reproducibility of icm, the isolates identified as either s. mutans or s. sobrinus were phenotyped on the subspecies level. in the population of the clinical isolates, 14 unambiguously different s. mutans and three different s. sobrinus phenotypes were detected. icm proved to be a powerful tool for a differentiation of mutans streptococci down to the subspecies level.

TI  == first isolation of streptococcus downei from human dental plaques.
AB  == in this study, we isolated four bacterial strains grown on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar. the strains had similar biochemical characteristics to biotypes i or ii of mutans streptococci. the four isolates were identified as streptococcus downei by 16s rdna and dextranase gene (dex) sequencing as well as  polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr-rflp) targeting dex. to our knowledge, this is the first report of the isolation and identification of s. downei from dental plaque in humans. the results suggest that s. downei can inhabit the human oral cavity.

TI  == antibacterial activity of different generation dentin-bonding systems.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this in vitro study was to investigate the antibacterial activities of different generation dentin-bonding systems. method and materials:  the antibacterial activities of dentin-bonding systems optibond fl primer, single bond, clearfil se bond primer, and prompt-l-pop were evaluated against streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei, and lactobacillus acidophilus. cervitec (1% chlorhexidine varnish) was also examined  as a positive control material. disk diffusion tests with filter paper disks (n = 10) containing a drop of each material (20 microl) were used. after incubation at 37 degrees c for 48 hours, the growth inhibition zones were measured in millimeters. results: of all the materials tested, optibond fl primer, clearfil se bond primer, and prompt-lpop showed larger growth inhibition zones than the control material for all bacterial strains. no antibacterial effect was noted for single bond. the results indicated that optibond fl primer had the strongest effect against the s mutans and l casei, and clearfil se bond primer produced the largest inhibition zone for s salivarius and l acidophilus among the test materials. conclusion: the antibacterial effects observed for the tested different generation dentin-bonding systems may be related to the acidic nature of the materials.

TI  == susceptibilities of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to antibacterial peptides, {beta}-defensins and ll37, produced by human epithelial cells.
AB  == objectives: antimicrobial peptides are one of the factors involved in innate immunity. the susceptibility of periodontopathogenic and cariogenic bacteria to the major antimicrobial peptides produced by epithelia was investigated. methods: synthetic antimicrobial peptides of human beta-defensin-1 (hbd1), hbd2, hbd3 and  ll37 (cap18) were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against oral bacteria. they included actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (20 strains), porphyromonas gingivalis (6), prevotella intermedia (7), fusobacterium nucleatum  (7), streptococcus mutans (5), streptococcus sobrinus (5), streptococcus salivarius (5), streptococcus sanguis (4), streptococcus mitis (2) and lactobacillus casei (1). results: although the four peptides had bactericidal activity against all bacteria tested, the degree of antibacterial activity was variable against the different strains and species. the antibacterial activity of hbd1 was lower than that of the other peptides. among the bacteria tested in this study, f. nucleatum was highly susceptible to hbd3 and ll37, and s. mutans was highly susceptible to hbd3. we measured the zeta-potential, representing the net  charge of whole bacteria, to study the relationship between susceptibility to cationic peptide and the net charge of the bacteria. although we found some correlation in a. actinomycetemcomitans strains, we did not find a definite correlation with all the bacterial species. conclusions: these results indicate that beta-defensins and ll37 have versatile antibacterial activity against oral bacteria.

TI  == identification of non-mutans streptococci organisms in dental plaques recovering  on mitis-salivarius bacitracin agar medium.
AB  == the objective of this study was to both isolate and identify non-mutans streptococci organisms (non-mso) from dental plaques recovered on mitis-salivarius sucrose bacitracin agar (msb) plates. the dental plaque samples, which had been collected from 63 human subjects, were diluted and plated on msb.  the bacteria growing on the msb plates were then identified with biochemical tests, as well as with 16s rdna cloning and sequencing techniques. our data indicated that bacteria from 30 subjects had been recovered on the msb plates. among the 21 typical colonies selected from the 30 subjects, 12 colonies, derived from 10 subjects, were identified as non-mso. these 12 colonies were determined to be streptococcus anginosus (8 colonies), s. sanguinis (1 colony), and pantoea  agglomerans (3 colonies). these results strongly suggest that a new selective medium will be required for the reliable isolation of mutans streptococci.

TI  == luxs-based signaling affects streptococcus mutans biofilm formation.
AB  == streptococcus mutans is implicated as a major etiological agent in human dental caries, and one of the important virulence properties of this organism is its ability to form biofilms (dental plaque) on tooth surfaces. we examined the role  of autoinducer-2 (ai-2) on s. mutans biofilm formation by constructing a gs-5 luxs-null mutant. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant in 0.5% sucrose defined medium was found to be markedly attenuated compared to the wild type. scanning electron microscopy also revealed that biofilms of the luxs mutant formed larger  clumps in sucrose medium compared to the parental strain. therefore, the expression of glucosyltransferase genes was examined and the gtfb and gtfc genes, but not the gtfd gene, in the luxs mutant were upregulated in the mid-log growth  phase. furthermore, we developed a novel two-compartment system to monitor ai-2 production by oral streptococci and periodontopathic bacteria. the biofilm defect of the luxs mutant was complemented by strains of s. gordonii, s. sobrinus, and s. anginosus; however, it was not complemented by s. oralis, s. salivarius, or s. sanguinis. biofilm formation by the luxs mutant was also complemented by porphyromonas gingivalis 381 and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 but not  by a p. gingivalis luxs mutant. these results suggest that the regulation of the  glucosyltransferase genes required for sucrose-dependent biofilm formation is regulated by ai-2. furthermore, these results provide further confirmation of previous proposals that quorum sensing via ai-2 may play a significant role in oral biofilm formation.

TI  == identification of clinically relevant viridans streptococci by an oligonucleotide array.
AB  == viridans streptococci (vs) are common etiologic agents of subacute infective endocarditis and are capable of causing a variety of pyogenic infections. many species of vs are difficult to differentiate by phenotypic traits. an oligonucleotide array based on 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer (its) sequences was developed to identify 11 clinically relevant vs. these 11 species were streptococcus anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. oralis, s. parasanguinis, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, and s. uberis. the method consisted of pcr amplification of the its regions by using  a pair of universal primers, followed by hybridization of the digoxigenin-labeled pcr products to a panel of species-specific oligonucleotides immobilized on a nylon membrane. after 120 strains of the 11 species of vg and 91 strains of other bacteria were tested, the sensitivity and specificity of the oligonucleotide array were found to be 100% (120 of 120 strains) and 95.6% (87 of 91 strains), respectively. s. pneumoniae cross-hybridized to the probes used for the identification of s. mitis, and simple biochemical tests such as optochin susceptibility or bile solubility should be used to differentiate s. pneumoniae from s. mitis. in conclusion, identification of species of vs by use of the present oligonucleotide array is accurate and could be used as an alternative reliable method for species identification of strains of vs.

AB  == the relationship between microflora, eruption status and caries status in the first permanent molar of young children was investigated in 177 children aged 6-7 years. a significantly greater proportion of fully erupted teeth were classified  as sound and plaque-free compared to partially erupted teeth. fully erupted teeth yielded greater numbers and proportions of mutans streptococci compared with significantly greater numbers and proportions of actinomyces israelii in partially erupted teeth. logistical regression analysis showed significant associations between white spot lesions in partially erupted teeth and increased  numbers of streptococcus oralis, mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius whereas the presence of actinomyces naeslundii was associated with health. significantly greater numbers and proportions of s. oralis and s. salivarius were isolated from partially erupted teeth with white spot lesions whereas streptococcus mutans was isolated in significantly greater numbers and proportions from fully erupted molars with white spots. this study suggests that  organisms other than mutans streptococci are associated with caries development in erupting permanent molar teeth.

AB  == hydrolytic degradation by-products associated with the constitutive monomers 2,2-bis [4-(2-hydroxy-3-methacryloxypropoxy) phenyl] propane (bis-gma), bisphenol a polyethylene glycol diether dimethacrylate (bis-ema), and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate (tedgma) used in dental restorative composites include bis-hydroxy-propoxyphenyl propane (bis-hppp), ethoxylated bisphenol a (e-bispa),  methacrylic acid (ma), and triethylene glycol (teg). these products are generated from the interaction of human salivary esterases with the composites. recent findings have indicated that tegdma has the ability to modulate oral bacteria but it is unclear which components of tegdma are related to the observed effects. the objective of the current study was to investigate the influence of tegdma derived degradation products ma and teg on the growth of three strains of oral bacteria:  s. mutans strains ng8 and jh1005, and s. salivarius at2. bacterial growth rates were measured at 37 degrees c, and ph values of 5.5 (representative of cariogenic state) or 7.0 at concentrations of 0-50mmol/l for ma (sigma, us) and 0-100mmol/l  for teg (sigma, us). it was found that at ph 5.5 teg significantly stimulated the growth of both s. mutans strains ( p<0.05 ) in the concentration range of 0.5-10.0mmol/l and stimulated the growth of s. salivarius at2 for the entire concentration range tested (p<0.05). teg (above 50mmol/1) did not significantly affect the doubling times of s. salivarius at ph of 7.0 and it inhibited the growth of both s. mutans strains above 50mmol/l at the same ph value. at ph 5.5 ma inhibited the growth of all three strains with increasing concentration. at neutral ph, the growth of s. mutans ng8 strain was significantly reduced by ma (  p<0.05 ) above 10mmol/l. in summary, these results indicate that teg and ma modulate the growth rate of important oral bacteria in a concentration and ph dependent manner.

TI  == antibacterial activity of silver inorganic agent yda filler.
AB  == yda filler is an antibacterial agent that is currently in commercial dental use.  in this study, we attempted to determine whether it exerts an antibacterial effect on human saliva bacteria, and to determine whether it can be used in dental materials. cfus in 1 ml stimulated human saliva were examined using blood  agar and mitis salivarius agar after immersion, with or without yda filler. the antibacterial effect was compared with that of ketac-silver. dental materials containing 5% wt yda filler were prepared for in vitro testing on s. mutans and a. viscosus. furthermore, we examined the in vitro cytotoxicity of experimental mma resin containing yda filler on hela cells. human saliva bacteria and mutans streptococci showed reduced viability following exposure to yda filler after 12 h. the concentration of silver ions released by yda filler was below 1 ppm after  12 h. two tested strains showed reduced viability following exposure to dental materials containing yda filler. in another experiment, mma resin containing yda  filler did not show cytotoxicity on hela cells after 24- and 48-h exposure. thus, yda filler may help in the development of antibacterial dental materials, such as composite resin, glass-ionomer or temporary cement.

TI  == isopanduratin a from kaempferia pandurata as an active antibacterial agent against cariogenic streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an antibacterial compound active against streptococcus mutans was isolated from kaempferia pandurata and identified as isopanduratin a using 1h nmr, 13c nmr and  ei-ms. the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of isopanduratin a was 4 mg/l which was much lower than that of some other natural anticariogenic agents such as sanguinarine (12 mg/l), green tea extract and carvacrol (125 mg/l), thymol (250 mg/l) and isoeugenol and eucalyptol (500 mg/l). the bactericidal test showed that isopanduratin a completely inactivated s. mutans at 20 mg/l in 1 min. significant inhibitory activity of isopanduratin a was also observed against s. sobrinus, s. sanguinis and s. salivarius with an mic of 4 mg/l. damage to the cell membrane and cell wall of s. mutans by isopanduratin a was shown using transmission electron microscopy (tem). these results suggest that isopanduratin  a could be employed as a potential antibacterial agent for preventing dental caries.

TI  == modifications of hydrophobicity, in vitro adherence and cellular aggregation of streptococcus mutans by helichrysum italicum extract.
AB  == aims: the purpose of the present study was to examine whether sublethal concentrations of helichrysum italicum extract could affect some of the cariogenic properties of streptococcus mutans. methods and results: we studied the antibacterial activity of h. italicum (ethanolic extract) against oral streptococci (strep. mutans atcc 35668, strep. salivarius atcc 13419 and strep. sanguis atcc 10556) and its influence on cell-surface hydrophobicity, in vitro sucrose-dependent adherence to glass surface and cellular aggregation of strep. mutans. the results indicate that all streptococci were susceptible to ethanolic  extract with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 31.25-62.50 microg  x ml(-1). sub-mic concentrations of h. italicum (7.81-31.25 microg x ml(-1)) reduced the hydrophobicity and the adherence (almost 90%) to glass surface of strep. mutans. the aggregation in the presence of dextran t2000 was also affected. conclusion: the inhibitory activity of h. italicum extract on strep. mutans is worthy of further study. significance and impact of the study: there is considerable interest in the use of natural compounds as alternative methods to control undesirable micro-organisms.

TI  == pcr detection and identification of oral streptococci in saliva samples using gtf genes.
AB  == oral streptococci are major constituents of dental plaque, and their prevalence is implicated in various pathologies. therefore, accurate identification of oral  streptococci would be valuable for studies of cariogenic plaque and for diagnostic use in infective endocarditis. many oral streptococci possess glucosyltransferase enzymes that synthesize glucan, which is an obligate component of dental plaque. we established a rapid and precise method to identify oral streptococci by pcr using the species-specific region from the glucosyltransferase gene. with the species-specific primers, streptococcus mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguinis, s. oralis, and s. gordonii could be successfully distinguished. further, we developed a simple method to extract the bacterial dna from saliva. using the resultant dna as a template, the proposed pcr detection was performed. their distribution was in accord with results of conventional biochemical tests. these findings indicate that the present pcr method is useful for the analysis of oral streptococci and can be successfully used in clinical applications to identify pathogenic bacteria associated with oral infectious disease and/or endocarditis.

TI  == physiologic actions of zinc related to inhibition of acid and alkali production by oral streptococci in suspensions and biofilms.
AB  == zinc is a known inhibitor of acid production by mutans streptococci. our primary  objective was to extend current knowledge of the physiologic bases for this inhibition and also for zinc inhibition of alkali production by streptococcus rattus fa-1 and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419. zinc at concentrations as low as 0.01-0.1 mm not only inhibited acid production by cells of streptococcus mutans gs-5 in suspensions or in biofilms but also sensitized glycolysis by intact cells to acidification. zinc reversibly inhibited the f-atpase of permeabilized cells of s. mutans with a 50% inhibitory concentration of about 1 mm for cells in suspensions. zinc reversibly inhibited the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system with 50% inhibition at about 0.3 mm znso4, or about half that concentration when the zinc-citrate chelate was used. the reversibility of these inhibitory actions of zinc correlates with findings that it is mainly bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal. zinc inhibited alkali production from arginine or urea and was a potent enzyme inhibitor for arginine deiminase of s. rattus fa-1 and for urease of s. salivarius. in addition, zinc citrate at high levels of 10-20 mm was weakly bactericidal.

TI  == susceptibility of oral bacteria to an antimicrobial decapeptide.
AB  == naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides have emerged as alternative classes of antimicrobials. in general, these antimicrobial peptides exhibit selectivity for  prokaryotes and minimize the problems of engendering microbial resistance. as an  alternative method to search for more effective broad-spectrum peptide antimicrobials, investigators have developed peptide libraries by using synthetic combinatorial technology. a novel decapeptide, kkvvfkvkfk (ksl), has been identified that shows a broad range of antibacterial activity. the purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of this antimicrobial peptide in killing selected strains of oral pathogens and resident saliva bacteria collected from human subjects. cytotoxic activity of ksl against mammalian cells and the structural features of this decapeptide were also investigated, the latter by using two-dimensional nmr in aqueous and dmso solutions. mics of ksl for the majority of oral bacteria tested in vitro ranged from 3 to 100 microg ml(-1). minimal bactericidal concentrations of ksl were, in general, within one to two dilutions of the mics. ksl exhibited an ed(99) (the dose at which 99 % killing was observed after 15 min at 37 degrees c) of 6.25 microg ml(-1) against selected strains of lactobacillus salivarius, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus gordonii and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. in addition, ksl damaged bacterial cell membranes and caused 1.05 log units reduction of viability counts of saliva bacteria. in vitro toxicity studies showed that ksl, at concentrations up to 1 mg ml(-1), did not induce cell death or compromise the membrane integrity of human gingival fibroblasts. nmr studies suggest that ksl adopts an alpha-helical structure in dmso solution, which mimics the polar aprotic membrane environment,  whereas it remains unstructured in aqueous medium. this study shows that ksl may  be a useful antimicrobial agent for inhibiting the growth of oral bacteria that are associated with caries development and early plaque formation.

TI  == the acid-tolerant microbiota associated with plaque from initial caries and healthy tooth surfaces.
AB  == the intent of this study was to compare the inherent acid tolerance of bacteria in samples of dental plaque from tooth sites in subjects with and without initial caries. plaque was collected from approximal surfaces showing early enamel caries and from healthy tooth surfaces in the same subjects, as well as from enamel surfaces of caries-free individuals. in addition to plating on blood agar, the plaque samples were plated directly on non-selective solid agar medium buffered to ph 7.0, 6.0, 5.5, 5.0, 4.5 and 4.0 to avoid any loss of adaptation to acid during primary isolation of plaque bacteria. the results showed that approximately 50% of the total cultivable plaque microbiota from caries, as well  as healthy tooth sites, was able to grow at ph 5.5 and 1% at ph 5.0, ph values regarded as critical for the demineralization of tooth enamel. at ph 5.0, members of the genus streptococcus were the dominant group, but mutans streptococci accounted for less than half of the streptococcal viable count. the other acid-tolerant streptococcal isolates included streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordinii, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius and sstreptococcus sanguis. analysis of the results indicated that the mutans streptococci in dental plaque were highly variable with respect to acid tolerance, and that both caries and healthy sites harboured significant numbers of mutans streptococci that were not acid-tolerant.

TI  == [effects of topical application of immunoglobulin yolk on mutans streptococci in  dental plaque].
AB  == objective: to evaluate the inhibitory effects of topical application of specific  immunoglobulin yolk antibodies (igy) to mutans streptococci on composition of human dental plaque. methods: a total of 24 healthy adult volunteers were selected and randomly distributed into three experimental groups. after a supragingival scaling, the subjects were treated with an application of igy containing spray (test group, n = 9), a 0.15% chlorhexidine(ch) spray(positive control group, n = 9) or a placebo phosphate buffered saline(pbs) spray without any active ingredients(negative control group, n = 6) three times daily for three weeks. pooled plaque samples from the smooth surfaces of teeth were collected for microbiologic analysis before administration (baseline, day 0), during treatment(days 7, 14 and 21) and after withdrawal of the agents(days 28, 42 and 56) and plaque index were recorded. microbial cultivation were performed by serially diluting the samples with pbs solution an cultivating the aliquots on mitis salivarius agar(ms) and ms supplemented with bacitracin (msb) for oral streptococci and mutans streptococci respectively. the number of colony-forming unit (cfu) per plate was counted and the percentage of mutans streptococci per oral streptococci in dental plaque were determined. the effect of igy on colonization of mutans streptococci were analyzed by an analysis of variance (anova). results: the plaque indexes remained unchanged, but mutans streptococci  in dental plaque was suppressed significantly following a short term(three weeks) application of igy, and low level of mutans streptococci persisted for at least 5 weeks after withdrawal of igy. conclusion: the results suggest that the immunization with specific immunoglobulin yolk against mutans streptococci could  be useful for long term suppression of mutans streptococci colonization in human  dental plaque.

TI  == identification of mutans streptococci by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes.
AB  == mutans streptococci are frequently isolated from dental plaque and carious lesions. these bacteria have been identified by conventional methods such as biochemical and serologic tests followed by the isolation of colonies on the mitis-salivarius agar, which are sometimes inconsistent. recently, species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) has been reported to rapidly identify streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. however, in the case of identification and classification into several species, e.g. within the group of  mutans streptococci consisting of seven species, the identification using species-specific pcr seems somewhat inefficient because of need for the development and preparation of specific primers for each species. therefore, in this study we developed a simple method using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of pcr-amplified 16s ribosomal rna genes (16s rrna genes pcr-rflp) for the identification of seven different species included in the group of mutans streptococci. we amplified 16s rrna gene sequences from genomic dna samples by pcr using universal primers and digested the pcr products with the restriction endonucleases, hpaii and haeiii. hpaii produced six rflp patterns for eight reference strains, since the patterns for s. sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus ferus were similar. rflp patterns produced with haeiii could separate these three species. furthermore, the rflp patterns predicted from the 16s rrna gene sequences in the genbank database agreed with the actual rflp patterns produced in the present study. the 16s rrna sequence comparisons can be  used to identify oral mutans streptococci; however, the identification by sequencing is sometimes difficult in large-scale studies and for small laboratories. therefore, 16s rrna genes pcr-rflp, using hpaii and haeiii, could be an alternative method for the identification of mutans streptococci, and may be applicable for large-scale studies on the cariogenicity of mutans streptococci.

TI  == bacterial replacement therapy: adapting 'germ warfare' to infection prevention.
AB  == the individual bacterial members of our indigeneous microbiota are actively engaged in an on-going battle to prevent colonisation and overgrowth of their terrain by competing microbes, some of which might have pathogenic potential for  the host. humans have long attempted to intervene in these bacterial interactions. ingestion of probiotic bacteria, particularly lactobacilli, is commonly practiced to promote well-balanced intestinal microflora. as bacterial resistance to antimicrobials has increased, so too has research into colonisation of human tissues with specific effector strains capable of out-competing known bacterial pathogens. recent progress is particularly evident in the application of avirulent streptococcus mutans to the control of dental caries, alpha hemolytic streptococci to reduction of otitis media recurrences and streptococcus salivarius to streptococcal pharyngitis prevention.

TI  == invasion and killing of human endothelial cells by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == colonization of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci can result in infective endocarditis and possibly atherosclerosis; however, the mechanisms of pathogenesis are poorly understood. we investigated the ability of  selected oral streptococci to infect monolayers of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (huvec) in 50% human plasma and to produce cytotoxicity. planktonic streptococcus gordonii ch1 killed huvec over a 5-h period by peroxidogenesis (alpha-hemolysin) and by acidogenesis but not by production of protein exotoxins. huvec were protected fully by addition of supplemental buffers and bovine liver catalase to the culture medium. streptococci were also found to  invade huvec by an endocytic mechanism that was dependent on polymerization of actin microfilaments and on a functional cytoskeleton, as indicated by inhibition with cytochalasin d and nocodazole. electron microscopy revealed streptococci attached to huvec surfaces via numerous fibrillar structures and bacteria in membrane-encased cytoplasmic vacuoles. following invasion by s. gordonii ch1, huvec monolayers showed 63% cell lysis over 4 h, releasing 64% of the total intracellular bacteria into the culture medium; however, the bacteria did not multiply during this time. the ability to invade huvec was exhibited by selected  strains of s. gordonii, s. sanguis, s. mutans, s. mitis, and s. oralis but only weakly by s. salivarius. comparison of isogenic pairs of s. gordonii revealed a requirement for several surface proteins for maximum host cell invasion: glucosyltransferase, the sialic acid-binding protein hsa, and the hydrophobicity/coaggregation proteins csha and cshb. deletion of genes for the antigen i/ii adhesins, sspa and sspb, did not affect invasion. we hypothesize that peroxidogenesis and invasion of the cardiovascular endothelium by viridans group streptococci are integral events in the pathogenesis of infective endocarditis and atherosclerosis.

AB  == the aim of this study was to assess levels of oral bacteria and their correlations in paired samples of saliva and subgingival plaque in a population of adult sudanese. whole saliva and pooled subgingival plaque samples from six probing sites of one tooth in each jaw were obtained from 56 sudanese adults (mean age 35.2+/-8.9 years). levels of 24 oral bacteria in the autologous saliva  and pooled plaque sample of each subject were assessed by dna probes and checkerboard dna-dna hybridization. there were significantly ( p< or =0.01) higher percentages of subjects with > or =10(5) bacterial cells of prevotella intermedia, campylobacter rectus, veillonella parvula, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus acidophilus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus salivarius, and leptotrichia buccalis and significantly ( p< or =0.01) lower percentages with treponema denticola in saliva than in subgingival plaque. the detection frequencies at > or =10(6) bacterial cells were significantly higher for selenomonas sputigena, s. anginosus, streptococcus sanguis, and s. salivarius and significantly lower for porphyromonas gingivalis in saliva than in subgingival plaque ( p< or =0.01). porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, s. sputigena, s. sanguis, and streptococcus mitis demonstrated significant ( p< or =0.05) positive correlations between their levels in plaque and saliva. this study indicates that the levels of p. gingivalis, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, s.  sanguis, and s. mitis correlate significantly in saliva and subgingival plaque and that higher accuracy of detection and assessment of the levels of these bacteria in the oral cavity may be achieved by concurrent sampling of saliva and  subgingival plaque.

AB  == the full-length sequences of the groesl genes (also known as cpn10/60) of streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus gordonii, and  streptococcus sanguis and the near full-length sequence of the groesl genes of streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus oralis, and streptococcus salivarius were determined. the lengths of the groes genes from the 10 species listed above ranged from 282 to 288 bp, and the full-length sequences of groel determined for  4 species (s. anginosus, s. constellatus, s. gordonii, and s. sanguis) revealed that each was 1,623 bp. the intergenic region (spacer) between the groes and groel genes varies in size (15 to 111 bp) and sequence between species. the variation of the groes sequences among the species tested was greater (62.1 to 95.1% nucleotide sequence identities) than that of the groel sequences (77.2 to 95.2% nucleotide sequence identities). phylogenetic analysis of the groes and groel genes yielded evolutionary trees similar to the tree constructed by use of  the 16s rrna gene. the intraspecies variation of the spacer was minimal for clinical isolates of some species. the groesl sequence data provide an additional parameter for identification of viridans group streptococcal species.

TI  == [evaluation of surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry].
AB  == surface disinfection is a procedure carried out on the external parts of the dental equipment as well as on other items of the dental office. the aim of this  study was to analyze the efficacy of 4 surface disinfectants utilized in dentistry: 77 degrees gl alcohol, phenolic compound (duplofen), iodophor (pvp-i)  and 77 degrees gl alcohol with 5% of chlorhexidine. four surfaces of the equipment were analyzed in the study (the carter, the washbasin for hand-washing, the headrest of the chair and the external surface of the reflector), and the spray-wipe-spray procedure was carried out. from each surface, samples were collected by means of surface plates containing mitis salivarius bacitracin sucrose agar, sabouraud dextrose agar with chloramphenicol, macconkey agar and blood agar, for counting mutans streptococci, candida yeasts, gram-negative bacteria and total microorganisms, respectively (ufc/plate). the results were statistically analyzed by means of the student's t test in order to compare the mean ufc/plate values. the most effective disinfectant was 77 degrees gl alcohol  with 5% of chlorhexidine, mainly against gram-positive bacteria. iodophor and phenolic compound were also effective in microbial reduction. 77 degrees gl alcohol was the least effective product - however, although it is not considered  as a surface disinfectant, it produced, in this study, statistically significant  microbial reduction after the disinfecting procedure.

TI  == intracellular and extracellular phs of streptococcus mutans after addition of acids: loading and efflux of a fluorescent ph indicator in streptococcal cells.
AB  == a ph-sensitive fluorescent dye, 2', 7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5 and 6-carboxyfluorescein (bcecf), was used to determine intracellular ph (ph(in)). the efflux of bcecf loaded into oral streptococcal cells was determined after incubation of the cells at 35 degrees c for 20 min in the presence and absence of glucose. in the absence of glucose, the fluorescence of intracellular bcecf in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sobrinus decreased only very slightly, indicating that the dye could be useful for ph(in) determination. in the presence of glucose, however, the fluorescence decreased by 57%. thus, the ph(in) of s. mutans cells was measured by the bcecf method in the absence of glucose at various acidic ph levels by adding lactic, acetic and hydrochloric acids to the cell suspensions. the ph(in) was almost equal to the extracellular ph (ph(out)) for ph(out) values  of between 8 and 5, indicating that protons permeated easily across the s. mutans cell membrane. for ph(out) between 5 and 4, ph(in) was constant at around 5, suggesting that the cell membrane was impermeable to protons, or that a cytoplasmic buffering system functioned. ph(in) decreased at ph(out) values of <  4. the constant ph(in) at acidic ph(out) levels could protect intracellular components, such as proteins, against acidification by sugar fermentation.

TI  == susceptibility of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus to cell wall inhibitors and development of a novel selective medium for s. sobrinus.
AB  == representative strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus showed  differences in susceptibility to members of the monobactam group of beta-lactam antibiotics: s. sobrinus was less sensitive than s. mutans. the minimum inhibitory concentrations of aztreonam (azt) and carumonam, both of which belong  to this group, were 2,000 microg/ml for s. sobrinus and 125 microg/ml for s. mutans. further addition of fosfomycin, bacitracin and sodium chloride to mitis salivarius agar (ms) supplemented with azt resulted in growth inhibition of s. mutans and oral streptococci other than s. sobrinus, and was therefore used as a  selective medium for s. sobrinus (ms-sob medium). the average growth recovery of  laboratory and clinically isolated strains of s. sobrinus on ms-sob medium was 74.1% compared to that on ms medium. seventy-eight percent of clinical samples in which s. sobrinus was detected yielded pure growth of s. sobrinus on ms-sob medium.

TI  == salivary microbiota levels in relation to periodontal status, experience of caries and miswak use in sudanese adults.
AB  == objectives: the purpose of the present investigation was to assess the salivary levels of 25 oral bacteria in relation to periodontal status and experience of caries, and to compare the levels of these bacteria between habitual miswak and toothbrush users in adult sudanese subjects. material and methods: the study subjects consisted of 56 individuals with age range 19-53 years (mean 35.2 years) and included 30 miswak and 26 toothbrush users. the periodontal status and presence of dental caries were assessed clinically. whole saliva was collected from all subjects, and the levels of 25 selected bacterial species in saliva were assessed by the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method using whole genomic dna probes. results: a high percentage of the subjects had detectable levels (> or =  105 bacterial cells) of several bacterial species in saliva. between 12% and 16%  of the subjects showed high (> or = 106 cells) salivary levels of the periodontitis-associated bacteria a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, p. intermedia, c. rectus and e. corrodens, whereas only two (3.6%) and four (7.1%) subjects had high levels of p. gingivalis and f. nucleatum, respectively. there were no significant differences in the levels of all or most bacterial species by age group, gender or periodontal status. presence of > or = 105 l. acidophilus bacterial cells in saliva was associated with high caries scores (p = 0.02). there were significantly higher levels of a. actinomycetemcomitans, p. melaninogenica, c. rectus, p. micros, v. parvula, s. mutans, s. anginosus, a. israelii, c. sputigena, and c. gingivalis, and significantly lower levels of p. intermedia, f. nucleatum, s. sputigena, e. corrodens, l. acidophilus, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. oralis, and s. mitis in the miswak than in the toothbrush group. conclusions: : the findings suggest that miswak may have a selective inhibitory effect on the level of certain bacteria in saliva, particularly several oral streptococci species. this is the first report that the checkerboard dna-dna hybridization method can be useful for assessing the levels of a wide range of bacterial taxa in saliva.

TI  == comparison of five selective media for the growth and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == background: although a few growth media are available for selective isolation of  the cariogenic bacteria, streptococcus mutans (s. mutans), it is still unclear as to which is the most efficacious. this study compared the selectivity and sensitivity of five different media for growing a laboratory strain of s. mutans  (nctc 10449), and for enumerating s. mutans from teeth of a group of young children, aged 2-10 years. methods: the media tested in this study were mitis salivarius with bacitracin (msb), mitis salivariuskanamycin-bacitracin (mskb), glucose-sucrose-tellurite-bacitracin (gstb), trypticase soy-sucrose-bacitracin (tys20b) and tryptone-yeast-cysteine-sucrose-bacitracin (tycsb) agars. these were prepared according to the respective manufacturer's instructions. results: the results showed that at concentrations of bacteria 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(10)/ml, the recovery of the laboratory s. mutans strain was highest in tycsb agar, followed by in descending order by tys20b, msb, gstb, and mskb (p<0.01). similar results were obtained using dental plaque samples collected from swabs of the teeth of a  group of children. in the clinical samples, tycsb again showed the highest recovery rates of s. mutans compared to the other four media. results were reproduced at dilutions of the samples at 1:20 x 10(6) to 1:2 x 10(6), and s. mutans concentrations of 1.6 to 7.7 log 10 cfu/ml. in addition, there were highest ratios of mutans to non-mutans bacteria in tycsb compared to the other media, suggesting high selectivity of this media for mutans species. conclusion:  the results of our study suggest that tycsb is the most sensitive and selective media for culture of s. mutans for laboratory and clinical studies.

TI  == an essential amino acid residue for catalytic activity of the dextranase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == dextranase (dex) is an enzyme that hydrolyzes glucan, a polymer of glucose synthesized from sucrose by glucosyltransferases (gtfs). by comparing amino acid  sequences of dexs and gtfs, we found that the dex enzymes of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus downei and streptococcus salivarius had similar amino acid sequences to those of the catalytic sites of gtfs of mutans streptococci. we therefore examined the amino acid essential in dex catalysis by molecular genetic approaches in this study. site-directed mutagenesis was used to convert the asp-385 of the dex molecule of s. mutans ingbritt to glu, asn, thr or val. replacement of asp-385 with any of the amino acids resulted in complete disappearance of dex activity. however, replacement of other asp residues did not affect the enzyme activity. the inactive enzymes still retained dextran-binding ability. these results suggest that asp-385 of the dex of s. mutans ingbritt was essential for enzyme activity and the catalytic and substrate-binding sites were located at different sites within the dex molecule.

TI  == a clinical, microbiologic, and radiographic study of deep caries lesions after incomplete caries removal.
AB  == objective: clinical, radiographic, and microbiologic changes in deep caries lesions were assessed after incomplete carious dentin removal and tooth sealing.  method and materials: thirty-two teeth with deep caries lesions were studied. treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the demineralized dentin, application of calcium hydroxide, and sealing for a 6- to 7-month period. the color and consistency of the dentin were clinically assessed. differences in radiographic density were assessed by digital image subtraction. microbiologic samples were obtained from the demineralized dentin before the temporary sealing  and after the experimental period. the samples were cultivated on blood agar under aerobic and anaerobic conditions, in mitis salivarius agar, and rogosa selective lactobacillus agar. results: two cases were lost during the study; one  presented pulpal necrosis. in the other case, there was pulpal exposure during removal of provisional sealing. in all teeth, the initial demineralized dentin was soft and wet; one lesion was yellow, 21 were light brown, and eight were dark brown. after treatment, the dentin was dry, and 80.00% of specimens were hard, 16.67% were leathery, and 3.33% remained soft. the dentin was light brown in five teeth and dark brown in 25. there was a statistically significant mean difference in radiographic density (pixel intensity), 88.77 +/- 7.02 in the control areas and 94.66 +/- 6.75 in the test areas. the counts of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria, lactobacilli, and streptococci mutans had decreased significantly by the end of treatment. conclusion: incomplete removal of carious dentin and subsequent tooth sealing resulted in the arrest of the lesions, suggesting that complete dentinal caries lesion removal is not essential to the control of caries lesions.

TI  == molecular analysis of bacterial species associated with childhood caries.
AB  == although substantial epidemiologic evidence links streptococcus mutans to caries, the pathobiology of caries may involve more complex communities of bacterial species. molecular methods for bacterial identification and enumeration now make  it possible to more precisely study the microbiota associated with dental caries. the purpose of this study was to compare the bacteria found in early childhood caries (ecc) to those found in caries-free children by using molecular identification methods. cloning and sequencing of bacterial 16s ribosomal dnas from a healthy subject and a subject with ecc were used for identification of novel species or uncultivated phylotypes and species not previously associated with dental caries. ten novel phylotypes were identified. a number of species or  phylotypes that may play a role in health or disease were identified and warrant  further investigation. in addition, quantitative measurements for 23 previously known bacterial species or species groups were obtained by a reverse capture checkerboard assay for 30 subjects with caries and 30 healthy controls. significant differences were observed for nine species: s. sanguinis was associated with health and, in order of decreasing cell numbers, actinomyces gerencseriae, bifidobacterium, s. mutans, veillonella, s. salivarius, s. constellatus, s. parasanguinis, and lactobacillus fermentum were associated with  caries. these data suggest that a. gerencseriae and other actinomyces species may play an important role in caries initiation and that a novel bifidobacterium may  be a major pathogen in deep caries. further investigation could lead to the identification of targets for biological interventions in the caries process and  thereby contribute to improved prevention of and treatment for this significant public health problem.

TI  == inhibitory effect of zncl(2) on glycolysis in human oral microbes.
AB  == although the inhibition of bacterial glycolysis by zinc ions might be expected to moderate dental caries, there has not been a comparison of the effect of zn on different organisms under both fixed ph and free-fall conditions. here, the effect of zncl(2) on streptococcus salivarius, strep. mutans, strep. sobrinus, actinomyces naeslundii and lactobacillus casei, as well as on mixtures of oral organisms outgrown from human dental plaque and saliva, was surveyed. ph-stat experiments were performed at ph 7, 6 or 5 in a solution containing 5% glucose and a suspension of the test organism; ph-fall experiments started at ph 7. in both cases, acid production was monitored for 60 min, when samples were taken for zn and lactate determinations. under ph-stat conditions, acid production was inhibited by zn most strongly in strep. sobrinus and strep. salivarius. in terms  of total acid production averted, however, the effect of zn under both ph-stat and ph-fall conditions was clearly greatest with strep. salivarius. a. naeslundii was inhibited the least strongly under ph-stat conditions. cultured oral organism mixtures were more sensitive to moderate concentrations of zinc (0.2-0.3mm initial concentration) than were the single species to higher concentrations (1mm). packed cell layers responded to zn quite differently from suspensions, the ph often falling in the presence of 1mm zn at a rate similar to the no zn control. as streptococci had the highest acidogenesis rates in both ph-stat and ph-fall experiments, it seems likely that inhibition of acid production with these organisms would be of more value in moderating caries than the inhibition of less acidogenic organisms such as a. naeslundii.

TI  == vaccination with fima from streptococcus parasanguis protects rats from endocarditis caused by other viridans streptococci.

TI  == [typing of streptococcus mutans (serotype c) by arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: to study the relationship between genetic diversity within streptococcus mutans (c), and dental caries. methods: one reference strain (gs5)  was used to establish the suitability of primers and the initial ap-pcr conditions. isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were obtained from 19 caries-free and 40 caries-active patients, and were originally isolated on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. totally 278 isolates were biochemically and serologically confirmed as streptococcus mutans (c). chromosomal dna was extracted from those isolates by chelex. one random primer, opa-05 was used as a  template in pcr reaction. all amplification reactions were conducted in a volume  of 20 microliters containing 2 microliters of 10 x reaction buffer, 200 mumol/l each of datp, dctp, dgtp and dttp and 2.5 units of taq dna polymerase. we varied  the concentrations of mgcl2 (1.5-4.5 mmol/l), template dna (2-40 ng), and primer  (0.3-0.5 mumol/l) to determine the optical conditions for ap-pcr. the temperature profile in a thermocycler was 35 cycles as follows: 94 degrees c for 1 min, at 36 degrees c for 2 min, at 72 degrees c for 2 min. the initial denaturation was at 94 degrees c for 5 min and the final extension at 72 degrees c for 5 min. results: the mgcl2 concentration in 4 mmol/l and the primer concentration in 0.5  mumol/l produced clearly distinct and reproducible fingerprints. we found 105 different patterns among the 278 isolates. in high-caries persons more than one genotype isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) were colonized. conclusions: isolates of streptococcus mutans (c) exist apparent genetic diversity. the genotypes of isolates might relate to differences in caries susceptibility.

AB  == secondary caries are a worldwide public and socioeconomic problem. the placement  of restorations can lead to the development of environmental conditions favorable to microbial colonization, especially on the tooth/restoration interface, which is a predisposing factor for secondary caries. the aim of this study was to evaluate microbial retention on conventional (chelon-fil and vidrion r) and resin-modified (vitremer and fuji ii lc) glass-ionomer cements, in situ, using a  hybrid composite resin (z100) as a control. twelve volunteers wore hawley appliances with specimens made of all tested filling materials for 7 days. the specimens were then removed from the appliances and transferred to tubes containing 2.0 ml of ringer-pras. microorganisms from the samples were inoculated onto blood agar and mitis salivarius bacitracin agar and incubated under anaerobiosis (90% n2, 10% co2), at 37 degrees c, for 10 and 2 days, respectively. the resin-modified glass-ionomer cements and the composite resin retained the same levels of microorganisms on their surfaces. the resin-modified glass-ionomers retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin and conventional glass-ionomer cements. the conventional glass-ionomer cements retained less mutans streptococci than the composite resin, but that difference was not statistically significant.

AB  == a surface protein antigen (pac) of streptococcus mutans, particularly the a-region of the molecule, has been reported to interact with salivary components  on the tooth surface. it might be a candidate antigen inducing the production of  antibodies against the adherence of s. mutans to the tooth surface. we investigated the effects of monoclonal antibodies (moabs) obtained by immunization of synthetic pac peptides that completely correspond to the amino acid sequence of part of the a-region. these moabs recognize several core b-cell  epitopes in the sequence. two (kh5 and sh2) of these antibodies reacted with both s. mutans and streptococcus sobrinus, but not with streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, porphyromonas gingivalis or lactobacillus casei. they clearly inhibited the real-time adherence of s. mutans to salivary components in  a biosensor. kh5, which showed a real-time inhibition (71%), also significantly prevented the recolonization of s. mutans on the tooth surface in rats. these results suggested that the core b-cell epitope (-y---l--y----) recognized by kh5  was the essential sequence in the antigenic epitopes of pac protein recognized specifically by the inhibitory antibody. therefore, the amino acid residues were  found to be important in the initial attachment of s. mutans to the tooth surface. these results provide for the mechanism of pac molecule in the initial attachment of s. mutans on the tooth surface and more effective designs for the removal of s. mutans and s. sobrinus from the oral cavity.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on mother-child transmission of mutans  streptococci: 6-year follow-up.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a noncariogenic or even cariostatic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) which shed easily into saliva from plaque. we have earlier shown that habitual xylitol  consumption of mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction  in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at 2 years of age. the aim of the present study was to assess the children's ms counts 1 and 4 years after the maternal xylitol consumption had been discontinued. at baseline, during pregnancy, all mothers (n = 195) showed high salivary levels of ms. the mothers were randomly assigned to xylitol, fluoride (f) and chlorhexidine (chx) groups. in the xylitol group, the mothers chewed xylitol-sweetened gum, for 21 months, starting 3 months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received chx or f varnish treatments at 6, 12 and 18 months after delivery. at the 2-year  examination, 169 mother-child pairs participated. at the 3-year and 6-year examinations, there were 159 and 147 children in the study, respectively. for children's ms analyses, visible plaque was collected using toothpicks at the age  of 3 and paraffin-stimulated saliva at the age of 6. the persons involved in the  collection and analysis of the microbiological samples were blinded as to the study design and group. both the plaque and salivary ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. in all groups, the colonization percentages increased during the follow-up. at the 3-year examination, the children's risk of having ms colonization was 2.3-fold in the f group (95% ci 1.3-4.2) compared to the xylitol group. this difference was statistically significant. even at 6 years of age, the salivary ms levels were significantly lower in the xylitol group than in the other groups (anova, p<0.001). in conclusion, the earlier demonstrated, xylitol-associated reduction in the probability of mother-child transmission of ms was still found in the children's  ms counts at the age of 3 and 6 years.

AB  == the significance of streptococcus gordonii in dental caries is undefined, as is that of other alpha-amylase-binding bacteria (abb) commonly found in the mouth. to clarify the ecological and cariological roles of s. gordonii our specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats, tan:spfom(om)br, were fed either diet 2000 (containing 56% confectioner's sugar, most of which is sucrose) or diet 2000cs (containing 56% cornstarch, in lieu of confectioner's sugar) and inoculated with  s. gordonii strains. uninoculated rats were free of both indigenous mutans streptococci (ms) and abb, including s. gordonii, as shown by culture on mitis salivarius and blood agars of swabs and sonicates of dentitions after weanlings had consumed these diets for 26 days. abb were detected by radiochemical assay using [125i]-amylase reactive to alpha-amylase-binding protein characteristic of  the surface of s. gordonii and other abb. no abb were detected (detection limit < 1 colony-forming units in 10(6) colony-forming units). thus the tan:spfom(om)br colony presents a 'clean animal model' for subsequent study. consequently, s. gordonii strains challis or g9b were used to inoculate weanling rat groups consuming either the high-sucrose diet 2000 or the cornstarch diet 2000cs. two additional groups fed each of these diets remained unioculated. recoveries of inoculants were tested 12 and 26 days later by oral swabs and sonication of the molars of one hemimandible of each animal, respectively. uninoculated animals were reconfirmed to be free of abb and mutans streptococci, but inoculated ones eating diet 2000cs had s. gordonii recoveries of 1-10% or, if eating diet 2000, 10-30% of total colony-farming units in sonicates. there were no statistically significant differences among the inoculated and uninoculated animal groups' caries scores when they ate the cornstarch diet. lesion scores for sucrose-eating rats were, however, from 2.4-5.1-fold higher than for cornstarch-eating rats, p < 0.001, and were still higher if animals had been inoculated with either challis (1.41-fold) or g9b (1.64-fold), than if uninoculated, both p < 0.001, so long as  the rats ate the sucrose diet. therefore, tan:spfom(om)br rats do not harbour abb or s. gordonii but can be colonized by s. gordonii. colonization levels of s. gordonii on the teeth are higher in the presence of high sucrose than with high starch-containing diets. caries scores are augmented by sucrose compared with starch, and are further augmented by s gordonii colonization. s. gordonii is thus cariologically significant in the presence of sucrose, at least in this rat.

TI  == mannosidase production by viridans group streptococci.
AB  == the production of mannosidase activity by all currently recognized species of human viridans group streptococci was determined using an assay in which bacterial growth was dependent on the degradation of the high-mannose-type glycans of rnase b and subsequent utilization of released mannose. rnase b is an  excellent substrate for the demonstration of mannosidase activity since it is a glycoprotein with a single glycosylation site which is occupied by high-mannose-type glycoforms containing five to nine mannose residues. mannosidase activity was produced only by some members of the mitis group (streptococcus mitis, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus cristatus, streptococcus infantis, streptococcus parasanguinis, and streptococcus pneumoniae) and streptococcus intermedius of the anginosus group. none of the other species within the salivarius and mutans groups or streptococcus peroris and streptococcus sanguinis produced mannosidase activity. using matrix-assisted  laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, it was demonstrated that the man(5) glycan alone was degraded while man(6) to man(9), which contain terminal alpha(1-->2) mannose residues in addition to the alpha(1-->3), alpha(1-->6), and beta(1-->4) residues present in man(5), remained intact. investigations on mannosidase production using synthetic (4-methylumbelliferone-  or p-nitrophenol-linked) alpha- or beta-mannosides as substrates indicated that there was no correlation between degradation of these substrates and degradation  of the man(5) glycan of rnase b. no species degraded these alpha-linked mannosides, while degradation of the beta-linked synthetic substrates was restricted to strains within the streptococcus anginosus, s. gordonii, and s. intermedius species. the data generated using a native glycoprotein as the substrate demonstrate that mannosidase production within the viridans group streptococci is more widely distributed than had previously been considered.

TI  == lactic acid bacteria from healthy oral cavity of thai volunteers: inhibition of oral pathogens.
AB  == the aims of the present study were to screen and characterize the antimicrobial lactic acid bacteria which were isolated from healthy oral cavities of thai volunteers, and to characterize their inhibiting substances. among 3790 isolates  (suspected to be lactic acid bacteria) from 130 volunteers, five showed an appreciable effect against sarcina lutea atcc 9341, bacillus cereus atcc 11778, escherichia coli atcc 25922, staphylococcus aureus atcc 6538, streptococcus mutans dtmu 1, strep. salivarius dtmu 1, strep. sanguis dtmu 1, candida albicans  atcc 13803 and c. albicans dtmu 2, as well as the oral pathogens. these antimicrobial isolates included l17 and n14 which showed the antibacterial activity, d14 which showed the anticandidal activity, and d6 and n8 which showed  both the antibacterial and anticandidal activities. the isolates were later found to be facultative anaerobic, gram-positive, non-spore-forming, non-capsule-forming and catalase-negative bacilli. they could utilize casein but  could not hydrolyse starch, and they produced hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocins. their antimicrobial potentials were found to be affected by ph, catalase, proteolytic enzymes and temperature. the activity was partially inactivated after catalase treatment, significantly declined at ph > or =9.0 or after trypsin and pepsin treatments, and also reduced after heating at > or =100 degrees c. however, the antimicrobial activity of these five isolates was somewhat resistant to heat. when the isolates were tested for their antimicrobial sensitivity, they  were shown to be sensitive to a number of antimicrobial agents. the final identification revealed that d6, d14 and n14 were lactobacillus paracasei subsp.  paracasei, and l17 and n8 were lact. rhamnosus.

TI  == automated fluorescent in situ hybridization for the specific detection and quantification of oral streptococci in dental plaque.
AB  == our aim was to develop a rapid fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assay for the identification of different oral groups of streptococci in dental plaque and  to combine it with digital image analysis for the automated enumeration of target cells. cy3-labeled oligonucleotide probes specific for 16s rrna gene sequences of the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups of streptococci were hybridized under stringent conditions with bacterial cultures or supragingival plaque samples that had been permeabilized with lysozyme. probe specificity was determined with strains from 30 different species, mainly of oral origin. results showed that probes ang541, mit447, ssp001, and sal090 with specificity for the anginosus, mitis, mutans, and salivarius groups, respectively, the pan-reactive streptococcal probe str405, the s. mutans specific probe mut590, and the s. sobrinus specific probe sob174 were well-suited for the identification of cultured streptococci. probes str405, mit447 and ssp001 were then successfully applied to enumerate automatically bacteria of the recognized taxa in 144 supragingival plaque samples. on the average, total streptococci accounted for 8.2%, streptococci of the mitis and mutans groups for 3.9 and 1.7%, respectively, of the plaques. the combined application of fish and automated image analysis provides an objective time-saving alternative to culture or pcr for the enumeration of selected oral streptococci in dental plaque.

TI  == caries risk assessment from dental plaque and salivary streptococcus mutans counts on two culture media.
AB  == this study attempted to determine which combination of plaque or saliva, and tryptic soy agar, bacitracin (tsy20b) or mitis salivarius, bacitracin media, yielded the highest caries-predictive values for mutans counts in children with different caries prevalence. sixty children were divided into three equally sized groups: caries free, low caries and high caries. eighteen months later, their caries incidence and initial mutans count were compared. fissure plaque on tsy20b yielded a high correlation between mutans counts and caries prevalence (p<0.009,  r=3346) and incidence (p<0.003, r=4521). the caries-predictive values obtained demonstrate that the coefficient of variation of mutans counts from lower first-molar fissure plaque on tsy20b accounts for 20.4% of the variation in final caries index. this strong correlation provides a valuable tool for the identification of caries-prone individuals.

TI  == mutans streptococci prevalence in puerto rican babies with cariogenic feeding behaviors.
AB  == purpose: previous studies have demonstrated that babies are at higher risk for mutans streptococci (ms) colonization if their mothers have dense salivary ms reservoirs relative to babies who have mothers with negligible salivary reservoirs. this communication provides data that identifies another potential risk factor (use of a nursing bottle at bedtime and/or naptime that contains a substrate other than water) for baby infection by ms. methods: the study population consisted of 60 babies (28 males/32 females; mean age 15 mos; age range 12-18 mos) who were all healthy, caries free, and slept with a nursing bottle that contained a substrate other than water (nb+). pooled maxillary incisor plaque and saliva samples were obtained and immediately placed in reduced transparent fluid (rtf); they were serially diluted and plated onto mitis salivarius agar plus bacitracin (msb) and blood agar plates within 4 hours of collection; the plates were incubated in an anaerobic environment for 48 h at 37  c and then placed for 24 h under aerobiosis prior to examination; representative  ms colonies were isolated and subjected to mannitol and sorbitol fermentation tests for taxonomic verification. plates with colony counts between 20 and 300 were utilized to determine the % of ms in each sample. results: fifty one of the  60(85%) babies harbored ms in at least 1 of the 2 samples. the 95% confidence interval for the proportion of subjects with detectable levels of ms was 73%-93%. fisher's exact test showed that babies 16-18 mos age were more likely to have detectable levels of ms than babies 12-15 mos age (p = 0.01). levels of ms in plaque and saliva were as follows: < 0.1% (plaque 27/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.77; saliva 28/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.76); 0.1%-1.0% (plaque 4/51, mean age 14 mos, sd 1.5; saliva 6/51, mean age 15 mos, sd 1.46); > 1.0% (plaque 14/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 2.1; saliva 11/51, mean age 16 mos, sd 1.91). the density of  infection did not vary by age for plaque (p = 0.32) or saliva (p = 0.64). conclusion: these findings support the concept that nb+ is a strong indicator for ms infection in puerto rican babies; that prevalence of infection increases with  age; and that density of infection does not vary with age in this population.

TI  == genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis and distinct aciduric subpopulations in human dental plaque.
AB  == the genotypic heterogeneity of streptococcus oralis isolated from the oral cavity was investigated using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr. unrelated subjects  harbored unique genotypes, with numerous genotypes being isolated from an individual. s. oralis is the predominant aciduric bacterium isolated from noncarious tooth sites. genotypic comparison of the aciduric populations isolated at ph 5.2 with those isolated from mitis-salivarius agar (msa) (ph 7.0) indicated that the aciduric populations were genotypically distinct in the majority of subjects (chi(2) = 13.09; p = 0.0031). neither the aciduric nor the msa-isolated  strains were stable, with no strains isolated at baseline being isolated 4 or 12  weeks later in the majority of subjects. the basis of this instability is unknown but is similar to that reported for streptococcus mitis. examination of s. oralis strains isolated from cohabiting couples demonstrated that in three of five couples, genotypically identical strains were isolated from both partners and this was confirmed by using salmonella enteritidis repetitive element pcr and enterobacterial pcr typing. these data provide further evidence of the physiological and genotypic heterogeneity of non-mutans streptococci. the demonstration of distinct aciduric populations of s. oralis implies that the role of these and other non-mutans streptococci in the caries process requires reevaluation.

TI  == adaptation of oral streptococci to low ph.
AB  == the strategies employed by oral streptococci to resist the inimical influences of acidification reflect the diverse and dynamic niches of the human mouth. all of the oral streptococci are capable of rapid degradation of sugar to acidic end-products. as a result, the ph value of their immediate environment can plummet to levels where glycolysis and growth cease. at this point, the approaches for survival in acid separate the organisms. streptococcus mutans, for example, relies on its f-atpase, to protect itself from acidification by pumping  protons out of the cells. s. salivarius responds by degrading urea to ammonia and s. sanguis produces ammonia by arginolysis. the mechanisms by which these organisms regulate their particular escape route are now being explored experimentally. the picture that emerges is that the acid-adaptive regulatory mechanisms of the oral streptococci differ markedly from those employed by gram-negative bacteria. what remains to be elucidated are the breadth of the acid-response systems in these organisms and how they permit the microbes to sustain themselves in the face of low ph and the bacterial competition present in their respective niches. in this article, we summarize reports concerning the means by which oral streptococci either utilize acidification to subdue their competitors or protect themselves until ph values return to a more favorable level.

TI  == the effect of nicotine on growth of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == there is little information available concerning the effects of nicotine on oral  bacteria; and in particular, streptococcus mutans, an important microbe in the etiology of dental caries. to test the effects of nicotine, streptococcus mutans  were incubated in either 0 or 10(-1)-10(-7) m concentrations of nicotine and then plated onto mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. colonies were counted and treatment groups compared. both 10(-1) and 10(-2) m nicotine caused total inhibition of bacterial growth, while 10(-3) and 10(-4) m produced significantly more colonies  than control. also, 10(-6) and 10(-7) m nicotine produced a significant reduction in the mean number of colonies. these results suggest a biphasic, dosage-dependent effect of nicotine on the growth of streptococcus mutans. since  10(-3) m nicotine has been reported within the saliva of smokeless tobacco users, use of these products could stimulate growth of streptococcus mutans and possibly place the user at increased risk for dental caries.

TI  == characterization of recombinant, ureolytic streptococcus mutans demonstrates an inverse relationship between dental plaque ureolytic capacity and cariogenicity.
AB  == dental caries results from prolonged plaque acidification that leads to the establishment of a cariogenic microflora and demineralization of the tooth. urease enzymes of oral bacteria hydrolyze urea to ammonia, which can neutralize plaque acids. to begin to examine the relationship between plaque ureolytic activity and the incidence of dental caries, recombinant, ureolytic strains of streptococcus mutans were constructed. specifically, the ureabcefgd operon from streptococcus salivarius 57.i was integrated into the s. mutans chromosome in such a way that the operon was transcribed from a weak, cognate promoter in s. mutans acus4 or a stronger promoter in s. mutans acus6. both strains expressed nicl(2)-dependent urease activity, but the maximal urease levels in acus6 were threefold higher than those in acus4. in vitro ph drop experiments demonstrated that the ability of the recombinant s. mutans strains to moderate a decrease in ph during the simultaneous metabolism of glucose and urea increased proportionately with the level of urease activity expressed. specific-pathogen-free rats that were infected with acus6 and fed a cariogenic diet with drinking water containing 25 mm urea and 50 microm nicl(2) had relatively high levels of oral urease activity, as well as dramatic decreases in  the prevalence of smooth-surface caries and the severity of sulcal caries, relative to controls. urease activity appears to influence plaque biochemistry and metabolism in a manner that reduces cariogenicity, suggesting that recombinant, ureolytic bacteria may be useful to promote dental health.

TI  == influence of maternal xylitol consumption on acquisition of mutans streptococci by infants.
AB  == xylitol is effective as a non-cariogenic sugar substitute. habitual xylitol consumption appears to select for mutans streptococci (ms) with impaired adhesion properties, i.e., they shed easily to saliva from plaque. one hundred sixty-nine  mother-child pairs participated in a two-year study exploring whether the mothers' xylitol consumption could be used to prevent mother-child transmission of mutans streptococci. all mothers showed high salivary levels of mutans streptococci during pregnancy. the mothers in the xylitol group (n = 106) were requested to chew xylitol-sweetened gum (65% w/w) at least 2 or 3 times a day, starting three months after delivery. in the two control groups, the mothers received either chlorhexidine (n = 30) or fluoride (n = 33) varnish treatments at 6, 12, and 18 months after delivery. the children did not chew gum or receive varnish treatments. ms were assessed from the mothers' saliva at half-year intervals and from the children's plaque at the one- and two-year examinations. the ms were cultured on mitis salivarius agars containing bacitracin. the salivary ms levels of the mothers remained high and not significantly different among the three study groups throughout the study. at two years of age, 9.7% of the children in the xylitol, 28.6% in the chlorhexidine, and 48.5% in the fluoride varnish group showed a detectable level of ms. in conclusion, therefore, habitual xylitol consumption by mothers was associated with a statistically significant reduction of the probability of mother-child transmission of ms assessed at two years of age. the effect was superior to that obtained with either chlorhexidine or fluoride varnish treatments performed as single applications at six-month intervals.

TI  == the gene encoding iiab(man)l in streptococcus salivarius is part of a tetracistronic operon encoding a phosphoenolpyruvate: mannose/glucose phosphotransferase system.
AB  == glucose and mannose are transported in streptococci by the mannose-pts (phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose phosphotransferase system), which consists of a cytoplasmic iiab protein, called iiab(man), and an uncharacterized membrane permease. this paper reports the characterization of the man operon encoding the  specific components of the mannose-pts of streptococcus salivarius. the man operon was composed of four genes, manl, manm, mann and mano. these genes were transcribed from a canonical promoter (pman) into a 3.6 kb polycistronic mrna that contained a 5'-utr (untranslated region). the predicted manl gene product encoded a 35.5 kda protein and contained the amino acid sequences of the iia and  iib phosphorylation sites already determined from purified s. salivarius iiab(man)l. expression of manl in escherichia coli generated a 35 kda protein that reacted with anti-iiab(man)l antibodies. the predicted manm protein had an estimated size of 27.2 kda. manm had similarity with iic domains of the mannose-eii family, but did not possess the signature proposed for mannose-iic proteins from gram-negative bacteria. from multiple alignment analyses of sequences available in current databases, the following modified iic(man) signature is proposed: gx3g[dnh]x3g[livm]2xg2[stl][lt][eq]. the deduced product of mann was a hydrophobic protein with a predicted molecular mass of 33.4 kda. the mann protein contained an amino acid sequence similar to the signature sequence of the iid domains of the mannose-eii family. mano encoded a 13.7 kda protein. this gene was also transcribed as a monocistronic mrna from a promoter located in the mann-mano intergenic region. a search of current databases revealed the presence of iiab(man)l, manm, mann and mano orthologues in streptococcus mutans, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus faecalis. this work has elucidated the molecular structure of the mannose pts in streptococci and enterococci, and demonstrated the presence of a putative regulatory protein (mano) within the man operon.

TI  == relationship among mutans streptococci, "low-ph" bacteria, and lodophilic polysaccharide-producing bacteria in dental plaque and early enamel caries in humans.
AB  == multiple interactions occur among major determinants of dental caries. we have studied the bacterial flora and ph-lowering capacity of the same dental plaques in relation to caries. the findings on the plaque flora are reported here. the buccal surfaces of upper teeth in each subject were selected for study. a low-caries group had no "white spot" caries (ws) in the selected dentition area;  a higher-caries group averaged 4.1 ws in this area. the latter group was divided  into subjects with 2, 3, or 4 ws and subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws. enumerated organisms in plaque samples (sound and ws sites) from all subjects were: (1) mutans streptococci (ms) on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin and mitis-salivarius agar; (2) non-mutans streptococci (non-ms) on mitis-salivarius agar; (3) organisms that were categorized according to their minimum ph in sugar broth, i.e., the predominant undifferentiated total flora on blood agar or the predominant non-ms flora on mitis-salivarius agar; and (4) iodophilic polysaccharide-storing organisms on trypticase-yeast extract-salts agar. plaques  covering ws lesions contained generally only low proportions (< 0.1%) of ms. the  plaque proportions of all the above 4 bacterial groups were increased in the higher-caries group but were similar for s and ws sites in this group. over half  of the total plaque flora in subjects with 5, 6, or 7 ws consisted of "low-ph"-type organisms (minimum ph < 4.4). many of these were neither ms nor "low-ph" non-ms. the numerical emergence of ms in plaque appeared to be preceded  often by other types of "low-ph" bacteria, including the non-ms. caries development in the absence or presence of ms as well as different bacterial successions in plaque can be explained readily by the dynamic and positive relationship among the factors carbohydrate consumption, plaque flora composition, plaque acidogenic potential, and caries activity.

TI  == variables affecting salivary streptococcus mutans counts in a cohort of 12-year-old subjects.
AB  == background: several factors such as toothbrushing, diet, acidogenic potential of  the mutans streptococci strain and site of the carious lesion can modify the salivary streptococcus mutans (sm) counts. in the present investigation the effect of some behavioural, clinical and microbiological variables on sm salivary counts was evaluated in a cohort of 12-year-olds. methods: forty subjects were examined by two calibrated examiners (gc, al). the number of surfaces either decayed occlusal, decayed smooth or filled and the number of bleeding sextants, (clinical index for oral hygiene) were reported. saliva was collected using a tongue depressor and was plated onto mitis salivarius agar with bacitracin and 20% sucrose. the presumptive sm colonies were counted and the concentrations were logarithmically transformed. one sm strain per subject was identified and the cariogenic potential evaluated as the minimum ph value recorded, during 5 hrs of  incubation in 5% sucrose solution. the children's parents or guardians completed  a questionnaire concerning the frequency of toothbrushing, the consumption of sweet foods and soft drinks and at what age the children started brushing their teeth. the effect of the explanatory variables on sm count logarithms was evaluated by stepwise multiple regression. results: the regressors with significant additional explanatory power were cariogenic potential (b = -1.335, p = 0.00001, r2 increment = 0.312), decayed smooth surfaces (b = -0.456, p = 0.009, r2 increment = 0.114) and bleeding sextants (b = -0.113, p = 0.004, r2 increment  = 0.062), whereas the power of filled surfaces was marginally significant (p = 0.08). conclusions: on the basis of these results, it is suggested that acidogenicity is not only a cariogenic factor, but also a factor promoting colonization of oral sites by sm, especially in subjects with a high frequency of sugar consumption.

AB  == purpose: to establish a method to measure microbial kill caused by ultrasonic cleaning. secondarily, to estimate the escape of bacteria from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions during operation of the unit. materials and methods: three commercial enzymatic detergents and saline were used as cleaners. depending on detergent, initial operational temperature was 21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c. streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 (s. mutans suspensions) was adjusted to a final concentration of 1.0 x 10(3) cells/ml in saline. suspensions (2000 ml) at the desired temperatures were added to the cleaner. aliquots were removed, serially diluted in letheen broth and spread plated over mitis salivarius agar. appropriate amounts of detergent solutions were added to s. mutans suspensions and the cleaner operated for 20 minutes. aliquots were then removed and plated. the process was repeated twice. plates were aerobically incubated at 37 degrees c for 7 days and the colonies counted. the procedure was repeated using three temperatures of s. mutans suspensions (21 degrees c, 37 degrees c or 60 degrees c), but without detergent or ultrasound. also, detergents were added to 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions and allowed to sit for 20 minutes without ultrasonic cleaning. microbial sampling was done as previously described. results: results when ultrasound was used indicated that little kill (5-15%) occurred in 21 degrees c or 37 degrees c detergent solutions. greater kill (25-35%) was noted with 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline. complete kill was accomplished with 60 degrees c saline or the 60 degrees c detergent solution. when ultrasound and detergent were not used, there was no kill in 21 degrees c and 37 degrees c saline, but complete kill in 60 degrees c saline. in the absence of ultrasound no kill was noted in 21 degrees c s. mutans suspensions to which detergent had been added. total kill of s. mutans was observed in 60 degrees c saline or 60 degrees c detergent with ultrasound or after a 20-minute exposure in 60 degrees c saline without ultrasonic cleaning. very few bacteria escaped from the ultrasonic cleaning solutions into the air during the cleaning process. placement of the unit lid effectively reduced emissions to zero.

AB  == susceptibility of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is strongly reduced by the formation of complex biofilms. we investigated whether synthetic histatin analogs with broad-spectrum antibacterial activity in vitro were also active against these complex mixtures of bacteria, as present in saliva and plaque. in a simplified model system for dental plaque, hydroxyapatite discs were placed in a  continuous culture system comprised of streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius, actinomyces naeslundii, veillonella parvula, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella intermedia. ex situ treatment of the biofilms formed on these discs with 100 microg/ml of peptide dhvar4 significantly reduced facultative anaerobic, total anaerobic, and obligate anaerobic gram-negative counts with 0.8, 0.5, and 0.5 log units, respectively. ex vivo treatment of salivary bacteria gave reductions of 0.4, 0.7, and 1.5 log units, respectively. for ex vivo treatment of plaque bacteria, reductions of 0.4, 0.4, and 1.4 log units, respectively, were found. in both saliva and plaque samples, obligate anaerobic gram-negative bacteria were significantly more susceptible to dhvar4 than facultatively anaerobic or anaerobic bacteria as a whole (p=0.013 and p=0.018, for salivary bacteria, and p=0.021 and p=0.020 for plaque bacteria, respectively). although the oral bacteria are protected by biofilm formation, the synthetic histatin analog caused a significant reduction of viable counts in a model for oral biofilm as well as in isolated oral biofilms.

TI  == effect of low-molecular-weight chitosans on the adhesive properties of oral streptococci.
AB  == it was previously shown that a low-molecular-weight chitosan and its derivatives  n-carboxymethyl chitosan and imidazolyl chitosan inhibit streptococcus mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite. the ability of the same molecules to interfere with adhesive properties of other oral streptococci (streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus anginosus, streptococcus intermedius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus vestibularis) was tested. when saliva-coated or -uncoated hydroxyapatite beads were treated with n-carboxymethyl chitosan, a reduction varying from 60% to 98% depending on strains was observed. low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan did not have any effect. growth in n-carboxymethyl chitosan-supplemented medium (final concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 micrograms.ml-1) caused a dose related reduction in the adsorption of all strains to hydroxyapatite and in their affinity towards xylene. no effect was observed with low-molecular-weight chitosans and imidazolyl chitosan. in contrast to what observed with s. mutans, the three polysaccharides did not affect detachment from hydroxyapatite beads and adherence to cheek epithelial cells of the other streptococci. these results suggest that low-molecular-weight chitosans and/or imidazolyl chitosan, selectively affecting s. mutans adsorption to hydroxyapatite, may be very interesting as potential anti-dental caries agents.

TI  == [alpha-hemolytic streptococci and root canal irrigants. an evaluation of the bactericidal efficacy of sodium hypochlorite and chlorhexidine gluconate plus cetrimide].
AB  == background and aims: the main bacterial species present in pulpal and periapical  microbic flora is alpha-hemolytic streptococci. they are regarded as facultative  anaerobes which prefer to grow in anaerobiosis. canal irrigation plays an important role in the success of endodontic treatment given that, on the one hand, it encourages the gradual elimination of the smear layer, and on the other  it neutralises microbic flora in the root canal. the aim of this study was to test the microbiological efficacy of sodium hypochlorite 1% and s new generation  irrigant based on chlorhexidine 0.2% and cetrimide 0.2%. methods: the test was performed on the following alpha-hemolytic streptococci bacteria (dasit, cornaredo, italy): streptococcus mitis atcc 9811; streptococcus mutans atcc 35668; streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419; streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556. the working concentration (cfu/ml) was defined as 0.5 mc farland which corresponds to a concentration of microorganisms of approximately 1.5 x 10(8) bacteria. the following canal irrigants were used: 1) cetrimide 0.2% + chlorhexidine 0.2% (cetrexidin vebas, s. giuliano milanese, italy); 2) naocl 1% (ogna, milan, italy). each individual substance remained in contact with the bacterial species  used in the test for 10'-20'-30'. results: the results obtained show the bactericidal efficacy of both the irrigants used, even after a short period of contact. conclusions: this does not mean that all irrigants are equal and/or promise the same results. this was a microbiological study, but it is nonetheless important to take other variables into account, such as contact time. moreover, in order to increase the probabilities for the success of endodontic treatment, canal irrigants must also present other characteristics, namely: biocompatibility, scarce toxicity, high proteolytic power.

TI  == acid-regulated proteins induced by streptococcus mutans and other oral bacteria during acid shock.
AB  == our previous research has demonstrated that with the more aciduric oral bacteria, an acid shock to sub-lethal ph values results in the induction of an acid tolerance response that protects the cells at extremely low ph (ph 3.0-4.0) that  kills unadapted control cells maintained at ph 7.5 (oral microbiol immunol 1997:  12: 266-273). in this study, we were interested in comparing the protein profiles of acid-shocked and control cells of nine organisms from three acid-ogenic genera that could be categorized as strong, weak and non-acid responders in an attempt to identify proteins that could be classified as acid-regulated proteins and which may be important in the process of survival at very low ph. for this, log-phase cultures were rapidly acidified from ph 7.5 to 5.5 in the presence of [14c]-amino acids for varying periods up to 2 h, the period previously shown to be required for maximum induction of the acid response. the cells were extracted  for total protein and subjected to one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide chromatography with comparable control and acid-shocked protein profiles compared by scanning and computer analysis. of particular interest were the proteins in the acid-shocked cells that showed enhanced labeling (i.e., synthesis) over the control cells, since these were considered acid-regulated proteins of importance in ph homeostasis. streptococcus mutans lt11 generated the most rapid and complex pattern: a total of 36 acid-regulated proteins showing enhanced synthesis, with 25 appearing within the first 30 min of acid shock. the enhanced synthesis was transient with all proteins, with the exception of two with molecular weights of 50/49 and 33/32 kda. within the acid-regulated proteins were proteins having molecular weights comparable to the  heat shock proteins and the various subunits of the membrane h+/atpase. by comparison, the strong responder, lactobacillus casei 151, showed the enhanced formation of only nine proteins within the first 30 min of the acid shock, with a total of 11 acid-regulated proteins formed during the 2-h adaptation period with  enhanced synthesis transient for seven of these proteins. streptococcus salivarius at2 and streptococcus gordonii th12 had the formation of 6 and 8 proteins enhanced, while the weakly responding organisms, streptococcus sanguis atcc 10,556 and streptococcus oralis atcc 10,557, exhibited 8 and 6 such proteins, respectively. even non-responding strains unable to survive at very low ph, such as streptococcus sobrinus ch125/43, streptococcus mitis atcc 12,261 and  actinomyces naeslundii 301-13 showed the initial formation of 3-9 acid-regulated  proteins, but protein synthesis was not sustained over the entire adaptation period. clearly, the survival of oral bacteria at very low ph is related, not to  the total number of the acid-regulated proteins induced per se but to the formation of key proteins that function to augment normal ph homeostasis.

TI  == effect of an alum-containing mouthrinse in children for plaque and salivary levels of selected oral microflora.
AB  == the purpose of the study was to assess the effect of daily supervised rinsing with a specially formulated, alum-containing mouthrinse on plaque and salivary levels of s. mutans, s. mitis and s. salivarius in caries susceptible children (12-14 years old) and to monitor the effect on the oral tissues and acceptability to subjects. forty-five subjects were divided into 3 groups (n = 15). group i received an experimental group with a mouthrinse containing hydrated aluminum potassium sulfate (alum). group 2 received a vehicle control group containing the same mouthrinse, but without alum and group 3 had a treatment control with distilled water. all subjects continued normal oral hygiene habits during the study. salivary and plaque levels were obtained at base line, 2 weeks and 4 weeks and evaluated for microbiologic procedures. also, potential adverse effects on oral tissues were performed during every visit. the mean plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus (s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius) for the experimental group were significantly reduced after 2 weeks and 4 weeks compared  with baseline. the plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus of experimental and vehicle control group differed statistically from each other after 4 weeks, with the strongest reduction in the experimental group and there was statistically difference between treatment control and vehicle control or experimental groups at each time interval. no evidence of deleterious effects to  the oral tissues was observed. daily use of an alum-containing mouthrinse was safe and produced significant reduction effect on plaque and salivary levels of oral streptococcus and can be used in children for the preventive dentistry.

TI  == acid production from lactulose by dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == representative strains of oral streptococci, lactobacilli and bifidobacteria were incubated overnight with lactulose or other carbohydrates and the final ph recorded. most bacteria tested were able to metabolize lactulose with the exception of strains of streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. fermentum. streptococcus mutans produced most acid overnight but the initial rate of acid production from lactulose by uninduced cultures was very low. plaque ph was monitored in 12 volunteers following rinsing the mouth with lactulose, sucrose or sorbitol or lactulose bp. these studies in vivo showed both lactulose and lactulose bp to exhibit low acidogenic potential. thus, although plaque bacteria are capable of fermenting lactulose, the results suggest that lactulose is likely to pose a small acidogenic challenge to teeth under normal conditions of use.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of viridans group streptococci in taiwan with an emphasis on the high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides in streptococcus oralis.
AB  == the in-vitro susceptibilities of 13 antimicrobial agents were determined for 207  isolates of viridans group streptococci recovered from patients with significant  infections in taiwan during 1995 and 1997. variable degrees of susceptibility existed among nine species. high-level penicillin resistance (mic > or = 4.0 mg/l) was found most frequently in streptococcus oralis (35%), followed by streptococcus mitis (20%) and streptococcus salivarius (8%). however, s. salivarius showed the lowest rate of susceptibility to penicillin (50%). macrolide resistance also occurred most frequently in s. oralis isolates (55%) but in none of streptococcus mutans. penicillin and macrolides tended to be less  active against isolates recovered from non-invasive sites than against those isolated from invasive sites. imipenem was the most active beta-lactam against penicillin-resistant isolates. ofloxacin, vancomycin and teicoplanin showed good  in-vitro activity against all isolates, with mic90s of 2, 1 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. none of these isolates displayed high-level resistance to gentamicin and most isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol. these results indicate the species-related variability of susceptibility, especially to penicillin, macrolides and tetracycline. in addition to s. mitis, s. oralis also  displayed high rates of resistance to penicillin and macrolides. the difference in susceptibilities between species of viridans streptococci indicates the importance of accurate identification and the need for continuing surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == mutacin production by streptococcus mutans may promote transmission of bacteria from mother to child.
AB  == the production of bacteriocin-like inhibitory substances, mutacins, by mutans streptococci varies among isolates. to find if the degree of mutacin activity of  an isolate was related to its transmission between mother and her child, 19 mothers and their 18-month- to 3-year-old children were sampled for their oral mutans streptococci. in addition, the stability of mutacin activity was studied with isolates from the mothers and with isolates from five unrelated 5-year-old children in 5- to 7-year follow-up studies. a total of 145 oral mutans streptococcal isolates were serotyped by immunodiffusion, ribotyped, and mutacin  typed by the stab culture technique. mutacin was produced by 88% of the strains against more than 1 of the 14 indicator strains, representing mutans streptococci, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus oralis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus pyogenes. streptococcus mutans  isolates showed more inhibitory activity than did streptococcus sobrinus isolates. identical ribotypes had similar mutacin activity profiles within a subject, initially and in the follow-up studies, in all but two cases. the mothers harbored a total of 37 different mutans streptococcal ribotypes. six children were negative for mutans streptococci. transmission was probable in 9 of 20 mother-child pairs on the basis of the presence of identical strains, as determined by ribotyping and bacteriocin (mutacin) typing. s. mutans strains shared between a mother and her child showed a broader spectrum of inhibitory activity than did nontransmitted strains. in conclusion, the mutacin activity of  clinical isolates is reasonably stable, and this virulence factor seems to be of  clinical importance in early colonization by s. mutans.

AB  == the separate and combined effects of peroxidase-generated hypothiocyanite (hoscn/oscn-) and f- ions on glucose uptake and growth of streptococcus mutans atcc 25175 were investigated. s. mutans cells were grown to late exponential or stationary growth phase, harvested, washed and suspended in 2.0 ml of sterilized  human whole saliva supplemented with 10 mm d-glucose. this saliva-bacteria mixture was supplemented with 5-150 microm h2o2 at ph 5.0 or 6.5. at ph 5.0, up to 103 +/- 21 microm hoscn/oscn- was generated. after 20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c, the saliva-bacteria suspension exposed to hoscn/oscn- were plated on mitis salivarius agar plates and incubated anaerobically for 2 days. identical experiments were made with f- ions (0.5, 1.0 and 5.0 mm). both hoscn/oscn- and f- caused a significant dose-dependent growth inhibition at ph 5.0, whereas no inhibition was observed at ph 6.5. when f- and hoscn/oscn- were added simultaneously at ph 5.0, an additive effect of growth inhibition was observed. in glucose incorporation experiments the bacteria-saliva mixture was exposed to 1 microm hoscn/oscn-, 0.5 mm f- or both. f-, hoscn/oscn- or their combination in sterilized whole saliva at ph 5.0 caused 14.2, 67.8 and 74.2% inhibition, respectively. these observations indicate that f- and hoscn/oscn- ions have an additive inhibitory effect on s. mutans and therefore their combination is likely to be more antibacterial than either agent alone.

AB  == enolase activity in strains of oral streptococci previously has been found to be  inhibited by 50% (ki) by fluoride concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microm or more in the presence of 0.5 to 1.0 mm inorganic phosphate ions. in this study, enolase was extracted and partly purified by a two-step process from five oral bacterial species and the effect of fluoride on the kinetics of enolase examined. the molecular weight of the putative enolase proteins was 46-48 kda. the vmax values ranged from 20 to 323 iu/mg and k(m) for glycerate-2-phosphate from 0.22 to 0.74 mm. enolase activity was inhibited competitively by fluoride, with ki values ranging from 16 to 54 microm in the presence of 5 mm inorganic phosphate ions. ki values for phosphate ranged from 2 to 8 mm. the enolase from streptococcus sanguis atcc 10556 was more sensitive to fluoride (ki = 16 +/- 2) than was enolase from streptococcus salivarius atcc 10575 (ki = 19 +/- 2) or streptococcus mutans nctc 10449 (ki = 40 +/- 4) and all three streptococcal strains were more sensitive to fluoride than either actinomyces naeslundii wvu 627 (ki = 46 +/- 6) or lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 7469 (ki = 54 +/- 6) enolases. the levels of fluoride found to inhibit the streptococcal enolases in this study are much lower than previously reported and are likely to be present in plaque, especially during acidogenesis, and could exert an anti-glycolytic effect.

TI  == rapid procedure for acid adaptation of oral lactic-acid bacteria and further characterization of the response.
AB  == acid-adaptive responses could be induced readily in oral lactic-acid bacteria by  growing them in batch cultures with excess sugar or more conveniently and rapidly by transferring cells to acidified growth media for the time required for biomass doubling. the response of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was induced in a progressive  rather than all-or-nothing way, and the extent of acid tolerance was inversely related to the ph of the inducing medium over a range from 8.5 to 5. the weak acids fluoride, acetate, or lactate did not measurably enhance acid adaptation, and so the response did not appear to depend primarily on changes in delta ph or  the proton motive force across the cell membrane. transcription and translation to form new proteins did appear to be necessary, as indicated by inhibition of adaptation by rifampin or chloramphenicol and by lack of adaptation by cells suspended in phosphate buffer at ph 5. streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei were acid adapted by the rapid method, and the method appeared to be generally useful for oral lactic-acid bacteria. the rapid induction of the response in multiple oral lactic-acid bacteria suggests that it is of general importance for maintaining a diversity of organisms in the oral microbiota, which is regularly subjected to acid stresses.

TI  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci and  its role in the control of sugar metabolism.
AB  == oral streptococci are sugar-fermentative bacteria comprising at least 19 distinct species and are a significant proportion of the normal microbial population of the mouth and upper respiratory tract of humans. these streptococci transport several sugars by the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) which concomitantly catalyzes the phosphorylation and translocation of mono- and  disaccharides via a chain of enzymic reactions that transfer a phosphate group from phosphoenolpyruvate to the incoming sugar. a number of pts components, including hpr, enzyme i and some enzymes ii, have been studied at the biochemical and/or genetical level in streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sobrinus. moreover, compelling evidence indicates that the oral streptococcal pts is involved in the regulation of sugar metabolism. results are  accumulating suggesting that a protein called iiabman, as well as the phosphocarrier protein hpr, are key regulatory components that allow these bacteria to select rapidly metabolizable sugars, such as glucose or fructose, over less readily utilizable carbohydrates. circumstantial evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms by which oral streptococcal pts exert their regulatory functions differ from mechanisms in other gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == mitis salivarius-bacitracin 10% sacarose agar for oral streptococci and streptococcus mutans counts.
AB  == the msb agar (mitis salivarius-bacitracin) 20% sacarose medium is frequently used for the isolation and count of total streptococci and streptococcus mutans. although it is considered a selective culture medium for this micro-organism, s.  mutans recovery in this medium is much lower than in this mitis salivarius agar (msa). because the number of s. mutans in saliva is used for estimating caries risk and activity from a microbiological stand point, the aim of this work was to find a modification of the msb 20% sacarose medium so that it would offer not only selectivity in the isolation but also maximum recovery. this would detect people at risk more efficiency and would evaluate the preventive odontological treatments more accurately. the results show that: 1) the greatest recovery of total streptococci and s. mutans is obtained in the msb 10% sacarose medium, 2) s. mutans must be incubated in aerobiosis and the total streptococci in a candle  jar (10% co2). msb 10% sacarose medium is proposed as a choice medium for the microbiological estimation of cariogenic risk and activity, to detect infection levels and evaluate preventive odontological treatments.

AB  == streptococcus gordonii has an extracellular glucosyltransferase (gtf) that polymerizes the glucose moiety of sucrose to form both water-soluble and water-insoluble glucans. whereas multiple gtf genes have been identified in strains of mutans streptococci and streptococcus salivarius, a single gene, designated gtfg, encodes the gtf of s. gordonii challis. gtfg is also unique among the characterized gtfs in that it has a described regulatory determinant, rgg. furthermore, the gtf activity in s. gordonii undergoes reversible phase variation between high and low levels. in order to gain insight into this novel gtf system, the nucleotide sequence of gtfg was determined and found to consist of a 4,734 base pair open reading frame encoding a protein with a deduced molecular weight of ca. 174,000. gtfg was similar to other sequenced gtfs with a  conserved signal sequence followed by a ca. 600-bp region distinctive for gtfg, a conserved region encoding a putative catalytic active site and a series of six direct repeats in the carboxyl terminal region implicated in glucan binding. although comparison of gtfg to other gtfs did not show a basis for the primer-independence of the encoded enzyme or the nature of the glucan products, the gtfg sequence data provide an important basis for further studies of these enzymes.

TI  == antibacterial activity of dentin bonding systems, resin-modified glass ionomers,  and polyacid-modified composite resins.
AB  == the antibacterial effects of the dentin bonding systems syntac, probond, gluma 3-step, the resin-modified glass ionomers photac-fil, fuji lining lc, fuji ii lc, and the polyacid-modified composite resins variglass, geristore, and infinity were evaluated using the cariogenic bacteria s mutans, l salivarius, s sobrinus,  and a viscosus in vitro with a modified cylinder drop plate agar diffusion assay. all glass ionomers, the polyacid-modified composites, and the primers and adhesives of the dentin bonding systems exhibited various degrees of antibacterial activity against most of the test bacteria. the antibacterial activity of the adhesives of dentin bonding systems was anticipated because of the glutaraldehyde used in their formulations. however, the antibacterial activity of the various primers was unexpected and indicates a dual antibacterial action of these systems.

TI  == the effect of areca nut on salivary and selected oral microorganisms.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect on the growth of salivary and selected oral microorganisms of areca nut, aqueous extracts of the nut, its major alkaloid arecoline and the components tannic acid and catechin of its tannin fraction. the antibacterial properties of the above were tested on streptococcus  mutans, streptococcus salivarius, candida albicans and fusobacterium nucleatum and, as a control, staphylococcus aureus. this was followed by investigating its  effect on salivary organisms cultured from the saliva after chewing boiled areca  nut. extracts inhibited the growth of the selected organisms in a concentration dependent manner, baked and boiled nuts being significantly more potent than raw  nut. growth of c. albicans was the least affected by the nut extracts. tannic acid was strongly antibacterial but not catechin or arecoline. no antibacterial effect could be demonstrated on salivary organisms after chewing the nut for 5 minutes but exposure of saliva to the cud for 1 hour caused a significant depression of bacterial growth. it is concluded that the hydrolysable tannins in  the tannin fraction, which include tannic acid, are responsible for the antibacterial properties of the nut and that prolonged intraoral exposure to the  nut can suppress bacteria in the mouth.

TI  == salivacin 140, a novel bacteriocin from lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius t140 active against pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == fifteen of 353 environmental isolates of lactic acid bacteria consistently showed activity against listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and/or propionibacterium acnes. strain t140, isolated from the surface  of japanese pampas grass leaves and identified as lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salicinius, also had activity against several lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus and yersinia enterocolitica. since the antagonistic factor(s) produced by t140 was sensitive to a proteolytic enzyme, it was concluded that a bacteriocin (named salivacin 140) was involved in the inhibition activity. strain t140 required a high initial ph (7.5-8.5) in agar plates for bacteriocin production.

TI  == surface location of hpr, a phosphocarrier of the phosphoenolpyruvate: sugar phosphotransferase system in streptococcus suis.
AB  == hpr is a low-molecular-mass phosphocarrier protein of the bacterial phosphoenolpyruvate (pep): sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) found in the cytoplasm or associated with the inner surface of the cytoplasmic membrane. treatment of streptococcus suis cells with a sorvall omnimixer, a technique used  to extract cell surface components, resulted in the extraction of a major protein with a molecular mass of 9 kda. several lines of evidence suggested that this protein was hpr: (i) the s. suis protein showed homology over the first 35 n-terminal amino acid residues with the hprs of streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mutans, including the signature sequence for the site of pep-dependent phosphorylation; (ii) it cross-reacted with the s. salivarius anti-hpr antibody preparation; (iii) it could be phosphorylated by enzyme i at the expense of pep, and by a membrane-associated kinase at the expense of atp; and (iv) it possessed phosphocarrier activity when used as a source of hpr in an  in vitro pts assay. the data suggested that a portion of the cellular hpr is associated with the external cell surface in s. suis, a result that was confirmed by immunogold electron microscopy. the cellular hpr of s. suis consisted of two forms that could be distinguished by the presence or the absence of the n-terminal methionine. amino acid sequence analysis indicated that the cell-surface-associated hpr of s. suis lacked the n-terminal methionine residue.

TI  == inducer expulsion and the occurrence of an hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-phosphate phosphatase in enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB  == inducer expulsion, a phenomenon in which rapidly metabolizable sugars cause cytoplasmic dephosphorylation and efflux of pre-accumulated sugar-phosphates (sugar-p), has been documented for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus bovis, and lactococcus lactis, but not for other gram-positive bacteria. using intact cells and membrane vesicles, we show that enterococcus faecalis exhibits both inducer exclusion and inducer expulsion, and that the latter phenomenon is dependent on the metabolite-activated atp-dependent hpr(ser) kinase that phosphorylates ser-46 in hpr of the phosphotransferase system. a small, heat-stable, membrane-associated, hpr(ser-p)-activated sugar-p phosphatase (pase  ii), previously identified only in lc. lactis, is shown to be present in extracts of enterococcus faecalis and streptococcus pyogenes but not in those of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, or bacillis subtilis, organisms that do not exhibit the inducer expulsion phenomenon. further, lactobacillus brevis, an organism that exhibits inducer expulsion by a different mechanism, also apparently lacks pase ii. the results reveal that pase ii is present in those organisms that exhibit the coupled sugar-p hydrolysis/expulsion mechanism but not those that lack this mechanism. they provide correlative evidence that pase ii initiates inducer expulsion in species of enterococci, streptococci and lactococci.

TI  == antibacterial effects of some root end filling materials.
AB  == in addition to having good sealing ability, root end filling materials should "ideally" have some antibacterial activity to prevent bacterial growth. this investigation compared the antibacterial effects of amalgam, zinc oxide-eugenol,  super eba and a mineral trioxide aggregate on nine facultative bacteria streptococcus fecalis, streptococcus mitis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus species, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis, and escherichia coli b and seven strict anaerobic bacteria, prevotella (bacteroides) buccae, bacteroides fragilis, prevotella (bacteroides) intermedia, prevotella (bacteroides) melaninogenica, fusobacterium  necrophorum, fusobacterium nucleatum, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius. after growing these bacteria on solid media, freshly mixed and 24-h set test materials  were placed on the surface of these inoculated media and incubated in the appropriate atmosphere for 24 to 48 h at 37 degrees c. impregnated discs with the super eba liquid were used as positive controls. the antibacterial effects of each material were measured in millimeters and the data were analyzed using one-way and two-way analysis of variance and scheffe tests to determine the statistical differences between the antibacterial effects of the test materials.  impregnated discs with super eba liquid caused varying degrees of growth inhibition for both facultative and strict anaerobic bacteria. both types of amalgam had no antibacterial effect against any of the bacteria tested in this study. mineral trioxide aggregate had an antibacterial effect on some of the facultative bacteria and no effect on any of the strict anaerobic bacteria. zinc  oxide-eugenol and super eba pastes had some antibacterial effects on both types of bacteria tested.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == regulation of atp-dependent p-(ser)-hpr formation in streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == sugar transport via the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep) phosphotransferase system involves pep-dependent phosphorylation of the general phosphotransferase system protein, hpr, at histidine 15. however, gram-positive bacteria can also carry out atp-dependent phosphorylation of hpr at serine 46 by means of (ser)hpr kinase. in this study, we demonstrate that (ser)hpr kinase in crude preparations of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 is membrane associated, with ph optima of 7.0 and 7.5, respectively. the latter organism possessed 7- to 27-fold-higher activity than s. mutans nctc 10449, gs-5, and ingbritt strains. the enzyme in s. salivarius was activated by fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (fbp) twofold with 0.05 mm atp, but this intermediate was slightly inhibitory with 1.0 mm atp at fbp concentrations up to 10 mm. similar inhibition was observed with the enzyme from s. mutans ingbritt. a variety of other glycolytic intermediates had no effect on kinase activity under  these conditions. the activity and regulation of (ser)hpr kinase were assessed in vivo by monitoring p-(ser)-hpr formation in steady-state cells of s. mutans ingbritt grown in continuous culture with limiting glucose (10 and 50 mm) and with excess glucose (100 and 200 mm). all four forms of hpr [free hpr, p approximately (his)-hpr, p-(ser)-hpr, and p approximately (his)-p-(ser)-hpr] could be detected in the cells; however, significant differences in the intracellular levels of the forms were apparent during growth at different glucose concentrations. the total hpr pool increased with increasing concentrations of glucose in the medium, with significant increases in the p-(ser)-hpr and p approximately hhis)-p-(ser)-hpr concentrations. for example, while total pep-dependent phosphorylation [p approximately(his)-hpr plus p approximately (his)-p-(ser)-hpr] varied only from 21.5 to 52.5 microgram mg of cell protein (-1) in cells grown at the four glucose concentrations, the total atp-dependent phosphorylation [p-(ser)-hpr plus p approximately (his)-p-(ser)-hpr] increased 12-fold from the 10 mm glucose-grown cells (9.1 microgram mg of cell protein (-1) to 106 and 105 microgram mg(-1) in the 100 and  200 mm glucose-grown cultures, respectively. (ser)hpr kinase activity in membrane preparations of the cells varied little between the 10, 50, and 100 mm glucose-grown cells but increased threefold in the 200 mm glucose-grown cells. the intracellular levels of atp, glucose-6-phosphate, and fbp increased with external glucose concentration, with the level of fbp being 3.8-fold higher for cells grown with 200 mm glucose than for those grown with 10 mm glucose. however, the variation in the intracellular levels of fbp, particularly between cells grown with 100 and 200 mm glucose, did not correlate with the extent of p-(ser)-hpr formation, suggesting that the activity of (ser)hpr kinase is not critically dependent on the availability of intracellular fbp.

TI  == sequence, expression, and function of the gene for the nonphosphorylating, nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == we report the sequencing of a 2,019-bp region of the streptococcus mutans ng5 genome which contains a 1,428-bp open reading frame (orf) whose putative translation product had 50% identity to the amino acid sequences of the nonphosphorylating, nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenases (gapn) from maize and pea. this orf is located approximately 200 bp downstream of the ptsi gene coding for enzyme i of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system. mutant bch150, in which the putative gapn gene had been inactivated, lacked gapn activity that was present in the wild-type strain, thus positively identifying the orf as the s. mutans gapn gene. another strain of s. mutans, dc10, which contains an insertionally inactivated ptsi gene, still possessed gapn activity, as did s. salivarius atcc 25975, which contains an insertion element between the ptsi and gapn genes. since the wild-type s. mutans  ng5 lacks both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and nadh:nadp oxidoreductase activities, the nadp-dependent glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase is important as a means of generating nadph for biosynthetic reactions.

TI  == distribution of proteins similar to iiimanh and iiimanl of the streptococcus salivarius phosphoenolpyruvate:mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system among oral and nonoral bacteria.
AB  == in streptococcus salivarius, the phosphoenolpyruvate (pep):mannose-glucose phosphotransferase system, which concomitantly transports and phosphorylates mannose, glucose, fructose, and 2-deoxyglucose, is composed of the general energy-coupling proteins ei and hpr, the specific membrane-bound iiiman, and two  forms of a protein called iiiman, with molecular weights of 38,900 (iiimanh) and  35,200 (iiimanl), that are found in the cytoplasm as well as associated with the  membrane. several lines of evidence suggest that iiimanh and/or iiimanl are involved in the control of sugar metabolism. to determine whether other bacteria  possess these proteins, we tested for their presence in 28 oral streptococcus strains, 3 nonoral streptococcus strains, 2 lactococcus strains, 2 enterococcus strains, 2 bacillus strains, 1 lactobacillus strain, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. three approaches were used to determine whether the iiiman proteins were present in these bacteria: (i) western blot (immunoblot) analysis of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, using anti-iiimanh and anti-iiimanh rabbit  polyclonal antibodies; (ii) analysis of pep-dependent phosphoproteins by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; and (iii) inhibition by anti-iiiman antibodies of the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose (a mannose analog) by crude cellular extracts. only the species s. salivarius and streptococcus vestibularis possessed the two forms of iiiman. fifteen other streptococcal species possessed one protein with a molecular weight between 35,200 and 38,900 that cross-reacted with both antibodies. in the case of 9 species, a protein possessing the same electrophoretic mobility was phosphorylated at the expense of pep. no such phosphoprotein, however, could be detected in the other six species. a iii(man)-like protein with a molecular weight of 35,500 was also detected in lactobacillus casei by western blot experiments as well as by pep-dependent phosphoprotein analysis, and a protein with a molecular weight of 38,900 that cross-reacted with anti-iii(man) antibodies was detected in lactococcus lactis. in several cases, the involvement  of these putative iii(man) proteins in the pep-dependent phosphorylation of 2-deoxyglucose was substantiated by the inhibition of phosphorylation activity of anti-iii(man) antibodies. no proteins cross-reacting with anti-iii(man) antibodies were detected in enterococci, bacilli, and e. coli. in s. aureus, a membrane protein with a molecular weight of 50,000 reacted strongly with the antibodies. this protein, however, was not phosphorylated at the expense of pep.

TI  == effectiveness of ethylene oxide for sterilization of dental handpieces.
AB  == ethylene oxide gas has been utilized as an alternative method for sterilization of dental handpieces, as it is less corrosive than steam. however, its effectiveness for sterilization of the internal components of dental handpieces has not been established. the objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of ethylene oxide and steam for sterilization of dental handpieces. unused handpieces and handpieces which had been exposed to clinical dental procedures ('clinical') were contaminated with streptococcus mutans, exposed to steam or ethylene oxide, and flushed with sterile saline. washings were plated on mitis-salivarius agar, and colonies identified and counted. no viable colonies could be established from washings from 'clinical' or 'unused' handpieces exposed to steam. however, viable colonies could be established from 'clinical' handpieces exposed to ethylene oxide. this data suggests that a substance entrapped within 'clinical' handpieces (possibly the biofilm) may protect bacteria from ethylene oxide gas, preventing adequate sterilization.

AB  == the main purpose of the present study was to investigate the influence of delmopinol hydrochloride on the cell surface morphology of gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial cells by using transmission electron microscopy. a second purpose was to evaluate the extraction of cell wall material caused by delmopinol and the binding of radiolabelled delmopinol to the various strains. fresh isolates and type strains of gram-negative rods associated with periodontal disease, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and strains of the gram-positive streptococci streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius, were exposed to 3.2 mm (0.1%) or 6.4 mm (0.2%) delmopinol hydrochloride from 1 to 90 min. for electron microscopy the cells were fixed and negatively contrast-stained. treatment with 6.4 mm delmopinol for 1 min resulted in marked ultrastructural changes of cell wall components and the outer cell membrane of the 3 gram-negative species compared with control cells, whereas the gram-positive streptococci treated with delmopinol showed little or no morphologic alteration as compared with untreated cells. the result from the electron microscopy was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of proteins released from bacterial cells treated as for electron microscopy. more material was extracted from the gram-negative rods than from the gram-positive cocci. significantly more delmopinol bound to the gram-negative rods than to the streptococci. it appears that the amphiphilic properties of delmopinol make gram-negative rods more vulnerable to delmopinol than gram-positive streptococci.

TI  == differences in the detection and enumeration of mutans streptococci due to differences in methods.
AB  == different methods reported for assessing mutans streptococci (ms) make the direct comparisons of results across studies difficult. to quantitate the variations of  ms estimates attributable to differences in method, stimulated and unstimulated saliva samples and oral swab samples were compared with pooled dental-plaque samples. detection of ms in stimulated saliva samples was in excellent agreement  with the presence of ms in pooled plaque samples. ms detection in unstimulated saliva samples, however, was significantly discordant with that in either pooled  plaque or oral swab samples. when caries status was used as the criterion of validity of ms estimates, stimulated saliva samples demonstrated a sensitivity (94%) similar to that of pooled plaque samples, but exhibited a lower specificity (11%) than that of pooled plaque samples (17%). as a result, the measure of association between ms and caries was biased (towards null) when ms status was based on stimulated saliva samples. interestingly though, in enumerating ms, stimulated saliva samples yielded significantly higher levels of ms (about 1.5 log10 increase) with a lower variability compared to unstimulated saliva samples. the use of different culture media for detection of ms gave different results as  well. ms detection was poor (kappa = 0.31) and ms levels were lower (p = 0.0001)  when samples were grown on glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar compared to mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. together with the relative ease of  sampling and processing, these findings collectively justify the use of plaque samples for the qualitative assessment of ms and stimulated saliva samples for the quantitative assessment of ms, while providing a basis for adjustment of estimates when comparing results across studies.

AB  == the c-termini of the glucosyltransferases (gtfs) of oral streptococci are responsible for glucan binding. these glucan-binding domains (gbds) are composed  of a series of repeated sequences that have been classified into four different classes (a-d) by virtue of sequence similarity and which, by inference, have been suggested to be of functional importance. in contrast, we propose that repeat sequences evolve in response to selection for an increase in the number of copies of a particular domain through multiple duplication events occurring at different times. according to this hypothesis, repeats should possess various degrees of similarity, especially if only key residues are of functional importance. analysis of the gbds of the gtfs indicated that a common fundamental repeat, designated the "yg" repeat, could be discerned within the "a", "b", "c", and "d"  repeats. similar elements were also conserved in the ligand-binding repeats of the clostridium difficile toxins and the lysins and the pspa protein of streptococcus pneumoniae, suggesting that similar selective pressures had also been imposed on these sequences. analysis of the "yg" repeats present in the gtfj and gtfk of streptococcus salivarius indicated that some of the "yg" repeats in the gbds of these proteins had arisen as a result of duplication events involving a series of three sequential "yg" repeats.

TI  == sequence and expression of the genes for hpr (ptsh) and enzyme i (ptsi) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == we report the sequencing of a 2,242-bp region of the streptococcus mutants ng5 genome containing the genes for ptsh and ptsi, which encode hpr and enzyme i (ei), respectively, of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase transport system. the sequence was obtained from two cloned overlapping genomic fragments; one expresses hpr and a truncated ei, while the other expresses a full-length ei in escherichia coli, as determined by western immunoblotting. the  ptsi gene appeared to be expressed from a region located in the ptsh gene. the s. mutans ng5 pts operon does not appear to be linked to other phosphotransferase transport system proteins as has been found in other bacteria. a positive fermentation pattern on macconkey-glucose plates by an e. coli ptsi mutant harboring the s. mutans ng5 ptsi gene on a plasmid indicated that the s. mutans ng5 ei can complement a defect in the e. coli gene. this was confirmed by protein phosphorylation experiments with 32p-labeled phosphoenolpyruvate indicating phosphotransfer from the s. mutans ng5 ei to the e. coli hpr. two forms of the cloned ei, both truncated to varying degrees in the c-terminal region, were inefficiently phosphorylated and unable to complement fully the ptsi defect in the e. coli mutant. the deduced amino acid sequence of hpr shows a high degree of homology, particularly around the active site, to the same protein from other gram-positive bacteria, notably, s. salivarius, and to a lesser extent with those of gram-negative bacteria. the deduced amino acid sequence of s. mutans ng5 ei also shares several regions of homology with other sequenced eis, notably, with the region around the active site, a region that contains the only conserved cystidyl residue among the various proteins and which may be involved in substrate binding.

TI  == bactericidal action of tachyplesin i against oral streptococci.
AB  == tachyplesin i, a polycationic antimicrobial peptide isolated from hemocytes of horseshoe crabs, kills bacteria by disrupting the membrane potential of the cytoplasmic membrane. the present study shows that, among 36 oral streptococcal strains, 12 of 21 streptococcus sanguis, 3 streptococcus mutans, 9 streptococcus  salivarius and 3 streptococcus milleri strains were susceptible to tachyplesin i, whereas 9 s. sanguis strains were resistant. interestingly, these resistant strains include the clinical isolates from both kawasaki disease and behcet patients. according to the time-kill study, tachyplesin i inhibited irreversibly  the growth of s. sanguis, s. mutans and s. salivarius strains within 20 min and an s. milleri strain within 80 min. although it has been suggested that escherichia coli cultured in rich media were more susceptible to tachyplesin i, the present results show that only 3 s. milleri strains were more sensitized to tachyplesin i in a glucose-supplemented medium, and other tested strains were not. similarly, only 4 strains were more resistant to tachyplesin i in saline than these were in a rich medium.

TI  == conservation of salivary glycoprotein-interacting and human immunoglobulin g-cross-reactive domains of antigen i/ii in oral streptococci.
AB  == in this study we localized more precisely the salivary glycoprotein-interacting and the human immunoglobulin g (higg)-cross-reacting domains on the sr molecule,  an antigen i/ii-related protein from s. mutans serotype f. mapping of the sr molecule with polypeptides expressed by subclones covering the entire molecule and with synthetic peptides demonstrates that the salivary glycoprotein-binding domain is located in the n-terminal alanine-rich repeats of the sr molecule. in order to investigate the degree of conservation of both regions in various oral streptococci, we tested the reactivity of 8 representative strains of the mutans  group and 11 nonmutans oral streptococcus strains (s. anginosus, s. milleri, s. constellatus, s. intermedius, s. mitis, s. sanguis, s. gordonii, s. salivarius, and s. mitis strains) with antipeptide antibodies in a whole-cell enzyme linked immunosorbent assay together with colony hybridization analysis using dna probes  designed to map these two regions. all the mutans group strains except s. rattus  and the 11 nonmutans streptococcal strains showed a high conservation of the c-terminal part of the sr molecule, especially the higg-cross-reacting domain, and less homology for the n-terminal salivary glycoprotein-binding region. almost all of the sera from patients with rheumatic disease reacted strongly with sr from s. mutans serotype f, p1 from s. mutans serotype c, and four peptides located in the higg-cross-reacting region and not with peptides located at the c  and n termini and in the proline-rich repeats. these results confirm that epitopes located within this region are immunogenic in humans and could lead to the synthesis of natural anti-igg antibodies.

TI  == mucin-sulphatase activity of some oral streptococci.
AB  == mucin-sulphatase activity, measured using a 35s-[so4(2-)]-labelled colonic mucin  substrate, was detected in whole cells of streptococci isolated from the human oral cavity. the highest levels of sulphatase activity were found in all strains  of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and in half of the strains of streptococcus mutans tested. little or no activity was detected in 9 of the 11 streptococcus oralis strains examined, in the 4 streptococcus constellatus strains, and in the 3 streptococcus anginosus isolates tested. the highest enzyme levels were obtained from the two fresh streptococcus gordonii isolates. this is  the first report of such activity in oral microorganisms. streptococcal mucin-sulphatase may contribute to the destruction of salivary mucins and mitigate their protective functions in the oral cavity, and be a determinant in the development of dental caries.

TI  == low surface tension calcium hydroxide solution is an effective antiseptic.
AB  == the antimicrobial effects of a saturated calcium hydroxide solution, and in combination with 10% and 20% detergent, were evaluated on streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, neisseria  sp., diphtheroid, staphylococcus aureus, lactobacillus sp., staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis and candida albicans. the saturated calcium hydroxide solution was effective against only four of the 11 microorganisms studied over a 60-min exposure time. the calcium hydroxide solutions containing detergent killed all 11 test organisms over a 30-min exposure time. this difference was statistically significant (p < 0.01). no statistically significant difference in antimicrobial action was found between the 10% and 20% detergent calcium hydroxide solutions (p > 0.01). however, the low surface tension (46.5 x  10(-3) nm-1) and high ph (10.8) of the calcium hydroxide solution with 20% detergent establish it as the more effective solution.

TI  == interaction of the salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with the bacterium streptococcus salivarius hb.
AB  == the interaction of the human salivary glycoprotein ep-gp with a number of oral bacterial species, following incubation with human whole saliva, has been investigated. ep-gp could be detected with a specific monoclonal antibody, by means of elisa or by electrophoresis in combination with western transfer. the results indicated that ep-gp is bound only by streptococcus salivarius, and not by the other tested strains of bacteria, actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, bacteroides fragilis, s. gordonii, s. oralis, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. rattus, s. constellatus, and s. anginosus. binding of ep-gp to s. salivarius is mediated by a protein-protein interaction, which was found to be ph-dependent with a maximum binding between ph 5 and 6. for further characterization of the binding of ep-gp  to s. salivarius, four mutants were tested, each of them lacking different cell wall antigens. ep-gp was bound to all mutants in amounts comparable with the wildtype, in spite of the different surface antigen compositions. we were able to identify a 27-kd ep-gp binding protein, by extraction of s. salivarius-cell wall  antigens and electrophoretic techniques. in addition to ep-gp, s. salivarius also bound two other salivary proteins, namely, secretory iga and low-molecular-weight mucin (mg-2).

TI  == grouping of oral streptococcal species using fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy in comparison with classical microbiological identification.
AB  == the grouping and identification made by fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-ir) of 40 oral streptococcal strains was compared with their known taxonomic  positions. grouping was obtained by cluster analysis on the spectral distances between the first derivative spectra of the strains. spectra were divided into five spectral 'windows' and cluster analysis was either on either a combination of all five windows or on a selected window. the oral streptococci were divided into two main clusters, mutans streptococci and other streptococci. this division was based mainly on the spectral information contained in the window between 1300-900 cm-1, indicative of polysaccharide and phosphate-carrying compounds. in  the grouping based on the entire spectrum, species clusters could be observed for streptococcus crista, strep. salivarius and strep. rattus. a few strains were placed in wrong clusters because of intra-strain variance. it is concluded that the grouping of these oral streptococcal species was good and similar to the classical taxonomy and that ft-ir might develop into a new identification method  for oral streptococci.

TI  == antibacterial effectiveness of dentin bonding systems.
AB  == this study examined the antibacterial activities of several commercially available glass ionomer cements, dentin bonding systems and luting agents by employing both agar plate diffusion (apd) and growth inhibition (gi) methods. amalgam and resin composites were also tested as control materials. in both methods (apd and gi), cylindrical specimens were used. four bacteria strains were tested: streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. mitis and s. sanguis. these studies were performed using standardized innoculums with selective media, and the assayed materials were directly applied on the assay cultures and plates. the results of agar plate assay were in accordance with the results of growth inhibition method. the glass ionomer cements showed marked antibacterial activity. on the contrary, amalgam, composites, luting agents and dentinal bonding systems did not affect bacterial growth. the sensitivity of the growth method showed that all the strains were inhibited in the same way by each inhibitory material. the data suggest that the use of glass ionomer cements as cavity liners/bases may reduce the consequences of microleakage due to its antibacterial properties.

TI  == glucose stimulates camp accumulation in the oral bacterium actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == actinomyces viscosus t14v, a gram-positive bacterium found in the oral cavity, was found to be insensitive to glucose-mediated catabolite repression. basal levels of beta-galactosidase (18-26 u) were observed at all phases of growth regardless of the culture conditions. further, beta-galactosidase could not be induced with lactose, or with a known inducer of the enzyme, isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside, or with dibutyryl camp. glucose, on the other hand, stimulated camp accumulation in a concentration-dependent manner. fructose  and sucrose mimicked the effects of glucose on camp accumulation, whereas galactose, mannose and maltose had lesser stimulatory effects. other carbon sources, i.e., lactose, alpha-methylglucoside, ribose, xylose and succinate were  without effect. glucose and alpha-methylglucoside were found to stimulate camp accumulation in toluene-permeabilized cells, in the presence of the phosphodiesterase inhibitor, theophylline. glucose did not stimulate camp levels  in other gram-positive bacteria including streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis and s. salivarius but did cause camp accumulation in other strains of a. viscosus. the results suggest that glucose effects on camp metabolism are independent of the induction of beta-galactosidase as presently defined for escherichia coli, and that the effects appear to be selective to the a. viscosus bacteria. the results  also suggest that glucose stimulates camp accumulation via activation of adenylate cyclase.

TI  == the resistance and adaptation of selected oral bacteria to mercury and its impact on their growth.
AB  == selected strains of oral streptococcus and actinomyces have been tested for their ability to grow in the presence of mercury. strains were tested for growth on a semi-defined medium with low mercury-binding characteristics. sensitivities were  initially measured on agar plates, and subsequently, selected strains were grown  in broth so that the impact of mercury on the growth characteristics could be determined. streptococci were more resistant to mercury (5 micrograms/ml to 40 micrograms/ml) than actinomyces (< 5 micrograms/ml to 30 micrograms/ml). the most resistant streptococci included s. mitis biovar 1, s. salivarius, s. sobrinus, and one strain of s. mutans, all of which grew on agar with 40 micrograms/ml of mercury. two other s. mutans strains were more sensitive, being inhibited by 10 and 20 micrograms/ml mercury. the most resistant actinomyces was a. naeslundii genospecies 1 (atcc12104), which grew on medium with 30 micrograms/ml mercury; two strains of actinomyces were completely inhibited by 5 micrograms/ml. mercury  caused increased lag times and reduced cell density in broth cultures. enrichment cultures of samples of human dental plaque showed that streptococci were the most resistant organisms that could be cultured on the medium and that these strains could adapt to relatively high mercury concentrations. s. oralis and s. mitis biovar 1 were the most resistant organisms isolated from enriched cultures, growing in broth media with 65 micrograms/ml mercury. mercury was bound to cell walls and cell cytoplasm of streptococci grown in the presence of mercury.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == sequence of the gtfk gene of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 and evolution of the gtf genes of oral streptococci.
AB  == many strains of oral streptococci secrete glucosyltransferases (gtfs) that polymerize sucrose into glucans that form an integral part of the plaque matrix on the tooth surface. recently, we reported the cloning of two closely linked gtf-encoding genes (gtfj and gtfk) from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 as well as the sequence of gtfj, which encodes a primer-dependent gtf that synthesizes an insoluble product (a gtf-i). in this communication we report the sequence of gtfk, which encodes a primer-dependent gtf that synthesizes a soluble product (a gtf-s), as well as the sequence of a small downstream open reading frame of unknown function. the deduced sequence of gtfk was compared with those of seven other streptococcal gtfs and an unrooted phylogenetic tree constructed.  this analysis suggested that gtfs with similar product specificities do not form  phylogenetic clusters and was consistent with currently accepted phylogenetic schemes. the tree was tested by constructing a series of 'sub-trees' from different blocks of the alignment. evidence was obtained for recombination events involving gtfb and gtfc from s. mutans gs-5, gtfj and gtfk from s. salivarius, as well as the gtfi genes from s. downei and s. sobrinus. the recombination events between gtfb and gtfc, and between the two gtfi genes, were confirmed by examining divergences at silent sites.

TI  == the cell-bound fructosyltransferase of streptococcus salivarius: the carboxyl terminus specifies attachment in a streptococcus gordonii model system.
AB  == the ftf gene, coding for the cell-bound beta-d-fructosyltransferase (ftf) of streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975, has been analyzed, and its deduced amino acid sequence has been compared with that of the secreted ftf of streptococcus mutans and the levansucrases (sacbs) of bacillus species. a unique proline-rich region detected at the c terminus of the ftf of s. salivarius preceded a hydrophobic terminal domain. this proline-rich region was shown to possess strong homology to the product of the prgc gene from pcf10 in enterococcus faecalis, which encodes a pheromone-responsive protein of unknown function, as well as homology to the human proline-rich salivary protein prp-4. a series of 3'-oh deletions of the s. salivarius ftf gene expressed in streptococcus gordonii challis lgr2 showed that the c terminus was required for cell surface attachment  in this heterologous organism, as only the complete gene product was cell bound.  this cell-bound activity was released in the presence of sucrose, suggesting that the mode of attachment and release of the s. salivarius ftf in s. gordonii was similar to that in its native host.

TI  == longitudinal study of relations between human salivary antimicrobial proteins and measures of dental plaque accumulation and composition.
AB  == many studies have attempted to relate levels of antimicrobial proteins in saliva  to oral health; results have been inconsistent, and one reason might be inconsistency of measures of plaque and saliva within subjects. this study investigated associations between plaque and salivary variables in longitudinal data. whole saliva, and 8-h plaque pooled from buccal first permanent molars, was obtained from 32 dental students on tuesdays from 3:00-6:00 p.m. over 4 weeks. salivary flow rate was determined, and samples were assayed for lysozyme, lactoferrin, total peroxidase, myeloperoxidase, oscn-, siga and total protein. colonies on mitis-salivarius agar were assigned to streptococcus sanguis, strep.  mutans or strep. salivarius on the basis of morphology, supplemented by the api rapid strep identification system. consistency of values within subjects across weeks was evaluated by repeat-measures analysis of variance and intraclass correlation; data were transformed to reduce skewness. pearson's r was used to determine associations between plaque and salivary variables. significant intraclass correlations (alpha = 0.05) were found for all salivary variables except myeloperoxidase, and for total flora, total streptococci, strep. sanguis and strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci. significant pearson correlations with strep. sanguis as a proportion of total streptococci were found for total protein (r = -0.24), siga (r = -0.22), lactoferrin (r = -0.19) and oscn- (r = 0.20) when data from all weeks were pooled (n = 128). strep. sanguis proportions tended to be low in subjects with high values for salivary proteins;  the range of proportions was wider in subjects with low salivary values. these findings suggest some consistency of weekly values for many plaque and salivary variables. they also support previous cross-sectional data which suggested that salivary antimicrobial proteins may have some effect on plaque composition. this  study was made before recent revisions in streptococcal taxonomy, and further research is needed to clarify interactions of salivary proteins with currently defined species.

AB  == ph changes in human dental plaque in vivo from lactose and milk have been studied in four separate mouthrinse experiments. (1) ph was measured in plaque samples of 12 subjects before and after 6 weeks of frequent daily mouthrinsing with 10% lactose. the ph decreases were significantly more pronounced after the adaptation period than before (p < 0.001), 4 of the 12 subjects showing about the same low plaque ph from lactose as from glucose. (2) similar to the previous experiment, frequent daily mouthrinsing with low-fat bovine milk in 10 subjects resulted in more pronounced ph decreases in plaque after an adaptation period of 4 weeks (p < 0.001). (3) single mouthrinses, without any prior adaptation, with bovine standard milk, human breast milk, lactose-hydrolysed bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 5% sucrose were compared regarding the effect on plaque ph in 7 subjects. all solutions resulted in ph falls. the most pronounced were found with sucrose, followed by the lactose-hydrolysed milk. (4) bovine standard milk, 5% lactose and 10% sucrose were compared after a single mouthrinse in 5 subjects using interdental plaque ph wire telemetry. lactose and milk were fermented more  slowly than sucrose. in a separate study, acid production from lactose was also measured in two oral strains each of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis. the results from these experiments indicated that at least part of the lactose transport and catabolism in all studied streptococcus strains seems to be regulated by inducible enzymes.

TI  == prevalence of dental caries in 4- to 5-year-old children partly explained by presence of salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == the correlation between dental caries and the number of oral mutans group streptococci (ms) present has been shown to be weak. the aim of this investigation was to study associations between caries experience (decayed, missing, and filled surfaces [dmfs]) and the number of ms in stimulated saliva, with emphasis on the level of disease and the confounding effect of regular intake of sweets, the presence of salivary lactobacilli, and oral hygiene. in some 2,700 4- to 5-year-old south african children of different ethnic origins, caries was diagnosed on the basis of world health organization criteria and saliva samples were analyzed for ms after cultivation on mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar and for lactobacilli by using the dentocult kit. oral  hygiene was scored on the basis of the greene and vermillion simplified debris index, while data on intake of sweets were derived from extensive interviews. pearson's coefficient of correlation was computed, and multiple regression analysis was performed to correct for confounding factors. the distribution of the children in the eight caries classes was strongly associated with the ms class (p < 0.001), with those in the lower ms classes generally having low dmfs scores and those in the higher ms classes having dmfs scores distributed over the whole range. the r value for the two variables was 0.25 for the total material; this was reduced to 0.18 by correction for confounding factors. the corresponding values for children with caries were 0.21 and 0.17, for those in the 1 to 6 dmfs  interval they were 0.07 and 0.03, and for those in the 7 to 81 dmfs interval they were 0.16 and 0.14. the data imply that the explanatory values for ms, those for  the lower caries interval not counted, ranged from 6 to 2%. the unexpected results for children with caries might be due to their distribution pattern. it is concluded that there is a need for reevaluation of ms as a risk factor in dental caries.

TI  == emergence of immune competence in saliva.
AB  == saliva contains essentially no iga at birth. however, secretory immune responses  to oral and non-oral microbial antigens emerge early in life. we have investigated the characteristics of these responses in salivas of infants less than 1 month through 4 years of age, using cross-sectional and longitudinal approaches. antibody specificities (iga, iga1, and iga2) were measured in elisa and western blot analysis to antigens of streptococcus mitis and s. salivarius that colonize during the neonatal period. antibodies reactive with s. sanguis and mutans streptococci, which colonize later in the infant's life, were also determined. concurrent investigation of the oral flora of each infant was performed and related to the observed antibody specificities. the secretory nature of the immunoglobulins in these salivas was analyzed immunologically and chromatographically. the primary molecular form of salivary iga was dimeric in all salivas tested. both iga subclasses were found, although a subset of infant salivas initially contained > 90% iga1. igm (> 1 microgram/ml) was detected in 58% of 3- to 17-week-old infants. by 2 months of age, salivas from most infants contained iga antibody reactive with at least two s. mitis components. many salivas also contained antibody reactive with s. salivarius components. by the end of the first year, most salivas contained iga1 and iga2 antibody to s. mitis  antigens. maturation of secretory responses in the second and third year was evidenced by the appearance of increased concentrations and additional specificities of salivary iga antibodies to s. mitis antigens. antibody to s. mitis, s. salivarius, and s. sanguis extracellular components was detected only after infection with the respective species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == adults (35-45 yr old) and children (5 and 12 yr old) recently arrived in israel from rural areas in ethiopia were examined. caries levels were low: e.g. dmft = 0.31 among 12-yr-olds, and 1.27 amongst adults. the 5-yr-olds were 86.8% caries-free, while 12-yr-olds were 81.8% and adults 54% caries-free respectively. according to interview data, the diet in ethiopia had been based on local agricultural products and was almost sugar-free. the mean total count of salivary bacteria, as determined on blood agar, was 3.4 x 10(8); mean count of streptococcus viridans, on mitis salivarius, was 6.7 x 10(7); and mean count of s. mutans, as determined on mitis salivarius with bacitracin, was 1.7 x 10(7). these levels were all high and were not significantly different from a control group of 20 israelis. the mean number of lactobacilli, on rogosa agar, was 2.75 x 10(4), which was significantly higher than among the controls (3.6 x 10(3). salivary ph levels were generally similar between the ethiopian group and the controls. salivary flow was significantly higher for the ethiopians (1.93 ml/min) than for controls (1.16 ml/min). low levels of caries in this population can be attributed to an almost sugar-free diet and high salivary flow, but not to the composition of oral microflora.

TI  == immunoglobulin a antibody activity to mutans streptococci in parotid, submandibular and whole saliva.
AB  == antigen extracts of 9 strains of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus mitis were separated in acrylamide gels by electrophoresis. strains of the same genotype of mutans streptococci were found to have virtually identical sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis patterns but differed clearly from other genotypes of mutans or with the reference strains s. salivarius and s. mitis. immunoglobulin a (iga) antibody activity to antigens of s. mutans, s. sobrinus and s. mitis in the parotid, submandibular and whole saliva of 12 people was detected by western blotting. iga antibodies reacted with several of the antigens, and the reaction pattern was unique for each of the individuals. to certain antigens, all the salivas blotted bands if both clear and questionable bands were counted. significantly more blotted bands were revealed with antigens from s. mutans than  s. sobrinus. the results of the 3 different salivas of the same individual had a  high degree of resemblance but in a few individuals, more blotted bands were obtained with parotid saliva to s. mutans and s. sobrinus antigens.

TI  == characterization of the streptococcus mutans gs-5 frua gene encoding exo-beta-d-fructosidase.
AB  == the complete nucleotide sequence (5,010 bp) of the fructanase gene (frua) and flanking regions of the chromosome of streptococcus mutans gs-5 was determined. the frua gene appears to be the sole transcript arising from a proximal promoter. the presumed precursor of the secreted frua protein consists of 1,423 amino acids, and it has an m(r) of 158,656 and a pi of 4.82. the n terminus of frua has characteristics in common with signal peptides of gram-positive organisms. the c  terminus consists of a serine- and threonine-rich region, followed by the peptide lpdtgd, 4 charged amino acids, 21 amino acids with a strongly hydrophobic character, and a charged pentapeptide tail, which are proposed to correspond to the wall-spanning region, the lpxtgx consensus sequence, and the membrane-spanning domains of surface-associated proteins of gram-positive cocci.  the frua protein has significant homology with the bacillus subtilis levanase (sacc), the bacteroides fragilis levanase (scrl), yeast invertases, and a number  of other beta-fructosidases but not with fructosyltransferase, glucosyltransferases, or glucan-binding proteins of oral streptococci. genes with homology to frua were detected in s. mutans serotype c, e, and f strains, streptococcus rattus, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus sanguis. a deletion derivative of frua lacking the c-terminal 437 amino acids was still functional and could hydrolyze beta-(2,6)- and beta-(2,1)-linked sugars, but with altered preference for substrates. the data begin to define functional domains of the frua protein and potential regulatory sites for induction, repression, growth rate control, and posttranslational localization of this multifunctional enzyme.

AB  == the streptococcus mutans glucosyltransferase (gtf) genes gtfb and gtfc were ligated into escherichia coli-streptococcus shuttle plasmids and introduced into  streptococcus milleri. gtfb transformant ksb8 formed an s. mutans-like rough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed an extracellular gtf-i, of 158 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-is, of 158 and 135 kda. gtfc transformant ksc43 formed a semirough colony on mitis salivarius agar and expressed primarily an extracellular gtf-si, of 146 kda, and two cell-bound gtf-sis, of 146 and 152 kda. the extracellular gtfs from ksb8 and ksc43 were purified and characterized. the two types of gtf also reacted specifically with monoclonal antibodies directed against each enzyme. both enzymes synthesized significant amounts of oligosaccharides, consisting primarily of alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages, as well  as water-insoluble glucans, containing alpha-1,3-glucosidic linkages. insoluble-glucan-synthesizing activities of both enzymes were stimulated (three-  to sixfold) by the addition of dextran t10 and were inhibited in the presence of  1.5 m ammonium sulfate. the km(s) for sucrose and the optimal phs were also similar for both enzymes. however, when the transformants were grown in todd-hewitt broth supplemented with sucrose, ksc43 cells, expressing gtf-si activity, adhered to glass surfaces in vitro, while ksb8 cells, expressing gtf-i  activity, did not. these results are discussed relative to the potential role of  the gtfb and gftc genes in s. mutans cariogenicity.

TI  == [morphologic and biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque].
AB  == the purposes of this study were to give the characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from dental plaque, and the relationships with dental caries. we stained 69 patients' teeth on supragingival plaques (plaque index = 1) with the pfiffer's reagent or fd&c red#28 dye, then isolated 80 strains of oral streptococci from 69 patients. cultures were grown in tsb, ms, and msb media. a total of 80 fresh-isolated plaque streptococci, including strains of s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans were identified on the basis of morphologic, dark field, sem, and biochemical characteristics. all of the oral plaque streptococci were to be found in significant percentages in dental plaque. patients who had caries harboured s. mutans more often (37/40) than patients without caries (7/29). s. mutans comprised the greatest percentage (37/69) of microorganisms encountered in caries' plaque, and there was an association between high counts of s. mutans and the presence of dental caries. cultural and  biochemical methods were used for the isolation and identification of the different species of s. mutans. the result indicated that biotype i were the most predominant species (50%) in dental plaque. thus, it is possible to isolate, screen and identify unknown strains through the morphologic, darkfield, sem, and  biochemical characteristics of viridans streptococci isolated from human dental plaque. by means of the present methods for identification, we hold considerable  promises for contributing to the prevention and diagnosis of dental diseases.

TI  == multibacterial artificial plaque. a model for studying carious process.
AB  == a multibacterial artificial plaque was established in vitro on enamel slabs incubated in mixed culture of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans (serotype c), streptococcus salivarius, lactobacillus casei and actinomyces viscosus. typical structure same as natural plaque was seen under microscope. the caries-like lesion produced under the plaque was observed in enamel sections. the lesion was similar in appearance to natural ones under optic and scanning electron microscopes. the acids produced in both culture media and artificial plaque were similar in composition and type to those produced in natural plaque after sugar attack. it is suggested that this kind of plaque model may be useful  in studying carious process in vitro, because it is easily controlled either by changing the composition of bacteria or by adding different kinds of nutrient in  the media. moreover, the results will be easier to explain than those produced in natural ones.

AB  == the oral micro-organism streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 synthesizes extracellular glucosyltransferases (gtfs) which polymerize the glucose moiety of  sucrose into glucan polymers. two separate genes encoding the activities of a gtf-i (a gtf that synthesizes an insoluble product) and a gtf-s (a gtf that synthesizes soluble product) were cloned into bacteriophage lambda l47.1. the inserts in the lambda-clones were characterized by restriction mapping and southern hybridization and were found to overlap, implying that the two genes lay very close to one another on the s. salivarius chromosome. both genes were subcloned into phagemid vector pibi30 where they were expressed at a high level.  the gtf-i-encoding gene was named gtfj and the gtf-s-encoding gene, gtfk. nucleotide sequencing showed that gtfj and most probably gtfk were closely related to the gtf genes of the mutans streptococci. sequence alignment also indicated that gtfk lay very close to and downstream from gtfj, and that both were transcribed in the same direction.

TI  == enumeration of oral streptococci on media containing different concentrations of  sodium and potassium ions.
AB  == laboratory "type" strains of oral streptococci were screened for their ability to grow on mitis-salivarius agar (msa) in the presence of increasing concentrations  of either na+ or k+ up to 500 mmol/l. strains were generally better able to withstand increasing concentrations of na+ than k+, although low numbers of colony-forming units (cfus) were seen with the highest concentration of either cation. two strains of streptococcus mutans, ingbritt 162 and ingbritt 175, behaved differently when the concentration of cation was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l; the latter showed a marked increase in the number of cfus when the na+ concentration was increased from 50 to 200 mmol/l, whereas there was a decrease with strain ingbritt 162. strains of oral streptococci from the saliva of adults  and children were isolated on modified msa containing known concentrations of na+ and k+ and further examined if they showed "mutans-like" colony morphology. the number of cfus generally dropped as the concentration of na+ or k+ was increased  from 200 to 350 or 500 mmol/l. greater numbers of streptococci were tolerant to na+ than to k+. half of the isolates were members of the streptococcus sanguis group (ssg), either streptococcus mitis or s. sanguis ii, and these were more tolerant to high concentrations of na+ or k+ than other isolates that were identified as streptococcus morbillorum, streptococcus acidominimus, and streptococcus milleri.

AB  == the protein, hpr, a necessary component of the phosphoenolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (pts) in bacteria, was purified from streptococcus salivarius by column chromatography. the purified preparation gave only one band  when analyzed by sodium dodecylsulfate gel electrophoresis or by isoelectric focusing in polyacrylamide gel (pi = 4.85). however, electrophoresis in tris-containing buffers under non-denaturing conditions revealed 2 bands that could be phosphorylated by pep in the presence of enzyme i of the pts or by atp with the hpr kinase. homogeneous preparations of these 2 forms could be obtained  by preparative electrophoresis. each preparation exhibited only 1 band when analyzed by electrophoresis under non-denaturing conditions, indicating that the  doublet observed before preparative electrophoresis was not an electrophoretic artefact. the electrophoretic mobility of each protein was not modified following heat-treatment at 100 degrees c for 20 min or storage at -40 degrees c for several months. both hpr proteins catalyzed in vitro the pep-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, but at a rate slightly lower than that observed with  a preparation of hpr containing both forms of the protein. both forms were also able to transfer the phosphate group from pep to the other specific pts proteins  known in s salivarius. rabbit polyclonal antibodies directed against each form reacted with both proteins. the presence of the 2 forms of hpr was detected in fresh cellular extracts of s salivarius; however, their intracellular ratio varied according to growth conditions. a doublet was also found in many other streptococcal species tested (s mutans, s sobrinus, s sanguis, s thermophilus, s  bovis, s rattus) and also in l lactis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == direct observations of cooperative effects in oral streptococcal adhesion to glass by analysis of the spatial arrangement of adhering bacteria.
AB  == the spatial arrangement of two strains of oral bacteria adhering on glass was studied in order to investigate cooperative effects in their adhesion mechanisms. streptococcus salivarius hb was a strain which possessed several classes of fibrillar surface appendages, whereas on the cell surface of s. mutants ns no surface appendages could be identified. the bacteria were deposited from a flowing suspension with various buffer concentrations on the bottom glass plate of a parallel plate flow cell and were observed directly with a video camera mounted on a phase contrast microscope. the positions of all adhering bacteria were determined by means of automated real time image analysis and subsequently employed for calculating radial and angular pair distribution functions. pair distribution functions indicate the average relative number density of bacteria around one deposited bacterium as a function of the radial distance or the angular orientation relative to the flow direction. from the calculated pair distribution functions of both bacterial strains it was concluded that cooperative effects contributed to the adhesion of s. salivarius hb, but not to adhesion of s. mutants ns. it was suggested that these cooperative effects originate from the surface appendages of s. salivarius hb.

TI  == sialidase activity of the "streptococcus milleri group" and other viridans group  streptococci.
AB  == viridans group streptococci were examined for the production of sialidase (neuraminidase) activity, using the fluorescent substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-d-n-acetylneuraminic acid in a simple and rapid (15-min) assay. sialidase was produced by all strains of streptococcus oralis and s. intermedius and by a majority of s. mitis strains. s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s.  gordonii, s. sanguis, s. vestibularis, s. salivarius, s. anginosus, s. constellatus, "s. parasanguis," and the "tufted fibril group" were uniformly negative. sialidase production may be a useful characteristic to assist in the identification of viridans group streptococci.

TI  == effect of tif4 solutions on bacterial growth in vitro and on tooth surfaces.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to assess the antimicrobial effect of tif4 as compared with equimolar solutions of naf, apf, and snf2 and to evaluate the effect, if any, on bacterial growth on topically treated tooth surfaces. in an in vitro study, paper discs impregnated with 20 microliters of equimolar solutions of snf2, naf, apf, and tif4 were placed on blood agar plates seeded with streptococcus mutans and bacteroides gingivalis. sterile saline was used as control. similar growth inhibition zones were found for all fluorides. in the second part of the study six volunteers carried intraoral appliances containing enamel and root surface specimens treated with 1% tif4 and untreated specimens for 18 h. scanning electron microscopic examination of the experimental tooth surfaces showed great variation in bacterial growth between subjects, but no systematic difference between fluoride-treated and untreated specimens. bacteria  from test and control specimens were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions on blood agar and on mitis salivarius agar. colony-forming unit counts showed great interindividual variations, but no differences could be observed between treated and untreated enamel or root surfaces. thus, the hypothesis that the presence of a ti-rich coating may influence bacterial colonization on tif4-treated tooth surfaces could not be substantiated.

TI  == coaggregation of streptococcus sanguis and other streptococci with candida albicans.
AB  == thirteen strains of viridans group streptococci and two strains of other streptococci were tested for coaggregation with candida albicans. streptococcus sanguis strains generally exhibited low levels of adherence to 28 degrees c-grown exponential-phase yeast cells, but starvation of yeast cells for glucose at 37 degrees c (or at 28 degrees c) increased their coaggregating activity with these  streptococci by at least tenfold. this was a property common to four c. albicans  strains tested, two of which were able to form mycelia (6406 and men) and two of  which were not (mm2002 and ca2). the expression of the coaggregation adhesin during yeast cell starvation was inhibited by addition of trichodermin or amphotericin b. the strains of s. sanguis, streptococcus gordonii, and streptococcus oralis tested for coaggregating activity encompassed a diverse range of physiological and morphological types, yet all exhibited saturable coaggregation with starved c. albicans cells. there was no correlation of cell surface hydrophobicity, of either yeast or streptococcal cells, with their abilities to coaggregate. strains of streptococcus anginosus also coaggregated with starved yeast cells; streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus pyogenes coaggregated to a lesser degree with c. albicans, and the coaggregation with s. pyogenes was not promoted by yeast cell starvation; streptococcus mutans and enterococcus faecalis did not coaggregate with yeast. the coaggregation reactions of s. sanguis and s. gordonii with c. albicans were inhibited by edta and by heat or protease treatment of the yeast cells and were not reversible by the addition  of lactose or other simple sugars. these observations extend the range of intergeneric coaggregations that are known to occur between oral microbes and suggest that coaggregations of c. albicans with viridans group streptococci may be important for colonization of oral surfaces by the yeast.

TI  == effect of chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel applied by tray or by toothbrush on salivary mutans streptococci.
AB  == a chlorhexidine (1%)-sodium fluoride (0.2%) gel applied using a dental tray six times during two consecutive days significantly decreased salivary levels of mutans streptococci but had only a slight effect on salivary levels of lactobacilli. the same gel used as a dentifrice for one week (twice a day) also significantly reduced salivary levels of mutans streptococci. however, this treatment was somewhat less effective than that using trays, on the basis of the  ratio of mutans streptococci to total aerobes. with both treatments baseline salivary levels of mutans streptococci were re-attained after 70 days. one day after the gel treatment, mutans streptococci were unable to adhere to plastic strips (dentocult sm strip mutans) but detectable growth was found on mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. this suggests that not only are numbers of mutans streptococci reduced after chlorhexidine-sodium fluoride gel treatment but also mutans streptococci adherence.

AB  == ten strains of oral streptococci, comprising nine species, were screened for their in vitro cohesive interactions with a freshly isolated strain of neisseria  pharyngis. strains of mutans streptococci, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis i, streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitis were able  to cohere with n. pharyngis cells attached to a salivary pellicle adsorbed to glass. the cohesion was either due to coaggregation between the different genera  or modification of the salivary pellicle by n. pharyngis mw2. s. sanguis ii and streptococcus oralis strains could not cohere with the n. pharyngis strain. extracellular polysaccharide formed from sucrose was found to mediate cohesion between certain strains of mutans streptococci or s. oralis and n. pharyngis mw2.

TI  == comparison of the initial streptococcal microflora on dental enamel in caries-active and in caries-inactive individuals.
AB  == this study compared the initial (4 h) microflora on enamel in 7 caries-active and in 7 caries-inactive adolescents. in both groups the microflora was dominated by  streptococci which comprised 61 and 78% (median values) of the total viable counts in caries-active and caries-inactive individuals, respectively (p less than 0.01). identification of a total of 700 streptococcal isolates according to  a recently revised classification showed that the predominant streptococci belonged to the species streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis biovar 1, and streptococcus sanguis. early plaque from caries-inactive individuals differed from that of caries-active individuals by significantly higher proportions of s.  sanguis (p less than 0.05) and iga1 protease producing streptococci (p less than  0.05). in caries-active individuals, there was a tendency to elevated levels of s. mitis biovar 1 (p less than 0.10). in addition, caries-active individuals were colonized by significantly higher numbers of mutans streptococci on the enamel surfaces (p less than 0.01). however, in both groups streptococcus mutans (serotype c) comprised less than or equal to 2% of the early streptococcal flora. streptococcus gordonii, s. mitis biovar 2, and streptococcus salivarius were present in low proportions and did not show differences in distribution that could be related to caries activity. the observed differences in the composition  of the early streptococcal microflora may be a factor that governs the eventual cariogenic potential of dental plaque.

TI  == saliva-induced aggregation of oral streptococci and the influence of blood group  reactive substances.
AB  == aggregation of strains of streptococcus rattus, strep. mutans and strep. salivarius by saliva from individuals of blood groups a, b and o was investigated. blood group a salivas had a significantly higher aggregation activity with strep. rattus than blood group b salivas (p less than 0.05). however, strep. mutans and strep. salivarius were better aggregated by blood group b saliva and this was significant for strep. mutans (p less than 0.05). for all three strains, the variance within blood group o was too large to give significant differences with either blood group a or b. the blood group a-specific carbohydrate, n-acetyl-d-galactosamine, inhibited aggregation of strep. rattus, but not of the other strains. the blood group b-specific carbohydrate, d-galactose, inhibited aggregation of strep. mutans but not of strep. rattus or strep. salivarius. l-fucose, specific for blood group o failed to inhibit aggregation of any of the three strains. these findings suggest that blood group-specific substances may be involved in bacterial aggregation.

TI  == properties of a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) extracted from intact cells of streptococcus sanguis.
AB  == cells of streptococcus sanguis strain challis were incubated with sodium lauroylsarcosinate to extract surface proteins. a polypeptide of apparent molecular mass 16 kda comprising about 12% of the extract was purified using anion-exchange chromatography. the polypeptide was shown to be a phosphocarrier protein (hpr) that could also be found in the soluble (cytoplasmic) fraction from cells broken by homogenization with glass beads. in vivo labelling of s. sanguis  cells with 32pi showed that the polypeptide carried a heat- and acid-stable phosphorylation and that during sucrose starvation the hpr became dephosphorylated. antiserum raised to the s. sanguis hpr reacted on western blots with hprs from all oral streptococci tested, together with strains of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius, but not with hprs from s. faecalis or s. bovis, nor with proteins from staphylococcus aureus, bacillus subtilis, actinomyces viscosus and  various lactobacilli. the s. sanguis hpr had a high content of alanine (17.2%) and was similar in overall amino acid composition to the hprs from s. mutans an s. salivarius. the n-terminal residues (to 37) of the s. sanguis hpr showed strong sequence identity (82%) with the n-terminal sequence of s. faecalis hpr. it is suggested that hpr in s. sanguis is associated closely with the cytoplasmic membrane. non-disruptive methods of removing cell-surface proteins from streptococci effect release of hpr and possibly other cytoplasmic components.

TI  == molecular surface characterization of oral streptococci by fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  == in order to characterize the molecular composition of oral streptococci, infrared transmission spectroscopy on freeze-dried cells dissolved in kbr was used. all infrared spectra show similar absorption bands for the strains studied with the most important absorption bands located at 2930 cm-1 (ch), 1653 cm-1 (ami), 1541  cm-1 (amii) and two bands at 1236 cm-1 and 1082 cm-1, which were assigned to phosphate and sugar groups. however, calculation of absorption band ratios normalized with respect to the integrated intensity of the ch stretching region around 2930 cm-1, show significant differences between the strains. both streptococcus mitis strains possess high ami/ch and amii/ch absorption band ratios compared to the other strains. streptococcus salivarius hbc12, a mutant strain devoid of all proteinaceous surface appendages, shows significantly lower  ami/ch and amii/ch band ratios with respect to its parent strain s. salivarius hb. two positive relationships could be established both between the amii/ch absorption band ratio and the n/c elemental surface concentration ratio of the strains previously, determined from x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) and also between ami/ch and the fraction of carbon atoms at the surface involved in amide bonds, determined by xps as well. from this comparison, it is concluded that transmission infrared spectroscopy can be employed as a technique to study the molecular surface composition of freeze-dried microorganisms.

AB  == physiological reactions of viridans streptococci were examined by the api-20strep system and a selection of conventional tests. cluster analysis of these results produced a classification similar to a taxonomic scheme based on that of colman and williams. the organisms could be divided into the six recognised species--streptococcus mutans, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and s. milleri. analysis confirmed that s. mitior and s. sanguis can be distinguished in the api-20strep test by hydrolysis of arginine but not by dextran production.  although s. mutans, s. mitior and s. sanguis can be divided into two further subgroups, the taxonomic significance of this is unclear. with this means of classification, most organisms could be identified easily by a small number of tests. api-20strep is convenient for performing physiological tests on viridans streptococci, but the information provided by the manufacturers in regard to identification and nomenclature is in need of revision.

AB  == a lactate dehydrogenase-deficient (ldh-) mutant of a human isolate of streptococcus mutans serotype c was tested in a gnotobiotic rat caries model. compared with the wild-type ldh-positive (ldh+) strains, it was significantly (alpha less than or equal to 0.005) less cariogenic in experiments with two different sublines of sprague-dawley rats. the ldh- mutant strain 044 colonized the oral cavity of the test animals to the same extent as its parent strain 041,  although its initial implantation was slightly but not significantly (p greater than or equal to 0.2) less. multiple oral or fecal samples plated on 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium indicator medium revealed no evidence of back mutation from ldh- to ldh+ in vivo. both ldh+ strain 041 and ldh- strain 044 demonstrated  bacteriocinlike activity in vitro against a number of human strains of mutans streptococci representing serotype a (s. cricetus) and serotypes c and e (s. mutans). serotypes b (s. rattus) and f (s. mutans) and strains of s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were not inhibited. thus, ldh mutant strain 044 possesses a number of desirable traits that suggest it should be investigated further as a possible effector strain for replacement therapy of dental caries. these traits include its stability and low cariogenicity in the sensitive gnotobiotic rat caries model, its bacteriocinlike activity against certain other  cariogenic s. mutans (but not against more inocuous indigenous oral streptococci), and the fact that it is a member of the most prevalent human serotype of cariogenic streptococci.

AB  == selected strains of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to degrade wheat starch, maltose, maltotriose, and maltoheptaose. s. sanguis iuom-11m and jc804, s. mutans 6715, s. salivarius iuom-8, a. viscosus iuom-62, and a. naeslundii atcc 12104 degraded all four substrates. s. mutans nctc 10449 degraded starch, maltose, and maltotriose, while a. viscosus atcc 15987 degraded starch and maltose, and s. sanguis ss34 degraded only maltose. l. casei iuom-14 did not  degrade any of the substrates. analysis of starch degradation products from s. sanguis iuom-11m and a. viscosus iuom-62 demonstrated oligosaccharides, maltose,  and trace amounts of glucose for the former and oligosaccharides, maltotriose, and maltose for the latter. s. sanguis iuom-11m alpha-glucosidase (ec 3.2.1.20) demonstrated a ph optimum of 6.5 and greatly enhanced activity from maltose-cultured cells as compared with cells cultured in glucose or fructose. the presence of fructose in the growth medium prevented this enhancement of activity by maltose. maltose inhibited sucrose-dependent synthesis of s. sanguis  iuom-11m insoluble polysaccharide and both primer-dependent and primer-independent synthesis of soluble polysaccharide. maltoheptaose inhibited primer-dependent but not primer-independent soluble polysaccharide synthesis. several oral bacteria have the ability to hydrolyze starch and to degrade further the products to acidogenic substrates. these products may also inhibit sucrose-dependent synthesis of polysaccharides, which enhances the production of  the acidogenic substrate fructose. the results add further support to the growing body of evidence suggesting that caries-promoting properties of starch may be expressed only when starch is present in diets containing sucrose.

TI  == gallotannins inhibit growth, water-insoluble glucan synthesis, and aggregation of mutans streptococci.
AB  == during screening for anti-plaque agents of plant origin, ethanolic extracts from  melaphis chinensis (bell), the chinese nutgall, exhibited strong inhibition of glucosyltransferase (gtf), in vitro adherence and glucan-induced agglutination of streptococcus mutans 3209 and s. sobrinus b13. more than 91% inhibition of water-insoluble glucan synthesis from sucrose by gtf was noted at a concentration as low as 7.8 micrograms/ml. bactericidal effects on other mutans streptococci, s. salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus were also evident. through chemical fractionation and analyses, along with bioassays, the active components were identified as gallotannins.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of topical anesthetic liquids containing lidocaine or benzocaine.
AB  == six species of microorganisms commonly found within the oral cavity were exposed  for either one minute or two hours to 5% lidocaine liquid topical anesthetic and  benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic. mixtures of microorganisms and anesthetics  were diluted and plated onto a brain heart infusion medium. reduction in cell viability was 73-100% after exposure to the anesthetic agents when compared with  the saline/buffer controls. a significant reduction (p < .005) in cell growth by  streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, s. salivarius, actinomyces viscosus,  and candida albicans was associated with a one-minute and two-hour exposure to lidocaine, benzocaine, 5% lidocaine, and the benzocaine vehicle control. five percent lidocaine reduced growth of the test orgainisms more than benzocaine in one-minute exposures to s. mutans, a. viscosus and s. salivarius and with a two-hour exposure to s. salivarius.five percent lidocaine was bacteriocidal or fungicidal to all microorganisms for both time periods whereas, benzocaine liquid topical anesthetic was predominately bacteriostatic or fungistatic after one-minute exposures and bacteriocidal or fungicidal after two hours.the results  indicated that two dental liquid topical anesthetics containing lidocaine or benzocaine possessed considerable antimicrobial activity to selected oral microorganisms. the exclusive use of a topical liquid anesthetic may be an adequate means to render the oral mucosa aseptic before injection of a local anesthetic.

TI  == partial characterisation of the inhibitory substances produced by streptococcus oralis and related species.
AB  == the production of inhibitory substances was sought by deferred antagonism. streptococcus oralis, streptococcus mitis and streptococcus sanguis produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide, but no detectable bacteriocin.  actinomycetes and neisseria pharyngis were particularly susceptible to the lethal action of hydrogen peroxide. streptococcus milleri produced bactericidal concentrations of hydrogen peroxide and bacteriocin-like substances. s. oralis strains were inhibited by the bacteriocin-like products of strains of streptococcus bovis, streptococcus faecalis, streptococcus mutans and streptococcus salivarius. inhibition was due neither to complete bacteriophage nor to fermentation end-products. extracellular polysaccharides formed during growth could not protect sensitive strains from the effect of hydrogen peroxide or bacteriocin-like substances.

TI  == in-vitro adherence of oral streptococci in the presence of sucrose and its relationship to cariogenicity in the rat.
AB  == streptococcus sanguis i gave a significantly greater percentage coverage (cell-pellicle attachment) of saliva-coated glass in the presence of sucrose than did strep. sanguis ii (p less than 0.025), and both these gave greater percentage coverages than the other species tested, between which no significant differences were noted. there was a large number of significant differences in clump size (cell-cell attachment) between species-pairs. among the mutans streptococci, there were significant differences in the percentage coverage between streptococcus rattus/streptococcus mutans (p less than 0.05) and strep. rattus/streptococcus sobrinus (p less than 0.01), and in clump size between all species-pairs with the exception of streptococcus cricetus or strep. sobrinus and strep. mutans. the rank order of species in relation to fissure caries was mutans streptococci greater than streptococcus salivarius greater than streptococcus milleri greater than strep. sanguis greater than streptococcus faecalis greater than streptococcus mitis greater than streptococcus lactis. there was a significant correlation between percentage coverage in vitro and fissure caries in vivo for strains of strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05) and pooled strains of strep. mitis and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.01). on comparing data for adherence in the presence or the absence of sucrose, the sugar had no effect on the percentage coverage of the seven species tested, but significantly increased  the clump size of the mutans streptococci (p less than 0.01) and strep. sanguis (p less than 0.05).

TI  == bactericidal activity of teicoplanin in an in-vitro two-compartment kinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of teicoplanin was studied in a model system in which antibiotic concentration is continuously varied. a two-compartment open model was used to reproduce, in vitro serum pharmacokinetics of teicoplanin in humans during 24 h after iv administration. staphylococcal and streptococcal strains of  various species were tested. teicoplanin showed rapid killing of staphylococcus epidermidis and staph. hominis. all strains of staph. epidermidis were rapidly killed in spite of the high mic values (4-16 mg/l). the killing effect against staph. haemolyticus was less rapid and marked than against staph. epidermidis, with strain to strain variation. a 99.9% kill was achieved for most strains within 22 h, but with other isolates regrowth occurred which was due to the presence of highly resistant cells in the original population. other staphylococci (staph. aureus, staph. saprophyticus) and streptococcus pyogenes, str. bovis and str. salivarius were reduced by 99.9% within 22 h. bactericidal activity against other streptococci (str. mutans, str. agalactiae, str. faecalis, str. faecium) was less marked; against str. sanguis teicoplanin was bacteriostatic.

TI  == the hydrophobicity of 'viridans' streptococci isolated from the human mouth.
AB  == the hydrophobicity of human oral streptococci was measured with the hexadecane assay modified by the incorporation of polyethylene glycol 6000. large variability in the hydrophobicity between cultures of some strains grown on different occasions was observed whereas other strains were less variable. the variation in hydrophobicity was significantly reduced by growing the cells in continuous culture in a chemostat under glucose-limiting conditions. the streptococcus mutans strains used all had low hydrophobicity and the mean hydrophobicity of this species was significantly lower (p less than 0.05) than the mean hydrophobicity of strep. salivarius, strep. sanguis type i and strep. sanguis type ii strains. this finding supports the view that hydrophobicity is a  contributing factor in the adhesion of viridans streptococci to oral surfaces.

TI  == metabolism of glycosylsucrose by oral microorganisms and its hydrolysis by streptococcus salivarius fructosyltransferase.
AB  == resting-cell suspensions of oral microorganisms grown in sucrose were studied for the production of acid from glucosylsucrose and maltosylsucrose. most oral microorganisms fermented these sugars to only a limited extent. streptococcus salivarius, however, metabolized glucosylsucrose as well as sucrose. we therefore looked for a specific enzyme in s. salivarius which was capable of hydrolyzing glucosylsucrose. fructosyltransferase and invertase were purified from s. salivarius 13419, and the substrate specificities and hydrolytic activities of these enzymes were determined. purified fructosyltransferase catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose, whereas purified invertase barely hydrolyzed these sugars. these results suggest that the high fermentative  efficiency of glycosylsucrose by s. salivarius is due to the hydrolysis of these  sugars by fructosyltransferase, but not by invertase. the partially purified fructosyltransferases of actinomyces viscosus ny1 and streptococcus mutans ncib 11723 catalyzed fructan synthesis from glucosylsucrose or maltosylsucrose. the fructosyltransferases of these oral microorganisms are also responsible for the hydrolysis of glycosylsucrose.

AB  == the effects of low concentrations of these fluorides on streptococcus sobrinus, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis were investigated. without fluoride, mutans streptococci (strep. mutans and strep. sobrinus) produced more acid than the other strains; both fluorides reduced acid production in all strains. naf had little effect on growth; snf2 decreased growth in all strains, most evidently in the strep. mutans. in all growth conditions, strep. sobrinus produced the most alkali-soluble glucan. both fluorides enhanced alkali-soluble glucan production in mutans streptococci while only snf2 enhanced this in the other streptococci.

TI  == a simple method for determining extracellular polysaccharide-producing ability of oral streptococci.
AB  == a simple method is described for determining the types of extracellular polysaccharides produced by oral streptococci. the method yields quantitative results in which the amount of polysaccharides produced is normalised with respect to dna. results correlate well with previously published data for oral streptococci, except in the case of streptococcus oralis for which there is no previously published data. all species within the mutans group produced both soluble and insoluble glucan; while soluble fructan was only produced by strains  of streptococcus rattus and streptococcus mutans. the major extracellular polysaccharide produced by streptococcus salivarius was soluble fructan, although some strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. most streptococcus sanguis strains produced soluble and insoluble glucan. soluble fructan was produced by some strains of s. sanguis and s. oralis. the latter also produced soluble and insoluble glucan. no detectable extracellular polysaccharide was elaborated by streptococcus milleri, streptococcus faecalis or streptococcus lactis.

AB  == aqueous tobacco extracts were used to supplement a basic salts solution (bss) and a microbial medium. thin-layer chromatography revealed sucrose in only one of four extracts. discs saturated with extracts (0.1-50 mg/ml) failed to inhibit growth of any of the micro-organisms. supplementation (10 mg/ml) of bss with the  tobaccos lacking sucrose resulted in augmented growth of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius and streptococcus sanguis whereas the sucrose-containing brand augmented only strep. sanguis growth. thus extracts of these smokeless tobaccos would serve as a growth substrate for three species of oral streptococci which are frequently associated with human dental caries.

TI  == a simplified diagnostic system for cultural detection and enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == a simple dip-slide test (cariescreen sm) based on msb selective agar was devised  for detection and quantitation of streptococcus mutans in oral samples. for this  test, a bacitracin tablet is dissolved in a vial containing buffered saline diluent. paraffin-stimulated saliva is collected in this diluent vial. a dip slide which incorporates a modified msb agar (minus bacitracin) is immersed briefly in the diluted saliva. after addition of a co2-generating tablet, the screw-cap dip slide is closed tightly in the vial and incubated for two days at 37 degrees c and one day at room temperature. s. mutans populations in saliva are estimated by comparison with a colony density chart. growth of reference strains  of s. mutans was equivalent on cariescreen sm dip slides and on msb agar plates.  reference strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis, and streptococcus milleri did not grow on cariescreen sm dip slides. aliquots of saliva from 50 schoolchildren and 51 adults were tested by the dip-slide method and by conventional plating methods in msb agar. very good correlation (0.93) between the two methods was obtained. this simplified s. mutans detection system is suitable for use by clinical personnel in dental clinics or other non-laboratory settings for identification of subjects potentially at risk for caries.

TI  == [bacteriological investigation of the cariogenic effects of sugar alcohols and sucrose].
AB  == considerable evidence indicates that the disaccharide, sucrose is probably the major dietary factor in dental caries formation and much subsequent research has  gone into the search for another sweetener to replace sucrose. currently, there is much interest in the development of new sweeteners and the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols. the present study aimed to examine the cariogenic properties of sugar alcohols (xylitol, sorbitol, mannitol) and sucrose on growth  pattern and acid production of s. mutans, s. mitis, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. faecalis, s. viridans, l. casei and l. acidophilus in vitro by using photo electrical colorimeter and ph meter. in conclusion the results in this study showed that out of sugar alcohols, xylitol is the only compound which, depending  on its concentration, significantly did not affect the growth and acid production of all tested micro organisms.

AB  == streptococcus salivarius tove-r has previously been reported as a successful competitor with streptococcus mutans 10449s and streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13 wt on the teeth of rats. we studied, in vitro, some possible bases for this competition, including hydrogen peroxide or catalase production, bacteriocin or enocin production, and growth rates. growth rates were measured spectrophotometrically in both complex and defined media. we studied conditions of aerobic and anaerobic incubation; glucose and sucrose medium supplementation at three concentrations each; various initial ph's; singly- or doubly-inoculated  cultures; and half-strength, normal, or double-strength broth used both fresh and as culture filtrates. tove-r grew as well as did mutans streptococci at acid ph,  decidedly better at alkaline ph, and nearly twice as fast near neutral ph. the average doubling time for tove-r was about 0.5 hr, while that for the mutans streptococci was about 1.0 hr. when tove-r was grown together with a mutans streptococcus, the growth rate observed for the doubly-inoculated culture was equal to or less than that of tove-r alone, never greater. the presence and proportions of both organisms in mixed cultures were confirmed by plate counts, direct specific immunofluorescence, and nomarski interference microscopy. there was no evidence, by any of the methods employed, to indicate the production of an inhibitory substance against mutans streptococci by tove-r, or vice versa. also,  there was no evidence that the faster growth rate of tove-r could be attributed to nutrient limitation of the mutans streptococci.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == differences in acid tolerance among representative oral streptococci were found to be related more closely to the dynamic permeabilities of the bacteria to protons than to differences in the sensitivities of cell membranes to gross damage caused by environmental acidification. for streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904, and streptococcus salivarius atcc 13419, gross  membrane damage, indicated by the release of magnesium from whole cells, occurred at ph values below about 4 and was rapid and extensive at ph values of about 3 or less. a more aciduric, lactic acid bacterium, lactobacillus casei atcc 4646, was  more resistant to environmental acidification, and gross membrane damage was evident only at ph values below 3. assessments of the movements of protons into s. mutans cells after an acid pulse at various ph values indicated that permeability to protons was minimal at a ph value of about 5, at which the average half time for ph equilibration across the cell membrane was about 12 min. the corresponding values for the less aciduric organism s. sanguis were ph 7 and  8.2 min, and the values for the intermediate organism s. salivarius were ph 6 and 6.6 min. the atpase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide acted to increase markedly the permeability of each organism to protons, and this action indicated that permeability involved not only the passive inflow of protons but also active outflow through the proton-translocating membrane atpase. membranes were isolated from each of the bacteria, and ph profiles for atpase activities indicated ph optima of about 7.5, 7.0, 6.0, and 5.0 for s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. mutans,  and l. casei, respectively. thus, the ph profiles for the enzymes reflected the acid tolerances of the bacteria and the permeabilities of whole cells to protons.

AB  == a dna fragment encoding the sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase component of the streptococcus mutans phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sucrose phosphotransferase system has been recovered from a plasmid-based genomic library of strain gs5. the locus, designated scrb, was found to reside within a 2.9-kilobase-pair restriction fragment present on the chimeric molecule pva1343 (7.3 kilobase pairs). minicell analysis of pva1343-directed translation products revealed that  the scrb product synthesized in escherichia coli v1343 was a single peptide of mr 57,000. this polypeptide was reactive with antiserum prepared against s. mutans intracellular invertase, which has been previously shown to have an mr of 43,000  to 48,000. the basis of this difference in mr was not established but may represent a posttranslational proteolytic event which occurred in s. mutans but not in recombinant v1343. sucrose-6-phosphate hydrolase purified to homogeneity from v1343 exhibited michaelis constants of 180 mm for sucrose and 0.08 mm for sucrose-6-phosphate. deletion analysis of pva1343 facilitated the assignment of a coding region for the hydrolase within the insert, as well as an orientation for  the transcription of scrb. scrb-defective strains of s. mutans constructed by additive integration of an insertionally inactivated scrb locus exhibited the sucrose sensitivity characteristic of this mutant class. similar loci were detected by dna-dna hybridization in additional strains of s. mutans and two strains of streptococcus cricetus, but not in single strain representatives of s. rattus, s. sobrinus, s. sanguis i and ii, s. salivarius, or s. mitis.

AB  == devices simulating occlusal fissures were constructed from dental enamel and bonded to human maxillary molar teeth for 3 weeks. facilitation of in vivo caries research in humans is the long-range goal for this model system. in the present investigation, microbial compositions of plaque in the fissural space of the model and natural fissural plaque from teeth bearing the devices were compared. plaque from models constructed from either bovine or human enamel was also compared. in addition, microhardness of the enamel surfaces was examined before and after oral exposure. plaque in both bovine and human enamel models differed significantly from natural fissural plaque in several microbial categories. differences appeared to be related to the increased accessibility of the deep fissural contents of the models. for example, levels of the aciduric streptococcus mutans and veillonella species were higher in the models, although  levels of a salivary inhabitant, streptococcus salivarius, were lower. plaque in  bovine and human enamel models was similar, and both models showed significant decreases in enamel microhardness after oral exposure for 3 weeks. the model system should be useful in caries research in that carieslike activity was simulated within a relatively short period of time, and the fissural space became colonized by high levels of cariogenic bacteria.

TI  == effect of monoclonal antibodies against lipoteichoic acid from the oral bacterium streptococcus mutans on its adhesion and plaque-accumulation in vitro.
AB  == five monoclonal antibodies directed against streptococcus mutans strain jbp lipoteichoic acid (lta) were characterized. they were all similarly reactive with the immunizing lta-containing extract, with intact strep. mutans jbp cells and with lta purified from lactobacillus casei. immobilized anti-lta antibodies removes lta from lta-containing extracts. the binding of antibodies to lta was inhibited by the aqueous extract but not by the organic extract of de-acylated lta, indicating reactivity with the polyglycerol-phosphate portion of the molecule. antibodies were reactive with all serotypes of strep. mutans, as well as with strains of streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis and l. casei,  but not with lta-negative species streptococcus mitis or actinomyces viscosus. anti-lta antibodies at doses of 0.3 or 3.0 micrograms/ml, had no effect on the adherence of strep. mutans jbp to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite, but enhanced adherence 150-300 per cent at 30 micrograms/ml. there was no effect of anti-lta antibodies in a chemostat model which measured sucrose-dependent plaque accumulation by strep. mutans. the results argue against a major role for lta in strep. mutans adherence or plaque accumulation in vitro.

TI  == phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase transport system of streptococcus mutans: purification of hpr and enzyme i and determination of their intracellular concentrations by rocket immunoelectrophoresis.
AB  == enzyme i and hpr, the general proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-sugar phosphotransferase system, play a pivotal role in the control of sugar utilization in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. to determine whether growth conditions could modify the rate of biosynthesis of these proteins in streptococcus mutans, we first purified to homogeneity enzyme i and hpr from s. mutans atcc 27352. using specific antibodies obtained against these proteins, we  determined by rocket electrophoresis the intracellular levels of enzyme i and hpr in cells of s. mutans 27352 grown under various batch culture conditions and in a number of glucose-grown cells of other strains of s. mutans. hpr was purified by  the procedure reported by gauthier et al. (l. gauthier, d. mayrand, and c. vadeboncoeur, j. bacteriol. 160:755-763, 1984) and displayed a single band with a molecular weight of 6,650 when analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-urea gel electrophoresis. enzyme i was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, affinity chromatography on an anti-streptococcus salivarius column, and preparative electrophoresis. the protein migrated as a single band in native and denaturating gel electrophoresis. the subunit molecular weight of enzyme i determined by electrophoresis under denaturating conditions was 68,000. in gel filtration chromatography at 4 degrees c, the enzyme migrated as a 135,000- to 160,000-molecular-weight species, suggesting that enzyme i is a dimer. in double  immunodiffusion experiments, antibodies against hpr reacted with several oral streptococci, streptococcus lactis, streptococcus faecium, and lactobacillus casei, but not with bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli. antibodies against enzyme i of s. mutans 27352 cross-reacted with enzyme i  from all the other oral streptococci tested. no cross-reaction was observed with  other gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. the levels of enzyme i and hpr determined by rocket electrophoresis in s. mutans 27352 varied at the most by twofold, depending on the growth conditions. glucose-grown cells of other s. mutans strains contained levels of enzyme i and hpr which were similar to those found in s. mutans 27352.

TI  == longitudinal microbiological investigation of a hospitalized population of older  adults with a high root surface caries risk.
AB  == intact root surfaces of chronically hospitalized subjects were sampled periodically to enumerate bacterial species believed to be associated with root caries. bacteria were cultivated and enumerated using a series of selective and enriched media. microbial counts, isolation frequencies, and percent cultivable flora data were analyzed for caries-active and caries-free surfaces and subjects. s. mutans, s. sanguis, a. viscosus, a. naeslundii, total lactobacilli, and veillonella accounted for a mean of less than 20% of the cultivated flora, with mitis salivarius agar cultivable streptococci averaging less than 5%. the microbial count data were highly variable, precluding the finding of significant  differences in caries association for either subjects or sites. streptococci, especially s. mutans, correlated highly with lactobacilli in the samples.

AB  == species identifications of 71 strains of viridans streptococci isolated from blood and 4 reference strains were made by the api 20 strep system (api system s. a., montalieu-vercien, france) and the conventional method. there are high levels of agreement between results obtained with the both methods for determining acidification from carbohydrate except inulin. the api 20 strep system correctly  identified 74.7% of the viridans streptococci with 9.3% low descrimination, 12% incorrect and 4% unidentified. all strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, s. salivarius  and s. anginosus-constellatus were correctly identified. the correct identification rates for s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii and s. mg-intermedius were 88.9%, 68% and 61% respectively. the difference of inulin reaction and the taxonomy discrepancy may be the cause of different identification. the study indicates that the api 20 strep system has a good potentiality for species identification of viridans streptococci at present time, however, further refinement in needed.

TI  == streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus detection in the assessment of dental root surface caries risk.
AB  == forty-five subjects contributing 150 root surfaces with gingival recession were sampled seven times over a 32-month period. we calculated isolation frequencies of lactobacilli on selective rogosa sl agar and s. mutans in a sensitive enrichment broth and on mitis salivarius agar. both s. mutans and lactobacilli were isolated more frequently from surfaces which became carious than from those  remaining caries-free. isolation frequencies were also higher for caries-free surfaces in caries-active subjects than for caries-free surfaces in caries-inactive subjects. the presence or absence of s. mutans and lactobacilli in samples taken at baseline could discriminate between subjects who were to be root-caries-active and those who were to remain root-caries-inactive during the subsequent observation period. moreover, if both bacteria were detected or only s. mutans was detected on a root surface at its entry into the study, that surface had a greater risk for developing a root lesion. however, the tests could not predict which root surfaces within the mouths of caries-active subjects were  to become carious. analysis of the data suggests that simple microbiological detection tests may be useful in identifying patients at high risk of root caries.

TI  == the surface free energy of oral streptococci after being coated with saliva and its relation to adhesion in the mouth.
AB  == contact angle measurements on layers of bacteria were used to determine the bacterial surface free energy (gamma b) of a variety of oral streptococcal strains, both without and after being coated with human whole saliva. at least four isolates of each species, either freshly isolated or laboratory strains, were used. the species streptococcus mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius were homogeneous, having high surface free energies, and were not affected by saliva treatment (gamma b = 106 +/- 12 and 107 +/- 10 erg x cm-2 in the absence and presence of saliva coating, respectively; n = 20). s. mitis had a very low surface free energy (46 +/- 15; n = 5), which was significantly increased after salivary adsorption (71 +/- 14 erg x cm-2; p less than 0.002). the species s. milleri contained strains with both high and low gamma b. calculation of the interfacial free energy of adhesion (delta f adh) for bacteria from a saliva suspension to solid surfaces with various arbitrary surface free energies (gamma  s) showed that, theoretically, most strains will encounter thermodynamically favorable conditions for adhesion to surfaces with a gamma s above 62 erg x cm-2. however, s. mitis strains not coated with saliva would only be able to adhere to  surfaces with gamma s lower than this value. saliva-coating reverses the calculated relationship with gamma s for these strains. the results indicate that an enamel surface with a low gamma s value would be thermodynamically unfavorable for adhesion of most oral streptococci.

TI  == inhibition of ecological emergence of mutans streptococci naturally transmitted between rats and consequent caries inhibition by streptococcus salivarius tove-r  infection.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus salivarius strain tove-r to inhibit the ecological emergence of virulent representatives of the most prevalent human mutans streptococci on the teeth of specific pathogen-free osborne-mendel rats was studied. rats which were infected by tove-r, or either s. mutans 10449s or s. sobrinus 6715-13wt, or uninfected were transiently co-caged so as to allow natural fecal transfer of organisms due to coprophagy. the infectants were differentially recovered from swabs of the teeth over the time course of the experiments and from sonified teeth at termination. data were expressed on both relative (percentage) and absolute (cfu) bases. initial oral colonization of rats by tove-r inhibited the ecological emergence of fecally transmitted s. mutans 10449s and s. sobrinus 6715-13wt. there was a generally inverse relationship between the percentages and absolute numbers of tove-r and the mutans streptococci on the teeth, which strongly suggested their competition for tooth sites. absolute numbers of total recoverable flora from the teeth upon sonification were correlated with caries scores, thus suggesting that total recoverable flora counts substantially reflect cavitation status. tove-r itself induced no apparent caries activity and its transmission to rats already infected by 10449s or its colonization of rats before 10449s infection inhibition caries induction by this s. mutans strain; similar anticaries effects were not statistically significant for tove-r against 6715-13wt in these experiments. these data on the inhibition of the ecological emergence of the mutans streptococci supplement the already reported ability of tove-r to preempt initial colonization of teeth and partially displace the colonization of teeth by the mutans streptococci.

TI  == cross-reactions between alpha-streptococci and omniserum, a polyvalent pneumococcal serum, demonstrated by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination.
AB  == in recent years several groups have used serological methods to demonstrate pneumococcal capsular antigens in sputum. in the present study 123 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci (including 97 strains from sputum or pharyngeal specimens) were tested for cross-reactions with a polyvalent antipneumococcal serum (omniserum). representatives of the following species were included: streptococcus bovis, s. equinus, s. intermedius, s. lactis, s. milleri, s. mitis, s. mutans, s. sobrinus, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. suis, and aerococcus viridans. serological reactions were detected by direct immunofluorescence, immunoelectroosmophoresis, and latex agglutination. fifteen (12%) of the strains  gave positive reactions by all three methods. positive reactions were also observed with another 32 strains (26%) with two of the methods, whereas 37 strains (30%) gave positive reactions by just one technique. altogether 84 (68%)  strains gave positive reactions with one or more of the methods. latex agglutination gave positive reactions with 26 (21%) strains compared with 57 (46%) in immunofluorescence and 63 (51%) in immunoelectroosmophoresis. absorption of the antiserum with one alpha-hemolytic strain reduced but did not entirely eliminate the cross-reactions with five tested strains. these findings indicate a potential risk of cross-reactions with polyvalent antipneumococcal serum in tests carried out on sputa or other specimens which may be contaminated with alpha-hemolytic streptococci.

TI  == competitive displacement of mutans streptococci and inhibition of tooth decay by  streptococcus salivarius tove-r.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus salivarius tove-r to displace virulent representatives of the most prevalent human mutans streptococci from the teeth of rats, and thereby to inhibit caries, was studied. streptococcus mutans 10449s- or streptococcus sobrinus 6715-13wt-infected specific-pathogen-free rats consuming a high-sucrose diet were inoculated by tove-r. the infectants were differentially recovered from swabs of the teeth over the time course of infection and from sonically treated material of extracted teeth and excised tongues. despite initial colonization of the teeth by the mutans streptococci, tove-r colonized the teeth, unlike other essentially nonvirulent plaque formers already described. it did not colonize the tongues of the rats. tove-r emerged and persisted as a prominent member of the plaque ecology. there was an associated decline in the mutans streptococci on the teeth, and this decline was associated with significant inhibition of the caries component attributable to 10449s infection (56%) and to 6715-13wt infection (52%). tove-r did not reliably inhibit the component of fissure caries attributable to the nonmutans indigenous flora of the rats. tove-r itself induced no detectable decay. the data suggest the potential therapeutic utility of tove-r to inhibit caries by displacement of mutans streptococci from the teeth. these results supplement the already reported ability of tove-r to preempt initial colonization of teeth by the mutans streptococci.

TI  == dissipation of the proton motive force in oral streptococci by fluoride.
AB  == strains of oral streptococci maintain an intracellular ph (phi) that is more alkaline than the external ph (pho). the delta ph (phi-pho) was about 0.6 in neutral media and about 0.9 in media of ph 5.5. addition of 10 micrograms of f- per ml at ph 7.0 reduced the delta ph in streptococcus salivarius to 0.17. the reduction of delta ph in s. sanguis h7pr3 was less pronounced, whereas the delta  ph in s. mutans ib 1600 was unaffected. the f- -resistant mutant of s. salivarius, strain flr103, maintained a delta ph of 0.51 with 100 micrograms of f- per ml. addition of f- to cells in media below ph 6.0 led to a reduction of delta ph in all strains. the anion had no effect on the transmembrane electrical  gradient of either mutant or parental cells of s. salivarius at ph 7.0. the principal effect of f- addition at neutral ph, therefore, was on the delta ph component of the proton motive force. at ph 5.5, 100 micrograms of f- per ml reduced the transmembrane electrical gradient from 71 to 40 mv in the parent and  from 80 to 42 mv in the mutant. we propose that the greater sensitivity of cells  to f- at lower medium ph stems from the rapid dissipation of delta ph by the anion. thus, ph equilibration in media of low ph would lead to a greater reduction of metabolic activity than when it occurs in media at neutral ph. the data also suggest that the growth of streptococci, with or without added f-, is limited when the intracellular ph falls below about 5.7.

TI  == ph change in artificial dental plaque formed by glucosyltransferase and some oral bacteria during batch and continuous culture.
AB  == streptococcus mutans alone or cell-free glucosyltransferase (g-tase)-together with either streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, actinomyces viscosus, or lactobacillus casei cells-formed artificial dental plaque that firmly adhered to glass electrodes in a continuous culture system containing sucrose. the ph in these artificial plaque samples decreased more than did that of the surrounding medium. in the absence of gtase, the bacteria other than s. mutans did not form firmly-adhering plaque on glass electrodes. the ph of the plaque formed with gtase alone did not show the ph decrease seen when the plaque  contained bacteria, but, because it catalyzed the synthesis of glucan, it is suggested that the glucan acts as a diffusion barrier to retard acid loss from plaque containing acid-producing bacteria.

AB  == the acidurance of glycolysis by intact cells of streptococcus mutans gs-5, streptococcus salivarius atcc 25925, and streptococcus sanguis nctc 10904 was found to be highly dependent on membrane functions affected by gramicidin, which  increases the proton permeability of cell membranes. plots of % glucose utilized  during two hours against suspension ph values for cells suspended in 100 mm phosphate buffer plus 1 mm mgcl2 plus 13.9 mm glucose indicated, for 50% glucose  utilization, ph values of 5.0 for s. mutans, 5.7 for s. salivarius, and 6.2 for s. sanguis. gramicidin treatment shifted these values to 6.0, 6.3, and 6.9, respectively. growth of s. mutans and s. salivarius in complex media proved to be more acid-sensitive than was glycolysis, and in batch cultures, there was a well-defined, post-growth phase of glycolysis. minimum ph values for growth and for glycolysis in medium with excess glucose were approximately 4.8 and 4.4, respectively, for s. mutans, and 4.9 and 4.3 for s. salivarius. s. sanguis was less aciduric and showed little differential acid sensitivity, with minimum ph values of about 5.2 for both growth and glycolysis. fluoride acted to eliminate the differences in acidurance of growth and glycolysis for s. mutans or s. salivarius and to render both processes more acid-sensitive. thus, glycolysis was more fluoride-sensitive than was growth. growth was found to be acid-limited in media with initial glucose levels greater than 0.2, 0.3, and 0.5% (weight/volume) for s. sanguis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius, respectively, and to be glucose-limited at lower levels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin agar, an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin agar for enumeration of streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an agar medium for selective recovery and enumeration of streptococcus mutans was developed as an alternative to mitis salivarius-bacitracin (msb) agar. combinations of dyes, antibiotics, and tellurite were added to a nonselective medium which, because of its sucrose content, allowed easy recognition of s. mutans colonies. candle jar incubation for 2 days, by comparison with anaerobic incubation, reduced background flora but did not diminish s. mutans recoveries from clinical samples. quantitative comparisons were made of the simultaneous recoveries of a number of authentic s. mutans serotype representatives and fresh  clinical isolates, using various glucose-sucrose-potassium tellurite-bacitracin (gstb) formulations and mitis salivarius, msb, and blood agars. mitis salivarius  counts were not detectably different from blood counts, but counts on msb were distinctly lower. a formulation of the new medium containing 5% glucose 5% sucrose, 0.001% potassium tellurite, 0.3 u of bacitracin per ml (hence gstb), and 2% agar gave recoveries nearly equal to those on mitis salivarius agar and much greater than those on msb. the medium yielded readily recognized s. mutans colonies and facilitated detection of intracellular polysaccharide formers upon flooding with i2 reagent. freshly isolated serotype c, e, and f colonies could often be distinguished from serotype d and g colonies, a distinction made reliable by testing for intracellular polysaccharide. a study of 300 salivary samples revealed gstb to give significantly higher recoveries than msb. about 72% of all samples were substantially underestimated for s. mutans with msb, and 6.7% of samples were falsely negative for s. mutans with msb. recovery of background flora on gstb was as low or lower than on msb, and both types of agar could be stored for at least 9 weeks without notable change of selectivity. thus, gstb agar appears to be simple and reliable to use and requires no anaerobic incubation. caution is voiced about interpretation of data previously reported which evaluated s. mutans on msb agar.

AB  == the serostat latex agglutination test (scott laboratories, inc., fiskesville, r.i.) for identification of group d streptococci was compared with bile-esculin agar and lancefield grouping by using 110 clinical isolates of group d streptococci (s. faecalis, 74; s. bovis, 24; s. durans, 3; s. faecium, 9) and 65  viridans streptococci (s. anginosus-constellatus, 2; streptococcus mg, 15; s. sanguis ii, 14; s. mitis, 7; s. mutans, 5; s. salivarius, 8; s. sanguis i, 8; s.  acidominimus, 1; s. morbillorum, 2; s. pneumoniae, 3). all strains of group d streptococci were bile-esculin positive. serostat reactions were falsely positive with 2 strains of s. sanguisii and 1 strain of streptococcus mg (4.6% of all viridans streptococci tested) and falsely negative with 10 s. bovis, 8 s. faecalis, 1 s. durans, and 6 s. faecium strains (22.7% of all group d streptococci tested). when considered with colonial morphology and hemolytic reaction, serostat is a rapid (60-s) and useful test for recognition of group d streptococci.

TI  == disseminated tetracycline resistance in oral streptococci: implication of a conjugative transposon.
AB  == a dna sequence specifying tetracycline resistance (tcr) has been previously cloned from a clinical isolate of streptococcus mutans designated u202 (j. a. tobian and f. l. macrina, j. bacteriol. 152:215-222, 1982). we used this sequence as a molecular probe in studying the dissemination of tcr among oral streptococcal species isolated from patients treated with tetracycline. eleven strains (including s. sanguis i, s. sanguis ii, s. mitis, and s. salivarius) from seven patients were examined by southern blot analysis. seven strains showed strong hybridization to the tcr probe, two showed weak hybridization, and two did not display detectable hybridization. based on previous characterization of the cloned sequence, our data suggest the dissemination of the tetm class of resistance determinants among these oral streptococci. one of the clinical s. sanguis i isolates studied was able to transfer its tcr phenotype to other oral streptococci and to enteric streptococci in the absence of plasmid dna. this transfer appeared to be conjugation-like on the basis of its insensitivity to dnase and its dependence on intimate cell-to-cell contact. using the cloned tcr sequence, we were able to study the progeny of the matings. our data suggest that this resistance transfer element occupies a chromosomal location in streptococcal cells and that it strongly resembles the conjugative transposon tn916 in its behavior.

TI  == reaction of human colostral and early milk antibodies with oral streptococci.
AB  == colostrum or early breast milk or both from each of 16 healthy women contained agglutinating antibodies for all normal streptococcal inhabitants of the human oral cavity (s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. salivarius), including those which colonize the neonatal oral cavity in significant numbers. agglutination correlated with the amount of immunoglobulin a (iga) binding to bacterial surfaces as measured by mixed reverse passive antiglobulin hemagglutination. surprisingly, colostral iga agglutinated our control organism, brucella abortus.  low levels of colostral or milk igm and igg antibodies also reacted with all of the test bacteria. absorption studies with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay showed that a proportion of antibodies in colostrum and early milk is specific for each of the different oral streptococci. fractionation on sepharose 4b indicated that 11s secretory iga is the predominant form of colostral and milk antibody for all of the test bacteria, including b. abortus. no evidence was found that reactions other than antigen-antibody reactions resulted in binding of colostral immunoglobulins by any of the test bacteria.

TI  == clinical isolates of streptococcus mutans serotype c with altered colony morphology due to fructan synthesis.
AB  == streptococcus mutans mt6801 , mt6861 , and mt6879 , which form large mucoid colonies on mitis salivarius agar, were isolated from a mother and her two daughters. these isolates were identified as serotype c by immunodiffusion with serotype-specific antisera. the large colonies formed on sucrose-containing agar  were found to contain water-soluble fructan . the cell-free fructosyltransferase  ( ftase ) activity of the strains which formed large colonies was five to eight times higher than that of serotype c s. mutans which produced small, rough colonies typical of this serotype. furthermore, greater quantities of fructan were synthesized from sucrose by growing cells of mt6801 when compared with mt8148 , a typical serotype c s. mutans. glucosyltransferase and ftase could be isolated by chromatofocusing from culture supernatants of mt6801 and mt8148 . the ftase activity of both strains was eluted at ph 4.5, and glucosyltransferase was  released by elution with an nacl linear gradient. the eluted ftase activity of mt6801 was significantly higher than that of mt8148 . strains mt6861 and mt6879 were also found to possess a similar property in terms of ftase activity. these results suggest that formation of large mucoid colonies by these strains is a consequence of high ftase activity.

TI  == structure and properties of the phosphoenolpyruvate: glucose phosphotransferase system of oral streptococci.
AB  == the presence of three distinct enzymes ii that catalysed the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose, fructose, and mannose was established in membranes of glucose-grown cells of streptococcus salivarius 25975 and various strains of streptococcus mutans. the enzyme ii mannose phosphorylated mainly mannose, glucose, and 2-deoxyglucose, and the enzyme ii glucose phosphorylated glucose, alpha-methylglucoside, and 2-deoxyglucose. the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphorylation of glucose and alpha-methylglucoside by isolated membrane of wild-type or eii mannose negative mutant cells did not require the presence of any soluble protein other than enzyme i and the phosphocarrier protein hpr. this result suggested that oral streptococci do not possess a soluble factor iii glucose. the enzyme ii activities varied as a function of the growth sugar but were not coordinately regulated. the variation elicited by specific sugars was not identical for all the strains tested. nevertheless, in the case of the s. mutans strains, growth at the expense of lactose always caused a significant decrease in the level of enzyme ii activities. finally, experiments conducted with eii mannose negative mutants and also with a pseudorevertant isolated from one of these mutants indicated that the preferential utilization of glucose over lactose by cells growing in mixtures depended on the presence of the eii mannose, but not on glucose-derived metabolites.

TI  == sucrase and maltase activities in supragingival dental plaque in humans of streptococcal, actinomyces and lactobacilli species.
AB  == 20 reference strains and 72 isolated strains from dental plaque of streptococci,  actinomyces, and lactobacilli species were examined for sucrase and maltase activities. the type of sucrase in the different strains was determined by use of the alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose. the enzyme activities were determined  as formation of monosaccharide, and quantitated spectrophotometrically. although  variations occurred in enzyme activities between reference and isolated strains,  the same general pattern was noticed. strains of streptococcus mutans and s. salivarius showed regularly the highest sucrase activities, followed by strains of actinomyces viscosus and a. naeslundii. most lactobacilli belonged to the bacteria with low sucrase activity like s. sanguis and s. mitior. in some lactobacilli strains, however, a high sucrase activity was observed. the level of sucrase activity in s. mutans strains was dependent on biotype/serotype, as strains of biotype v/serotype e showed high activities, biotypes i and iv corresponding to serotypes c, f, and d showed intermediate activity, and biotype  iii/serotype a always showed low activity. in most of the strains the sucrases were composed of enzymes with specificity against both alpha-glucosidic linkage and beta-fructosidic linkage of the sucrose molecule, but in varying ratios. in all species, exept s. sanguis and s. mitior, lower maltase than sucrase activity  was observed, but even in the two species mentioned the maltase activities were relatively low. on the basis of observations of selected reference strains in every species examined both sucrases and maltases are to some extent inducible.

TI  == slide-scoring method for estimation of streptococcus mutans levels in saliva.
AB  == a method was developed to facilitate the estimation of s. mutans levels in saliva. paraffin-stimulated saliva was poured on a special slide coated with mitis-salivarius-sucrose agar. two discs containing bacitracin (5 micrograms) were placed on the inoculated slide and the growth density of s. mutans around the bacitracin discs was scored after incubation in candle jars at 37 degrees c for 48 h. the obtained score values correlated well with the numbers of cfu of s. mutans per 1 ml of saliva estimated by a conventional method using mitis-salivarius-bacitracin agar. the experimental method was further tested by incubating the slides in an atmosphere created by co2-generating tables that were placed into the cover tubes of the slides. these score values were similar to those after conventional incubation. the method is suggested for epidemiologic studies and in selecting persons at high risk for caries and in controlling the effectiveness of prophylactic measures of these patients.

TI  == regulation of glucose metabolism in oral streptococci through independent pathways of glucose 6-phosphate and glucose 1-phosphate formation.
AB  == in vivo rates of glucose uptake and acid production by oral streptococci grown in glucose- or nitrogen-limited continuous culture and batch culture were compared with the glucose phosphorylation activities of harvested, decryptified cells. the strains examined contained significant phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) activity, measured by a glucose 6-phosphate (g6p) dehydrogenase-linked assay procedure, but this activity was insufficient to account for the in vivo glucose uptake rates. however, atp was a superior phosphoryl donor to phosphoenolpyruvate, and unlike the pts, phosphoryl transfer  with atp was insensitive to bacteriostatic concentrations of chlorhexidine, suggesting glucokinase-mediated g6p formation. again, g6p formation from the pts  and glucokinase reactions was not commensurate with some of the glucose uptake rates observed, implying that other phosphorylation reactions must be occurring.  two novel reactions involving carbamyl phosphate and acetyl phosphate were identified in some of the strains. no g6p formation was detected with these potential phosphoryl donors, but in the presence of phosphoglucomutase, glucose 1-phosphate (g1p) formation was evident, which was insensitive to chlorhexidine.  g1p is a precursor of glycogen, and good correlation was obtained between g1p formation activity and endogenous metabolism of washed cells measured either as a rate of acid production at a constant ph 7 or as a decrease in ph with time in the absence of titrant. a "league table" of abilities to synthesize g1p and produce acid from endogenous metabolism was compiled for oral streptococci grown  in batch culture. this indicated that streptococcus mutans ingbritt and streptococcus sanguis challis were unable to form g1p or produce much acid endogenously, whereas increasing activities were obtained with streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, and streptococcus mitis. in particular, s. mitis had the highest g1p formation activities and was able to decrease the ph to less than 5 in 15 min by endogenous metabolism alone. the data are consistent with the intracellular accumulation of free glucose driven by proton motive force when pts activities are low and the subsequent phosphorylation to either g6p for  metabolism via glycolysis or g1p for glycogen biosynthesis. the accumulation of acetyl phosphate during glucose-limited growth and the availability of arginine for catabolism to carbamyl phosphate provide an explanation as to why some glucose-limited oral streptococci continue to synthesize glycogen under these conditions, which might prevail in plaque.

TI  == polysaccharide production by cell free transferases in saliva in relation to salivary microflora.
AB  == the supernatant of centrifuged whole saliva was incubated with radiolabeled sucrose to measure polysaccharide production by cell free transferases and to examine whether water-insoluble polysaccharides were produced. amounts of polysaccharides were considered to reflect the level of cell free transferases in saliva. plating samples on blood agar, ms and msb plates gave salivary counts of  total cfu, total streptococci, s. salivarius and s. mutans. the capability of the cell free portion of saliva to produce polymers was confirmed and it appeared that the cell free transferases were able to produce water-insoluble polysaccharides. significant correlations were found between the total and the insoluble polysaccharides from 14c-g'-sucrose and total cfu, total streptococci,  s. salivarius and s. mutans, respectively. heavily s. mutans infected subjects seemed to produce particularly large amounts of water-insoluble polysaccharides from 14c-g'-sucrose. the apparently water-insoluble 14c-f'-polysaccharides correlated significantly to the number of s. salivarius. it was thus concluded that the constitution of the oral microflora and particularly the levels of s. mutans and s. salivarius were of importance for the level of cell free transferase activity.

TI  == growth and acid tolerance of human dental plaque bacteria.
AB  == pure cultures of representative strains of cariogenic and non-cariogenic plaque bacteria were assessed for their ability to initiate and maintain growth in broths, adjusted to initial ph levels of 7.0, 5.5 or 5.0, and to produce lactic acid from sucrose or glucose in resting-cell suspensions at ph 6.5, 5.0, 4.5 and  4.0. streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus casei and streptococcus faecalis showed  greater acid tolerance than strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitis and actinomyces viscosus. for all species, growth initiation in broth was more acid sensitive than lactic-acid production in resting-cell suspensions. these data confirm and extend previous observations that the species of plaque bacteria most closely associated with the initiation or progression of dental caries are more aciduric than non-cariogenic species.

AB  == sugar transport and glycolysis in streptococcus sanguis nctc 7865, streptococcus  mitis atcc 903, streptococcus salivarius nctc 8606 and several strains of streptococcus mutans were investigated by following the rate of acid production by washed bacteria at a constant ph of 7.0. the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase system (pts) was inhibited by low concentrations of chlorhexidine. when this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine was added to cells washed and re-suspended in kcl, glucose uptake and glycolysis continued at a greatly-reduced rate. chlorhexidine abolished glucose and sucrose uptake and metabolism in bacteria washed and incubated in saline. the na+-inhibition was reproduced in kcl-washed bacteria using the cyclic peptide ionophores, valinomycin and gramicidin, to dissipate k+ and h+ gradients  across the cell membrane. glucose metabolism by strep. mutans b13 was more resistant to chlorhexidine than that of strep. mutans nctc 10449 or strep. sanguis but was more sensitive to the ionophores. valinomycin had a greater inhibitory effect on strain b13 than the other two. that ion gradients are important in the chlorhexidine-resistant glucose-uptake mechanism was confirmed using the classical uncoupling agents, carbonylcyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone, 2,4-dinitrophenol and kscn. glucose metabolism was inhibited in the presence of both the uncouplers and the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine and significant inhibition was also observed in the absence of the pts inhibitor. lactate or the atpase inhibitor, dicyclohexyl carbodiimide (dccd), had similar inhibitory effects on the non-pts uptake system.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == purification of proteins similar to hpr and enzyme i from the oral bacterium streptococcus salivarius. biochemical and immunochemical properties.
AB  == the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (pts) is made of several  proteins. two of them are designated general proteins because they are required for the transport and phosphorylation of all sugars of the pts. these two proteins are found in the soluble fraction of cellular extracts and are termed hpr and enzyme i (ei). we reported in this work the purification and the characterization of these two proteins from streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975.  hpr was purified by deae-cellulose chromatography, molecular sieving on ultrogel  aca44, and carboxymethylcellulose chromatography. sodium dodecyl sulfate electrophoresis in the presence of urea revealed a single band with a molecular weight of 6700. the protein contained no tryptophan and had a pi of 4.8. the purification scheme of ei was as follows: deae-cellulose chromatography, hydroxylapatite chromatography, deae-sephadex a-50 chromatography, preparative electrophoresis, and molecular sieving on ultrogel aca34. the five-step purification for ei produced a 199-fold purified preparation with a specific activity of 530 mumol of hpr phosphorylated per minute per milligram of protein at 37 degrees c. the fraction obtained after filtration on ultrogel aca34 gave one band (68 000) on sodium dodecyl sulfate - polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the molecular weight of the native enzyme determined by gel filtration at 4 degrees c was 135 000, suggesting that it was a dimer. enzyme i had a pi of 4.2,  a ph optimum of 6.7, a km for hpr of about 27 microm, a km for phosphoenolpyruvate of 0.48 mm, and kinetics that were consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. evidence had been obtained which indicated that s. salivarius enzyme i was antigenically very similar to enzyme i from various strains of streptococcus mutans, but not to the enzyme from bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus faecalis, and escherichia coli.

TI  == comparative hydrophobicities of oral bacteria and their adherence to salivary pellicles.
AB  == oral bacteria were found to differ in their surface hydrophobicities as determined by their ability to adsorb to hexadecane. strains of actinomyces viscosus, a. naeslundii, streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, and bacteroides gingivalis proved highly hydrophobic. strains of b. intermedius, s. salivarius, s. mutans, and b. melaninogenicus were less hydrophobic, whereas strains of actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans were hydrophilic. an overall correlation was noted between the adsorption of bacteria to hexadecane and their numbers which attached to experimental salivary pellicles formed on hydroxyapatite surfaces. this suggests that hydrophobic bonding plays an important role in this process. pellicles prepared from saliva which had been extracted with chloroform-methanol  to remove lipids adsorbed comparable numbers of s. sanguis and a. viscosus and increased numbers of s. mutans. analyses of adsorption isotherms indicated that pellicles formed from lipid-depleted saliva contained increased numbers of binding sites for the s. mutans strains studied, and this likely accounts for their enhanced adsorption. absorption of saliva with 10% octyl or phenyl sepharose reduced the protein content of saliva by almost half, but the numbers of bacteria which attached to pellicles prepared from such absorbed saliva were similar to or higher than those which attached to control pellicles. these observations suggest that saliva does not contain unique highly hydrophobic salivary macromolecules which serve as essential pellicle receptors for the bacteria studied. the data obtained are consistent with the view that hydrophobic bonding together with interactions between complementary molecules are involved in bacterial attachment to salivary pellicles on teeth.

AB  == approved type strains of streptococcus sanguis, s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius were grown under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. the rate of hydrogen peroxide excretion, oxygen uptake, and acid production from glucose by washed-cell suspensions of these strains were studied, and the levels of enzymes  in cell-free extracts which reduced oxygen, hydrogen peroxide, or hypothiocyanite (oscn-) in the presence of nadh or nadph were assayed. the effects of lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide on the rate of acid production and  oxygen uptake by intact cells, the activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts, and the levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates were also studied. all strains consumed oxygen in the presence of glucose. s. sanguis, s. mitis, and anaerobically grown s. mutans excreted hydrogen peroxide. there was higher nadh oxidase and nadh peroxidase activity in aerobically grown cells than  in anaerobically grown cells. nadph oxidase activity was low in all species. acid production, oxygen uptake, and, consequently, hydrogen peroxide excretion were inhibited in all the strains by lactoperoxidase-thiocyanate-hydrogen peroxide. s. sanguis and s. mitis had a higher capacity than s. mutans and s. salivarius to recover from this inhibition. higher activity in the former strains of an nadh-oscn oxidoreductase, which converted oscn- into thiocyanate, explained this  difference. the change in levels of intracellular glycolytic intermediates after  inhibition of glycolysis by oscn- and the actual activity of glycolytic enzymes in cell-free extracts in the presence of oscn- indicated that the primary target  of oscn- in the glycolytic pathway was glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase.

TI  == purification and properties of pyruvate kinase from streptococcus sanguis and activator specificity of pyruvate kinase from oral streptococci.
AB  == it was found that pyruvate kinases with two different regulatory characteristics  were distributed among oral streptococci. the pyruvate kinases of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, and streptococcus bovis were activated by glucose 6-phosphate, whereas the enzymes of both streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mitis were activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. pyruvate kinase  (ec 2.7.1.40) from s. sanguis nctc 10904 was purified, giving a single band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the enzyme had a molecular weight of 250,000 to 260,000 and consisted of four identical subunits.  whereas the pyruvate kinase from s. mutans was completely dependent on glucose 6-phosphate (k. abbe and t. yamada, j. bacteriol. 149:299-305, 1982), the enzyme  from s. sanguis was activated by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. in the presence of 0.5 mm fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the saturation curves for the substrates, phosphoenolpyruvate and adp, were hyperbolic, and the km values were 0.13 and 0.30 mm, respectively. without fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, saturation curves for both substrates were sigmoidal. gdp, idp, and udp could replace adp. like the enzyme from s. mutans, the enzyme from s. sanguis required a divalent cation, mg2+ or mn2+, and a monovalent cation, k+ or nh4+, for activity, and it was strongly inhibited by pi. when the concentration of pi was increased, the half-saturating concentration and hill coefficient for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate  increased. the remarkable fluctuation of intracellular levels of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and phosphoenolpyruvate observed in the cells growing under glucose limitation and nitrogen limitation implies that the intracellular concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, in cooperation with that of pi, may regulate pyruvate kinase activity in s. sanguis in vivo.

TI  == production, purification, and properties of a bacteriocin from staphylococcus aureus isolated from saliva.
AB  == staphylococci from samples of human saliva were isolated on staphylococcal-selective agar plates. these strains were tested for the inhibition of the growth of staphylococcus aureus fda209p. the frequency of inhibitory strains among all of the staphylococcal isolates was 5.2%. strain iys2, which formed the biggest inhibitory zone against the growth of the indicator strain, was used as the producer of bacteriocin. iys2 was identified to be s. aureus, based on its biological properties. the bacteriocin was purified by sequential procedures, including ammonium sulfate precipitation, fractionation with ethanol, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. its molecular weight was determined to be 5,000. the isoelectric point was 10.0. in amino acid  composition, lysine, histidine, aspartic acid, valine, and phenylalanine were predominant. the bacteriocin was heat stable but inactivated by proteases or peptidase. the bacteriocin had a bactericidal effect on susceptible cells. an analysis of the inhibitory spectrum among typical oral indigenous bacteria showed that streptococcus salivarius, propionibacterium acnes, corynebacterium parvulum, and actinomyces israelii were susceptible to the bacteriocin. streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, actinomyces naeslundii, fusobacterium nucleatum, bacterionema matruchotii, and bacteroides melaninogenicus were resistant. the majority of s. aureus tested were susceptible, and all staphylococcus epidermidis strains tested were resistant.

AB  == plaque and saliva samples were obtained twice from 58 children at an interval of  1 year and examined for the prevalence of streptococcus mutans on mitis salivarius (ms) and mitis salivarius bacitracin (msb) agar. two types of s. mutans colonies with different colonial morphologies were seen on both media. they were serologically identified as serotypes c/e/f and d/g respectively. the first type, morphogroup c/e/f, had the typical "frosted-glass" appearance. it was the most prevalent and was found in 97% of the children. the second type, morphogroup d/g, had a creamy marzipan consistency with a dull, granular surface, gray to brown in color and often with some liquid around or on top of the colony. group d/g was detected in 21 children (36%) and then together with colonies of group c/e/f. children infected with single or multiple morphogroups of s. mutans  generally harbored the same groups 1 year later. there was a significant positive correlation between the proportion of s. mutans in plaque and their numbers in saliva.

AB  == plaque from the fitting surface of upper full dentures in eight patients with healthy palatal mucosa was studied. to characterize the predominant cultivable flora, 916 isolates (100-128 from each sample) were subcultured from anaerobic roll-tubes. streptococci constituted 0-81 per cent (median, 41 per cent) of the isolates with varying proportions of streptococcus milleri, streptoccus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus mitior and streptococcus sanguis. staphylococcus aureus made up 0-13 per cent (median, 6 per cent). gram-positive rods constituted 1-74 per cent (median, 33 per cent). among these, actinomyces israelii, actinomyces naeslundii, actinomyces viscosus and actinomyces odontolyticus were the most common species, whereas lactobacilli were isolated only from two samples, constituting 21 and 48 per cent. among gram-negative bacteria, only veillonella parvula was common, constituting 3-20 per cent (median, 10 per cent). gram-negative rods were isolated only from three samples in small proportions making up 0-6 per cent (median, 0 per cent) of the flora. forty-seven isolates (5 per cent) were lost. cultures for yeasts on sabouraud agar were positive for five samples and the yeast counts corresponded to 0-0.45 per cent (median, 0.002 per cent) of the total viable counts. the microflora of denture plaque is highly variable and is to a large extent similar to that of some forms of dental plaque.

AB  == oral streptococci, isolated from the mouths of 2 healthy subjects, hydrolysed innocuous rutin, a flavonoid glycoside, to its genotoxic aglycon quercetin, in vitro. the isolates were identified as streptococcus milleri. the glycosidase, rutinase, was studied in cell-free extracts derived from one of the isolates, grown anaerobically in batch cultures by the use of a bioassay, the ames test, in which s-9 was replaced by the cell-free extracts. this streptococcal rutinase was: constitutive, partly inducible, cytosolic, most active for rutin and most active at ph 6.5. type-culture collection strains of other oral streptococci (streptococcus salivarius atcc 25975 and streptococcus mutans strain 6715-10) showed no capacity for rutin degradation. a hypothesis for a novel role of the oral microflora in a disease process other than caries and periodontal disease, namely intra-oral cancer, is presented. the possibility of a bacterial liberation of the genotoxic quercetin in situ could be but one example of its involvement in the local carcinogenic process.

TI  == inhibition by the antimicrobial agent chlorhexidine of acid production and sugar  transport in oral streptococcal bacteria.
AB  == oral streptococci transport sugars via the phosphoenolpyruvate-phosphotransferase (pep-pts) system. in a specific assay of this system, low concentrations of chlorhexidine abolished the activity of the glucose and sucrose pts in batch-grown cells of streptococcus mutans ingbritt and b13, strep. sanguis nctc 7865, strep. mitis atcc 903, strep. milleri nctc 10709 and strep. salivarius nctc 8606. intact cells and cells made permeable to the assay reagents with toluene were used. toluenized cells were more sensitive to chlorhexidine than intact cells (0.09 and 0.25 mm, respectively). this pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine reduced acid production from glucose in ph fall experiments to values higher than are obtained solely from endogenous metabolism. the effect of  chlorhexidine on rates of acid production was determined at ph 7.0 using cells washed with either 135 mm nacl or 135 mm kcl. in general, faster rates of acid production from the metabolism of glucose and sucrose were obtained with potassium-treated cells. addition of the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine markedly reduced or totally abolished acid production by nacl-treated cells; a greater residual-activity was detected in the same cells washed with kcl (except with strep. mutans b13 and strep. mitis atcc 903). the pts-inhibitory concentration of chlorhexidine had little or no effect on the viability of cells. the results confirm the existence of sugar uptake systems in  oral streptococci additional to the pts and provide an explanation for the additive anti-caries effect of mouth-rinses containing both fluoride and chlorhexidine.

TI  == inhibition by acarbose, nojirimycin and 1-deoxynojirimycin of glucosyltransferase produced by oral streptococci.
AB  == acarbose is known to inhibit glucoamylase, maltase and sucrase. our aim was to test whether it would also inhibit glucosyltransferase (gtf), to determine the type of inhibition and to compare the inhibitor potency of acarbose with that of  nojirimycin and deoxynojirimycin, two other glucosidase inhibitors. enzyme inhibition was measured either by chemical assay or by incorporation of radioactivity into product. acarbose effectively inhibited the synthesis of polysaccharide by gtf from strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis, but not by fructosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius. acarbose  and 1-deoxynojirimycin were more potent inhibitors of gtf than maltose, nojirimycin or various amino sugars. the mechanism of action of these compounds is consistent with competitive inhibition.

TI  == an improved method for measuring aggregation of certain streptococcal bacteria found in dental plaque.
AB  == various cells were incubated with either dextran or sucrose and the reaction was  terminated by the addition of a 20 per cent solution of formaldehyde. a reaction  mixture consisting of cells and aggregated cells was applied to a step-gradient glycerol column (0-60 per cent) and 0.5 ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the column. non-aggregated cells remained in the top layer of the column. aggregated cells settled in the 30 per cent glycerol layer as determined  by either spectrophotometric or radioactive methods. the amount of aggregated cells demonstrated in this layer increased with either incubation time or concentration of sucrose, dextran or cells. cells of strep, mutans strains 6715,  aht, 10449, omz-176, omz-175 and two mutants of strep. mutans strain 6715 (designated c4 and c307) aggregated strongly. cells of strep. mutans strain lm7 aggregated weakly, whereas cells of strep. mutans 6715 mutant uab165, a mutant defective in aggregation. strep. mutans strain bht, strep. salivarius and strep.  sanguis did not aggregate in the presence of either sucrose or dextran. experiments testing co-aggregation between two different types of cells were done by using 3h-labelled and 14c-labelled cells. strep. mutans strain 6715 co-aggregated with strep. sanguis in the presence of sucrose or dextran, whereas  strep. mutans strain 6715 did not aggregate with strep. salivarius. the method separates aggregated from non-aggregated cells and enables quantitation of sucrose- or dextran-induced aggregation and co-aggregation.

AB  == longitudinal microbiological examinations have been made of dental plaque from a  site approximal to the upper central incisors of 10 8-year-old children living in an area with water fluoridation. differential counts of viable bacteria, made using a selective medium containing various levels of fluoride (0 to 100 mug/ml)  at ph levels of 7.0 to 5.5, demonstrated an effect of both ph and fluoride on the numbers and types of bacteria isolated. strains of streptococcus and neisseria grew after only 16 h of incubation at ph levels as low as 6.0 with fluoride levels up to 50 mug/ml. the most commonly isolated streptococci were streptococcus mitior and s. salivarius. s. mutans was isolated less frequently and was inhibited by 20 and 50 mug of fluoride per ml at ph 6.0 and 6.5, respectively. veillonella strains were the most resistant isolates, being isolated after 16 h of incubation on media at ph 6.0 with 100 mug of fluoride per ml. despite their known fluoride resistance, actinomyces spp. were often only detected on the selective media after 72 h of incubation. the ph of the medium had a definite selective effect, as the number of colonies growing on the fluoride-free basal media at ph 6.0 was only 30% of that at ph 7.0. representative strains of s. mutans, s. mitior, s. sanguis, and s. milleri were tested for their ability to utilize glucose at the ph and fluoride levels of the  medium on which they were initially isolated. fluoride reduced the initial glycolytic rate of the cells, but in 5 of the 13 strains tested the final amount  of glucose used after 2 h of incubation was the same in the presence or absence of fluoride. the isolation of bacteria capable of growth in the presence of fluoride over a significant portion of the ph range that occurs in plaque in vivo could explain in part the finding that fluoride does not have a dramatic effect on the plaque community. fluoride in plaque may reduce the ecological advantage afforded to aciduric s. mutans strains by carbohydrate substances. in the in vivo situation this could mean that, even with high carbohydrate intake, fluoride may  permit s. mitior to compete with s. mutans within the plaque ecosystem.

TI  == adsorption of lysozyme from human whole saliva by streptococcus sanguis 903 and other oral microorganisms.
AB  == several strains of streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii plus fresh isolates of streptococcus salivarius were surveyed for their abilities to deplete lysozyme from human-whole-saliva supernatant. bacteria were incubated in saliva for 60 min at 37 degrees c and then removed by centrifugation, and the recovered supernatant solutions were assayed for lysozyme activity by using whole cells of micrococcus  lysodeikticus as the substrate. mean lysozyme depletions by bacterial strains varied over a wide (eightfold) range. the greatest mean depletion of lysozyme (60 to 70%) was observed with s. sanguis (biotype i), serotype b of s. mutans, and the fresh s. salivarius isolates. the lowest mean depletion was noted with s. mitis (15%) and biotype ii s. sanguis (ca. 30%). the remaining species and strains exhibited an intermediate degree of depletion. in studies with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme was depleted by normal or heated (90 degrees c, 30 min) bacteria and could be recovered from the organism. furthermore, under appropriate conditions, lysozyme depletion by cells at 0 and 37 degrees c was very similar. on the basis of these observations, we concluded that depletion was due to the adsorption of lysozyme by the organism. with s. sanguis 903, lysozyme adsorption  depended on the concentration of bacteria, time of incubation, and the ionic strength of the medium. the extent of adsorption, however, was independent of ph's of 3.9 to 8.3. when a low concentration of s. sanguis 903 was used, lysozyme adsorption reached saturation (4 mug of adsorbed lysozyme per 10(7) cells) at 20  mug of lysozyme added per ml. salivary lysozyme adsorption by several other oral  microorganisms (a. viscosus wvu 626 and wvu 627, s. sanguis 73x11, s. mutans bht, and s. salivarius ng) was similar to that of s. sanguis 903 in sensitivity to ionic strength. lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 from either a buffer solution or a saliva supernatant was more sensitive to ionic strength at 0 than at 37 degrees c. on the basis of results from experiments in saliva versus buffer, we concluded that saliva had no major effect on the extent of lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis 903 other than providing a source of ionic strength. a comparison of ph and ionic strength effects on lysozyme adsorption by s. sanguis  903 with literature reports of lysozyme lysis of whole cells and hydrolysis of cell walls, peptidoglycan, and (glcnac)(4) suggested that adsorption by s. sanguis 903 was more dependent on electrostatic interactions than was lysozyme catalysis. the possibility is discussed that anionic bacterial surface components mediate lysozyme adsorption and temper the potential effects of lysozyme on the microorganisms.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == oral flora of children with "nursing bottle caries".
AB  == s. mutans averaged about 60% of the total cultivable flora of dental plaque obtained from caries lesions, white spot margins of these lesions, or clinically-sound areas of upper anterior teeth, and averaged about 27% in plaque  from mostly clinically-sound areas of posterior teeth of six children with nursing bottle caries; its concentrations in saliva averaged about 10% of the total cultivable flora. nearly all of 107 isolated s. mutans strains belonged to  the serotype group c/e/f. the proportion of s. sanguis, in contrast to those of s. mutans, were very low in plaque from upper anterior teeth and higher in plaque from posterior teeth. the proportions of s. salivarius in saliva were unusually low, and this organism was not detected in the saliva of most subjects. lactobacilli were found in nearly all plaque samples; plaque and carious material from cavities contained higher levels than plaque associated with white spots or  clinically-sound tooth surfaces. the findings provide further support for the role of s. mutans in the initiation of human dental caries. in the case of lactobacilli, they support other evidence suggesting only the limited involvement of these organisms in the initiation of caries lesions, but a more extensive role in their progression. in addition, they clearly illustrate the marked effect of diet on the dental plaque flora.

AB  == the enolase from a highly fluoride-sensitive strain of streptococcus salivarius and its fluoride-resistant mutant, as well as those from strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans with intermediate and low sensitivities to fluoride have been shown to be inhibited by fluoride. comparisons of the purified, strain-specific enzymes showed a high degree of similarity for all preparations. the michaelis constants for the substrate 2-phosphoglycerate were 1.3 x 10(-4) to 2.4 x 10(-4) m, ph optima were 7.3 to 7.7, and mg2+ optima were 2 meq/liter for all. inhibition by fluoride required the presence of inorganic phosphate and was competitive in nature, and the calculated modified inhibition indices were found to be in the range from 3.3 x 10(-14) to 5.8 x 10(-14) m4. percent inhibitions were determined under standardized conditions (0.16 mm naf, 2 mm mgso4, 0.5 mm pi, and 0.5 mm 2-phosphoglycerate) and were found to range from  53.3 to 65.9% for all of the purified enzymes. the differences do not appear to be meaningful metabolically. inhibition was reduced to about 14% at ph 6.0. from  the similarities in the behavior of the strain-specific enzymes it is concluded that the differences in the glycolytic sensitivities of the different strains of  streptococci to fluoride are not the consequence of any kinetic differences between the respective enolases.

TI  == sucrose-induced ecological response of experimental dental plaques from caries-free and caries-susceptible human volunteers.
AB  == microbial succession, experimental cariogenicity, and sucrose metabolism were examined in dental plaques which developed on sterile bovine enamel inserts in acrylic palatal appliances. the appliances were worn for a period of 14 days by 10 caries-free and 10 caries-susceptible human volunteers. three of six enamel inserts on each appliance were exposed extraorally to 10% sucrose in 0.85% saline six times a day, and three were exposed simultaneously to 0.85% saline as a control environment. the responses of the plaques to the high-sucrose environment in both caries status populations were compared. in all plaques, exposure to 10%  sucrose stimulated the succession of veillonella spp., lactobacillus spp., streptococcus salivarius, and, to a lesser extent, streptococcus mutans and a decline in levels of streptococcus sanguis, neisseria spp., and gram-negative anaerobic rods. plaques from caries-free mouths, in contrast to those from caries-susceptible mouths, harbored higher levels of veillonella spp., gram-negative anaerobic rods, and neisseria spp. and lower levels of lactobacillus spp. sucrose-exposed plaques from caries-free mouths also induced less enamel microhardness changes and formed less lactic acid from [14c]sucrose during a 60-min incubation at 37 degrees c than did comparable plaques from caries-susceptible mouths. the experiments revealed consistent differences in the ecological response to a cariogenic substrate environment in plaques from the two populations, with plaques from caries-free subjects exhibiting less cariogenic potential than those from caries-susceptible subjects.

TI  == isolation and characterization of streptococcus mutans mutants defective in adherence and aggregation.
AB  == a method was developed which enriched for mutants of streptococcus mutans that exhibit defects in adherence to glass, aggregation, or both. mutants were isolated from derivatives of strains ps14 (serotype c) and 6715 (serotype g) after mutagenesis with either ethyl methane sulfonate or nitrous acid. cell survival after mutagenesis was kept above 1 to 2% to enhance the probability that mutants resulted from single mutational events. a total of 117 mutants were isolated; they also displayed non-wild-type colony morphology on mitis salivarius agar. these mutants were examined for (i) adherence and aggregation after overnight growth in sucrose-containing medium, (ii) aggregation of nongrowing cells in the presence of 200 microgram of sucrose per ml or 20 microgram of dextran per ml, and (iii) dextranase production on blue dextran agar plates. although we isolated mutants which exhibited a variation from the parent strain in only one of the traits tested, the majority of mutants exhibited defects in two or more characteristics. thirty-eight stable mutants of independent origin were categorized into 13 separate phenotypic groups.

TI  == bacteriocin production by streptococcus salivarius strain p.
AB  == a bacteriocin, streptococcin sal-p, was isolated by freeze-thaw elution from cultures of streptococcus salivarius strain p grown on tryptic soy agar plus 1% neopeptone. the inhibitor could also be extracted with either 7 m urea of 1 m nacl from cells grown on this medium, but little activity was recovered from cells grown in liquid media of from the supernatants of these cultures. streptococcin sal-p was found to be a proteinaceous substance of molecular weight approximately 8000. it was remarkably stable at extremes of ph or temperature and appeared to adsorb nonspecifically to both sensitive and resistant bacterial cells and also to cellulose membranes. the range of its inhibitory activity was almost entirely against gram-positive bacteria, particularly streptococci, including strains of s. pyogenes and s. sanguis, but not s. mutans or group d streptococci. streptococcin sal-p was bactericidal for actively metabolizing susceptible strains.

TI  == interference of secretory immunoglobulin a with sorption of oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite.
AB  == the potential of secretory immunoglobulin a (s-iga) to interfere with the initial phase of dental plaque formation was studied by using an in vitro method which permits the quantitative determination of the sorption of radiolabeled oral bacterial cells to hydroxyapatite (ha) beads. the importance of specific s-iga antibodies was evaluated by a comparison of the effect of pure preparations of colostral s-iga, polymeric myeloma iga, or preabsorbed s-iga. specific antibody molecules bound at the ha surface significantly enhanced the sorption of two streptococcus sanguis strains. in contrast, ha-bound s-iga antibodies inhibited the sorption of streptococcus mitior and streptococcus salivarius. the same was true for streptococcus mutans cells, but only when they were propagated in the absence of sucrose. suspended in saliva, cells of all streptococcal species adhered in significantly lower numbers to ha. comparative experiments with bacteria suspended in solutions of various preparations of iga or immunoglobulin-deficient salivas with s-iga or myeloma iga added indicated that the adherence inhibition seen with s. sanguis, s. mitior, s. salivarius, and glucose-grown s. mutans was partly attributable to functions of s-iga antibodies. under the in vitro conditions of the study, s-iga antibodies had no effect on the sorption of sucrose-grown s. mutans, actinomyces viscosus, and actinomyces naeslundii to ha. the results indicated that s-iga can interfere with the sorption of some oral bacteria to ha by several different functions.

TI  == common antigens of streptococcal and non-streptococcal oral bacteria: immunochemical studies of extracellular and cell-wall-associated antigens from streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mutans, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == soluble extracellular antigens (esa) were prepared from the culture supernatant of exponential growing cells of streptococcus sanguis omz 9 by a combination of ammonium sulfate precipitation and chromatography on a bio-gel p6 column. soluble cell wall antigens (wea) were obtained from the bacterial pellet by extraction with 1 m phosphate buffer (ph 6). antisera against whole cells of s. sanguis and  s. mutans of different serotypes, 10% trichloroacetic extracts of bacterial cell  walls, dextran, esa, and wea were prepared by injecting the different antigens several times in rabbits. esa and wea were prepared from a representative strain  of bratthall's seven serological groups, lactobacillus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus. all sera showed various agglutinin titers against heat-killed cells, and titers were generally higher with homologous cells. the comparison of the different antigens using agar gel diffusion and immunoelectrophoresis showed the presence of extracellular common antigens in both esa and wea between the different strains. absorption of anti-esa sera with  wea, and anti-wea sera with esa, showed the existence of a specific antigen common to all bacteria in each fraction. enzymatic treatment of the antigen before immunodiffusion demonstrated the protein nature of the two antigens present in esa and wea.

TI  == virulence-related physiological changes and antigenic variation in populations of streptococcus mutans colonizing gnotobiotic rats.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine if populations of streptococcus mutans which were undergoing antigenic variation while colonizing gnotobiotic rats concomitantly became altered in physiological characteristics which affected their virulence. s. mutans strain jbp (serotype c), which was freshly isolated from a carious lesion in a 6-year old child, was used to inoculate gnotobiotic rats; uninfected animals served as controls. substrains were isolated from animals 1, 2, 3, 4, and 12 weeks after infection; samples of pilocarpine-stimulated saliva were also obtained from representative animals for  antibody analyses. isolates derived from stock cultures of strain jbp proved to be homogeneous with respect to all of the physiological characteristics monitored. however, substrains isolated from the animals within 4 weeks after infection were altered with respect to their ability to agglutinate in the presence of sucrose, their ability to form adherent growth in sucrose broth, and  the terminal ph attained in glucose broth. some isolates obtained 12 weeks after  infection no longer synthesized detectable levels of c antigen or intracellular glycogen, and they formed atypical smooth colonies on mitis salivarius agar. with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, low levels of immunoglobulin a (iga) antibodies reactive with whole jbp cells were detected in saliva samples of uninfected control animals at each sampling period; these evidently were induced  to antigens contained in the diet of the animals. significantly higher levels of  iga antibodies were present in saliva samples from animals infected with strain jbp for 3 weeks or longer. thus, the emergence of antigenic and physiological variants of s. mutans in the animals was paralleled by increased levels of salivary iga antibodies. the reactivity of salivary igg with jbp cells was low, and it fluctuated in both groups of animals. no antibodies of the igm class were  detected. when tested in gnotobiotic rats, several variants, including strains which no longer formed typical rough colonies or adherent growth in sucrose broth, proved much less virulent than parental strain jbp in inducing carious lesions. prior oral immunization, which resulted in higher levels of salivary and serum iga antibodies reactive with strain jbp, was found to accelerate the emergence of smooth-colony variants in the animals; it was also associated with decreased streptococcal population levels on the teeth and in feces of the rats.  it is suggested that part of the mechanism by which artificial immunization leads to a reduction in dental caries development in experimental animals is due to the earlier selection of less virulent streptococcal populations.

TI  == role of bacterial interactions in the colonization of oral surfaces of actinomyces viscosus.
AB  == the effects of several microbial residents of human oral cavities on the attachment of actinomyces viscosus t14v to tooth surfaces were assessed by using  the saliva-coated hydroxyapatite (sha) in vitro system. attachment to sha by a. viscosus t14v was not inhibited in the presence of streptococcus mutans gs5, either in the presence or absence of sucrose. precoating sha beads with s. mutans in the presence of sucrose also did not retard strain t14v attachment. however, the presence of streptococcus sanguis m5 during strain t14v attachment markedly inhibited the interaction of a. viscosus t14v with sha, whereas another s. sanguis strain, strain g9b, produced relatively weak inhibition. the inhibitory effect of s. sanguis m5 appeared to result from the direct interaction of this organism with a. viscosus t14v. conversely, the presence of strain t14v markedly  increased the attachment of s. sanguis m5 to sha while partially inhibiting the attachment of s. sanguis g9b. moreover, sha beads precoated with a. viscosus t14v bound much higher levels of s. sanguis m5 relative to uncoated sha, whereas s. sanguis g9b attachment was only weakly inhibited. it was also observed that sha beads precoated with either s. sanguis m5 or g9b inhibited subsequent attachment  by strain t14v. these results suggest the possibility that the attachment sites for both s. sanguis strains partially overlap those for a. viscosus t14v. streptococcus mitis weakly inhibited attachment of strain t14v to sha, and both streptococcus salivarius and lactobacillus casei had little effect on attachment. in addition, both a radioisotope attachment assay and fluorescent microscopy demonstrated no significant attachment of a. viscosus t14v to human epithelial cells.

TI  == an in vitro model for studying adsorption of oral streptococci to crown and bridge cements.
AB  == a sensitive, in vitro method has been developed for the study of bacterial adsorption to dental crown and bridge cements. the method employs heavily radiolabelled cells which adhere to the wall in wells made from the cements. loss of radioactivity from the bacterial suspension during incubation is used to measure the degree of bacterial adherence to the materials. strains of streptococcus sanguis and streptococcus mutans adhered in greater numbers than a  strain of streptococcus salivarius to both a zinc phosphate cement and a zinc carboxylate cement. the zinc phosphate cement supported adherence to a greater degree than did the zinc carboxylate cement. pretreatment of the cement surfaces  with human saliva tended to reduce bacterial adherence. pretreatment of the bacteria with saliva slightly enhanced sorption of s. sanguis and s. salivarius,  but tended to impair sorption of s. mutans to both types of cements. when both bacteria and cements had been pretreated with saliva, a strong inhibition of the  adherence of s. mutans was observed.

TI  == in vitro studies of dental plaque formation: adsorption of oral streptococci to hydroxyaptite.
AB  == a mixture of saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads and radioactively labeled bacteria has been employed as an in vitro model for the initial phase of dental plaque formation. adsorption in this model can be expressed by the langmuir adsorption isotherm, and the adherence of oral streptococci can be expressed as the product of the affinity constant (ka) and the number of binding sites (n), kan. with this approach, streptococcus sanguis serotype 1 strains adhered better  (kan = [187 +/- 72] x 10(-2)) than serotype 2 strains (kan = [97 +/- 84] x 10(-2)); a t test showed this difference to be statistically significant to the 99.99% confidence level. strains of s. mitis, s. mutans, and s. salivarius did not appear to adhere as well. to analyze the bacterial receptors involved in adherence, competition studies in which increasing quantities of unlabeled bacteria were added to a fixed quantity (4 x 10(9) cells per ml) of 3h-labeled serotype 1, reference strain s. sanguis g9b, were performed. these studies indicated that the type 1 strains competed for the same, or closely related, binding sites. competition studies using serotype 2 s. sanguis strains resulted in an increased binding of reference strain g9b to hydroxyapatite. scanning electron microscopy indicated this effect was due to the formation of localized aggregations of bacteria, presumably representing the two bacterial types. the results of competition studies with s. mitis were variable, and several strains of other oral bacteria showed little or no competition.

AB  == the addition of lactose, galactose, or isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside (iptg) to glucose-grown cells of streptococcus salivarius 25975 resulted in the co-induction of both the lactose-p-enolpyruvate phosphotransferase system (lactose-pts) and beta-galactosidase, with the latter the predominant metabolic system. with various strains of streptococcus mutans and streptococcus sanguis 10556, on the other hand, the lactose-pts was the major metabolic pathway with beta-galactosidase induced either to low or negligible levels. in all cases, induction of the lactose-pts resulted in the concomitant induction of 6-p-beta-galactosidase. the induction by lactose of both the lactose-pts and beta-galactosidase in all strains was repressed by glucose and other catabolites, notably, fructose. induction of beta-galactosidase in s. salivarius 25975 by iptg was, however, relatively resistant to glucose repression. induction experiments with iptg and lactose suggested that a cellular metabolite of lactose metabolism  was a repressor of enzyme activity. exogenous camp was shown to reverse the transient repression by glucose of beta-galactosidase induction in cells of s. salivarius 25975 receiving lactose, provided the cells were grown with small amounts of toluene to overcome the permeability barrier to this nucleotide, camp, was however, unable to overcome the permanent repression of beta-galactosidase activity to a significant extent under these conditions.

AB  == various factors affecting the aggregation of actinomyces naeslundii strain 12104  were studied. when the ph of glucose-supplemented growth medium fell below 5.5, the cells aggregated and formed microbial masses which tenaciously adhered to the culture vessels. when the organism was cultured in the same medium in the absence of glucose, maximum growth was reduced and the final culture ph values remained above 6.5, but the cells were more dispersed and nonadherent. adjusting the final ph of these cultures to below 5.5 with hcl caused the cells to aggregate. cells from unsupplemented cultures with final ph values of 6.7 were washed by centrifugation, dispersed by vigorous shaking, and suspended in buffer at ph values ranging from 4.5 to 8.0. aggregation (expressed as the percent reduction of optical density at 520 nm after incubation at 37 degrees c) occurred rapidly at ph values below 6.0 but did not readily occur at higher ph values. aggregation of strain 12104 in washed cell suspensions was induced by low ph and influenced by cell concentration and ionic strength of the environment. low ph values also induced aggregation in washed cell suspensions of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces viscosus.

AB  == extracellular products of 12 strains of streptococcus mutans and 5 additional species of oral bacteria were analyzed for their ability to inhibit proliferation of fibroblastoid cells (hela and av3) and blast transformation of human peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from normal individuals. products from s. mutans strains aht and bht, streptococcus intermedius, and actinomyces viscosus inhibited [3h]thymidine uptake by fibroblastoid cells and phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes. products from s. mutans e49, streptococcus salivarius, and actinomyces naeslundii inhibited blast transformation of human lymphocytes but did not significantly inhibit the growth  of fibroblastoid cells. preparations from s. intermedius gave the greatest inhibitory activity against both target cell types; initial characterization of this preparation suggested a single factor active in both assays, in that the heat lability and sephadex g-200 elution profile were similar for the inhibitory  activity seen with the two cell types. the molecular weight of the inhibitor, estimated by gel filtration on sephadex g-200 and ultragel aca34, was approximately 160,000. the results strongly suggest that oral bacteria produce heat-labile substances that interfere with fibroblast proliferation and alter the lymphocytic immunological response.

TI  == "conjugal" transfer of plasmid dna among oral streptococci.
AB  == the beta plasmid from streptococcus faecalis strain ds5, which codes for resistance to erythromycin and lincomycin, was introduced into a lancefield group f streptococcus, strain dr1501, by transformation. this strain, dr1501 (beta), was found to be an excellent donor of the beta plasmid and readily transferred the resistance markers to various lactic acid bacteria, including certain strains of s. mutans, s. sanguis, and s. salivarius. evidence is presented indicating that the transfer of the beta plasmid is mediated by a mechanism that requires cell-to-cell contact. the transfer of plasmid dna during conjugation has been confirmed by the isolation of beta plasmid from transconjugant clones and by their ability to then serve as donors of the erythromycin and lincomycin resistance markers.

TI  == comparative estimates of bacterial affinities and adsorption sites on hydroxyapatite surfaces.
AB  == the adsorption of strains of prominent oral bacteria to hydroxyapatite (ha) surfaces was studied by use of an adsorption model based on the langmuir adsorption isotherm; this permitted comparative estimates of the number of adsorption sites and the strength of the adsorption bonds on untreated and salivatreated ha surfaces for strain of streptococcus mutans, s. salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, actinomyces viscosus, and a. naeslundii. the experimental data closely followed the adsorption model as judged by the high correlation coefficients obtained for all strains studied. adsorption to untreated ha was similar for strains of the six species studied, suggesting that a common adsorption mechanism, possibly ca(2+) bridging, may exist for attachment to ha. more complex interactions appeared to be involved in bacterial adsorption to saliva-treated ha since adsorption of the strains tested at unsaturating cell concentrations varied more than 30-fold. this indicates that adsorbed salivary components on ha surfaces impart a higher order of specificity for subsequent bacterial adsorption. fewer cells of strains of s. mutans, s. salivarius, and a.  naeslundii adsorbed to saliva-treated ha than to untreated ha because adsorbed salivary components presented fewer adsorption sites. substantially higher numbers of cells of strains of s. sanguis, s. mitis, and a. viscosus adsorbed to  saliva-treated ha because the film of adsorbed salivary components increased the  number of adsorption sites for these strains. the affinity constants for all but  one strain studied were lower on saliva-treated ha than on untreated ha. the number of bacterial cells which adsorbed to saliva-treated ha more closely related to the number of available binding sites than to the strength of their adsorption bonds when tested at an initial concentration of 2 x 10(7) organisms/ml. although some differences were observed in the adsorption of strains of s. mutans representative of five serological groups, the numbers which attached to saliva-treated ha did not vary widely; this suggests that factors other than their ability to attach to a pellicle-covered ha surface may be responsible for their varying geographic distribution in human populations.

AB  == oral implantation and the cariogenic activity of clinical strains of streptococcus mutans which had been isolated from japanese children and labeled with streptomycin-resistance were examined in specific pathogen-free sprague-dawley rats. all the seven strains tested were easily implanted and persisted during the experimental period. extensive carious lesions were produced in rats inoculated with clinical strains of s. mutans belonging to serotypes c, d, e, and f, and maintained on caries-inducing diet no. 2000. noninfected rats did not develop dental caries when fed diet no. 2000. type d s. mutans preferentially induced smooth surface caries in the rats. strains of other serotypes primarily developed caries of pit and fissure origin. caries also developed in rats inoculated with reference s. mutans strains bhtr and fair (type b) that had been maintained in the laboratories for many years. however, the cariogenicity of the laboratory strains was found to have decreased markedly. all three s. sanguis strains could be implanted, but only one strain induced definite fissure caries. two s. salivarius strains could not be implanted well in the rats and therefore they were not cariogenic. four different species of lactobacilli also failed to induce dental caries in rats subjected to similar caries test regimen on diet no. 200. s. mutans strain mt6r (type c) also induce caries in golden hamsters and icr mice, but of variable degrees.

TI  == some immunohistochemical experiments aiming at the electron-microscopic in situ identification of a dental plaque microorganism--streptococcus mutans.
AB  == the aim of the present investigation was to test a procedure useful for the electron-microscopic in situ identification of the presumptive cariogenic microorganism streptococcus mutans (serotype d) growing in the human dental plaque. for this purpose, different parameters of an indirect immunohistochemical method were tested in three sets of experiments. in experiment set i, all serological and histochemical procedures were performed en bloc on specimens fixed only with glutaraldehyde before embedding in vestopal w. different marking  substances, such as ferritin, alkaline phosphatase and horseradish peroxidase (hrp) were tested. the en bloc method using hrp-labelled antibodies was found useful for staining of in vitro-grown bacteria but failed when applied to dental  plaque. in experiment set ii, ultrathin sections of glutaraldehyde-fixed and glycol methacrylate-embedded in vitro-grown bacteria were section-stained. the bacteria became outlined with a highly electron-dense hrp reaction product which  accumulated on top of the cell envelope. the same type of hrp reaction product was found on some bacteria in the 2-day-old dental plaque after section-staining. this system was further tested in a series of controls also using consecutive serial sections. in exp. set iii, a number of different stationary and transient  oral bacteria were immunohistochemically section-stained. a cross-reaction with bacteria belonging to s.salivarius was discovered and removed by absorbing the anti-s.mutans serotype d serum with s.salivarius (nctc 8618).

TI  == adherence of veillonella species mediated by extracellular glucosyltransferase from streptococcus salivarius.
AB  == the effect of extracellular products from streptococcus salivarius on sucrose-dependent adherence to smooth surfaces by other oral bacteria was studied in vitro. strains of streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pyogenes, and veillonella parvula without innate ability to adhere to a steel wire were able to do so when  incubated with sucrose and cell-free culture fluid from s. salivarius strains 9759, 25975, cnii, and mepi. these culture fluids synthesized more adherent material and water-insoluble glucan than those from streptococcus mutans c67-1 and seven other s. salivarius strains. among the s. salivarius strains, glucosyltransferase (gt; dextransucrase, ec 2.4.1.5) activity varied more than 100-fold. cells of veillonella and s. mitis s3 that had been incubated in culture fluids from s. salivarius 25975 and 9759, respectively, and then washed adhered upon subsequent incubation with sucrose. this was due to adsorbed gt because (i)  the adherence was sensitive to dextranase; (ii) it was observed only with the high-gt culture fluids; (iii) it was dependent on sucrose; and (iv) the washed veillonella cells synthesized glucan, but not fructan, from sucrose. these results suggest that sucrose-dependent adherence of bacteria without such innate  ability can be mediated by (i) entrapment in insoluble glucan synthesized by s. salivarius culture fluids, and (ii) prior adsorption of gt from s. salivarius culture fluids. the possibility that gt formed by high-yield strains of s. salivarius is distributed through the mouth by the action of salivary flow and contributes to sucrose-dependent adherence and plaque formation is considered.

TI  == survival of bacteria from human dental plaque under various transport conditions.
AB  == the effects of transport media, temperature, and anaerobiosis on the survival of  bacteria from human supragingival dental plaque were studied. individual samples  were obtained by passing sterile, unwaxed dental floss through the interproximal  spaces. the plaque-bearing portion of floss was immediately placed in vials containing reduced transport fluid, viability-preserving microbistatic medium, or reduced salt solution transport fluid. plaque samples were dispersed by ultrasonic oscillation, serially diluted, and plated in duplicate on mm10-sucrose-blood agar, mitis salivarius bacitracin agar, and rogosa tomato juice agar. initial viable counts (time 0) were compared with viable count determinations after 48- and 72-h storage. quantitative recovery (>30%) of various groups of oral bacteria was accomplished from both reduced transport fluid and viability-preserving microbistatic medium after 48- and 72-h storage. storage of dental plaque in reduced salt solution proved unsatisfactory for most  bacteria (less than 10% survival). since growth of some bacteria may occur in viability-preserving microbistatic medium and the charcoal present interferes with colonly enumeration on low-dilution plates, we found reduced transport fluid to be the most suitable medium for transport and recovery of bacteria from supragingival dental plaque. subzero storage (-196 and -40 degrees c) did not enhance the survival of bacteria from dental plaque; storage at moderate (5 and 20 degrees c) temperatures gave better recovery of viable bacteria. survival after anaerobic or aerobic storage was comparable for total colony-forming units; however, anaerobic storage enhanced survival of streptococcus mutans and lactobacillus. since these organisms are specifically associated with dental caries, anaerobic techniques are preferred for caries activity testing of plaque.

TI  == new method for the isolation of streptococcus mutans and its differentiation from other oral streptococci.
AB  == a new, improved agar medium for the isolation of streptococcus mutans, the etiological agent of dental caries, was developed. in contrast to mitis-salivarius agar, this medium not only recovers a greater number of s. mutans strains from most oral specimens but, because of its mannitol and sorbitol content, it also facilitates the differentiation of s. mutans from other oral streptococci, e.g., s. salivarius, s. mitis, and s. sanguis, which do not grow or produce scanty growth only after 10 days of incubation. the medium is easy to prepare because of its simple and unique composition, is characterized by the presence of an acid indicator, and can be utilized under aerobic and anaerobic conditions as well. the medium cannot be used to distinguish among the eight serotypes, a to g and sl-1, of s. mutans. mannitol-utilizing bacteria such as streptococci (e.g., s. faecalis) and other microorganisms (e.g., staphylococcus aureus) are able to grow on this medium and can be distinguished from s. mutans by their unique colony morphology.

TI  == properties of a mutant of streptococcus mutans altered in glucosyltransferase activity.
AB  == a mutant of streptococcus mutans gs-5 has been isolated as a smooth colonial variant on mitis salivarius agar. this mutant, designated sng-1, adheres to glass surfaces as well as the parental organism when grown in the presence of sucrose.  however, in contrast to the parental organism, glucose-grown cultures of the mutant did not adhere to smooth surfaces when incubated with sucrose under nongrowing conditions. the inability of the mutant organism to adhere to glass surfaces under the latter condition was a result to markedly reduced levels of mutant cell-associated glucosyltransferase activity. in addition, the extracellular activity of the mutant was also severely depressed relative to the  parental activity. the reduced levels of mutant enzyme activity appear to be a result of a mutation in a structural gene coding for glucosyltransferase activity since (i) mutant glucosyltransferase activity is much less resistant to heat inactivation compared to the parental enzymes and (ii) the migration patterns of  the mutant and parental enzymes differ on polyacrylamide gels and after isoelectric focusing on polyacrylamide gels. however, the kinetic properties of the mutant enzymes are similar to those of the comparable parental activities in  terms of ph and temperature optima and km values for sucrose. the mutant enzyme responsible for soluble glucan synthesis has been purified approximately 300-fold. these results are discussed in terms of the mechanism of glucan synthesis by s. mutans.

AB  == the cellular fatty acid composition of 18 strains of streptococcus mutans and 17  isolates of related streptococci were examined by gas-liquid chromatography. the  cultures could be divided into two distinct groups on the basis of their fatty acids. the first group, which included s mutans and s salivarius, contained palmitic (16:0), octadecenoic (18:1), stearic (18:0), eicosenoic (20:1), and eicosanoic (20:0) acids. the presence of the two 20-carbon fatty acids distinguished s mutans and s salivarius from all of the other species. two of the s mutans cultures were further distinguished by the presence of 19-carbon and 21-carbon cyclopropane acids. the second group included s sanguis, s mitis, s uberis, and a culture of lancefield group c streptococci. the percentages of the  major acids (16:0, 18:1, and 18:0) found in these species were essentially identical. a culture of lancefield group e streptococci contained large amounts of 16:1 and 18:1 and small amounts of two unidentified acids which were not present in any of the other cultures.

TI  == physiological classification of oral viridans streptococci.
AB  == the human mouth harbors large numbers of a variety of greening streptococci. for  many years the classification and nomenclature of these organisms have been confused, but recent studies have clarified the situation considerably. five distinct species can be distinguished among the oral streptococci s mutans, s sanguis, s mitior, s milleri, and s salivarius, and these may be identified using a simple scheme consisting of seven physiological tests. further subdivisions within these species may be achieved using serological methods. a small number of oral streptococci remain which cannot easily be identified with existing schemes. these may represent additional species that, as yet, have not been adequately described. there seems little justification for continuing the practive of calling all alpha-hemolytic streptococci simple "streptococcus viridans".

TI  == turku sugar studies x. occurrence of polysaccharide-forming streptococci and ability of the mixed plaque microbiota to ferment various carbohydrates.
AB  == dental plaque samples collected from the subjects during the last 20 months of the 2 year trial were subjected to quantitative and qualitative analysis of the occurrence of s. mutans, s. sanguis, s. salivarius and the total growth on phenol red agar. lyophilized plaque samples were homogenized and incubated on a sucrose  containing medium under anaerobic conditions. in addition, the ph-values were measured after incubation of the mixed plaque flora in media containing 1% respectively xylitol(x), sorbitol, sucrose (s), fructose (f) or no carbohydrates. the results show a significantly lower incidence of s. mutans in the x-group relative to the s- and f-groups. the corresponding difference could not be observed between the s- and f-groups. the logarithmic means and standard deviations of the colony counts of s. sanguis, s. salivarius and total bacteria yielded no significant differences between the 3 sugar groups during the test period. repeated ph-measurements, carried out at the 4, 12, 18 and 24 month phases, showed that, except in the presence of x, the mean values all fell below  the ph-limit of 5.5. in the course of the study, no evidence was obtained of adaption of mutation enabling acidogenic decomposition of x. these findings emphasize the importance of low acidogenic potential in dental plaque, generally  paralleled by a low incidence of dental caries.

AB  == d-fructans synthesized from sucrose by cell-free systems of strains of streptococcus mutans and strep. salivarius have been shown by methylation and enzymatic studies to have different glycosidic linkages. the cold water-insoluble d-fructans from strep. mutans strain bht and jc-1 have inulin-type structures consisting beta-(2 leads to 1)-d-fructofuranosidic linkages, with average repeating units of 8 and 27 sugar residues, respectively, whereas the water-soluble fructan from strep. salivarius strain hht has a levan-type branched structure consisting beta-(2 leads to 6)-d-fructofuranosidic linkages with an average repeating unit of 9 sugar residues. the solubility properties of these fructants are discussed on the basis of the structural differences.

TI  == evaluation of human oral organisms and pathogenic streptococcus for production of iga protease.
AB  == iga protease is a proteolytic enzyme found in whole human saliva and in dental plaque that cleaves both secretory and myeloma iga of human origin to yield intact fabalpha and fcalpha fragments. to determine which bacteria are capable of producing this enzyme, we have examined a variety of strains normally found in the human oral cavity and a number of streptococci of known lancefield group serotype. streptococci of groups a, b, c, d, f, g, h, m, and n, streptococcus mutans, streptococcus sanguis, streptococcus mitior, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus faecalis, veillonella, lactobacillus, actinomyces, propionibacterium, bacteroides, and fusobacterium were grown in liquid medium, and fluids were examined for iga protease activity. only s. sanguis and clinically isolated group h streptococci elaborated iga protease under the culture conditions used. negative strains could not be stimulated to produce the  enzyme when cultured in the presence of secretory iga. among the natural oral bacteria, capacity to produce iga protease is restricted to certain species of streptococcus, notably those of the group h serotype. since secretory immunity is mediated by the iga class of antibody, the presence of this enzyme at mucosal surfaces could modify the secretory immune function.

TI  == amino acid requirements of streptococcus mutans and other oral streptococci.
AB  == the amino acid requirements of streptococcus mutans strains aht, omz-61, fa-1, bht, gs-5, jc-2, ingbritt, at6t, omz-176, 6715, streptococcus salivarius hht, streptococcus sanguis omz-9, and strain 72x46 were determined in a chemically defined medium. when grown anaerobically in the presence of sodium carbonate (or  bicarbonate for a few strains), few amino acids were required. all strains tested required cystine (or cystine) as a nutrient. three strains (s. mutans omz-176, fa-1, and bht) required glutamate (and/or glutamine). a third amino acid (lysine  for s. mutans fa-1 and histidine for s. mutans omz-176) was required by two of the three strains which required glutamate. the amino acids mentioned above were  required for all conditions of incubation (and inoculum) tested. the requirements for several other amino acids were conditional, that is, dependent on the incubation conditions and inoculum used. for example, when carbonate was not added, glutamate was required by s. mutans gs-5. aerobic incubations, with carbonate or bicarbonate added, resluted in requirements for glutamate and leucine by several strains. with these incubation conditions, one strain required isoleucine (s. mutans fa-1), another valine (s. mutans aht), and a third tyrosine (72x46). aerobic incubations in the absence of carbonate or bicarbonate further increased the number of amino acids required by several strains. furthermore, when stationary-phase cultures replaced exponentially growing cultures as an inoculum, several strains required additional amino acids, presumably for the initiation of growth.

TI  == growth of several cariogenic strains of oral streptococci in a chemically defined medium.
AB  == a chemically defined medium in which streptococcus mutans strains aht, bht, gs-5, jc-2, ingbritt, at6t, at9t, 6715, and omz-176 and streptococcus salivarius strain hht grew rapidly to high turbidities was formulated. maximal turbidities of each  strain were observed after 8 to 12 h of aerobic growth. the subsequent transfer of exponentially growing cells into fresh medium resulted in growth at the same rate without lag. growth of these strains occurred with rates at least one-half of those observed in an organic medium, such as todd-hewitt broth. s. mutans strains fa-1 and omz-61 grew at relatively slow rates in the defined medium, but  more rapidly growth to higher turbidities of both strains was obtained when sodium bicarbonate was added to the medium. streptococcus sanguis strain omz-9 and another group h streptococcus (strain 72 times 46) grew rapidly in the defined medium after the addition of sodium carbonate. the presence of carbonate  or bicarbonate yielded higher turbidities of all the other strains, and the growth rates of several of the strains tested were also increased.

TI  == changing agglutination activities of salivary immunoglobulin a preparations against oral streptococci.
AB  == immunoglobulin a (iga) was prepared from samples of parotid saliva collected from two individuals over a 150-day period. standardized solutions of the iga were tested for agglutinating antibody activity against strains of streptococcus salivarius, s. sanguis, s. mitis, and s. mutans that had been isolated from a homologous individual on day 30 and preserved in the lyophilized state. the agglutinating activity of the standardized iga preparations against these strains was found to change over time, whereas the agglutination patterns of iga prepared from saliva samples collected 3 days apart were generally similar. differences in agglutination titers were also observed between iga samples prepared from saliva  collected on day 0 and day 150. the data indicate that the oral cavity may harbor streptococci of different antigenic composition representing the same species at  a given time and that parotid iga agglutinating antibody against these serotypes  changes over time.

TI  == immunoelectron microscopic identification and localization of streptococcus sanguis with peroxidase-labeled antibody: localization of surface antigens in pure cultures.
AB  == an indirect method of localizing antigens with horseradish peroxidase-labeled antibody was used to identify and localize surface antigens of streptococcus sanguis at the ultrastructural level. an electron dense layer surrounding the cell wall could be distinguished without any additional electron microscope staining. this labeled layer represents an immune complex consisting of bacterial surface antigens, specific rabbit antisera, and peroxidase-labeled goat anti-rabbit globulins. although with undiluted antisera slight cross-reactions occurred with s. salivarius and s. miteor (mitis), these could be readily distinguished from the more intense homologous reaction by their patchiness and the difference in distribution of the label. these cross-reactions were eliminated by appropriate dilutions of the antiserum. no cross-reactions occurred with s. mutans, s. faecalis, actinomyces species, or bacterionema, microorganisms wents indicated that horseradish peroxidase can become non-specifically adsorbed  to the membrane of certain bacterial cells. appropriate controls must, therefore, be included for localization of membrane associated antigens with horseradish peroxidase.

TI  == characteristics of streptococcus milleri and streptococcus mitior from infected dental root canals.
AB  == morphological and physiological characteristics of 103 streptococcal isolates obtained from positive routine cultures of material from dental root canals at filling, were studied. the majority of the isolates were those which at a primary identification not fullfilled the criteria of enterococci, strep. sanguis, strep. mutans or strep. salivarius. only a few representative strains of the latter types were included in the study as a control of the method. the resemblance of the 103 isolates to 38 reference strains were assessed with numerical methods. the isolates formed 9 clusters with reference strains occurring in all but one. of the isolates which it was intended to identify and characterize with numerical taxonomic analysis, all but one joined one of 3 clusters and were identified as strep. milleri or strep. mitior (mitis). the most useful cultural characteristics to dfferentiate the two species were growth on the sulphonamide containing mc-agar and 7.5% bile blood agar by strep. milleri and production of hydrogen peroxide by strep. mitior. the characteristics of the strains in the nine 80-phenons are given in table 2. other characteristics that appeared to be of interest for differentiating strep. milleri from strep. mitior and these two species from other viridans streptococci are underlined in table 2. strep. milleri seems not earlier to have been reported to occur in infected root canals. the occurrence of strep. milleri is in agreement with the data given on serological groups found among streptococcal isolates from routine root canal cultures. little is known about the occurrence and distribution of strep. milleri in the human oral cavity, which therefore warrant further investigations.

TI  == bacteriocin production and susceptibility among strains of streptococcus mutans grown in the presence of sucrose.
AB  == whereas the bacteriocin activity of eight strains of streptococcus mutans was unaffected by growth in the presence of sucrose, such a medium rendered five s. mutans and one s. salivarius indicator strains unsusceptible to the bacteriocins. in contrast, the susceptibility of three s. faecalis and one s. pyogenes strains  was unaltered when these indicators were grown in the presence of sucrose. since  the s. mutans and s. salivarius strains produced extracellular polysaccharides from sucrose whereas the s. faecalis and s. pyogenes strains did not, it was concluded that a coating of extracellular polysaccharides rendered normally susceptible organisms unsusceptible to bacteriocin action. this supports previous suggestions that such bacteriocins are not active in vivo and therefore play no role in regulating the microbial ecology in dental plaque.

TI  == mutanolysin, bacteriolytic agent for cariogenic streptococci: partial purification and properties.
AB  == mutanolysin partially purified from the culture filtrate of streptomyces globisporus 1829 consists of two main lytic enzymes with an isoelectric point near ph 8.5 and 10, respectively, and proteolytic enzyme is associated with the latter lytic enzyme. mutanolysin exhibited maximal lytic activity at 60 c in the  ph range 6.5 to 7.0 and was stable at 50 c in the acid range. n-bromosuccinimide  caused complete inhibition of lytic activity at 1 mm, whereas calcium and magnesium ions at the same concentration caused activation. mutanolysin had lytic or bactericidal activity against the living cells of streptococcus mutans, streptococcus salivarius, streptococcus sanguis, lactobacillus acidophilus, and actinomyces viscosus, which are considered to be etiologic agents of dental caries, but had no activity against s. aureus and all gram-negative strains tested. the lytic activity was well retained in human saliva. digestion of the cell walls of s. mutans bht by mutanolysin was accompanied by the liberation of free amino groups and reducing sugars. mutanolysin may be expected to be a useful agent for dental caries control.

TI  == in vitro attachment of streptococci to the tooth surface.
AB  == the ability of streptococcus strains to adhere to the tooth surface in vitro was  investigated. polished enamel slabs, with and without acquired pellicles, were incubated with buffer suspensions of oral streptococci, and attached bacteria were counted under a microscope using incident light. low numbers of bacteria adhered to uncoated enamel; the presence of an acquired pellicle significantly enhanced the attachment of all strains tested. the adherence of streptococcus sanguis was significantly greater than that of streptococcus salivarius, and both of these strains adhered in greater numbers than did streptococcus mutans. when bacteria were suspended in whole saliva, the adherence of s. salivarius and s. mutans was inhibited, whereas the adherence of s. sanguis was enhanced in some experiments and inhibited in others. the adherence of s. sanguis and s. salivarius was consistently inhibited by parotid fluid; this inhibitory effect persisted after thorough washing and resonication of the bacterial cells. incubation in oral fluids was associated with the attachment of bacterial clumps  to the pellicle, and parallel investigation revealed agglutination of s. sanguis  and s. salivarius by whole saliva and, in particular, parotid fluid. the results  are discussed in terms of surface microecology, and are related to the development of dental plaque.

TI  == efficiency of various growth media in recovering oral bacterial flora from human  dental plaque.
AB  == mm10 sucrose blood agar (mm10 sb agar), n(2)c agar, schaedler agar (sh agar), and mitis salivarius agar (ms agar) were tested for their ability to recover human dental plaque flora by a continuous anaerobic procedure and by a conventional anaerobic method. mm10 sb agar yielded higher recovery of bacteria from plaque samples as determined by the enumeration of colony-forming units (cfu). the cfu on n(2)c agar, sh agar, and ms agar were lower than mm10 sb agar when the continuous anaerobic procedure was used. the superior performance of mm10 sb agar was much more apparent when used for the cultivation of dental plaque by the conventional anaerobic method. under these conditions the counts were consistently higher on mm10 sb agar as compared to the other media tested. however, the differential counts of streptococcus sanguis and s. mutans from carious plaque samples were in general comparable on all culture media. deletion  of blood from mm10 sb agar did not lower counts. the elimination of dithiothreitol from this medium resulted in a significantly lower recovery of bacteria from the plaque samples when cultured by the conventional anaerobic method. the storage of mm10 sb agar for varying periods of time aerobic conditions did not seem to affect its performance. these findings suggest that mm10 sb agar is an ideal culture medium for the isolation, nonselective enumeration, and differential counts of bacteria present in normal and disease-associated plaques.

TI  == proportional distribution and relative adherence of streptococcus miteor (mitis)  on various surfaces in the human oral cavity.
AB  == a group of streptococci possessing the characteristics of streptococcus miteor (s. mitis) was found to predominate on nonkeratinized human oral mucosa. these organisms averaged from 76 to 89% of the total flora cultivable on anaerobically  incubated blood agar plates from cheek, lip, and ventral tongue surfaces. they averaged 34, 40, and 18% of the streptococci in dental plaque, in saliva, and on  the tongue dorsum, respectively. their ability to adhere to oral surfaces was studied by introducing mixtures of streptomycin-resistant strains of s. miteor, s. salivarius, and s. mutans into the mouths of volunteers. samples of oral surfaces taken 1 hr later indicated s. miteor adhered far better than the other streptococci to buccal mucosa and to teeth, but s. salivarius showed a higher affinity to the tongue dorsum. glucose-grown cells of s. mutans adhered feebly to all oral surfaces studied and were rapidly cleared from the mouth. cells of s. miteor and s. salivarius present naturally in saliva adhered to cleaned teeth comparable to in vitro cultivated strains. electron microscopy of cells of s. miteor attached to buccal epithelial cells obtained from germfree rats indicated  that the organisms possessed a fibrillar "fuzzy" coat which appeared to mediate their attachment to the epithelial cell membrane. this "fuzzy" coat was removed by treatment with trypsin, and it appears to be similar to that previously observed on cells of s. pyogenes and s. salivarius.

TI  == selective bacterial adherence to oral epithelial surfaces and its role as an ecological determinant.
AB  == the possible relationship between the ability of streptococcus species to adhere  to oral epithelial cells and their natural distribution on epithelial surfaces within the mouth was studied. strains of s. salivarius and s. sanguis, which are  present in significant proportions on oral epithelial surfaces, were found to possess a definite capacity to adhere to epithelial cells obtained from cheek scrapings of humans, hamsters, and germ-free rats. in contrast, strains of s. mutans, which are found in only minor proportions, if at all, on oral epithelial  surfaces exhibited feeble or no adherence to oral epithelial cells. s. salivarius cells attached well to human cheek cells over the range of ph 5 to 8. its adherence was not found to be markedly influenced by saliva or by growth in sucrose broth. several other types of bacteria were examined which also exhibited widely different abilities to attach to human cheek cells. mixtures of streptomycin-labeled strains were introduced into the mouths of volunteers for study of the adherence of streptococcus species to oral epithelial surfaces in vivo. labeled s. salivarius and s. sanguis were recovered in high proportions from cheek and tongue surfaces, whereas the proportions of labeled s. mutans recovered from these surfaces were low in comparison to the original mixture. these data indicate that a correlation exists between the relative adherence of various streptococcus species and their proportional distribution found naturally on oral epithelial surfaces. the ability of bacteria to adhere to surfaces is proposed as a critical ecological determinant affecting their colonization in environments with open surfaces exposed to bathing fluids.
