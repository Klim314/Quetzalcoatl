TI  == development of a selective and differential medium for capsulated lactococcus garvieae.
AB  == a selective and differential medium termed 'lg agar' was developed for the isolation and presumptive identification of lactococcus garvieae that results in  black colonies with red halos. in this study, all 14 strains of l. garvieae and only 9 of the 148 strains representing 38 other species were able to grow on the  lg agar. the nine viable strains on lg agar plates (including enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactococcus lactis, vibrio fluvialis, vibrio furnissii, vibrio mimicus and vibrio salmonicida) were further differentiated from l. garvieae by various colours or colony features. colonies isolated from the mixing culture and the infected giant sea perch using lg agar plates were all positively identified as l. garvieae by conventional tests and 16s rdna sequencing. furthermore, lg agar discriminated capsulated strains of l. garvieae, which were believed to be correlated with pathogens of fish and shellfish, from non-capsulated ones by colony appearances. the specificity and differentiating ability of lg agar suggest that this medium displays considerable potential for primary isolation and presumptive identification of l. garvieae from pathological and environmental samples.

TI  == identification of genes in a kg- phenotype of lactococcus garvieae, a fish pathogenic bacterium, whose proteins react with antikg- rabbit serum.
AB  == five different clones (sa1b05, sa1b10, sa2f01, sa8a11 and sa9h10) were isolated from the gene library of the lactococcus garvieae sa8201 (kg-) strain by immunological screening using rabbit serum against l. garvieae (kg-) phenotype cells. a western blot analysis indicated that the molecular sizes of immunologically detected proteins of sa1b05, sa1b10, sa2f01, sa8a11 and sa9h10, which were fused with lacz protein, were 25, 30, 28, 26 and 13 kda, respectively. the amino acid sequences of the immunologically detected proteins of sa1b05, sa1b10, sa2f01 and sa8a11 were homologous to a processing protease of bacillus subtilis (36.6%), dihydropteroate synthase of escherichia coli (34.6%), trigger factor of b. subtilis (45.8%) and n-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase of  vibrio furnissii (37.1%), respectively. there was no significant homologous sequence of sa9h10 in ddbj/embl/genbank and swissprot. we cloned and sequenced a  longer dna fragment (sa9h10l) of sa9h10 from the gene library. the predicted amino acid sequence of this clone was weak homology to m protein of streptococcus pyogenes (22.7%). five genes were specifically expressed in the kg- phenotype strains. however, sa8a11 and sa9h10 was expressed in the mutated strain sa8201-ttc, whose serological phenotype was changed from kg- to kg+ by 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride.
