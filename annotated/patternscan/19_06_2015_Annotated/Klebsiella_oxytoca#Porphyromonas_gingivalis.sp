TI  == changes in the subgingival microbiota and periodontal parameters before and 3 months after bracket placement.
AB  == introduction: dental plaque is organized in a biofilm complex that provides protection and nutrients for periodontopathic bacteria. several factors can affect microbial colonization, including restorations and orthodontic brackets. the aim of this study was to investigate changes in subgingival microbiota and clinical parameters before and after bracket placement. methods: clinical parameters and subgingival microbial samples were collected from 30 patients before and after bracket placement. thirty additional patients with no orthodontic treatment served as controls. samples were cultured and analyzed for  periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria. a descriptive analysis was conducted, and chi-square, student t, wilcoxon matched, and mann whitney rank sum tests were used to test for differences between groups (p < or=.05). results: no  changes in probing depth or clinical attachment level were observed, but scores for bleeding on probing, plaque index, and gingival index increased after bracket placement (p < or =.05). porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia/prevotella nigrescens, tannerella forsythia, and fusobacterium species were elevated in the experimental group after bracket placement compared with the control group (p < or =.01). superinfecting microorganisms such as enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, and serratia marcescens were  also found. conclusions: bracket placement influences the accumulation of plaque  and the colonization of important periodontopathic and superinfecting bacteria, resulting in more inflammation and bleeding. special attention should be paid to  oral hygiene methods in orthodontic patients.

TI  == subgingival microflora of advanced periodontitis in the dominican republic.
AB  == a study of the predominant subgingival microflora was carried out in 24 periodontitis patients, 18 to 60 years of age, in santo domingo, dominican republic. paper point sampling, transport in vmga iii, and conventional microbiological techniques were utilized. direct microscopic examination revealed that cocci and nonmotile organisms made up 85% of the total organisms and spirochetes as little as 3%. nonselective culturing showed gram-negative organisms to constitute 53% of total isolates. fusobacterium nucleatum averaged 15%, black-pigmented anaerobes 7%, and peptostreptococcus micros 10% of the cultivable microflora. enteric rods and acinetobacter species were recovered from 16 patients and comprised 23% of the cultivable flora. enterobacter cloacae occurred in 8 patients, klebsiella oxytoca in 3 patients, and 7 other species in  10 patients. parallel studies have found a significantly lower prevalence of enteric rods in advanced periodontitis patients in the usa. in conclusion, fewer  spirochetes and markedly more enteric rods seem to inhabit adult periodontitis lesions in santo domingo patients compared to those in usa. high levels of subgingival enteric rods in periodontitis patients in santo domingo may have important prophylactic and therapeutic implications.
