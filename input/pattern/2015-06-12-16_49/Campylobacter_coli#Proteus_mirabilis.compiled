TI  - Detection of Salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method targeting bcfD gene.
AB  - In this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay for Salmonella detection targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in Salmonella. The Salmonella LAMP assay we developed successfully amplified 44 Salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-Salmonella standard strains (Proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Campylobacter jejuni and Vibrio parahemolyticus). The detection limit was 5 CFU of Salmonella pure culture or 200 CFU of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 CFU g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect Salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. Our experiments show that the LAMP method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection. The Salmonella LAMP assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: A loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was established to detect Salmonella targeting bcfD gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene.

The Salmonella LAMP assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for Salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.
TI  - Isolation of Campylobacter from Brazilian broiler flocks using different culturing procedures.
AB  - Conventional culturing methods enable the detection of Campylobacter in broiler flocks. However, laboratory culture of Campylobacter is laborious because of its fastidious behavior and the presence of competing nontarget bacteria. This study evaluated different protocols to isolate Campylobacter from broiler litter, feces, and cloacal and drag swabs. Samples taken from commercial Brazilian broiler flocks were directly streaked onto Preston agar (PA), Campy-Line agar (CLA), and modified charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar (mCCDA) and also enriched in blood-free Bolton broth (bfBB) for 24 and 48 h followed by plating onto the different selective media. Higher numbers of Campylobacter-positive cloacal and drag swab samples were observed using either direct plating or enrichment for 24 h before plating onto PA, compared with enrichment for 48 h (P < 0.05). Furthermore, direct plating was a more sensitive method to detect Campylobacter in broiler litter and feces samples. Analysis of directly plated samples revealed that higher Campylobacter levels were detected in feces streaked onto PA (88.8%), cloacal swabs plated onto mCCDA (72.2%), drag swabs streaked onto CLA or mCCDA (69.4%), and litter samples inoculated onto PA (63.8%). Preston agar was the best agar to isolate Campylobacter from directly plated litter samples (P < 0.05), but there was no difference in the efficacies of PA, mCCDA, and CLA in detecting Campylobacter in other samples. The isolated Campylobacter strains were phenotypically identified as Campylobacter jejuni or Campylobacter coli. The predominant contaminant observed in the Campylobacter cultures was Proteus mirabilis, which was resistant to the majority of antimicrobial agents in selective media. Together, these data showed that direct plating onto PA and onto either CLA or mCCDA as the second selective agar enabled the reliable isolation of thermophilic Campylobacter species from broiler samples. Finally, Campylobacter was detected in all broiler flocks sampled.
TI  - Screening of Australian plants for antimicrobial activity against Campylobacter jejuni.
AB  - Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of acute enteritis in humans, with  symptoms such as diarrhoea, fever and abdominal cramps. In this study, 115 extracts from 109 Australian plant species were investigated for their antimicrobial activities against two C. jejuni strains using an in vitro broth microdilution assay. Among the plants tested, 107 (93%) extracts showed activity at a concentration between 32 and 1024 microg/mL against at least one C. jejuni strain. Seventeen plant extracts were selected for further testing against another six C. jejuni strains, as well as Campylobacter coli, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus cereus, Proteus mirabilis and Enterococcus faecalis. The extract from Eucalyptus occidentalis demonstrated the highest antimicrobial activity, with an inhibitory concentration of 32 microg/mL against C. jejuni and B. cereus. This study has shown that extracts of selected Australian plants possess antimicrobial activity against C. jejuni and thus may have application in the control of this organism in live poultry and retail poultry products.
TI  - Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli in patients with travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  - The identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of ESBL-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. Patients with travellers' diarrhoea (N = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia or Campylobacter, were also examined for ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. The overall prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBL-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). Of the patients who had travelled in Europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be ESBL carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside Europe. ESBL-producing E. coli was especially common among patients returning from India (11/14), Egypt (19/38; 50%) and Thailand (8/38; 22%). In total, 90% of the genes of the ESBL-positive samples were of CTX-M type. The CTX-M-1 group dominated, followed by the CTX-M-9 group. The repetitive sequence-based PCR fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the ESBL strains found. Patients who have travelled outside Europe are at high risk of being colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.
TI  - Isolation and purification of enterocin E-760 with broad antimicrobial activity against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Strain NRRL B-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as Enterococcus durans, Enterococcus faecium, or Enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as antagonistic to Campylobacter jejuni. The isolate produced a 5,362-Da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, S. enterica serovar Choleraesuis, S. enterica serovar Typhimurium, S. enterica serovar Gallinarum, Escherichia coli O157:H7, Yersinia enterocolitica, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella dysenteriae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, and 20 other Campylobacter species isolates. The enterocin, E-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. The proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin E-760 was demonstrated upon treatment with various proteolytic enzymes. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase K, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. The enterocin demonstrated thermostability by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees C and was stable at pH values between 5.0 and 8.7. However, activity was lost below pH 3.0 and above pH 9.5. Administration of enterocin E-760-treated feed significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized with two strains of C. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) CFU. Enterocin E-760 also significantly (P < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired Campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.
TI  - A microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  - A major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. In addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. A microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrB as the marker gene, was developed. We present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. Our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. The approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting Escherichia coli, Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., Aeromonas hydrophila, Vibrio cholerae, Mycobacterium avium, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Helicobacter pylori, Proteus mirabilis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Campylobacter jejuni. The introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. Environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. Detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.
TI  - Elevated levels of IgM and IgA antibodies to Proteus mirabilis and IgM antibodies to Escherichia coli are associated with early rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Antibodies to Proteus mirabilis were previously detected in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (RA). We examined the prevalence of antibodies to P. mirabilis and their associations with RA in early synovitis patients. METHODS: Two hundred and forty-six patients with inflammatory arthritis for less than 1 yr were prospectively evaluated for 1 yr. Of these patients, 30% had rheumatoid factor (RF)-positive RA, 16% RF-negative RA, 17% a spondyloarthropathy and 37% undifferentiated arthritis. Serum antibodies to P. mirabilis, Escherichia coli and other potentially arthritogenic organisms (Chlamydia, Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Yersinia and parvovirus B19) and for antibodies specific for immunoglobulin (Ig) G damaged with advanced glycation end-products (anti-IgG-AGE) were measured. RESULTS: IgM and IgA anti-Proteus antibodies were significantly higher in patients with RF-positive RA compared with all other patient groups (P < 0.0005 and P < 0.005). Anti-P. mirabilis IgG, and IgG, IgA, and IgM antibodies to other potentially arthritogenic pathogens did not differ in the patient groups. IgM antibodies to E. coli were elevated in RF-positive RA patients. Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA results were not explained by false-positive reactions, because after absorption of RF there was no decrease in antibodies to Proteus in 10 of 12 patients. Proteus and E. coli antibodies were highest in patients positive for both RF and anti-IgG-AGE antibodies (P<0.001). Patients with erosions tended to have higher IgA anti-Proteus titres, but no association with the shared HLA epitope or treatment was detected. CONCLUSION: Anti-P. mirabilis IgM and IgA and anti-E. coli IgM antibody elevations are associated with early seropositive RA and the presence of anti-IgG-AGE antibodies. The role that P. mirabilis or E. coli plays in early RF-positive RA requires further investigation.
TI  - [Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study].
AB  - Bact-Alert automatized system for blood cultures: 5 vs 7 days of incubation. First Argentine multicentre study. Between January and December 2001, we analyzed 80,141 blood cultures by the Bact-Alert system (14,960 FAN aerobics, 3,855 FAN anaerobic, 11,114 standards aerobics, 11,367 standards anaerobic, 12,054 pediatrics and 26,791 FAN pediatrics bottles) and 44.235 series from 27.615 patients at eight hospitals of Buenos Aires city, one of La Plata city and three of the Buenos Aires province. A total of 13,657 blood cultures yielded a positive result. Only 181 of them had been detected as positive between the 5th and 7th day of incubation and only 26 (0.19%) had clinical significance (Staphylococcus aureus 3; coagulase negative staphylococci 2; Enterococcus faecalis 1; Streptococcus pneumoniae 2; Campylobacter spp 1; Escherichia coli 1; Enterobacter cloacae 1; Enterobacteraerogenes 1; Citrobacter freundii 1; Klebsiella pneumoniae 1; Proteus mirabilis 1; Serratia marcescens 4; yeasts 7, including one strain of Cryptococcus neoformans). Of the total of contaminants, 38% were isolated by the anaerobic standard (65% were Propionibacterium spp and 29% coagulase negative staphylococci), 31.2% by the FAN aerobic (33.3% difphteroids and 28.9% Bacillus spp), 11.8% by the pediatric, 9% by FAN pediatric, 8.33% by aerobic standard and 1.4% by FAN anaerobic bottle. Our results show that the prolonged incubation of blood cultures for more than 5 days using the Bact-Alert system is unnecessary.
TI  - Diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on Helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  - Among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (AA) is one of the most important. AA has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on Helicobacter pylori. However, there are limited studies on the possible role of AA and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (PA) on the growth and survival of H. pylori. In the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that AA in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mM) inhibited H. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. In contrast, under aerobic conditions AA in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mM) significantly increased the survival of H. pylori presumably eliminating the toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. The hydrophobic derivative of AA, PA (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mM). This effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: Escherichia coli, Proteus vulgaris, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Clostridium sporogenes and Campylobacter jejuni. Among these bacterial strains, PA showed a similar inhibitory effect on B. cereus and B. subtilis as observed with H. pylori. The results suggest that PA may be considered an important AA derivative in eradication of H. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.
TI  - Infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious background of patients with a history of acute anterior uveitis (AAU) and healthy control subjects. METHODS: Sixty four patients with previous AAU and 64 sex and age matched controls were studied. Serum antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Campylobacter jejuni, and Borrelia burgdorferi were measured using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and antibodies to Chlamydia trachomatis and Chlamydia pneumoniae by microimmunofluorescence test. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), separated by density gradient centrifugation, were studied for Salmonella and Yersinia antigens by means of an immunofluorescence test, and for C pneumoniae DNA with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Neither prevalence nor levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and control subjects, or between subgroups of patients created on the basis of clinical characteristics. In logistic regression analysis, the high number of recurrences (>10) of AAU was independently related to the presence of single or multiple bacterial antibodies (p=0.04). None of the PBMC samples of the patients were positive for Yersinia or Salmonella antigens. C pneumoniae PCR was positive in a patient who was negative for C pneumoniae antibodies. CONCLUSION: Although neither the prevalence nor the levels of single microbial antibodies studied differed between the patients and the controls, current data suggest that the presence of single or multiple antibodies in patients with many recurrences of AAU compared with patients with none or few recurrences may be a sign of repeated infections, antigen persistence, or raised innate immune responsiveness.
TI  - Antibody reactivity of a standardized human serum protein solution against a spectrum of microbial pathogens and toxins: comparison with fresh frozen plasma.
AB  - In this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (HSP) and fresh frozen plasma (FFP) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. Due to the clinical use of HSP and FFP for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that HSP contains marked IgG antibody reactivity against antigens of Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Enterobacter sakazakii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Candida albicans. Although no IgM antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in HSP, moderate IgA reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated specific IgA and IgG responses against the endoproteinase Glu-C and the superantigens enterotoxin A and B of S. aureus, the IgA-protease of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic E. coli. By using 3 different HSP batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. This antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of FFP.
TI  - A novel action of the proton pump inhibitor rabeprazole and its thioether derivative against the motility of Helicobacter pylori.
AB  - The motility of Helicobacter pylori was maximum at 37 degrees C and at pH 6. A newly developed proton pump inhibitor, rabeprazole (RPZ), and its thioether derivative (RPZ-TH) markedly inhibited the motility of H. pylori. The concentrations of the drug necessary to inhibit 50% of the motility were 0.25, 16, 16, and >64 microgram/ml for RPZ-TH, RPZ, lansoprazole, and omeprazole, respectively. No such inhibitory effects were observed with H(2) blockers or anti-H. pylori agents. The motilities of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli-but not those of Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, and Proteus mirabilis-were also inhibited. Prolonged incubation with RPZ or RPZ-TH inhibited bacterial growth of only H. pylori, except for a turbid colony mutant. The results indicate that RPZ and RPZ-TH have a characteristic inhibitory effect against the motility of H. pylori (spiral-shaped bacteria), which is distinguished from that against bacterial growth.
TI  - [Lumbar puncture in a pediatric emergency department: something more than a diagnostic technic].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to know the incidence of serious bacterial infections (SBI) in children without sepsis or intracranial infection in which spinal puncture (LP) was performed in an Emergency Department. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective study of all 471 previously healthy children between 1 month and 14 years of age in which a lumbar puncture was performed between July 1995 and March 1997 in the Emergency Department of our hospital was performed. RESULTS: Two hundred and three children (43%) had sepsis, meningitis or encephalitis (aseptic meningitis 149, 31.6%; sepsis-bacterial meningitis 26, 5.5%; nonspecific meningitis 26, 5.5%; encephalitis 2, 0.4%) and 14 (5.2%) had pneumonia. Of the other 254 children, 36 (14.1%) had a SBI: 19 urinary tract infections (E. coli), 11 bacteremia (Streptococcus pneumoniae 8, Salmonella enteritidis 1, Proteus mirabilis 1, E. coli 1, the latter two also having a positive urine culture) and 6 bacterial gastroenteritis (salmonella 5, Campylobacter jejuni 1). The incidence of SBI was significantly higher in the group of children younger than 5 years old (32/175, 18.2%) than in the older group (4/79, 5.0%, p = 0.009). Two patients died (one with pneumococcal meningitis and one with meningococcal sepsis). CONCLUSIONS: Children with fever and a normal result in the LP must be carefully examined and, especially in younger patients, urine, blood and stool (if stool abnormalities) cultures should be collected. These children must be closely observed in the hospital or at home and must be re-evaluated by their pediatrician in the following 24 hours.
TI  - Enterobacterial antibodies in Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the role of microbial infection in rheumatic diseases. METHODS: Sera from 39 Chinese patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 52 patients with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and 51 healthy subjects (HS) were examined for IgG, IgA, and IgM class antibodies against Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Salmonella typhimurium and enteritidis, Yersinia enterocolitica, and Klebsiella pneumoniae (capsular serotypes 31 and 43), using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. RESULTS: In patients with RA, IgA class antibodies against all bacterial strains used as the antigen were increased when compared to healthy controls. In patients with AS, significantly elevated IgA levels were observed against Campylobacter and Klebsiella K43. IgM class antibodies were less frequently elevated in RA and in AS than IgA class antibodies. In RA patients, IgG antibodies against Klebsiella K43 and Proteus were significantly increased. No differences were observed in IgG class antibodies between AS patients and healthy controls. CONCLUSION: Increases in serum bacterial antibodies in RA and AS suggest that in both diseases stimulation of the intestinal immune system by enterobacteria may have a role. However, the question whether this phenomenon is due to increased intestinal permeability and/or represents cross reactions between different enterobacteria remains open.
TI  - [Helicobacter pylori: antibodies in sera of pigs and calves].
AB  - 64 sera of pigs and 22 sera of calves were investigated in a Helicobacter pylori-ELISA. The test system was validated with positive and negative reference sera. In contrast to other investigations it was tried to exclude false positive results by absorbing the sera with Wolinella succinogenes, Campylobacter jejuni subsp.jejuni, E. coli and Proteus mirabilis. This proved to be necessary, as the extinctions of some sera were reduced considerably. Using this technique sera of 5 pigs and 6 calves could be identified, which fulfilled the following criteria: 1. The extinctions were statistically significant above the mean value of the corresponding group after absorption with Campylobacter jejuni subsp.jejuni. 2. After absorbing the sera of pigs with 3 and the sera of calves with 4 bacteria the extinctions were above 50% of that of the human positive serum. 3. The extinctions of these sera were-like the positive reference sera-nearly not influenced by the absorption. These results indicate the presence of serum antibodies in pigs and calves, which react with epitops from Helicobacter pylori.
TI  - In-vitro evaluation of cefpodoxime.
AB  - In-vitro antimicrobial activity of cefpodoxime was evaluated against several microbial species by both conventional tests and additional parameters which take into consideration some of the conditions likely to be encountered in infected tissues. MICs for 414 recent clinical isolates, including staphylococci, streptococci, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, several Enterobacteriaceae, Aeromonas hydrophila and Campylobacter jejuni were determined. MIC values overall were similar to those observed for strains from other geographical areas. Inhibition of growth by cefpodoxime was virtually unaffected by the inoculum size, even using bacterial populations as large as 10(9) cfu of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis. Growth in the presence of human serum as the only source of nutrients did not significantly affect the inhibition exerted by cefpodoxime, even against large bacterial populations of S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae. For K. pneumoniae, E. coli, P. mirabilis and beta-lactamase-negative M. catarrhalis it was also found that sub-MIC concentrations of cefpodoxime were still able to inhibit the majority of cells in microbial populations as large as 10(9) cfu. Evaluation of bactericidal activity demonstrated that cefpodoxime concentrations comparable to those achievable in plasma or in the respiratory tract were able to kill rapidly large bacterial populations of S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. The bactericidal activity was apparently lower against M. catarrhalis, H. influenzae, S. aureus, E. coli, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in HLA-B27+ healthy individuals.
AB  
TI  - Detection of ciprofloxacin resistance in gram-negative bacteria due to alterations in gyrA.
AB  - Two plasmids containing the cloned Escherichia coli wild-type gyrA gene were used to transform ciprofloxacin-resistant Gram-negative clinical isolates to screen for DNA gyrase A-mediated quinolone resistance. The results show that the technique is simple and applicable to a wide range of Gram-negative species including E. coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella aerogenes, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The use of an arithmetical MIC series of dilutions (as opposed to standard geometrical ones) was found to be essential during screening for the detection of altered gyrase A. The observations were consistent with the suggestion that DNA gyrase is highly conserved among different species of bacteria and that gyrase A-mediated resistance can occur in all.
TI  - Campylobacter jejuni in acute diarrhoea in infancy and its relation to faecal leucocytic count.
AB  - A prospective study was carried out to identify the relative risk of Campylobacter jejuni infection in 50 infants with acute diarrhoea, 24 infants with acute resistant diarrhoea and 25 healthy normal infants as a matching control group. Faecal samples were collected from the three groups and were cultured on both selective media for Campylobacter and other media for isolation of other organisms. Direct stool smears, stained with methylene blue, were examined for detection of faecal leucocyte in all samples. Campylobacter jejuni were isolated from 4 cases (8.0%) of the acute diarrhoeal group and 4 cases (16.6%) of acute resistant diarrhoeal group. The other bacterial pathogens isolated from our cases were Salmonella, Shigella, E. Coli, Proteus mirabilis, Vibrio Parahaemolytious Klebsiella, Streptococcus faecalis and Candida albicans. All cases from whom Campylobacter was isolated were bottle fed and their ages were below 6 months. Smears for faecal leucocytes were positive in 100% of Campylobacter isolated cases, 60% of Salmonella, 50% of Shigella, 14% of E. Coli and 100% were negative in all other cases. Thus it can be recommended that any case presenting with acute diarrhoea should be initially screened by faecal leucocytic counting, positive cases should be cultured for Campylobacter jejuni detection in addition to cultures for other organisms detection.
TI  - [Antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  - In order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (OFLX) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. The following conclusions were reached. 1. Comparison of the MIC distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of OFLX-resistant isolates with the passage of time of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella ssp., Enterobacter spp., Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Providencia spp., and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Most common elevations of MIC values against these bacteria were observed in MIC80 and MIC90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in MIC50 values. However, MIC50's of OFLX against Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. Most of the OFLX-resistant strains of S. aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Furthermore, MIC80 of OFLX against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. Susceptibility of Streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. The results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. Bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of OFLX-resistant strains even in 1990 were Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Campylobacter spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. 4. Recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of OFLX-resistant strains among many bacteria. However, the bacteria which contained high percentages of OFLX-resistant strains except for MRSA were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of MIC values were only observed in MIC80 and MIC90. These results suggested that OFLX preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.
TI  - Bacterial antibodies in ankylosing spondylitis.
AB  - Antibodies to Salmonellae, Yersiniae, Campylobacter jejuni, Borrelia burgdorferi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis and Chlamydia trachomatis were measured by ELISA in the sera of 99 patients with ankylosing spondylitis. Increased prevalence of IgA and IgG class antibodies against K. pneumoniae and of IgA class against E. coli was observed in ankylosing spondylitis. No clear correlation between the disease activity and occurrence of antibodies was revealed. The results are in line with the previously published findings suggesting that K. pneumoniae may have a role in the aetiopathogenesis of ankylosing spondylitis.
TI  - Shuttle cloning and nucleotide sequences of Helicobacter pylori genes responsible for urease activity.
AB  - Production of a potent urease has been described as a trait common to all Helicobacter pylori so far isolated from humans with gastritis as well as peptic ulceration. The detection of urease activity from genes cloned from H. pylori was made possible by use of a shuttle cosmid vector, allowing replication and movement of cloned DNA sequences in either Escherichia coli or Campylobacter jejuni. With this approach, we cloned a 44-kb portion of H. pylori chromosomal DNA which did not lead to urease activity when introduced into E. coli but permitted, although temporarily, biosynthesis of the urease when transferred by conjugation to C. jejuni. The recombinant cosmid (pILL585) expressing the urease phenotype was mapped and used to subclone an 8.1-kb fragment (pILL590) able to confer the same property to C. jejuni recipient strains. By a series of deletions and subclonings, the urease genes were localized to a 4.2-kb region of DNA and were sequenced by the dideoxy method. Four open reading frames were found, encoding polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 26,500 (ureA), 61,600 (ureB), 49,200 (ureC), and 15,000 (ureD). The predicted UreA and UreB polypeptides correspond to the two structural subunits of the urease enzyme; they exhibit a high degree of homology with the three structural subunits of Proteus mirabilis (56% exact matches) as well as with the unique structural subunit of jack bean urease (55.5% exact matches). Although the UreD-predicted polypeptide has domains relevant to transmembrane proteins, no precise role could be attributed to this polypeptide or to the UreC polypeptide, which both mapped to a DNA sequence shown to be required to confer urease activity to a C. jejuni recipient strain.
TI  - Freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  - Freeze-substitution was performed on strains of Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Campylobacter fetus, Vibrio cholerae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas putida, Aeromonas salmonicida, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, Caulobacter crescentus, and Leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. A thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width was displayed in E. coli K-12, K30, and His 1 (a K-12 derivative containing the K30 capsule genes), P. multocida, C. fetus, P. putida, A. salmonicida, H. pleuropneumoniae, and P. mirabilis. The other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. Capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular to the cell surface, was observed on E. coli K30 and His 1 and P. mirabilis cells. A more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of H. pleuropneumoniae. For the first time a capsule, distinct from the sheath, was observed on L. discophora. In all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. Other distinct envelope structures were observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of L. discophora and the S layers of A. salmonicida A450 and C. crescentus CB15A. We believe that the freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.
TI  - In-vitro activity of meropenem against clinical isolates obtained in Canada.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was compared with that of imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, gentamicin and, where appropriate, other antibiotics against recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. MICs were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Meropenem inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii at less than or equal to 0.25 mg/l and was four- to 16-fold more active than imipenem against these species. Against the enteric pathogens Salmonella typhi, Shigella sonnei, Yersinia enterocolitica and Campylobacter jejuni, meropenem was four- to eight-fold more active than imipenem, inhibiting all isolates at less than or equal to 0.03 mg/l. Meropenem was also more active than imipenem against Haemophilus influenzae (MIC90 0.06 mg/l) but had similar activity against the Bacteroides fragilis group (MIC90 0.25 mg/l), against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90 2 mg/l) and against streptococci. Imipenem was four-fold more active than meropenem against Acinetobacter spp. and two- to eight-fold more active against all species of staphylococci tested. Both meropenem and imipenem were inactive against Ps. (Xanthomonas) maltophilia.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. A study mainly focused on ofloxacin (the second report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (OFLX) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures throughout Japan between April, 1986 and March, 1987. The results were totalized with an emphasis mainly on OFLX and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. In this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. Similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to OFLX included Staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), Entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), Streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), Escherichia coli (4,097 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), Enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), Enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), Citrobacter freundii (406 strains), Proteus mirabilis (613 strains), Morganella morganii (320 strains), Serratia marcescens (869 strains), Haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), Acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and Campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). Neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to OFLX was investigated with this species. As results, OFLX showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. aerogenes, C. freundii, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp., and C. jejuni. However, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. The following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: Streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), Streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), Enterococcus faecium (146 strains), Branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), Citrobacter diversus (128 strains), Klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), Proteus vulgaris (438 strains), Serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), Pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), Pseudomonas putida (154 strains), Xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), Bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin in vitro compared with that of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin.
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of dactimicin, a pseudo-disaccharide aminoglycoside antibiotic, was compared with those of dibekacin, netilmicin, sisomicin and micronomicin using clinical isolates of four Gram-positive and sixteen Gram-negative bacteria. Dactimicin was more active than the reference amino-glycosides against Serratia marcescens, especially gentamicin-resistant Serratia sp., Proteus vulgaris, P. rettgeri and Klebsiella oxytoca, but less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. mirabilis. Dactimicin was equally active as the references excepting netilmicin against Gram-positive bacteria and some Gram-negative bacteria including Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogens, E. cloacae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Campylobacter jejunii. Dactimicin was active against resistant strains possessing various aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes including AAC(3)-1, by which dactimicin was acetylated.
TI  - In vitro activities of PD 117,596 and reference antibiotics against 448 clinical  bacterial strains.
AB  - The in vitro activity of PD 117,596, a new fluoroquinolone antibiotic, was tested against 448 bacterial isolates (15 genera) by agar dilution (inoculum, 10(4) CFU per spot). The activity of PD 117,596 was compared with that of 15 antibiotics against 327 gram-negative strains and with that of 8 other antibiotics against 121 gram-positive strains. PD 117,596 demonstrated the best activity against Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter spp., Serratia marcescens, and Branhamella catarrhalis (MICs for 90% of the isolates [MIC90S], 0.008 to 0.25 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 (MIC90, 0.25 microgram/ml) was at least twofold more active than ciprofloxacin against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas spp. PD 117,596 and ciprofloxacin were similar in activity against Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Legionella pneumophila, and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 0.002 to 0.125 microgram/ml). PD 117,596 was more active than ciprofloxacin against streptococcal groups A, B, C, and G, S. pneumoniae, and enterococci (MIC90S, 0.06 to 0.125 microgram/ml). Against Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant isolates, PD 117,596 (MIC90S, 0.03 to 0.06 microgram/ml) was 4- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and was most active against Corynebacterium spp. PD 117,596 appears to be the most active fluoroquinolone to date, with excellent activity against gram-positive bacteria and enhanced activity against gram-negative aerobic-facultative bacteria.
TI  - [Susceptibilities of clinical isolates to antibacterial agents. Focusing mainly on ofloxacin (first report). Reported by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility of Clinical Isolates].
AB  - Susceptibility tests were carried out on a variety of clinically isolated pathogens using the susceptibility disc method at 197 hospitals in Japan between May, 1985 through March, 1986. These tests were organized by the Research Group for Testing Ofloxacin Susceptibility on Clinical Isolates, and the results were statistically analyzed. This paper describes a comparison of susceptibilities of clinical isolates including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia marcescens, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and Campylobacter jejuni to ofloxacin (OFLX) and conventional antibacterial drugs. The results obtained were summarized as follows. 1. OFLX showed strong antibacterial activity against S. aureus, S. epidermidis, N. gonorrhoeae, E. coli, E. aerogenes, E. cloacae, C. freundii, K. pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, M. morganii, H. influenzae, A. calcoaceticus, Acinetobacter sp. and C. jejuni and only a few strains were resistant to OFLX. Moreover, OFLX has superior antibacterial activity against many species compared not only to norfloxacin but also to most of the conventional antibacterial drugs. 2. When studied by sampled materials such as sputum, urine, abscesses and otorrhea, OFLX occasionally showed different actions against the same species from different sources. Almost species from the urinary isolates were less sensitive than those from the sputum.
TI  - In vitro study of the antibacterial activity of ofloxacin against recent clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of ofloxacin, a new broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent, was studied by a standardized single disc method. A total of 990 clinical isolates were tested, including 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria. Ofloxacin was highly active against 683 strains (70.41%), had intermediate activity against 109 (11.23%) and had no activity against 178 (18.35%). Ofloxacin was highly active against E. coli, Klebsiella sp., Citrobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Proteus morganii, Salmonella sp., Campylobacter jejuni, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Eubacterium sp., Propionibacterium acnes and Streptococcus sp. Pseudomonas sp., Serratia sp. and Proteus vulgaris had percentages of resistance to ofloxacin of 37.11%, 32% and 33.33% respectively. High percentages of resistance to ofloxacin were found only for Providencia sp., Proteus rettgeri and Bacteroides fragilis. With regard to Streptococcus faecalis, the results obtained with the disc procedure were not reliable and MIC determination was necessary to assess the behaviour of the drug.
TI  - In-vitro activity of pefloxacin compared to enoxacin, norfloxacin, gentamicin and new beta-lactams.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of pefloxacin was compared with that of norfloxacin, enoxacin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 363 recent clinical isolates. An agar dilution procedure was used to determine MICs and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, indole-positive Proteus spp., Enterobacter spp., Shigella sonnei, Salmonella typhi, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus and Haemophilus influenzae at less than or equal to 0.5 mg/l. Serratia marcescens and Providencia stuartii were somewhat more resistant, 2 mg/l of pefloxacin being required to inhibit 90% of isolates of these species. Pefloxacin inhibited 90% of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 4 mg/l and 90% of isolates of the Bacteroides fragilis group at 16 mg/l. The activity of enoxacin was similar to that of pefloxacin, with enoxacin being four-fold less active against Staph. aureus, two-fold less active against the Bacteroides fragilis group and most species of the Enterobacteriaceae, and two-fold more active against Ps. aeruginosa. Pefloxacin showed good activity against gentamicin-resistant Ps. aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae and against methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus. Strains with decreased susceptibility to norfloxacin tended to be less susceptible to both pefloxacin and enoxacin.
TI  - In vitro activity of norfloxacin, a quinolinecarboxylic acid, compared with that  of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and trimethoprim.
AB  - Norfloxacin is a quinolinecarboxylic acid compound. We examined the in vitro activity of this compound against gram-positive and -negative species, including anaerobic species. It inhibited 90% (MIC90) of strains of Escherichia coli at 0.05 microgram/ml, Klebsiella sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Salmonella and Shigella spp. at 0.1 microgram/ml, Citrobacter sp. at 0.4 microgram/ml, Enterobacter cloacae at 0.2 microgram/ml, Enterobacter aerogenes at 0.4 microgram/ml, and Enterobacter agglomerans at 0.2 microgram/ml. The MICs of Proteus mirabilis, Morganella sp., Proteus vulgaris, Proteus rettgeri, and Providencia sp. were 0.1, 0.2, 0.8, 0.3, and 1.6 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 of Serratia sp. was 1.6 micrograms/ml, and that of Acinetobacter sp. was 6.3 micrograms/ml. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa the MIC50, the MIC75, and the MIC90 were 0.8, 1.6, and 3.1 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC50 of Pseudomonas maltophilia was 3.1 micrograms/ml, and the MIC90 was 12.5 micrograms/ml. Yersinia, Arizona, and Aeromonas all were inhibited at concentrations below 1 microgram/ml, as was Campylobacter. The activity of the compound against gram-positive species was less impressive: the MIC90s of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus faecalis were 1.6, 6.3, 3.1, and 12.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. All Listeria strains were inhibited by 3.1 micrograms/ml. The activity of norfloxacine was not affected by the type of medium, pH, or inoculum size. There was no major difference between MIC and minimum bactericidal concentration values. Norfloxacin inhibited bacteria in every species which was resistant to ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalexin, gentamicin, and trimethoprim at concentrations lower than those of aminothiazolyl cephalosporins, moxalactam, and aminoglycosides.
TI  - In-vitro effect of edta-tris-lysozyme solutions on selected pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The in-vitro effect of EDTA-Tris-lysozyme solution on 16 pathogenic bacteria of medical or veterinary importance was determined. Marked decreases in bacterial count occurred with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Moraxella osloensis and Campylobacter fetus, and smaller decreses with Salmonella typhimurium, Shigella boydii, Aeromonas hydrophila, proteus mirabilis, Listeria monocytogenes and Erysipelothrix insidiosa. The test solution had no effect on Klebsiella ozaenae, Brucella canis, Cornynebacterium pyogenes, Coryne, renale, Streptococcus equi and staphylococcus aureus.
