lactobacillus acidophilus la 1 binds to cultured human intestinal cell lines and  inhibits cell attachment and cell invasion by enterovirulent bacteria.
four human lactobacillus acidophilus strains were tested for their ability to adhere onto human enterocyte like caco-2 cells in culture.
the la 1 strain exhibited a high calcium independent adhesive property.
this adhesion onto caco-2 cells required a proteinaceous adhesion promoting factor, which was present in the spent bacterial broth culture supernatant.
la 1 strain also strongly bound to the mucus secreted by the homogeneous cultured human goblet cell line ht29-mtx.
the inhibitory effect of la 1 organisms against caco-2 cell adhesion and cell invasion by a large variety of diarrhoeagenic bacteria was investigated. as a result, the following dose dependent inhibitions were obtained: (a) against the cell association of enterotoxigenic, diffusely adhering and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium; (b) against the cell invasion by enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and salmonella typhimurium.
incubations of l acidophilus la 1 before and together with enterovirulent e coli were more effective than incubation after infection by e coli.
