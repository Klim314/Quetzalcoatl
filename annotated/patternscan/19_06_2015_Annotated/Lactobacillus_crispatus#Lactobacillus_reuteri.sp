TI  == identification of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among reproductive age women in mysore, india.
AB  == a healthy vaginal environment is predominated by certain lactobacillus species, which lead to the prevention of infections of the reproductive tract. this study  examined the characteristics of cultivable lactobacillus species between healthy  women and women with bacterial vaginosis (bv). between november 2011 and sept 2013, 139 women attending a women's clinic in mysore, india were diagnosed for bv in a cross-sectional study. bv was diagnosed using amsel's criteria: homogeneous  vaginal discharge, vaginal ph > 4.5, production of amines, and presence of 'clue' cells. those with three or more of the characteristics were considered to have bv. vaginal swabs were then cultured in rogosa agar, de man-rogosa-sharpe broth.  gram-positive lactobacilli generating 600- 800bp amplicon by16 srna were further  characterized by sequencing. cultivable vaginal samples were obtained from 132 (94.9%) women. according to amsel criteria, 83(62.1%) women were healthy and 49(37.1%) women had bv. eleven different lactobacillus species were isolated from 47 women. the common lactobacilli species found in this sample included l. crispatus (39.6%), l. gasseri (45.8%), and l. jensenii (14.6%). lactobacilli were isolated from 39 healthy and 8 women with bv. l. gasseri was cultured from 18.8%  of healthy and 6.1% of women with bv. the presence of l. reuteri was significantly associated with normal vaginal microbiota (p-value = 0.026). these  results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population. our findings showed lactobacilli species  present in healthy vagina of women in india do not differ from those reported from other countries.

TI  == lactobacillus gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, for growth in milk.
AB  == lactobacillus gasseri is a widespread commensal lactic acid bacterium inhabiting  human mucosal niches and has many beneficial effects as a probiotic. however, l.  gasseri is difficult to grow in milk, which hurts usability for the food industry. it had been previously reported that supplementation with yeast extract or proteose peptone, including peptides, enables l. gasseri to grow well in milk. in this study, our objective was to confirm peptide requirement of l. gasseri and evaluate efficacy of peptide release by enzymatic proteolysis on growth of l. gassei in milk. three strains of l. gasseri did not grow well in modified deman,  rogosa, sharpe broth without any nitrogen sources (mrs-n), but addition of a casein-derived peptide mixture, tryptone, promoted growth. in contrast, little effect was observed after adding casein or a casein-derived amino acid mixture, casamino acids. these results indicate that l. gasseri requires peptides, not proteins or free amino acids, among milk-derived nitrogen sources for growth. lactobacillus gasseri jcm 1131t hardly had growth capacity in 6 kinds of milk-based media: bovine milk, human milk, skim milk, cheese whey, modified mrs-n (mrsl-n) supplemented with acid whey, and mrsl-n supplemented with casein. moreover, treatment with digestive proteases, particularly pepsin, to release peptides made it grow well in each milk-based medium. the pepsin treatment was the most effective for growth of strain jcm 1131t in skim milk among the tested food-grade proteases such as trypsin, alpha-chymotrypsin, calf rennet, ficin, bromelain, and papain. as well as strain jcm 1131t, pepsinolysis of milk improved growth of other l. gasseri strains and some strains of enteric lactobacilli such  as lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus reuteri. these results suggest that some relatives of l. gasseri also use peptides as desirable nitrogen sources, and that milk may be a good supplier of nutritious peptides to enteric lactobacilli including l. gasseri after peptic digestion in the gastrointestinal tract. this is the first report showing peptide requirement of l. gasseri and efficacy of pepsinolysis on the growth of l. gasseri and its relatives in milk. this study would contribute to increasing usability of l. gasseri and its relatives as probiotics in dairy foods.

TI  == characterization of the most abundant lactobacillus species in chicken gastrointestinal tract and potential use as probiotics for genetic engineering.
AB  == the count and diffusion of lactobacilli species in the different gastrointestinal tract (gi) regions of broilers were investigated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and the probiotic characteristics of six l. reuteri species isolated from broilers' gi tract were also investigated to obtain the potential target for genetic engineering. lactobacilli had the highest diversity  in the crop and the lowest one in the cecum. compared with the lower gi tract, more lactobacilli were found in the upper gi tract. lactobacillus reuteri, l. johnsonii, l. acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. salivarius, and l. aviarius were the  predominant lactobacillus species and present throughout the gi tract of chickens. lactobacillus reuteri was the most abundant lactobacillus species. lactobacillus reuteri xc1 had good probiotic characteristics that would be a potential and desirable target for genetic engineering.

TI  == characterization of culturable vaginal lactobacillus species among women with and without bacterial vaginosis from the united states and india: a cross-sectional study.
AB  == lactobacillus species play an integral part in the health of the vaginal microbiota. we compared vaginal lactobacillus species in women from india and the usa with and without bacterial vaginosis (bv). between july 2009 and november 2010, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 40 women attending a women's health clinic in mysore, india, and a sexually transmitted diseases clinic in san francisco, usa. women were diagnosed with bv using amsel's criteria and the nugent score. lactobacillus 16s rdna was sequenced to speciate the cultured isolates. ten indian and 10 us women without bv were compared with an equal number of women with bv. lactobacilli were isolated from all healthy women, but from only 10% of indian and 50% of us women with bv. 16s rdna from 164 lactobacillus colonies was sequenced from healthy women (126 colonies) and women  with bv (38 colonies). seven cultivable lactobacillus species were isolated from  11 indian women and nine species from 15 us women. the majority of lactobacillus  species among indian women were l. crispatus (25.0%), l. jensenii (25.0%) and l.  reuteri (16.7%). among us women, l. crispatus (32.0%), l. jensenii (20.0%) and l. coleohominis (12.0%) predominated. l. jensenii and l. crispatus dominated the vaginal flora of healthy indian and us women. indian women appeared to have a higher percentage of obligate heterofermentative species, suggesting the need for a larger degree of metabolic flexibility and a more challenging vaginal environment.

TI  == animal rennets as sources of dairy lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == the microbial composition of artisan and industrial animal rennet pastes was studied by using both culture-dependent and -independent approaches. pyrosequencing targeting the 16s rrna gene allowed to identify 361 operational taxonomic units (otus) to the genus/species level. among lactic acid bacteria (lab), streptococcus thermophilus and some lactobacilli, mainly lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus reuteri, were the most abundant species, with differences among the samples. twelve groups of microorganisms were targeted by viable plate counts revealing a dominance of mesophilic cocci. all rennets were able to acidify ultrahigh-temperature-processed (uht) milk as shown by ph and total titratable acidity (tta). presumptive lab isolated at the highest dilutions of acidified milks were phenotypically characterized, grouped, differentiated at  the strain level by randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr analysis, and subjected to 16s rrna gene sequencing. only 18 strains were clearly identified at the species level, as enterococcus casseliflavus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus lactis, lactobacillus delbrueckii, and streptococcus thermophilus, while the other strains, all belonging to the genus enterococcus, could not be allotted into any previously described species. the phylogenetic analysis showed that these strains might represent different unknown species. all strains were evaluated for their dairy technological performances. all isolates produced diacetyl, and 10 of them produced a rapid ph drop in milk,  but only 3 isolates were also autolytic. this work showed that animal rennet pastes can be sources of lab, mainly enterococci, that might contribute to the microbial diversity associated with dairy productions.

TI  == lactobacillus decelerates cervical epithelial cell cycle progression.
AB  == we investigated cell cycle progression in epithelial cervical me-180 cells during colonization of three different lactobacillus species utilizing live cell microscopy, bromodeoxyuridine incorporation assays, and flow cytometry. the colonization of these me-180 cells by l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri, originating from human gastric epithelia and saliva, respectively, was shown to reduce cell cycle progression and to cause host cells to accumulate in the g1 phase of the cell cycle. the g1 phase accumulation in l. rhamnosus-colonized cells was accompanied by the up-regulation and nuclear accumulation of p21. by contrast, the vaginal isolate l. crispatus did not affect cell cycle progression. furthermore, both the supernatants from the lactic acid-producing l. rhamnosus colonies and lactic acid added to cell culture media were able to reduce the proliferation of me-180 cells. in this study, we reveal the diversity of the lactobacillus species to affect host cell cycle progression and demonstrate that  l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exert anti-proliferative effects on human cervical carcinoma cells.

TI  == lactobacillus species isolated from vaginal secretions of healthy and bacterial vaginosis-intermediate mexican women: a prospective study.
AB  == background: lactobacillus jensenii, l. iners, l. crispatus and l. gasseri are the most frequently occurring lactobacilli in the vagina. however, the native species vary widely according to the studied population. the present study was performed  to genetically determine the identity of lactobacillus strains present in the vaginal discharge of healthy and bacterial vaginosis (bv) intermediate mexican women. methods: in a prospective study, 31 strains preliminarily identified as lactobacillus species were isolated from 21 samples collected from 105 non-pregnant mexican women. the samples were classified into groups according to  the nugent score criteria proposed for detection of bv: normal (n), intermediate  (i) and bacterial vaginosis (bv). we examined the isolates using culture-based methods as well as molecular analysis of the v1-v3 regions of the 16s rrna gene.  enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus (eric) sequence analysis was performed to reject clones. results: clinical isolates (25/31) were classified into four groups based on sequencing and analysis of the 16s rrna gene: l. acidophilus (14/25), l. reuteri (6/25), l. casei (4/25) and l. buchneri (1/25). the remaining six isolates were presumptively identified as enterococcus species. within the l. acidophilus group, l. gasseri was the most frequently isolated species, followed by l. jensenii and l. crispatus. l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus and l. brevis were also isolated, and were placed in the l. reuteri, l. casei and l.  buchneri groups, respectively. eric profile analysis showed intraspecific variability amongst the l. gasseri and l. fermentum species. conclusions: these findings agree with previous studies showing that l. crispatus, l. gasseri and l. jensenii are consistently present in the healthy vaginal ecosystem. additional species or phylotypes were detected in the vaginal microbiota of the non-pregnant mexican (hispanic-mestizo) population, and thus, these results further our understanding of vaginal lactobacilli colonisation and richness in this particular population.

TI  == faecal d/l lactate ratio is a metabolic signature of microbiota imbalance in patients with short bowel syndrome.
AB  == our objective was to understand the functional link between the composition of faecal microbiota and the clinical characteristics of adults with short bowel syndrome (sbs). sixteen patients suffering from type ii sbs were included in the  study. they displayed a total oral intake of 2661+/-1005 kcal/day with superior sugar absorption (83+/-12%) than protein (42+/-13%) or fat (39+/-26%). these patients displayed a marked dysbiosis in faecal microbiota, with a predominance of lactobacillus/leuconostoc group, while clostridium and bacteroides were under-represented. each patient exhibited a diverse lactic acid bacteria composition (l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, l. crispatus, l. gasseri, l. johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. mucosae), displaying specific d and l-lactate production profiles in vitro. of 16 patients, 9/16 (56%) accumulated lactates in  their faecal samples, from 2 to 110 mm of d-lactate and from 2 to 80 mm of l-lactate. the presence of lactates in faeces (56% patients) was used to define the lactate-accumulator group (la), while absence of faecal lactates (44% patients) defines the non lactate-accumulator group (nla). the la group had a lower plasma hco3(-) concentration (17.1+/-2.8 mm) than the nla group (22.8+/-4.6 mm), indicating that la and nla groups are clinically relevant sub-types. two patients, belonging to the la group and who particularly accumulated faecal d-lactate, were at risk of d-encephalopathic reactions. furthermore, all patients of the nla group and those accumulating preferentially l isoform in the la group  had never developed d-acidosis. the d/l faecal lactate ratio seems to be the most relevant index for a higher d-encephalopathy risk, rather than d- and l-lactate faecal concentrations per se. testing criteria that take into account hco3(-) value, total faecal lactate and the faecal d/l lactate ratio may become useful tools for identifying sbs patients at risk for d-encephalopathy.

TI  == dietary inclusion of feathers affects intestinal microbiota and microbial metabolites in growing leghorn-type chickens.
AB  == feather pecking in laying hens is a serious behavioral problem that is often associated with feather eating. the intake of feathers may influence the gut microbiota and its metabolism. the aim of this study was to determine the effect  of 2 different diets, with or without 5% ground feathers, on the gut microbiota and the resulting microbial fermentation products and to identify keratin-degrading bacteria in chicken digesta. one-day-old lohmann-selected leghorn chicks were divided into 3 feeding groups: group a (control), b (5% ground feathers in the diet), and c, in which the control diet was fed until wk 12 and then switched to the 5% feather diet to study the effect of time of first  feather ingestion. the gut microbiota was analyzed by cultivation and denaturing  gradient gel electrophoresis of ileum and cecum digesta. short-chain fatty acids, ammonia, and lactate concentrations were measured as microbial metabolites. the concentration of keratinolytic bacteria increased after feather ingestion in the  ileum (p < 0.001) and cecum (p = 0.033). bacterial species that hydrolyzed keratin were identified as enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus reuteri-like species (97% sequence homology), and lactobacillus salivarius-like species (97% sequence homology). molecular analysis of cecal dna  extracts showed that the feather diet lowered the bacterial diversity indicated by a reduced richness (p < 0.001) and shannon (p = 0.012) index. the pattern of microbial metabolites indicated some changes, especially in the cecum. this study showed that feather intake induced an adaptation of the intestinal microbiota in  chickens. it remains unclear to what extent the changed metabolism of the microbiota reflects the feather intake and could have an effect on the behavior of the hens.

TI  == in vitro screening of lactobacilli isolated from chicken excreta to control salmonella enteritidis and typhimurium.
AB  == 1. the aim of this work was to select lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains from chicks and hens of egg-laying strains for potential use to control salmonellae. 2. nineteen lab strains obtained from culture collections, and 24 strains isolated from excreta of laying hens and chicks, were evaluated for inhibitory capacities against two salmonella serotypes using a "spot-the-lawn" technique and other in vitro properties that could be predictive of antimicrobial activity. 3.  the size of the inhibition zone differed slightly between salmonella serotypes, however, the mean size of the salmonella inhibition zone differed greatly among the lab strains. lactobacillus salivarius, l. plantarum, l. rhamnosus and l. reuteri exhibited powerful inhibitory effects to each salmonella strain. 4. the result of the acid tolerance test showed that all l. salivarius, l. kitasatonis strains and each of l. ingluviei cannot survive in a low ph environment. in the bile acid tolerance assay, growth was inhibited in all strains, except l. kitasatonis he4, and a large inhibition was observed in most of the l. salivarius and l. crispatus strains. 5. the results demonstrate that some lab of poultry origin were able to inhibit the growth of salmonella and survive simulated passage through the gastrointestinal tract. the selected lab could act in the lower gastrointestinal tract to prevent salmonellosis in poultry.

TI  == adhesion forces and coaggregation between vaginal staphylococci and lactobacilli.
AB  == urogenital infections are the most common ailments afflicting women. they are treated with dated antimicrobials whose efficacy is diminishing. the process of infection involves pathogen adhesion and displacement of indigenous lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus jensenii. an alternative therapeutic approach to antimicrobial therapy is to reestablish lactobacilli in this microbiome through probiotic administration. we hypothesized that lactobacilli displaying strong adhesion forces with pathogens would facilitate coaggregation between the two strains, ultimately explaining the elimination of pathogens seen in vivo. using atomic force microscopy, we found that adhesion forces between lactobacilli and three virulent toxic shock syndrome toxin 1-producing staphylococcus aureus strains, were significantly stronger (2.2-6.4 nn) than between staphylococcal pairs (2.2-3.4 nn), especially for the probiotic lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 (4.0-6.4 nn) after 120 s of bond-strengthening. moreover, stronger adhesion forces resulted in significantly larger coaggregates. adhesion between the bacteria occurred instantly upon contact and matured within one to two minutes, demonstrating the potential for rapid anti-pathogen effects using a probiotic. coaggregation is one of the recognized mechanisms through which lactobacilli can  exert their probiotic effects to create a hostile micro-environment around a pathogen. with antimicrobial options fading, it therewith becomes increasingly important to identify lactobacilli that bind strongly with pathogens.

TI  == qualitative and semiquantitative analysis of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy fertile and postmenopausal chinese women.
AB  == the present study aimed to investigate the prevalence and quantity of lactobacillus species in the vaginas of healthy chinese women. vaginal samples from 92 fertile and 22 postmenopausal healthy chinese women were analysed using a 16s rrna gene clone library and species-specific pcr followed by sequencing and real-time pcr. a total of 13 different lactobacillus species were detected. species-specific pcr showed that 3% of the fertile women were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 97% were colonized by two or more species. among the postmenopausal women, 91% were colonized by one species of lactobacillus and 9% were colonized by two species. in the fertile women, l. iners (82.61%), l. crispatus (70.65%) and l. gasseri (67.39%) were more prevalent than l. jensenii (40.22%), l. acidophilus (39.13%), l. brevis (23.91%), l. plantarum (5.43%), l. johnsonii (3.26%), l. fermentum (2.17%), l. salivarius (2.17%), l. rhamnosus (1.09%), l. reuteri (1.09%) and l. paracasei (1.09%); l. delbrueckii was not detected. in the postmenopausal women, l. fermentum, l. rhamnosus, l. reuteri and l. delbrueckii were not detected, and the other 10 species were detected in just  a few samples. the prevalence of these species according to the clone library differed from the prevalence indicated by the species-specific pcr. according to  the semiquantitative analysis, the total lactobacillus dna concentrations were higher in fertile women than in postmenopausal women. sixty-one per cent of the fertile women were predominantly colonized by l. iners, 35% by l. crispatus, and  2% by l. gasseri. associations between pairs of lactobacillus species in fertile  women were significant (p<0.05) between the following pairs: l. iners and l. gasseri, l. iners and l. jensenii, l. iners and l. acidophilus, l. gasseri and l. acidophilus, and l. gasseri and l. jensenii. in conclusion, this study provided detailed information on lactobacillus species colonizing the vaginas of healthy chinese fertile and postmenopausal women. the study also showed that the diversity of lactobacillus species in fertile women was higher than in postmenopausal women. according to our study, different techniques, such as species-specific pcr and comparison against a 16s rrna gene clone library, resulted in different findings regarding species prevalence. these findings highlight the importance of standardization of techniques used for evaluation of  bacterial communities. according to our findings regarding species associations,  l. iners and l. gasseri may have influences on colonization and proliferation of  other vaginal lactobacillus species.

TI  == lactobacillus species shift in distal esophagus of high-fat-diet-fed rats.
AB  == aim: to analyze the microbiota shift in the distal esophagus of sprague-dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. methods: twenty sprague-dawley rats were divided into high-fat diet and normal control groups of 10 rats each. the composition of microbiota in the mucosa from the distal esophagus was analyzed based on selective culture. a variety of lactobacillus species were identified by molecular biological techniques. bacterial dna from lactobacillus colonies was extracted, and 16s rdna was amplified by pcr using bacterial universal primers. the amplified 16s rdna products were separated by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge). every single band was purified from the gel and sent to be sequenced. results: based on mucosal bacterial culturing in the distal esophagus, staphylococcus aureus was absent, and total anaerobes and lactobacillus species were decreased significantly in the high-fat diet group compared with the normal control group (p < 0.01). detailed dgge analysis on the  composition of lactobacillus species in the distal esophagus revealed that lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri (l. gasseri) and lactobacillus reuteri (l. reuteri) comprised the lactobacillus species in the high-fat diet group, while the composition of lactobacillus species in the normal control group consisted of l. gasseri, lactobacillus jensenii and l. reuteri. conclusion: high-fat diet led to a mucosal microflora shift in the distal esophagus in rats,  especially the composition of lactobacillus species.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial feed additives on broiler commensal posthatch gut microbiota development and performance.
AB  == the effects of avilamycin, zinc bacitracin, and flavophospholipol on broiler gut  microbial community colonization and bird performance in the first 17 days posthatch were investigated. significant differences in gut microbiota associated with gut section, dietary treatment, and age were identified by terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp), although no performance-related differences between dietary treatments were detected. similar age-related shifts in the gut microbiota were identified regardless of diet but varied between the ilea and ceca. interbird variabilities in ileal bacterial communities were reduced (3 to 7 days posthatch) in chicks fed with feed containing antimicrobial agents. avilamycin and flavophospholipol had the most consistent effect on gut microbial communities. operational taxonomic units (otu) linked to changes in gut microbiota in birds on antimicrobial-supplemented diets  were characterized and identified. some otus could be identified to the species level; however, the majority could be only tentatively classified to the genus, family, order, or domain level. otus 140 to 146 (lachnospiraceae), otu 186/188 (lactobacillus johnsonii), otu 220 (lachnospiraceae), otus 284 to 288 (unclassified bacterial spp. or ruminococcaceae), otu 296/298 (unclassified bacterium or clostridiales), and otu 480/482 (oxalobacteraceae) were less prevalent in the guts of chicks fed antimicrobial-supplemented diets. otu 178/180 (lactobacillus crispatus), otu 152 (lactobacillus reuteri or unclassified clostridiales), otu 198/200 (subdoligranulum spp.), and otu 490/492 (unclassified bacterium or enterobacteriaceae) were less prevalent in the gut of chicks raised  on the antimicrobial-free diet. the identification of key bacterial species influenced by antimicrobial-supplemented feed immediately posthatch may assist in the formulation of diets that facilitate beneficial gut microbial colonization and, hence, the development of alternatives to current antimicrobial agents in feed for sustainable poultry production.

TI  == comparison and utilization of repetitive-element pcr techniques for typing lactobacillus isolates from the chicken gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == three repetitive-element pcr techniques were evaluated for the ability to type strains of lactobacillus species commonly identified in the chicken gastrointestinal tract. enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus pcr (eric-pcr) produced species- and strain-specific profiles for lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gallinarum, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus reuteri isolates. the technique typed strains within these species equally as well as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. dna concentration and quality did not affect the eric-pcr profiles, indicating that this method, unlike other high-resolution methods, can be adapted to high-throughput analysis of isolates.  subsequently, eric-pcr was used to type lactobacillus species diversity of a large collection of isolates derived from chickens grown under commercial and necrotic enteritis disease induction conditions. this study has illustrated, for  the first time, that there is great strain diversity within each lactobacillus species present and has revealed that chickens raised under commercial conditions harbor greater species and strain diversity than chickens raised under necrotic enteritis disease induction conditions.

TI  == adherence of clinically isolated lactobacilli to human cervical cells in competition with neisseria gonorrhoeae.
AB  == lactobacilli are normal inhabitants of our microbiota and are known to protect against pathogens. neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human specific pathogenic bacterium that colonises the urogenital tract where it causes gonorrhoea. in this study we  analysed early interactions between lactobacilli and gonococci and investigated how they compete for adherence to human epithelial cervical cells. we show that lactobacilli adhere at various levels and that the number of adherent bacteria does not correlate to the level of protection against gonococcal infection. protection against gonococcal adhesion varied between lactobacillus species. lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus gasseri and lactobacillus reuteri were capable of reducing gonococcal adherence while lactobacillus rhamnosus was not. lactobacillus strains of vaginal origin had the best capacity to remain attached  to the host cell during gonococcal adherence. further, we show that gonococci and lactobacilli interact with each other with resultant lactobacilli incorporation into the gonococcal microcolony. hence, gonococci bind to colonised lactobacilli  and this complex frequently detaches from the epithelial cell surface, resulting  in reduced bacterial colonisation. also, purified gonococcal pili are capable of  removing adherent lactobacilli from the cell surface. taken together, we reveal novel data regarding gonococcal and lactobacilli competition for adherence that will benefit future gonococcal prevention and treatments.

TI  == changes in the predominant human lactobacillus flora during in vitro fertilisation.
AB  == background: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions 16s rrna genes using pyrosequencing technology is a powerful tool for typing vaginal lactobacilli to the species level and has been used for investigating the vaginal microbial niche. methods: this study has characterized the normal cultivable vaginal lactobacillus flora at varying estradiol levels in plasma; the study comprised 17 patients undergoing ovarian stimulation for in vitro fertilization (ivf) treatment. the vaginal status of each participant was initially assessed as normal according to amsel and nugent criteria. results: l.  crispatus, l. gasseri and/or l. jensenii were present in 10 of the patients throughout the study period, and little variation among these three species was encountered in individual patients. the flora of three women was dominated by l.  delbrueckii, l. rhamnosus or l. vaginalis. one woman exhibited a dominance of l.  iners. the flora of the remaining three women were initially dominated by l. rhamnosus or l. reuteri, but as their estrogen levels rose, their flora composition altered, to become dominated by one of the three species most common  in a normal, healthy vagina. conclusion: signature matching of nucleotide sequences in the v1 and v3 regions of 16s rrna genes is a discriminative tool for the study of vaginal lactobacilli and can be used to track the lactobacillus flora under a variety of physiological conditions.

TI  == lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
AB  == twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.

AB  == bacteria from crops of 1- and 5-week-old broiler chickens fed with two brands (diets a and b) of wheat-based diets were isolated on lactobacillus-selective medium and identified (n = 300) based on partial 16s rrna gene sequence. the most abundant lactobacillus species were l. reuteri (33%), l. crispatus (18.7%), and l. salivarius (13.3%). regardless of farm and feed, l. reuteri was the most abundant species (p < 0.005) in the crops of the younger chickens. however, the amount of l. reuteri was significantly reduced in the crops of the 5-week-old chickens regardless of the feed (p = 0.016). the diversity of l. reuteri isolates was studied by fatty acid analysis, and the 94 l. reuteri isolates could be arranged into several clusters. the nisin sensitivities of the l. reuteri isolates were determined because nisin is a candidate coccidiostat. sensitive isolates were found more frequently in younger chickens (77%) than in 5-week-old  chickens (23%), whereas chickens fed with commercial feed b had a higher proportion of nisin-resistant isolates (73%) than did chickens fed with feed a (45%). nisin-resistant strains are potential candidates for adjunct cultures for  maintaining l. reuteri in its natural niche in the crop and are potential targets for genetic engineering with nisin-selectable food-grade vectors. the diversity of the l. reuteri population suggested that one should consider including several strains representing different clusters and nisin resistance phenotypes in candidate probiotic feed supplements for chickens.

TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == species diversity and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria from women in uganda and korea.
AB  == aims: lactobacilli play an important role in maintaining vaginal health of women. the aim of this study was to compare the species richness and relative abundance  of lactobacillus and other lactic acid bacteria in women of two geographically distant countries, uganda and korea. methods and results: vaginal samples were obtained from two women populations in uganda and korea. the lactobacillus rogosa sl agar was used for initial isolation of lactic acid bacteria. after phenotypic  analyses, the 16s rrna gene was amplified by polymerase-chain reaction and analysed by the blast program and phylogenetic tree construction. a total of 338  (128 korean and 210 ugandan) vaginal lactic acid bacterial strains were isolated, including five genera: lactobacillus, leuconostoc, pediococcus, streptococcus and weissella. while lactobacillus crispatus was common in both populations, lactobacillus fermentum was common only in korean women, and lactobacillus gasseri, lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus vaginalis only in ugandan women. among other lactic acid bacteria, weissella was more common in ugandan, and pediococcus in korean women. all weissella strains produced hydrogen peroxide, and all pediococcus strains inhibited candida species. conclusion: although many  lactic acid bacteria colonize women, their species distributions may be different in women of geographically separated communities. significance and impact of the  study: the knowledge of species richness and relative abundance of vaginal lactic acid bacteria, including lactobacillus, pediococcus and weissella, may lead to the design of better probiotic products as bacterial replacement therapy.

TI  == effect of lactobacillus challenge on gardnerella vaginalis biofilms.
AB  == bacterial vaginosis (bv) is the most common infectious condition in women. it is  caused primarily by anaerobic bacteria which rapidly form biofilms recalcitrant to antibiotic treatment, elevate vaginal ph, induce inflammatory processes and displace indigenous lactobacilli from the vault. gardnerella vaginalis is commonly associated with these infections. microscopy analysis showed that within 72 h, viable g. vaginalis covered a surface area of 567 microm(2), reached a depth of 16 microm and a density of approximately 104 microm(3). they maintained  these levels for a further 3 days unless challenged with lactobacilli strains. lactobacillus reuteri rc-14 produced the biggest displacement of gardnerella. this was not due to ph, which remained between 4.7 and 5.1 for all experiments, nor by hydrogen peroxide which is produced in low amounts by strain l. reuteri rc-14, high amounts by l. crispatus 33820 and not at all by l. rhamnosus gr-1. deconvolution microscopy showed changes in structure and viability of the biofilms, with loss of dense gardnerella biofilm pods. for the first time, a strain of l. iners, the most commonly isolated vaginal lactobacillus in healthy women, was tested for potential probiotic properties. it was found to disrupt gardnerella biofilm surface area, density and depth, albeit to a lesser extent than l. reuteri rc-14. these studies help to provide insight into the clinical situation in which probiotic and indigenous vaginal lactobacilli can interfere with gardnerella's presence and reduce the risk of bacterial vaginosis.

TI  == cloacal lactobacillus isolates from broilers often display resistance toward tetracycline antibiotics.
AB  == lactobacillus crispatus, l. reuteri, l. amylovorus, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius strains isolated from cloacal swabs of broiler chickens derived from 20 different farms in belgium were tested for susceptibility to tetracycline and minocycline. acquired resistance percentages to these antibiotics were extremely high for l. crispatus, l. reuteri, l. gallinarum, and l. salivarius subsp. salivarius (75%-100%). l. amylovorus on the  contrary, displayed lower resistance percentages (25%) toward minocycline and tetracycline. in several strains, resistance against the tetracycline antibiotics was associated with the presence of the resistance genes tet(k), tet(l), tet(m),  tet(w), and tet(z). to our knowledge, this is the first report of tet(z) in lactobacilli and tet(k), tet(l), and tet(w) in lactobacilli identified to species level. our findings strengthen the evidence of intestinal lactobacillus species acting as a pool of antimicrobial resistance genes urging the need for prudent use of tetracycline antibiotics in poultry production.

TI  == [influence of a xylanase feed additive on lactobacillus species in the jejunum of piglets].
AB  == rrna extracts from the jejunum of rearing piglets fed a wheat/rye based diet with or without a xylanase feed additive were hybridized against eight lactobacillus spp. specific digoxigenin labelled oligonucleotide probes. known concentrations of sample- or culture rna extracts were used to calibrate and quantify hybridization signals from different sample extracts and hybridizations. the xylanase feed additive tended to increase total eubacterial rrna in the terminal  jejunum, probably a result of increased lactobacillus spp. rrna in the central and terminal jejunum. however, individual animal variations were high. l. reuteri was the major lactobacillus species followed by l. acidophilus and l. mucosae. l. amylophilus and l. crispatus were not detected in all rna extracts. the results of this study show that the xylanase feed additive modifies lactobacillus spp. populations on the species level in piglets in addition to their well known effects on digesta viscosity and nutrient digestibility. the implications of these effects for the intestinal microbiota require further analysis.

TI  == influence of intensive and extensive breeding on lactic acid bacteria isolated from gallus gallus domesticus ceca.
AB  == in the present study, lactic acid bacteria (lab) from the cecum of chickens bred  either under intensive (commercial broilers) or extensive (free-range) conditions were isolated, identified and some of their probiotic characteristics determined. the lab identified by 16s-23s rrna pcr-ardra were mainly of lactobacillus species and to a lesser extent of enterococcus spp. for all animals. free-range chickens  showed a higher presence of lactobacillus acidophilus while lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus johnsonii were more frequently recovered from commercial broilers. lactobacillus crispatus was found only in commercial broilers, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus agilis only in free-range chickens and  lactobacillus salivarius in both types. enterococcus isolates from ceca of commercial broilers showed a higher resistance to antimicrobial drugs. lactobacillus isolates from free-range chickens presented a higher frequency of in vitro antagonistic activity against selected pathogens than from commercial broilers. all lab isolates had predominantly non-hydrophobic surfaces, but with variations depending on age of the chickens and breeding conditions. animal breeding caused variation on composition, antimicrobial susceptibility, antagonistic activity and surface hydrophobicity of lab from chicken cecum. lab isolates from ceca of free-range chickens have potential as probiotic agents, which may be used in the future as replacing the use of antimicrobials as growth  promoters.

TI  == selection of potential probiotic lactobacilli from pig feces to be used as additives in pelleted feeding.
AB  == thirty-five isolates from pig feces were identified as lactobacillus reuteri (12  strains), lactobacillus mucosae (7), lactobacillus plantarum (6), lactobacillus kitasatonis (3), lactobacillus rossiae (2), lactobacillus ultunensis (2), lactobacillus crispatus (2), and lactobacillus intestinalis (1) by partial sequence analysis of the 16s rrna. all isolates were detected at 8-9 log cfu g(-1). preliminarily, strains were selected based on resistance to heat treatments (ca. 70 degrees c for 10 s). the decrease in viability for some l. reuteri, l. mucosae, l. plantarum, l. kitasatonis, and l. rossiae strains was lower than 1 log cycle. selected strains were further characterized for acid and  bile salt resistance, and antibacterial activity. except for l. kitasatonis, tolerance to simulated gastric and intestinal conditions was enhanced for all strains by addition of reconstituted skimmed milk. antibacterial activity was found against gram-positive and -negative potential pathogens. l. reuteri 8.1, 3s7, 6.2, and 1.2, l. mucosae 1.1r, l. plantarum 4.1, and l. rossiae 4.4 were freeze-dried and mixed (1%, w/w) into pig feed before pelleting. after pelleting, pig feed contained 10-9 log cfu kg(-1) of lactobacilli. l. plantarum 4.1, and l.  reuteri 3s7 were selected based on their bile salt resistance, ph tolerance, antimicrobial activity and heat resistance. the findings in this study provide a  strong basis for exploring the potential of porcine lactobacilli isolates to be used in pelleted feeding as probiotic additives.

TI  == probiotics for prevention of recurrent urinary tract infections in women: a review of the evidence from microbiological and clinical studies.
AB  == recurrent urinary tract infections (utis) afflict a great number of women around  the world. the use of probiotics, especially lactobacilli, has been considered for the prevention of utis. since lactobacilli dominate the urogenital flora of healthy premenopausal women, it has been suggested that restoration of the urogenital flora, which is dominated by uropathogens, with lactobacilli may protect against utis. this review is based on a search of pubmed for relevant articles. many in vitro studies, animal experiments, microbiological studies in healthy women, and clinical trials in women with utis have been carried out to assess the effectiveness and safety of probiotics for prophylaxis against uropathogens. most of them had encouraging findings for some specific strains of  lactobacilli. lactobacillus rhamnosus gr-1 and l. reuteri rc-14 (previously called l. fermentum rc-14) seemed to be the most effective among the studied lactobacilli for the prevention of utis. l. casei shirota and l. crispatus ctv-05 have also shown efficacy in some studies. l. rhamnosus gg did not appear to be quite as effective in the prevention of utis. the evidence from the available studies suggests that probiotics can be beneficial for preventing recurrent utis  in women; they also have a good safety profile. however, further research is needed to confirm these results before the widespread use of probiotics for this  indication can be recommended.

TI  == extracellular homopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides from intestinal lactobacilli.
AB  == aims: to characterize lactobacilli isolated from the intestines of ducks or pigs  with respect to the production of extracellular homopolysaccharides (hops) and oligosaccharides. methods and results: lactobacillus strains of duck or pig origin were screened for hops synthesis and >25% of the isolates produced fructans or glucans from sucrose. glucan-forming strains were found within the species lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus animalis and fructan-forming strains were found within lactobacillus mucosae, lactobacillus crispatus and lactobacillus acidophilus. the glucan-forming strains of l. reuteri but not l. animalis produced glucose-oligosaccharides in additon to the respective polymers, and two fructan-forming strains of l. acidophilus produced kestose. genes coding  for glycosyltransferases were detected by pcr and partially characterized by sequence analysis. conclusions: a large proportion of lactobacilli from intestinal habitats produce hops from sucrose and polysaccharide formation is generally associated with the formation of glucose- and fructose oligosaccharides. significance and impact of the study: the characterization of the metabolic potential of intestinal lactobacilli contributes to the understanding of the molecular basis of autochthony in intestinal habitats. moreover, this is the first report of glucose-oligosaccharide production during growth of lactobacilli, and one novel fructosyltransferase and one novel glucansucrase were partially characterized on the genetic level.

TI  == heat shock treatment increases the frequency of loss of an erythromycin resistance-encoding transposable element from the chromosome of lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692.
AB  == a 3,165-bp chromosomally integrated transposon, designatedtn3692, of the gram-positive strain lactobacillus crispatus chcc3692 contains an erm(b) gene conferring resistance to erythromycin at concentrations of up to 250 micrograms/ml. loss of this resistance can occur spontaneously, but the rate is substantially increased by heat shock treatment. heat shock treatment at 60 degrees c resulted in an almost 40-fold increase in the frequency of erythromycin-sensitive cells (erythromycin mic, 0.047 micrograms/ml). the phenotypic change was followed by a dramatic increase in transcription of the transposase gene and the concomitant loss of an approximately 2-kb dna fragment carrying the erm(b) gene from the 3,165-bp erm transposon. in cells that were not subjected to heat shock, transcription of the transposase gene was not detectable. the upstream sequence of the transposase gene did not show any homology to known heat shock promoters in the gene data bank. significant homology (>99%) was observed between the erythromycin resistance-encoding gene from l. crispatus chcc3692 and the erm(b) genes from other gram-positive bacteria, such as streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus  faecium, and lactobacillus reuteri, which strongly indicates a common origin of the erm(b) gene for these species. the transposed dna element was not translocated to other parts of the genome of chcc3692, as determining by southern blotting, pcr analysis, and dna sequencing. no other major aberrations were observed, as judged by colony morphology, growth performance of the strain, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. these observations suggest that heat shock treatment could be used as a tool for the removal of unwanted antibiotic resistance genes harbored in transposons flanked by insertion sequence elements or transposases in lactic acid bacteria used for animal and human food production.

TI  == detection and identification of lactobacillus species in crops of broilers of different ages by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis.
AB  == the microflora of the crop was investigated throughout the broiler production period (0 to 42 days) using pcr combined with denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (pcr-dgge) and selective bacteriological culture of lactobacilli  followed by amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra). the birds were  raised under conditions similar to those used in commercial broiler production. lactobacilli predominated and attained populations of 10(8) to 10(9) cfu per gram of crop contents. many of the lactobacilli present in the crop (61.9% of isolates) belonged to species of the lactobacillus acidophilus group and could not be differentiated by pcr-dgge. a rapid and simple ardra method was developed  to distinguish between the members of the l. acidophilus group. haeiii-ardra was  used for preliminary identification of isolates in the l. acidophilus group and to identify lactobacillus reuteri and lactobacillus salivarius. msei-ardra generated unique patterns for all species of the l. acidophilus group, identifying lactobacillus crispatus, lactobacillus johnsonii, and lactobacillus gallinarum among crop isolates. the results of our study provide comprehensive knowledge of the lactobacillus microflora in the crops of birds of different ages using nucleic acid-based methods of detection and identification based on current taxonomic criteria.

TI  == monitoring the bacterial population dynamics in sourdough fermentation processes  by using pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis.
AB  == four sourdoughs (a to d) were produced under practical conditions by using a starter mixture of three commercially available sourdough starters and a baker's  yeast constitutively containing various species of lactic acid bacteria (lab). the sourdoughs were continuously propagated until the composition of the lab flora remained stable. two lab-specific pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) systems were established and used to monitor the development of the microflora. depending on the prevailing ecological conditions  in the different sourdough fermentations, only a few lactobacillus species were found to be competitive and became dominant. in sourdough a (traditional process  with rye flour), lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and a new species, l. mindensis,  were detected. in rye flour sourdoughs b and c, which differed in the process temperature, exclusively l. crispatus and l. pontis became the predominant species in sourdough b and l. crispatus, l. panis, and l. frumenti became the predominant species in sourdough c. on the other hand, in sourdough d (corresponding to sourdough c but produced with rye bran), l. johnsonii and l. reuteri were found. the results of pcr-dgge were consistent with those obtained by culturing, except for sourdough b, in which l. fermentum was also detected. isolates of the species l. sanfranciscensis and l. fermentum were shown by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-pcr analysis to originate from the commercial  starters and the baker's yeast, respectively.

AB  == aims: to select adhesive strains among strains of lactobacillus and to apply them to inhibit adhesion of food-borne pathogens. methods and results: twelve lactobacillus strains (10 from intestine) were examined for adhesion using caco-2 cell cultures. the two most adhesive strains, lactobacillus crispatus jcm 8779 and lact. reuteri jcm 1081, were used to test antiadhesion activity against enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and enterococcus faecalis strains. adhesion of the pathogens was inhibited by both lactobacillus strains. adhesion of ent. faecalis was especially strongly inhibited by jcm 8779. although antimicrobial activity was not detected in the culture supernatant fluid by agar well diffusion assay, the supernatant fluid obtained from the harvested jcm 8779 cell suspension showed bactericidal activity against ent. faecalis. conclusion: the strong antiadhesion activity of jcm 8779 against ent. faecalis appears to be due to the combined effect of both bactericidal activity and competition for attachment site. significance and impact of the study: this is the first report that lact. crispatus produces a bactericidal substance.
