TI  == the presence of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial pathogens in endotracheal tube biofilms and corresponding surveillance cultures.
AB  == mechanically ventilated patients often develop ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). soon after intubation, a mixed biofilm harboring microbial pathogens is formed on the endotracheal tube (et). it is believed that this biofilm contributes to the development of vap. unfortunately, the causative agent is often not known at the time vap is suspected, and early therapy often relies on the identification of surveillance cultures (sc). it is thus important to know whether these sc can predict the microbial flora in et biofilms. in this study, we compare the presence of a number of antibiotic-resistant nosocomial bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, micrococcus luteus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, and staphylococcus epidermidis) and of candida albicans in cultures from et biofilms and sc (i.e. sputum samples, nose swabs, and throat swabs) of 20 mechanically ventilated patients. our data indicate that  there is a good correlation between the presence of (antibiotic-resistant) pathogens in et biofilms and sc.

TI  == characterization of six antibacterial response genes from the european corn borer (ostrinia nubilalis) larval gut and their expression in response to bacterial challenge.
AB  == six cdnas encoding putative antibacterial response proteins were identified and characterized from the larval gut of the european corn borer (ostrinia nubilalis). these antibacterial response proteins include four peptidoglycan recognition proteins (pgrps), one beta-1,3-glucanase-1 (betaglu-1), and one lysozyme. tissue-specific expression analysis showed that these genes were highly expressed in the midgut, except for lysozyme. analysis of expression of these genes in different developmental stage showed that they were expressed in larval  stages, but little or no detectable expression was found in egg, pupa and adult.  when larvae were challenged with gram-negative bacteria (enterobacter aerogenes), the expression of all six genes was up-regulated in the fatbodies. however, when  larvae were challenged with gram-positive bacteria (micrococcus luteus), only pgrp-c and lysozyme genes were up-regulated. this study provides additional insights into the expression of antibacterial response genes in o. nubilalis larvae and helps us better understand the immune defense response in o. nubilalis.

TI  == phytoremediation of mercury in pristine and crude oil contaminated soils: contributions of rhizobacteria and their host plants to mercury removal.
AB  == the rhizospheric soils of three tested legume crops: broad beans (vicia faba), beans (phaseolus vulgaris) and pea (pisum sativum), and two nonlegume crops: cucumber (cucumis sativus) and tomato, (lycopersicon esculentum) contained considerable numbers (the magnitude of 10(5)g(-1) soil) of bacteria with the combined potential for hydrocarbon-utilization and mercury-resistance. sequencing of the 16s rrna coding genes of rhizobacteria associated with broad beans revealed that they were affiliated to citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, exiquobacterium aurantiacum, pseudomonas veronii, micrococcus luteus,  brevibacillus brevis, arthrobacter sp. and flavobacterium psychrophilum. these rhizobacteria were also diazotrophic, i.e. capable of n(2) fixation, which makes  them self-sufficient regarding their nitrogen nutrition and thus suitable remediation agents in nitrogen-poor soils, such as the oily desert soil. the crude oil attenuation potential of the individual rhizobacteria was inhibited by  hgcl(2), but about 50% or more of this potential was still maintained in the presence of up to 40 mgl(-1) hgcl(2). rhizobacteria-free plants removed amounts of mercury from the surrounding media almost equivalent to those removed by the rhizospheric bacterial consortia in the absence of the plants. it was concluded that both the collector plants and their rhizospheric bacterial consortia contributed equivalently to mercury removal from soil.

TI  == analysis of cell division gene ftsz (sulb) from gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == the ftsz (sulb) gene of escherichia coli codes for a 40,000-dalton protein that carries out a key step in the cell division pathway. the presence of an ftsz gene protein in other bacterial species was examined by a combination of southern blot and western blot analyses. southern blot analysis of genomic restriction digests  revealed that many bacteria, including species from six members of the family enterobacteriaceae and from pseudomonas aeruginosa and agrobacterium tumefaciens, contained sequences which hybridized with an e. coli ftsz probe. genomic dna from more distantly related bacteria, including bacillus subtilis, branhamella catarrhalis, micrococcus luteus, and staphylococcus aureus, did not hybridize under minimally stringent conditions. western blot analysis, with anti-e. coli ftsz antiserum, revealed that all bacterial species examined contained a major immunoreactive band. several of the enterobacteriaceae were transformed with a multicopy plasmid encoding the e. coli ftsz gene. these transformed strains, shigella sonnei, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter  aerogenes, were shown to overproduce the ftsz protein and to produce minicells. analysis of [35s]methionine-labeled minicells revealed that the plasmid-encoded gene products were the major labeled species. this demonstrated that the e. coli  ftsz gene could function in other bacterial species to induce minicells and that  these minicells could be used to analyze plasmid-endoced gene products.
