TI  == comparison of the gut microbiota of people in france and saudi arabia.
AB  == background/objectives: the gut microbiota contributes to energy acquisition from  food, and changes in the gut microbiome are associated with obesity. the eating habits of saudis are much different than those of europeans, and our objective was to compare the fecal microbiota of obese and normal weight saudis and french. subjects/methods: illumina miseq deep sequencing was used to test the gut microbiota of 9 normal weight and 9 obese individuals from saudi arabia and 16 normal weight and 12 obese individuals from france. results: obese french possessed significantly more relative proteobacteria (p=0.002) and bacteroidetes  (p=0.05) and had lower richness and biodiversity at all the operational taxonomic unit (otu) cutoffs (p<0.05) than normal weight french. obese saudis possessed significantly more firmicutes (p=0.001) without a difference in richness (p=0.2)  and biodiversity (p=0.3) compared with normal weight saudis. we found a common bacterial species core of 23 species existing in 50% of obese and normal weight saudis and 29 species in 50% of obese and normal weight french. actinomyces odontolyticus, escherichia coli and ruminococcus obeum were present in at least 50% of all individuals tested. french individuals had significantly higher richness and biodiversity compared with saudis at all the otu cutoffs (p<0.05). conclusion: microbiota differences between obese and normal weight french were not similar to those between obese and normal weight saudis. the studies of different populations can result in contrasting data regarding the associations of the gut microbiota and obesity.

TI  == sudan azo dyes and para red degradation by prevalent bacteria of the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  == sudan azo dyes have genotoxic effects and ingestion of food products contaminated with sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red could lead to exposure in the human gastrointestinal tract. in this study, we examined thirty-five prevalent species  of human intestinal bacteria to evaluate their capacity to degrade sudan dyes and para red. among these tested bacterial strains, 23, 13, 33, 30, and 29 out of 35  species tested were able to reduce sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively, to some extent. bifidobacterium infantis, clostridium indolis, enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus rhamnosus, and ruminococcus obeum were able  to reduce completely all four tested sudan dyes and para red. escherichia coli and peptostreptococcus magnus were the only two strains that were not able to reduce any of the tested sudan dyes and para red to any significant extent. metabolites of the reduction of the tested sudan dyes and para red by e. faecalis were isolated and identified by hplc and lc/esi-ms analyses and compared with authentic standards. thus it appears that the ability to reduce sudan dyes and para red except sudan ii is common among bacteria in the human colon.

TI  == development of a membrane-array method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == a membrane-array method was developed for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples without using the expensive microarray-arrayer and laser-scanner. the 16s rdna sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to nitrocellulose membranes. digoxigenin (dig)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or pure cultured bacteria using two universal primers, and were hybridized to the membrane-array. hybridization signals were read by nbt/bcip color development. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, b. vulgatus, b. fragilis, b. distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, c. leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, r. bromii, r. callidus, r. albus, bifidobacterium  longum, b. adolescentis, b. infantis, eubacterium biforme, e. aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus,escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the membrane-array method is a reliable technique for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples. the result was also confirmed by  using specific pcr methods for these bacteria.

TI  == design and evaluation of oligonucleotide-microarray method for the detection of human intestinal bacteria in fecal samples.
AB  == an oligonucleotide-microarray method was developed for the detection of intestinal bacteria in fecal samples collected from human subjects. the 16s rdna  sequences of 20 predominant human intestinal bacterial species were used to design oligonucleotide probes. three 40-mer oligonucleotides specific for each bacterial species (total 60 probes) were synthesized and applied to glass slides. cyanine5 (cy5)-labeled 16s rdnas were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) from human fecal samples or bacterial dna using two universal primers and were hybridized to the oligo-microarray. the 20 intestinal bacterial species tested were bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides distasonis, clostridium clostridiiforme, clostridium leptum, fusobacterium prausnitzii, peptostreptococcus productus, ruminococcus obeum, ruminococcus bromii, ruminococcus callidus, ruminococcus albus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, bifidobacterium infantis, eubacterium biforme, eubacterium aerofaciens, lactobacillus acidophilus, escherichia coli, and enterococcus faecium. the two universal primers were able to amplify full size 16s rdna from all of the 20 bacterial species tested. the hybridization results indicated that the oligo-microarray method developed in this study is a reliable method for the detection of predominant human intestinal bacteria in the fecal samples.
