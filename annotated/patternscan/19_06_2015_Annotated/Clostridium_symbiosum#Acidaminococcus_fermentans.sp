TI  == substrate specificity of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum: toward a bio-based production of adipic acid.
AB  == expression of six genes from two glutamate fermenting clostridia converted escherichia coli into a producer of glutaconate from 2-oxoglutarate of the general metabolism (djurdjevic, i. et al. 2010, appl. environ. microbiol.77, 320-322). the present work examines whether this pathway can also be used to reduce 2-oxoadipate to (r)-2-hydroxyadipic acid and dehydrate its coa thioester to 2-hexenedioic acid, an unsaturated precursor of the biotechnologically valuable adipic acid (hexanedioic acid). 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum, the key enzyme of this pathway and a potential radical enzyme, catalyzes the reversible dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa to (e)-glutaconyl-coa. using a spectrophotometric assay and mass spectrometry, it was found that (r)-2-hydroxyadipoyl-coa, oxalocrotonyl-coa, muconyl-coa, and butynedioyl-coa, but not 3-methylglutaconyl-coa, served as alternative substrates. hydration of butynedioyl-coa most likely led to 2-oxosuccinyl-coa, which spontaneously hydrolyzed to oxaloacetate and coash. the dehydratase is not  specific for the coa-moiety because (r)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-thioesters of n-acetylcysteamine and pantetheine served as almost equal substrates. whereas the related 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa dehydratase generated the stable and inhibitory 2,4-pentadienoyl-coa radical, the analogous allylic ketyl radical could not be detected with muconyl-coa and 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase. with the exception of (r)-2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa, all mono-coa-thioesters of dicarboxylates used in this study were synthesized with glutaconate coa-transferase from acidaminococcus fermentans. the now possible conversion of (r)-2-hydroxyadipate via (r)-2-hydroxyadipoyl-coa and 2-hexenedioyl-coa to 2-hexenedioate paves the road for a bio-based production of adipic acid.

TI  == an asymmetric model for na+-translocating glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases.
AB  == glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase (gcd) couples the biotin-dependent decarboxylation of glutaconyl-coa with the generation of an electrochemical na(+) gradient. sequencing of the genes encoding all subunits of the clostridium symbiosum decarboxylase membrane complex revealed that it comprises two distinct biotin carrier subunits, gcdc(1) and gcdc(2), which differ in the length of a central alanine- and proline-rich linker domain. co-crystallization of the decarboxylase  subunit gcda with the substrate glutaconyl-coa, the product crotonyl-coa, and the substrate analogue glutaryl-coa, respectively, resulted in a high resolution model for substrate binding and catalysis revealing remarkable structural changes upon substrate binding. unlike the gcda structure from acidaminococcus fermentans, these data suggest that in intact gcd complexes, gcda is associated as a tetramer crisscrossed by a network of solvent-filled tunnels.

TI  == dehydration of (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa to enoyl-coa in the fermentation of alpha-amino acids by anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == several clostridia and fusobacteria ferment alpha-amino acids via (r)-2-hydroxyacyl-coa, which is dehydrated to enoyl-coa by syn-elimination. this  reaction is of great mechanistic interest, since the beta-hydrogen, to be eliminated as proton, is not activated (pk 40-50). a mechanism has been proposed, in which one high-energy electron acts as cofactor and transiently reduces the electrophilic thiol ester carbonyl to a nucleophilic ketyl radical anion. the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases are two-component systems composed of an extremely oxygen-sensitive component a, an activator, and component d, the actual dehydratase. component a, a homodimer with one [4fe-4s]cluster, transfers an electron to component d, a heterodimer with 1-2 [4fe-4s]clusters and fmn, concomitant with hydrolysis of two atp. from component d the electron is further  transferred to the substrate, where it facilitates elimination of the hydroxyl group. in the resulting enoxyradical the beta-hydrogen is activated (pk14). after elimination the electron is handed-over to the next incoming substrate without further hydrolysis of atp. the helix-cluster-helix architecture of component a forms an angle of 105 degrees, which probably opens to 180 degrees upon binding of atp resembling an archer shooting arrows. therefore we designated component a  as 'archerase'. here, we describe 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from acidaminococcus fermentans, clostridium symbiosum and fusobacterium nucleatum, 2-phenyllactate dehydratase from clostridium sporogenes, 2-hydroxyisocaproyl-coa  dehydratase from clostridium difficile, and lactyl-coa dehydratase from clostridium propionicum. a relative of the 2-hydroxyacyl-coa dehydratases is benzoyl-coa reductase from thauera aromatica. analogous but unrelated archerases  are the iron proteins of nitrogenase and bacterial protochlorophyllide reductase. in anaerobic organisms, which do not oxidize 2-oxo acids, a second energy-driven  electron transfer from nadh to ferredoxin, the electron donor of component a, has been established. the transfer is catalysed by a membrane-bound nadh-ferredoxin oxidoreductase driven by an electrochemical na(+)-gradient. this enzyme is related to the rnf proteins involved in rhodobacter capsulatus nitrogen fixation.

TI  == 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum.
AB  == component d (hgdab) of 2-hydroxyglutaryl-coa dehydratase from clostridium symbiosum was purified to homogeneity. it is able to use component a from acidaminococcus fermentans (hgdc) to initiate catalysis together with atp, mg2+ and a strong reducing agent such as ti(iii)citrate. component d from c. symbiosum has a 6 x higher specific activity compared with that from a. fermentans and contains a second [4fe-4s] cluster but the same amount of riboflavin 5'-phosphate (1.0 per heterodimeric enzyme, m = 100 kda). mossbauer spectroscopy revealed symmetric cube-type structures of the two [4fe-4s]2+ clusters. epr spectroscopy showed the resistance of the clusters to reducing agents, but detected a sharp signal at g = 2. 004 probably due to a stabilized flavin semiquinone. three genes from c. symbiosum coding for components d (hgda and hgdb) and a (hgdc) were cloned and sequenced. primer extension experiments indicated that the genes are transcribed in the order hgdcab from an operon only half the size of that from a. fermentans. sequence comparisons detected a close relationship to the dehydratase system from a. fermentans and hgda from fusobacterium nucleatum, as well as to putative proteins of unknown function from archaeoglobus fulgidus. lower, but significant, identities were found with putative enzymes from several methanogenic archaea and escherichia coli, as well as with the mechanistically related benzoyl-coa reductases from the proteobacteria rhodopseudomonas palustris and thauera aromatica.

TI  == the biotin-dependent sodium ion pump glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase from fusobacterium nucleatum (subsp. nucleatum). comparison with the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == membrane preparations of fusobacterium nucleatum grown on glutamate contain glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase at a high specific activity (13.8 nkat/mg protein).  the enzyme was solubilized with 2% triton x-100 in 0.5 m nacl and purified 63-fold to a specific activity of 870 nkat/mg by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-sepharose. the activity of the decarboxylase was strictly dependent on na+ (km = 3 mm) and was stimulated up to 3-fold by phospholipids. the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria acidaminococcus fermentans and clostridium symbiosum have a lower apparent km for na+ (1 mm) and  were not stimulated by phospholipids. in addition only the fusobacterial decarboxylase required sodium ion for stability and was inactivated by potassium  ion. by incorporation of this purified enzyme into phospholipids an electrogenic  sodium ion pump was reconstituted. the enzyme consists of four subunits, alpha (m = 65 kda), beta (33 kda), gamma (19 kda), and delta (16 kda) with the functions of a carboxy transferase (alpha), a carboxy lyase (beta and probably delta) and a biotin carrier (gamma). the subunits are very similar to those of the glutaconyl-coa decarboxylases from the gram-positive bacteria. with an antiserum  directed against the decarboxylase from a. fermentans the alpha- and the biotin containing subunits of the three decarboxylases and that from peptostreptococcus  asaccharolyticus could be detected on western blots.

TI  == a sodium ion gradient as energy source for peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus.
AB  == the determination of enzymatic activities in cell-free extracts of acidaminococcus fermentans and peptostreptococcus asaccharolyticus led to a refined scheme for the pathway of glutamate fermentation via (r)-2-hydroxyglutarate to acetate and butyrate. from the ratio of these products  the amount of atp generated by substrate level phosphorylation was calculated. growth experiments with the organisms including clostridium symbiosum and clostridium tetanomorphum indicated that a sodium gradient contributed additional energy for growth. the high growth yields found in organisms containing the biotin dependent sodium pump glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase could be reduced by the sodium ionophor monensin. in p. asaccharolyticus energy equivalent up to 0.6 mol  atp per mol of glutaconyl-coa decarboxylated was conserved via the na+ gradient.  the data may explain the growth promoting effects of monensin in cattle.

TI  == purification, characterisation and reconstitution of glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase, a biotin-dependent sodium pump from anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase from acidaminococcus fermentans is a biotin enzyme,  which is integrated into membranes. it is activated by triton x-100 and inhibited by avidin. the results obtained by a combination of both agents indicate that biotin and the substrate-binding site are located on the same side of the membrane. the decarboxylase was solubilized with triton x-100 and purified by affinity chromatography on monomeric avidin-sepharose. the enzyme is composed of  three types of polypeptides: the group of alpha chains (mr 120000-140000) containing the biotin, the beta chain (60000) and an apparently hydrophobic gamma chain (35000). sodium ions specifically protected the latter chain from tryptic digestion. it was supposed, therefore, that this chain might function as the na+  channel. the beta and gamma chains but not the alpha chain could be labelled by n-ethyl-[14c]maleimide. similar decarboxylases but with much smaller biotin peptides (mr 15000-20000) were isolated from peptococcus aerogenes and clostridium symbiosum. the decarboxylases from all three organisms could be reconstituted to active sodium pumps by incubation with phospholipid vesicles and octylglucoside followed by dilution. the na+ uptake catalysed by the enzyme from  a. fermentans was completely inhibited by monensin and activated twofold by valinomycin/k+ indicating an electrogenic na+ pump. the coupling between na+ transport and decarboxylation was not tight. during the reaction the ratio decreased from initially 1 to 0.2. the three organisms mentioned above and clostridium tetanomorphum without glutaconyl-coa decarboxylase are able to ferment glutamate and require 10 mm na+ for rapid growth. there is no correlation between the concentration of monensin necessary to inhibit growth and the presence of decarboxylase in these organisms.
