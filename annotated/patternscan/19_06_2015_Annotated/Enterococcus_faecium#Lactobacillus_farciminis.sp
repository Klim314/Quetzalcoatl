TI  == isolation and partial characterization of halotolerant lactic acid bacteria from  two mexican cheeses.
AB  == isolated strains of halotolerant or halophilic lactic acid bacteria (halab) from  cotija and doble crema cheeses were identified and partially characterized by phenotypic and genotypic methods, and their technological abilities were studied  in order to test their potential use as dairy starter components. humidity, a(w), ph, and salt concentration of cheeses were determined. genotypic diversity was evaluated by randomly amplified polymorphic dna-polymerase chain reaction. molecular identification and phylogenetic reconstructions based on 16s rrna gene  sequences were performed. additional technological abilities such as salt tolerance, acidifying, and proteolytic and lipolytic activities were also investigated. the differences among strains reflected the biodiversity of halab in both types of cheeses. lactobacillus acidipiscis, tetragenococcus halophilus,  weissella thailandensis, and lactobacillus pentosus from cotija cheese, and l. acidipiscis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus farciminis, and lactobacillus rhamnosus from doble crema cheese were identified based on 16s rrna. quantitative and qualitative assessments showed strains of t.  halophilus and l. plantarum to be proteolytic, along with e. faecium, l. farciminis, and l. pentosus to a lesser extent. lipolytic activity could be demonstrated in strains of e. faecium, l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and t. halophilus. strains belonging to the species l. pentosus, l. plantarum, and e. faecium were able to acidify the milk media. this study evidences the presence of halab that may play a role in the ripening of cheeses.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.

TI  == characterisation of lactic acid bacteria isolated from naturally fermented greek  dry salami.
AB  == a total of 348 lactic acid bacteria isolated from five batches of naturally fermented dry salami at various stages of ripening were characterised. the majority of the strains were assigned to two main phylogenetic groups of species: (i) the psychrotrophic, formerly called atypical, meat streptobacteria (169 strains) and (ii) a new genus weissella (120), which was recently proposed (collins et al., 1993) to include leuconostoc paramesenteroides and some other closely related species. meat streptobacteria were identified as lactobacillus curvatus (88 strains) and l. sake (76), whereas 5 strains were indistinguishable  and, thus designated l. sake/curvatus. non-psychrotrophic streptobacteria were also isolated and identified as l. plantarum (34 strains), l. farciminis (10), l. coryniformis (1) and l. casei subsp. pseudoplantarum (1). the majority of the weissella strains (86) were leuconostoc-like bacteria; four of them were identified as w. viridescens, 11 belonged to the newly described w. hellenica (collins et al., 1993), another 11 resembled w. paramesenteroides, whereas 60 isolates were not classified to any species. the latter group comprised strains that produced d(l)-lactate. the remaining weissella were gas-forming, arginine-positive rods assigned to w. minor (31) and w. halotolerans (3). other species identified were enterococcus faecium (10), leuconostoc mesenteroides (1), l. brevis (1) and pediococcus sp. (1). the main criteria used to distinguish between above species as well as their distribution on the five salami batches in relation to their succession with time and suitability as starters were discussed.
