TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. reported by the research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == this study was conducted to investigate susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antibacterial agents at 64 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study,  identification and susceptibility testing were carried out at each laboratory and the tests were performed according to the disk dilution method recommended by nccls in which susceptibilities are classified into "s", "ms", "i" and "r". ipm showed markedly high in vitro activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. ipm also  had strong activities against achromobacter xylosoxidans and pseudomonas aeruginosa, but less active against flavobacterium spp., e. faecium, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas cepacia. in a study in which activities of ipm against bacteria isolated from different clinical sources were compared, differences in susceptibilities were observed among s. aureus, cns, a. calcoaceticus and p. aeruginosa, but such differences were not apparent among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, s. marcescens or p. mirabilis.

TI  == [susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to antimicrobial agents. a study mainly focused on imipenem. research group for testing imipenem susceptibility on clinical isolates].
AB  == we investigated susceptibilities of clinical bacterial isolates to imipenem (ipm) and other antimicrobial agents at 459 hospital laboratories throughout japan from september to december of 1988. in this study, identification and susceptibility testing were performed at each hospital laboratory and the tests were carried out according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc technique in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, + and -. ipm had significantly high activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, salmonella spp., citrobacter freundii, proteus mirabilis, providencia rettgeri, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, moraxella catarrhalis, alcaligenes spp., peptococcus spp./peptostreptococcus spp., bacteroides fragilis and bacteroides spp. and should slightly lower activities on coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), enterococcus faecalis, haemophilus influenzae, serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, providencia stuartii and pseudomonas aeruginosa than on the above mentioned bacteria. in a comparative study on activities of ipm against bacteria from different clinical sources, no remarkable differences were found due to different sources among s. pneumoniae, e. faecalis, h. influenzae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, c. freundii, p. mirabilis or a. calcoaceticus, whereas slight differences were found among staphylococcus aureus, cns, s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa.
