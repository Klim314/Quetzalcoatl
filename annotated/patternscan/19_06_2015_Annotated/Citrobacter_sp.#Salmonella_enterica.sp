TI  == characterization of citrobacter sp. line 328 as a source of vi for a vi-crm(197)  glycoconjugate vaccine against salmonella typhi.
AB  == introduction: salmonella enterica serovar typhi is the causative agent of typhoid fever with over 22 million cases and over 200,000 deaths reported annually. a vaccine is much needed for use in young children and the novartis vaccines institute for global health (nvgh) is developing a conjugate vaccine which targets s. typhi vi capsular polysaccharide. methodology: here we describe a method suitable for industrial scale production of the vi antigen based on expression by a citrobacter line. we optimized the production of vi by selecting  a suitable citrobacter strain (citrobacter 328) that yields high and stable expression of vi in chemically defined medium under industrial-scale fermentation conditions. results: vi-crm197 made using vi from citrobacter 328 elicited high anti-vi antibody levels in mice and rabbits. conclusions: citrobacter 328 is a suitable strain for production of vi for conjugate anti-typhi vaccines. being a bsl-1 organism, which grows in defined medium and stably produces high yields of  vi, it offers excellent potential for safe production of inexpensive vaccines for populations at risk of typhoid fever.

TI  == slya, a regulatory protein from salmonella typhimurium, induces a haemolytic and  pore-forming protein in escherichia coli.
AB  == a chromosomal fragment from salmonella typhimurium, when cloned in escherichia coli, generates a haemolytic phenotype. this fragment carries two genes, termed slya and slyb. the expression of slya is sufficient for the haemolytic phenotype. the haemolytic activity of e. coli carrying multiple copies of slya is found mainly in the cytoplasm, with some in the periplasm of cells grown to stationary  phase, but overexpression of slyb, a 15 kda lipoprotein probably located in the outer membrane, may lead to enhanced, albeit unspecific, release of the haemolytic activity into the medium. polyclonal antibodies raised against a purified slya-hlya fusion protein identified the overexpressed monomeric 17 kda slya protein mainly in the cytoplasm of e. coli grown to stationary phase, although smaller amounts were also found in the periplasm and even in the culture supernatant. however, the anti-slya antibodies reacted with the slya protein in a periplasmic fraction that did not contain the haemolytic activity. conversely, the periplasmic fraction exhibiting haemolytic activity did not contain the 17 kda slya protein. furthermore, s. typhimurium transformed with multiple copies of the slya gene did not show a haemolytic phenotype when grown in rich culture media, although the slya protein was expressed in amounts similar to those in the recombinant e. coli strain. these results indicate that slya is not itself a cytolysin but rather induces in e. coli (but not in s. typhimurium) the synthesis of an uncharacterised, haemolytically active protein which forms pores with a diameter of about 2.6 nm in an artificial lipid bilayer. the slya protein thus seems to represent a regulation factor in salmonella, as is also suggested by the similarity of the slya protein to some other bacterial regulatory proteins. slya- and slyb-related genes were also obtained by pcr from e. coli, shigella sp. and citrobacter diversus but not from several other gram-negative bacteria tested.

TI  == phosphatase-mediated heavy metal accumulation by a citrobacter sp. and related enterobacteria.
AB  == a citrobacter sp. was reported previously to accumulate heavy metals as cell-bound heavy metal phosphates. metal uptake is mediated by the activity of a  periplasmic acid-type phosphatase that liberates inorganic phosphate to provide the precipitant ligand for heavy metals presented to the cells. amino acid sequencing of peptide fragments of the purified enzyme revealed significant homology to the phon product (acid phosphatase) of some other enterobacteria. these organisms, together with klebsiella pneumoniae, previously reported to produce acid phosphatase, were tested for their ability to remove uranium and lanthanum from challenge solutions supplemented with phosphatase substrate. the coupling of phosphate liberation to metal bioaccumulation was limited to the metal accumulating citrobacter sp.; therefore the participation of species-specific additional factors in metal bioaccumulation was suggested.

TI  == in vitro activity of tigemonam against urinary tract pathogens.
AB  == tigemonam's in vitro activity was compared with that of aztreonam, cefotaxime, gentamicin, and norfloxacin. thirty-two strains of pseudomonas and 960 strains of enterobacteriaceae were studied using the agar dilution method (including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter sp., serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and salmonella enterica). tigemonam displayed good activity against enterobacteriaceae. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), were as follows: mic50s were 0.01 mg/l for p. mirabilis and 0.5 mg/l for s. marcescens, mic90s were 0.03 mg/l for p. mirabilis and p. vulgaris and 4 mg/l for citrobacter freundii. tigemonam inhibited e. coli and p. mirabilis, the most common strains of urinary pathogens. despite mic90s of 9.5 and 4 mg/l for enterobacter and c. freundii, respectively, resistance to tigemonam was observed. tigemonam was found to be inactive against pseudomonas aeruginosa, with mic50s and mic90s higher than 128 mg/l (range, 64 to greater than 128 mg/l). tigemonam's activity was found to  be similar to that of cefotaxime, slightly less than that of norfloxacin and aztreonam, and substantially greater than that of gentamicin. of all the drugs tested, only norfloxacin and aztreonam possessed activity profiles against p. aeruginosa that were compatible with their clinical usefulness (mic90, 8 mg/l for norfloxacin; mic50, 8 mg/l and mic90, 32 mg/l for aztreonam). cefotaxime and gentamicin showed no activity on more than 90% of the p. aeruginosa strains tested.

TI  == inhibition of colonization of the chicken alimentary tract with salmonella typhimurium gram-negative facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == oral administration of strains of food poisoning salmonellas to day-old chickens  produced a profound inhibition in the subsequent colonization of the caeca by a strain of salmonella typhimurium given one day later. closely related genera were unable to produce a similar inhibition. the inhibition was not the result of bacteriophages produced by the first strain. neither was it the result of an immunological response by the host induced by the first strain. in additional experiments in day-old chickens, inhibition of an escherichia coli nalr strain and of a citrobacter sp. nalr strain was produced by the antibiotic-sensitive forms of the homologous strains while strains from other genera did not produce any inhibition. when an avirulent mutant of s. typhimurium was used for pre-treatment a statistically significant reduction in the excretion of the super-infecting s. typhimurium nalr strain over several weeks was produced. a genus specific inhibition was reproduced in vitro by mixed culture experiments. live cultures were necessary for in vitro inhibition. killed cells or a culture supernatant produced no inhibition.
