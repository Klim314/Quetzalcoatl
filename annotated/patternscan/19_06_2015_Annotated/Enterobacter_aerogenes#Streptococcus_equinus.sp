TI  == polymerase chain reaction of bacterial genomes with single universal primer: application to distinguishing mycobacteria species.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction with a single universal primer (up-pcr) was applied to bacterial strains and mycobacteria isolates alongside conventional methods. a  universal protocol of preparation of pcr samples from cultures representing escherichia coli, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella pneumoniae, mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium bovis, and several non-tuberculous mycobacteria was found to be reproducible and efficient with these organisms. the bands of up-pcr  products observed in an agarose gel after electrophoresis were species-specific and provided an efficient means of distinguishing bacterial species. the applicability of this approach to mycobacteria identification was assessed by comparing the dna bands obtained for different strains. three reference strains and 22 clinical isolates of m. tuberculosis and m. bovis produced very similar dna banding patterns. they comprised a triplet of prominent and several minor fragments within the 200-500 base pair (bp) size range and were the easiest to interpret. the dna profiles of unrelated mycobacteria clearly differed from each  other when subjected to electrophoretic analysis and correlated well with results of culture method. the method provides a real promise of its application in clinical studies as a simple assay for distinguishing between tubercle bacilli.

TI  == laboratory diagnosis of bacteremia by headspace gas-liquid chromatography.
AB  == the growth of staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, s. fecalis, s. sanguis, s. bovis, s. mitior, s. agalactiae, escherichia coli, a-d group, klebsiella aerogenes, k. oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, serratia marcescens, pasteurella multocida or listeria monocytogenes in 83 blood  cultures was detected in a 1.5-min analysis using head-space gas-liquid chromatography. two hundred and twenty-four blood cultures in which there was no  growth of micro-organisms were negative in the analysis. the analysis detected the growth of s. epidermidis in only 6 of 26 blood cultures and failed to detect  the growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida albicans and species of micrococcus, corynebacterium or bacillus in 18 blood cultures.
