TI  == detection and genomic characterization of motility in lactobacillus curvatus: confirmation of motility in a species outside the lactobacillus salivarius clade.
AB  == lactobacillus is the largest genus within the lactic acid bacteria (lab), with almost 180 species currently identified. motility has been reported for at least  13 lactobacillus species, all belonging to the lactobacillus salivarius clade. motility in lactobacilli is poorly characterized. it probably confers competitive advantages, such as superior nutrient acquisition and niche colonization, but it  could also play an important role in innate immune system activation through flagellin-toll-like receptor 5 (tlr5) interaction. we now report strong evidence  of motility in a species outside the l. salivarius clade, lactobacillus curvatus  (strain nric0822). the motility of l. curvatus nric 0822 was revealed by phase-contrast microscopy and soft-agar motility assays. strain nric 0822 was motile at temperatures between 15 degrees c and 37 degrees c, with a range of different carbohydrates, and under varying atmospheric conditions. we sequenced the l. curvatus nric 0822 genome, which revealed that the motility genes are organized in a single operon and that the products are very similar (>98.5% amino acid similarity over >11,000 amino acids) to those encoded by the motility operon of lactobacillus acidipiscis kctc 13900 (shown for the first time to be motile also). moreover, the presence of a large number of mobile genetic elements within and flanking the motility operon of l. curvatus suggests recent horizontal transfer between members of two distinct lactobacillus clades: l. acidipiscis in  the l. salivarius clade and l. curvatus inthe l. sakei clade. this study provides novel phenotypic, genetic, and phylogenetic insights into flagellum-mediated motility in lactobacilli.

TI  == catabolic flexibility of mammalian-associated lactobacilli.
AB  == metabolic flexibility may be generally defined as "the capacity for the organism  to adapt fuel oxidation to fuel availability". the metabolic diversification strategies used by individual bacteria vary greatly from the use of novel or acquired enzymes to the use of plasmid-localised genes and transporters. in this  review, we describe the ability of lactobacilli to utilise a variety of carbon sources from their current or new environments in order to grow and survive. the  genus lactobacillus now includes more than 150 species, many with adaptive capabilities, broad metabolic capacity and species/strain variance. they are therefore, an informative example of a cell factory capable of adapting to new niches with differing nutritional landscapes. indeed, lactobacilli naturally colonise and grow in a wide variety of environmental niches which include the roots and foliage of plants, silage, various fermented foods and beverages, the human vagina and the mammalian gastrointestinal tract (git; including the mouth,  stomach, small intestine and large intestine). here we primarily describe the metabolic flexibility of some lactobacilli isolated from the mammalian gastrointestinal tract, and we also describe some of the food-associated species  with a proven ability to adapt to the git. as examples this review concentrates on the following species - lb. plantarum, lb. acidophilus, lb. ruminis, lb. salivarius, lb. reuteri and lb. sakei, to highlight the diversity and inter-relationships between the catabolic nature of species within the genus.

TI  == identification of lactobacilli residing in chicken ceca with antagonism against campylobacter.
AB  == bacteriocins produced by lactobacillus salivarius have been recently recognized as a natural means to control campylobacter and salmonella in live poultry. this  finding is of relevance since campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the predominant species isolated from poultry that are associated with human campylobacteriosis. in the present work, lactic acid bacteria (lab) isolated from the cecum of twenty tunisian chickens were identified and those isolates with antagonism against campylobacter were further characterized. following their preliminary confirmation as lab, 150 strains were identified by combining morphological criteria, biochemical tests, and molecular methods, the latter inluding intergenic 16s- 23s pcr, specific lactobacilli pcr, and a biphasic approach. most of the lab isolated belonged to the genus lactobacillus, among them lb. sakei (33.3%), lb. salivarius (19.4%), lb. reuteri (8.6%), and lb. curvatus (8.6%). the other lab strains included those of the genus weissella (16.7%), enterococcus faecalis (5.3%), leuconostoc mesenteroides (2.7%), lactococcus graviae (2.7%), and streptococcus sp. (2.7%). the lactobacilli strains were tested for their antagonism against c. jejuni and c. coli. the activity of three of them, lb. salivarius smxd51, lb. salivarius mms122, and lb.  salivarius mms151, against the aforementioned target strains could be ascribed to the production of bacteriocins.

TI  == characterization of tetracycline resistance lactobacilli isolated from swine intestines at western area of taiwan.
AB  == to investigate the frequency of tetracycline resistance (tet-r) lactobacilli in pig intestines, a total of 256 pig colons were analyzed and found to contain typical colonies of tet-r lactic acid bacteria in every sample, ranging from 3.2  x 10(3) to 6.6 x 10(5) cfu/cm(2). from these samples, a total of 159 isolates of  tet-r lactobacilli were obtained and identified as belonging to 11 species, including lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus amylovorus, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus ruminis, lactobacillus kefiri, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus sakei, lactobacillus coryniformis, lactobacillus parabuchneri and lactobacillus letivazi. based on the efsa (2008) breakpoints, all isolates, after mic analysis, were qualified as tet-r, from which the significant high tet-r mic(50) and mic(90) values indicated an ecological distribution of tet-r lactobacilli mostly with high resistance potency in pig colons. pcr-detection identified 5 tet genes in these isolates, the most predominant one being tet (w), followed by tet (m), (l), (k), and (q). their detection rates were 82.0%, 22.5%, 14.4%, 8.1% and 0.9%, respectively. noteworthily, isolates of the same species carrying identical tet gene(s) usually had a wide different mic values. furthermore, strain-subtyping of these isolates  by rep-pcr demonstrated a notable genotypic biodiversity % (average = 62%).

TI  == phylogenomic reconstruction of lactic acid bacteria: an update.
AB  == background: lactic acid bacteria (lab) are important in the food industry for the production of fermented food products and in human health as commensals in the gut. however, the phylogenetic relationships among lab species remain under intensive debate owing to disagreements among different data sets. results: we performed a phylogenetic analysis of lab species based on 232 genes from 28 lab genome sequences. regardless of the tree-building methods used, combined analyses yielded an identical, well-resolved tree topology with strong supports for all nodes. the lab species examined were divided into two groups. group 1 included families enterococcaceae and streptococcaceae. group 2 included families lactobacillaceae and leuconostocaceae. within group 2, the lab species were divided into two clades. one clade comprised of the acidophilus complex of genus  lactobacillus and two other species, lb. sakei and lb. casei. in the acidophilus  complex, lb. delbrueckii separated first, while lb. acidophilus/lb. helveticus and lb. gasseri/lb. johnsonii were clustered into a sister group. the other clade within group 2 consisted of the salivarius subgroup, including five species, lb.  salivarius, lb. plantarum, lb. brevis, lb. reuteri, lb. fermentum, and the genera pediococcus, oenococcus, and leuconostoc. in this clade, lb. salivarius was positioned most basally, followed by two clusters, one corresponding to lb. plantarum/lb. brevis pair and pediococcus, and the other including oenococcus/leuconostoc pair and lb. reuteri/lb. fermentum pair. in addition, phylogenetic utility of the 232 genes was analyzed to identify those that may be  more useful than others. the genes identified as useful were related to translation and ribosomal structure and biogenesis (trsb), and a three-gene set comprising genes encoding ultra-violet resistance protein b (uvrb), dna polymerase iii (polc) and penicillin binding protein 2b (pbpb). conclusions: our  phylogenomic analyses provide important insights into the evolution and diversification of lab species, and also revealed the phylogenetic utility of several genes. we infer that the occurrence of multiple, independent adaptation events in lab species, have resulted in their occupation of various habitats. further analyses of more genes from additional, representative lab species are needed to reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying adaptation of lab species to various environmental niches.

TI  == diversity of lactobacillus and bifidobacterium in feces of herbivores, omnivores  and carnivores.
AB  == the lactobacillus and bifidobacterium population in the feces of 26 animals (16 species) were studied by culture-dependent and culture-independent techniques. lactobacilli were detected from a few herbivores, all carnivores and some omnivores. lactobacillus johnsonii, lactobacillus reuteri, lactobacillus salivarius, lactobacillus vaginalis and lactobacillus ingluviei were the most dominant lactobacilli in carnivores. these species were, however, not predominant in herbivores and omnivores. lactobacillus brevis, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus parabuchneri, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus sakei, leuconostoc mesenteroides and leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, usually present in raw plant material, were present in omnivores but not in carnivores. bifidobacteria were detected in only four herbivores and two omnivores. bifidobacterium pseudolongum was the only bifidobacterium species detected in herbivores. bifidobacteria detected in the two omnivores are phylogenetically not closely related to known species and are possible novel species in the genus.

TI  == diversity of the genus lactobacillus revealed by comparative genomics of five species.
AB  == the genus lactobacillus contains over 80 recognized species, and is characterized by a high level of diversity, reflected in its complex phylogeny. the authors' recent determination of the genome sequence of lactobacillus salivarius means that five complete genomes of lactobacillus species are available for comparative genomics: l. salivarius, l. plantarum, l. acidophilus, l. johnsonii and l. sakei. this paper now shows that there is no extensive synteny of the genome sequences of these five lactobacilli. phylogeny based on whole-genome alignments suggested  that l. salivarius was closer to l. plantarum than to l. sakei, which was closest to enterococcus faecalis, in contrast to 16s rrna gene relatedness. a total of 593 orthologues common to all five species were identified. species relatedness based on this protein set was largely concordant with genome synteny-based relatedness. a lactobacillus supertree, combining individual phylogenetic trees from each of 354 core proteins, had four main branches, comprising l. salivarius-l. plantarum; l. sakei; e. faecalis; and l. acidophilus-l. johnsonii.  the extreme divergence of the lactobacillus genomes analysed supports the recognition of new subgeneric divisions.

TI  == screening of lactic-acid bacteria from south african barley beer for the production of bacteriocin-like compounds.
AB  == strains of lactobacillus paracasei subsp. paracasei (strain st11br), l. pentosus  (strain st151br), l. plantarum (strain st13br), and lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis (strain st34br) producing bacteriocin-like peptides were isolated from barley beer produced in the western, northern and eastern provinces of south africa. the peptides (bacst11br, bacst151br, bacst13br and bacst34br) lost their  activity after treatment with proteinase k, a proteinase, papain, chymotrypsin, trypsin, pepsin and pronase, but not when they were treated with alpha-amylase, suggesting that the peptides are not glycosylated. the peptides inhibited the growth of lactobacillus casei, l. sakei, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis, but not enterobacter cloacae, lactobacillus bulgaricus subsp. delbrueckii, l. plantarum, l. salivarius, listeria innocua, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus uberis, s. agalactiae, s. caprinus and s. pneumoniae. peptides bacst11br and bacst13br differed from the other 2 peptides by failing to kill klebsiella pneumoniae and one of the e. coli strains. peptides were stable after 2 h of incubation at ph 2.0-12.0, and after 90 min at 100 degrees c. when autoclaved (121 degrees c, 20 min), only bacst13br lost its activity. the bacteriocin-like peptides were produced at a growth temperature of 30 degrees c,  but not at 37 degrees c.

TI  == microbiological characterization and probiotic potential of koko and koko sour water, african spontaneously fermented millet porridge and drink.
AB  == aims: to identify and examine the diversity of predominant lactic acid bacteria (lab) in koko and koko sour water (ksw) from different ghanaian production sites  with regard to pattern of fermentation (api 50 chl), genotype, antimicrobial activity, and resistance to low ph and bile salts. methods and results: in total  215 lab were isolated from koko and ksw. the isolates were identified using intergenic transcribed spacers (its)-pcr restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp), api 50 chl, restriction enzyme analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (rea-pfge) and sequencing of the 16s rrna gene. the dominating micro-organisms in koko was found to be weisella confusa and lactobacillus fermentum, followed by lact. salivarius and pediococcus spp. chemometric data analysis were used to link the lab species to the different production stages and production sites. at intra-species level the isolates were found to have a great  diversity. the isolates were investigated for antimicrobial activity using agar diffusion assays, and acid and bile tolerance. most isolates showed low levels of antimicrobial activity towards the indicator strain listeria innocua, but not towards the bacteriocin-sensitive lact. sakei. growth of all lab isolates was unaffected by the presence of 0.3% (v/v) oxgall bile. the isolates were able to survive, but were not able to grow in growth medium adjusted to ph 2.5. conclusions: the dominating lab of koko and ksw were w. confusa and lact. fermentum showing a pronounced taxonomic biodiversity at sub-species level between stages within the production as well as between production sites. other species observed in ksw were lact. salivarius, ped. pentosaceus, ped. acidilactici and lact. paraplantarum. they occurred in levels of 108 cfu ml-1 in  fresh ksw and showed uniform antimicrobial activity, and acid and bile tolerance. significance and impact of the study: the present study gives a detailed picture  of the taxonomy and diversity of lab in an african-fermented millet product that  may have potential as a probiotic product for the local population. the chemometric tools principal component analysis and anova partial least squares regression were proven to be useful in the analysis of microbial groupings and associations with specific sites and stages in the production of koko and ksw.

TI  == bacteriocin production by spray-dried lactic acid bacteria.
AB  == aims: cell survival and antagonistic activity against listeria innocua, listeria  monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus were investigated after spray-drying three bacteriocin-producing strains of lactic acid bacteria: carnobacterium divergens, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus sakei. methods and results: bacterial cell concentrates were spray-dried and stored at 4 degrees c and 18 degrees c and 0.3% erh (equilibrium relative humidity). enumeration and antagonistic activity were evaluated before and after spray-drying and at regular intervals during storage. conclusions: a higher survival rate was obtained when survival was performed at 4 degrees c. with the exception of carnobacterium divergens which lost the inhibitory activity against staph. aureus after drying,  antagonistic production was not affected by the process nor by the storage. of the three species studied, lact. salivarius showed the highest resistance to the  spray-drying and storage processes. significance and impact of the study: spray-drying is a potentially useful process for large scale production of dried  powders containing viable organisms with antagonistic activity against pathogens.

TI  == characterisation of is153, an is3-family insertion sequence isolated from lactobacillus sanfranciscensis and its use for strain differentiation.
AB  == an insertion sequence has been identified in the genome of lactobacillus sanfranciscensis dsm 20451t as segment of 1351 nucleotides containing 37-bp imperfect terminal inverted repeats. the sequence of this element encodes two out of phase, overlapping open reading frames, orfa and orfb, from which three putative proteins are produced. orfab is a transframe protein produced by -1 translational frame shifting between orf a and orf b that is presumed to be the transposase. the large orfab of this element encodes a 342 amino acid protein that displays similarities with transposases encoded by bacterial insertion sequences belonging to the is3 family. in l. sanfranciscensis type strain dsm 20451t multiple truncated is elements were identified. inverse pcr was used to analyze target sites of four of these elements, but except of their highly at rich character not any sequence specificity was identified so far. moreover, no flanking direct repeats were identified. multiple copies of is153 were detected by hybridization in other strains of l. sanfranciscensis. resulting hybridization patterns were shown to differentiate between organisms at strain level rather than a probe targeted against the 16s rdna. with a pcr based approach is153 or highly similar sequences were detected in l. acidophilus, l. casei, l. malefermentans, l. plantarum, l. hilgardii, l. collinoides l. farciminis l. sakei and l. salivarius, l. reuteri as well as in enterococcus faecium, pediococcus acidilactici and p. pentosaceus.
