TI  == antimicrobial activity of schinus lentiscifolius (anacardiaceae).
AB  == ethnopharmacological relevance: schinus lentiscifolius marchand (syn. schinus weinmannifolius engl) is a plant native to rio grande do sul (southern brazil) and has been used in brazilian traditional medicine as antiseptic and antimicrobial for the treatment of many different health problems as well as to treat leucorrhea and to assist in ulcer and wound healing. although it is a plant widely used by the population, there are no studies proving this popular use. material and methods: the crude aqueous extract, the crude neutral methanol extract, fractions prepared from this extract (n-hexane, ethyl acetate, and n-butanol), pure compounds isolated from these fractions, and derivatives were investigated in vitro for antimicrobial activities against five gram positive bacteria: bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus saprophyticus, streptococcus pyogenes, three gram negative bacteria: escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella sonnei, and four yeasts: candida albicans, candida tropicalis, cryptococcus neoformans, and saccharomyces cerevisiae. the isolated compound moronic acid, which is the most active, was tested against a range of other bacteria such as two gram positive bacteria, namely, bacillus cereus, enterococcus spp, and six gram negative bacteria, namely, burkholderia cepacia, providencia stuartii, morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, and proteus mirabilis. results: the leaf aqueous extract (decoction) of schinus lentiscifolius showed a  broad spectrum of antibacterial activity, ranging from 125 to 250 mug/ml (mic) against the tested bacteria and fungi. the n-hexane extract, despite being very little active against bacteria, showed an excellent antifungal activity, especially against candida albicans (mic=25 mug/ml), candida tropicalis (mic=15.5 mug/ml), and cryptococcus neoformans, (mic=15.5 mug/ml). from the acetate fraction (the most active against bacteria), compounds 1-6 were isolated: nonadecanol (1), moronic acid (2), gallic acid methyl ester (3), gallic acid (4), quercetin (5) and quercitrin (6). the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of moronic acid between 1.5 and 3 mug/ml against most of the tested bacteria shows that it is one of the metabolites responsible for the antibacterial activity of schinus lentiscifolius. conclusion: the antimicrobial activity and some constituents of schinus lentiscifolius are reported for the first time. the results of the present study provide scientific basis for the popular use of schinus lentiscifolius for a number of different health problems.

TI  == synthesis and in-vitro antimicrobial evaluation of a high-affinity iron chelator  in combination with chloramphenicol.
AB  == objectives: the objectives of this study were first to design and synthesize a hexadentate chelator with high iron(iii) affinity and, second, to evaluate its antimicrobial activity in the presence and absence of chloramphenicol. methods: a hexadentate ligand was synthesized by conjugating a protected bidentate compound  onto a tripodal structure. the pka values and iron affinity of the chelator were  determined by spectophotometric titration. minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined by visual inspection of broth turbidity. the bactericidal rates were calculated by counting the colony numbers on a light board after incubation with  and without an antimicrobial agent. key findings: a hexadentate 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one was found to possess a high affinity for iron(iii), with a pfe value of 31.2 (negative logarithm of concentration of the free iron(iii) in solution (when [fe(3)(+)](total) = 10(-)(6)) m; [ligand](total) = 10(5) m; ph = 7.4). we found that this chelator had an appreciable inhibitory effect in vitro against the two bacterial strains providencia stuartii and staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the presence of chloramphenicol. conclusions: a 3-hydroxypyridin-4-one hexadentate ligand has potential as an antimicrobial agent. combination therapy with this iron chelator plus chloramphenicol has potential for the treatment of extracellular infections.

TI  == antibacterial activity of silver-doped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == ag-doped nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite nanoparticles (ag:hap-nps) (ca10-xagx(po4)6(oh)2, xag = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.3) with antibacterial properties are of great interest in the development of new products. coprecipitation method  is a promising route for obtaining nanocrystalline ag:hap with antibacterial properties. x-ray diffraction identified hap as an unique crystalline phase in each sample. the calculated lattice constants of a = b = 9.435 a, c = 6.876 a for xag = 0.05, a = b = 9.443 a, c = 6.875 a for xag = 0.2, and a = b = 9.445 a, c =  6.877 a for xag = 0.3 are in good agreement with the standard of a = b = 9.418 a, c = 6.884 a (space group p63/m). the fourier transform infrared and raman spectra of the sintered hap show the absorption bands characteristic to hydroxyapatite. the ag:hap nanoparticles are evaluated for their antibacterial activity against staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, providencia stuartii, citrobacter freundii and serratia marcescens. the results showed that the antibacterial activity of these materials, regardless of the sample types, was greatest against s. aureus, k. pneumoniae, p. stuartii, and c. freundii. the results of qualitative antibacterial tests revealed that the tested ag:hap-nps had an important inhibitory activity on p. stuartii and c. freundii. the absorbance values measured at 490 nm of the p. stuartii and c. freundii in the presence of ag:hap-nps decreased compared with those of organic solvent used (dmso) for all the samples (xag = 0.05, 0.2, and 0.3). antibacterial activity increased with the increase of xag in the samples. the ag:hap-np concentration had little influence  on the bacterial growth (p. stuartii).

TI  == crystalline bacterial biofilm formation on urinary catheters by urease-producing  urinary tract pathogens: a simple method of control.
AB  == the problem of catheter encrustation stems from infection by urease-producing bacteria. these organisms generate ammonia from urea, elevate the ph of urine and cause crystals of calcium and magnesium phosphates to form in the urine and the biofilm that develops on the catheter. in this study, a laboratory model was used to compare the ability of 12 urease-positive species of urinary tract pathogens to encrust and block catheters. proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris and providencia rettgeri were able to raise the urinary ph above 8.3 and produce catheter-blocking crystalline biofilms within 40 h. morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus elevated the ph of urine to 7.4 and 6.9, respectively, and  caused some crystal deposition in the biofilms but did not block catheters in the 96 h experimental period. isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca,  enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and providencia stuartii were only capable of raising the ph of urine to a maximum of 6.4 and failed to cause crystal deposition in the biofilm. the most effective way to prevent catheter encrustation was shown to be diluting urine and increasing its citrate concentration. this strategy raises the nucleation ph (ph(n)) at which calcium and magnesium phosphates crystallize from urine. increasing the fluid intake of a healthy volunteer with citrated drinks resulted in urine with a ph(n) of >8.0 in which catheter encrustation was inhibited. it is suggested that this dietary strategy will be an effective means of controlling catheter encrustation, whichever bacterial species is causing the problem.

TI  == bluish discolouration of urine drainage tube and bag in a female patient with spina bifida, paraplegia, and suprapubic cystostomy.
AB  == we present a female patient with spina bifida, paraplegia, suprapubic cystostomy, and chronic constipation, who became anxious when she noticed a bluish discolouration of her urine drainage system. urine microbiology revealed growth of providencia stuartii and staphylococcus aureus. there were no systemic features of infection and, therefore, antibiotics were not prescribed for asymptomatic bacteriuria. this patient was advised to change the urine bag every  day, and was prescribed senna to facilitate bowel evacuation. she was reassured that bluish discolouration of the urine drainage tube and bag was a transient, benign phenomenon and not indicative of any underlying pathology. over the next 7 days, the bluish discolouration gradually faded away. clinical characteristics of patients who are likely to develop this phenomenon and the underlying biochemical mechanism for bluish discolouration of the urine drainage system are discussed in brief.

TI  == effect of triclosan on the development of bacterial biofilms by urinary tract pathogens on urinary catheters.
AB  == objectives: to examine (i) the effect of triclosan on the formation of catheter biofilms by urinary tract pathogens and (ii) the diffusion of triclosan through the retention balloons of urinary catheters. methods: models of the catheterized  bladder were infected with eight different urinary tract pathogens and the effect of triclosan on biofilm formation was assessed by determining the numbers of viable cells colonizing the catheters and by scanning electron microscopy. hplc was used to determine the triclosan concentration in urine draining from models that had been fitted with triclosan-inflated silicone catheters. results: when catheters were inflated with triclosan (10 g/l) the formation of catheter biofilm by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and proteus mirabilis was prevented. the numbers of enterococcus faecalis and providencia stuartii cells colonizing catheters were also significantly reduced (p<0.05). serratia marcescens, morganella morganii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, however, were able to produce extensive catheter biofilms in the presence of triclosan. only p. mirabilis produced alkaline urine and encrusted the catheters. concentrations of 0.02-0.16 mg/l of the biocide were detected in urine draining from the model over the 48 h experimental period. conclusions: triclosan diffused through silicone catheter balloons and produced urinary concentrations that prevented catheter encrustation by p. mirabilis and biofilm formation by several  other common pathogens of the catheterized urinary tract. it had little effect on urease-producing p. aeruginosa, s. marcescens or m. morganii but these species did not produce alkaline urine or crystalline biofilms.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == antimicrobial spectrum and target site of d-3-phenyllactic acid.
AB  == geotrichum candidum excretes d-3-phenyllactic acid, which inhibits the growth of  listeria monocytogenes. it was found to inhibit a range of gram-positive bacteria found in humans and foodstuffs, such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis, and gram-negative bacteria from humans, such as providencia stuartii and klebsiella oxytoca. scanning electron microscope studies on the effect of d-3-phenyllactic acid on l. monocytogenes showed that it caused changes in bacterial behavior and structure. the bacteria formed aggregates and secreted polysaccharides; their cell walls lost their rigidity, causing the cells to swell. finally the bacteria broke down completely and the cells disintegrate.

TI  == substrate recognition by the leucyl/phenylalanyl-trna-protein transferase. conservation within the enzyme family and localization to the trypsin-resistant domain.
AB  == the leucyl/phenylalanyl-trna-protein transferase (l/f-transferase) from escherichia coli catalyzes a peptidyltransferase reaction that results in the n-terminal aminoacylation of acceptor proteins using leu-, phe-, and met-trnas as amino acid donors. we demonstrated that l/f-transferase homologs are widely distributed throughout the eubacteria, supporting our proposal that the enzyme family is ancient and catalyzes early peptide bond synthesis. however, here we present data suggesting that the l/f-transferase is not a homolog of the peptidyltransferase enzymes involved in cell wall peptidoglycan biosynthesis in gram-positive species, such as staphylococcus aureus. a sequence comparison of the known l/f-transferase homologs began to identify the essential residues required to catalyze a peptidyltransferase reaction and revealed that <20% of the residues were invariant within the l/f-transferase family. despite this sequence  variation, substrate specificity was broadly conserved, and l/f-transferase homologs from providencia stuartii, vibrio cholerae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp. all complemented an e. coli aat mutant (lacking l/f-transferase activity) for the degradation of n-end rule substrates.  in vitro comparison of the most divergent l/f-transferase homologs, from e. coli  and the cyanobacterium synechocystis sp., revealed near-complete conservation of  both substrate specificity and secondary structure. finally, we demonstrated that variants of the e. coli l/f-transferase, lacking either 33 or 78 n-terminal residues, retained measurable peptidyltransferase activity and wild type substrate specificity. overall, our results identified an essential core of an l/f-transferase and revealed that a peptidyltransferase catalyst may be constructed from approximately 120 amino acids.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates to beta-lactam antibiotics from u.s. clinical trials over a 5-year period.
AB  == results are reported for agar dilution susceptibility testing of 3,075 isolates of aerobic bacteria collected from >200 u.s. institutions, located in 30 different states. these isolates were collected from 1987 through 1991 from patients who participated in cefepime clinical trials. cefepime susceptibility was compared with ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefoperazone, and imipenem. to avoid duplication of strains, only initial isolates were included. cefepime minimum inhibitory concentration (mic90) values for enterobacteriaceae were < or = 0.5 microg/ml, except for two species, citrobacter freundii and providencia stuartii, with mic90 values of 2 and 1, respectively. the mic90 values of the other cephalosporins were higher, especially for enterobacter aerogenes and c. freundii. the mic90 values of cefepime for methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (4 microg/ml) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (8 microg/ml) were similar to those of cefotaxime for s. aureus (4 microg/ml), and to ceftazidime for p. aeruginosa (8 microg/ml). streptococcus pneumoniae was similar in susceptibility to cefotaxime at 0.06 microg/ml. the activity of cefepime against a diverse group of gram-positive and gram-negative (1987-1991) bacteria isolates demonstrates the excellent activity of cefepime compared to third-generation cephalosporins and imipenem, particularly among c. freundii and e. aerogenes isolates, which were often resistant to other cephalosporins.

TI  == emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  == we have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. after eight years of use, 97-100% of enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. after six years of use, 94%-100% of enterobacteriaceae (except providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of p. stuartii, a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa declined from 100%  to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. there were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal mic of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/l; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/l decreased from 94% to 64%. imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for p. aeruginosa.

TI  == prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in europe. study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy e. v.
AB  == since 1984, when the first fluoroquinolone, norfloxacin, was marketed in europe,  there has been a marked increase in the usage of this class of drugs. in order to evaluate the influence of this drug usage on the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in clinical isolates of the family enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterococcus faecalis we reviewed the susceptibility data from four collaborative surveys conducted between 1983 and 1990 by the study group 'bacterial resistance' of the paul-ehrlich-society for chemotherapy. all participating laboratories used the same standardized methods. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined by the broth microdilution method. more than 20,000 bacterial strains were tested. the results are presented for ciprofloxacin, which is regarded as the representative of the fluoroquinolones. using > or = 4 mg/l as a breakpoint for resistance to ciprofloxacin, the prevalence of resistant strains of the family enterobacteriaceae in central europe between 1983 and 1990 remained below 1%. in contrast, the resistance rates in p. aeruginosa were 0.7%, 1.0%, 3.8% and 7.0%, in s. aureus 0%, 0.5%, 6.6% and  6.8%, and in e. faecalis 2.2%, 0.7%, 4.9% and 7.7% in 1983, 1986, 1989 and 1990,  respectively. the latest study carried out in cooperation with 78 laboratories from 12 european countries revealed great differences in the prevalence of resistance to fluoroquinolones from one species to another ranging from 0% with proteus vulgaris and salmonella spp. to 26.7% with providencia stuartii.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of biapenem, a new carbapenem antibiotic.
AB  == biapenem is a new carbapenem antibiotic with high stability to human renal dehydropeptidase i. its in vitro activity was compared with that of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, piperacillin and gentamicin against a total  of 650 recent clinical isolates. mics were determined by a standard agar dilution procedure and all isolates were tested at two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu). biapenem inhibited 90% of isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus  mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia stuartii, enterobacter spp., citrobacter freundii, serratia marcescens, salmonella typhi, shigella sonnei and yersinia enterocolitica at < or = 2 mg/l and was as active as or two- to four-fold more active than imipenem against all these species, with the exception of serratia marcescens, against which imipenem was two-fold more active. biapenem was two-fold more active than imipenem against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90 4 mg/l) and had activity similar to that of imipenem against the bacteroides fragilis group (mic90 0.5 mg/l) but was two-fold less active than imipenem against methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90 0.06 mg/l)  and was, like imipenem, inactive against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus.

TI  == [antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime on fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == antimicrobial activity of ceftazidime (caz) was compared with those of other cephem antibiotics against clinically isolated strains sent to us by medical institutions throughout japan in 1989 and 1991. those strains separated and identified from samples collected from patients with various infections were also examined, and the following results were obtained. 1. the results suggested that, compared with reports of studies conducted with clinical isolates in early 1980's, mic90 of caz in 1991 were markedly higher against staphylococcus spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. also, among other bacteria such as providencia rettgeri, providencia stuartii, xanthomonas maltophilia, and bacteroides fragilis group, strains resistant to caz were observed in high proportions. however, large time-course changes were not observed in microbial activities of caz on streptococcus pyogenes, klebsiella spp, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, haemophilus influenzae and anaerobic gpc (gram-positive cocci). 2. among the strains used in the study, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp), cephamycin and oxime type cephem-resistant gram-negative bacilli of enterobacteriaceae and new quinolone-resistant organisms were observed in high proportions. it appears therefore, that caz failed to exert sufficient antimicrobial activities to these  strains because of combination of resistance in these strains. 3. antimicrobial activities of caz on recent clinical isolates showed problems as mentioned above. however, it was also demonstrated that caz maintained effective antimicrobial activities against most of the clinical isolates which could be causative organisms of infectious diseases in the clinical practice. when it is additionally taken into account that caz is one of those limited drugs with activity against p. aeruginosa, and it has excellent permeability through outer membrane, it is concluded that caz still is one of the clinically useful cephem drugs in 1990's.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of sisomicin against fresh clinical isolates].
AB  == to investigate antibacterial activities of sisomicin (siso), mics of siso as well as other aminoglycosides (ags) were determined against many clinical isolates which were obtained in 1991. results are summarized below: 1. no siso-resistant strains were observed among isolates of escherichia coli, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter aerogenes, proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii. 2. in comparison with the results of our previous study against isolates obtained in 1986, the rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) was higher, and siso-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among the mrsa. also, siso-resistant strains of serratia marcescens increased. however, the rate of siso-resistant strains of  pseudomonas aeruginosa decreased, and among citrobacter freundii, enterobacter cloacae and proteus vulgaris, siso-resistant strains did not increase over the years. 3. mics of siso against providencia rettgeri and providencia stuartii were high, suggesting that antibacterial activities of siso was weak against genus providencia. 4. for comparison, according to mics of ofloxacin and imipenem, new  quinolone-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among various organisms, and carbapenem-resistant strains were observed at a high rate among s. marcescens and p. aeruginosa. 5. siso is still one of the useful ags in the 1990's since it  maintains its strong antibacterial activities against most clinical isolates obtained in recent years and its potential as a combination drug with beta-lactams is being reported.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of ru29246, the active metabolite of hr916b.
AB  == hr 916b is a new orally absorbed cephalosporin. in tests its active metabolite, ru29246, inhibited streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae and streptococcus pneumoniae at less than or equal to 0.12 micrograms/ml, which is similar to the antibacterial activity of cefuroxime, and was more active than cefaclor. it was also more active (mic 2 micrograms/ml) than cefixime, cefuroxime, cefaclor and cefotaxime against staphylococci. ru29246 inhibited escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, citrobacter diversus, klebsiella oxytoca, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and salmonella spp. at less than or equal to 1 microgram/ml, thus being more active than cefuroxime and cefaclor,  but was less active than cefixime and cefotaxime. it did not inhibit pseudomonas  aeruginosa and other pseudomonas spp., enterobacter spp., serratia marcescens or  bacteroides fragilis. ru29246 was not hydrolyzed by tem-1, staphylococcus aureus  tem-2 or moraxella catarrhalis beta-lactamases, but was hydrolyzed by tem-3 and the chromosomal beta-lactamases of proteus vulgaris and morganella morganii. plasmid and chromosomal beta-lactamases were inhibited by ru29246.

TI  == bacteremia in a long-term-care facility: a five-year prospective study of 163 consecutive episodes.
AB  == the clinical features, microbiological characteristics, and outcomes of 163 episodes of bacteremia occurring at a long-term-care facility were evaluated. the rate of nosocomial bacteremia increased from 0.20 to 0.36 cases/1,000 patient-days from 1985 to 1989; there was a parallel increase in the rate of all  nosocomial infections combined. bacteremia was documented in 6.5% of all hospital-acquired infections. the majority of isolates were gram-negative, and providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative species. staphylococcus aureus was the most frequent isolate; one-third of s. aureus strains were resistant to methicillin. bacteremia was polymicrobial in 36 episodes (22%), 14 of which involved an enterococcal species. portals of entry included the urinary  tract (55%), the respiratory tract (11%), and soft tissue (9%). overall mortality was 21.5%. death was significantly associated with residence on the intermediate-care unit, the presence of a respiratory infection, a change in mental status, and relatively recent admission. optimal management of bacterial infection in a long-term-care setting requires the availability of blood culture  results. initial decisions about antibiotic therapy should be made in light of the likelihood of infection with multiresistant organisms and of polymicrobial infection.

TI  == in vitro activity of an oxycephem ocp 9-176 compared with its sulfur analog and other beta-lactams.
AB  == ocp 9-176 is an oxycephem antibiotic that contains a 2-aminothiazolyl, carboxypropyl side chain at c-7 and a pyridinium thiomethyl group at c-3. ocp 9-176 was generally twofold less active than its sulfur-containing analog me 1228 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, providencia  stuartii, proteus vulgaris, and serratia marcescens. activity against enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii was equivalent. ocp 9-176 was twofold less active than me-1228 against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter species. activity of the two agents was similar against staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis. although ocp 9-176 inhibited e. coli containing tem-1 and tem-2, it was less active than me-1228. klebsiella organisms with shv-1 and k-2 beta-lactamases were inhibited, but tem-3-containing isolates had mics of 16  micrograms/ml. ocp 9-176 was minimally hydrolyzed by tem-1, pse-1, k-1, and p99,  and it was a poor inhibitor of p99. replacement of sulfur with oxygen does not increase the activity of compounds with sulfopyridinium methyl groups at c-3.

TI  == clinical correlates of bacteremia in a veterans administration extended care facility.
AB  == little is known about bacteremia in long-term care facilities. we have conducted  a retrospective study during a 12-month period analyzing the clinical correlates  of bacteremia in 533 chronically institutionalized, predominantly male patients,  with an average age of 69 years. thirty-four men had forty-two bacteremic illnesses during this period. the incidence rate was 0.30 episodes per 1000 patient care days, and the mortality rate was 21%. the urinary tract was the most frequently identified tissue source (56%), followed by respiratory tract (7%) and skin (7%). providencia stuartii was the most common gram-negative organism, while staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococcus were the frequent gram-positive microbes. gram-negative bacteremia accounted for 63% of the episodes (15% mortality rate), and gram-positive bacteremia accounted for 27% (18% mortality rate); 10% of the bacteremias were polymicrobial (25% mortality rate). most of the isolated organisms were sensitive to available antimicrobial agents. the leading risk factor for bacteremia was an indwelling urinary catheter (odds ratio 39, 95% confidence limits 16 to 97). patients with urinary catheters  at the beginning of the study constituted only 5% of the population, but accounted for 40% of the gram-negative bacteremias during the year of observation.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of amoxycillin/clavulanate (augmentin), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone against hospital strains of gram-negative and -positive bacteria.
AB  == the in vitro antibacterial activities of amoxycillin/clavulanate (augmentin), ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were compared against 330 gram-negative and gram-positive strains isolated from clinical specimens received at the king abdulaziz university hospital (kauh) in saudi arabia. the antibacterial susceptibility was determinated by stokes method and by the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) using an agar dilution method. ceftazidime and ceftriaxone were the most active antibiotics, inhibiting 90% of the tested strains by obtainable serum concentrations. augmentin, on the other hand, had much lower activity against most of the strains tested. ceftazidime's activity was superior  to that of ceftriaxone especially against klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., citrobacter diversus, indole positive proteus, providencia stuartii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus and pseudomonas aeruginosa. ceftriaxone had better activity against serratia orderefera, morganella morganii and staphylococcus aureus. beta-lactamase stable cephalosporins are therefore a potential replacement for aminoglycosides in the antimicrobial therapy of serious gram-negative infections and alternative agents in the treatment of some gram-positive infections.

TI  == in-vitro activity of enoxacin (cl-919), a new quinoline derivative, compared with that of other antimicrobial agents.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of enoxacin (ci-919), a new synthetic quinoline derivative  was compared with that of three other quinolines ofloxacin, norfloxacin and nalidixic acid. in addition beta-lactams and gentamicin were also included when appropriate. the mics of enoxacin for 90% of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., enterobacter spp., proteus spp., providencia stuartii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus were less than 4 mg/l, for haemophilus influenzae less than 0.25 mg/l and neisseria gonorrhoeae less than 0.03 mg/l. bacteroides fragilis and streptococci (including streptococcus pneumoniae) were less susceptible, mic90 16 mg/l. against many of the common enterobacteriaceae enoxacin displayed a similar  degree of activity as gentamicin. gentamicin-resistant strains of common bacterial pathogens were susceptible to enoxacin as were methicillin-resistant staph. aureus. the protein binding of enoxacin (concentration 5 mg/l) was 18%.

TI  == clavulanic acid in combination with ticarcillin: an in-vitro comparison with other beta-lactams.
AB  == the in-vitro activity of ticarcillin in combination with clavulanic acid was compared with that of ticarcillin alone, piperacillin, cefotaxime and, where appropriate, other beta-lactams against a total of 301 recent clinical isolates and characterized beta-lactamase producers. an agar dilution procedure was used to determine mics and two inocula (10(4) and 10(6) cfu) were used throughout. mics of the combination of ticarcillin and clavulanic acid were expressed as mics of ticarcillin in the presence of 5 or 10 mg/l of clavulanic acid. against most members of the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii and serratia marcescens), ticarcillin plus clavulanic acid was as active as or more active than piperacillin. against staphylococcus aureus. haemophilus influenzae and the bacteroides fragilis group  the combination was considerably more active than piperacillin. piperacillin was  more active than the ticarcillin/clavulanic acid combination against pseudomonas  aeruginosa.

TI  == [in vitro bacteriostatic activity of cefmenoxime (sce 1365), cefotaxime and moxalactam].
AB  == the in vitro activity of cefmenoxime (sce 1365), a new cephalosporin derivate was compared with two other "third generation" cephalosporins: cefotaxime and moxalactam. cefmenoxime as cefotaxime and moxalactam were very active against 305 cephalosporinase-producing and cephalosporinase-non-producing enterobacteriaceae. cefmenoxime was the most active against serratia marcescens, citrobacter freundii, morganella morganii, salmonella, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica with a mean mic at least twice lower. several strains of the species hafnia alvei, providencia stuartii and proteus vulgaris were more resistant. against haemophilus influenzae, the activity of the three cephalosporins was higher with  a mean mic between 0,030 and 0,040 microgram/ml. against carbenicillin-sensible or carpenicillin-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter calcoaceticus, the three cephalosporins were not performant. against staphylococcus aureus, cefmenoxime and cefotaxime had an identical activity with a mean mic of 1,5 microgram/ml against methicillin-sensible strains and a mean mic of 5,5 micrograms/ml against methicillin-resistant strains.

TI  == clinical efficacy of cefotaxime in serious infections.
AB  == thirty-five patients underwent 38 treatment courses with cefotaxime. documented infections included 11 bacteremias, 7 cases of nosocomial pneumonia, 6 surgical wound infections, 3 bone infections, 1 biliary infection, and 1 urinary tract infection. granulocytopenic patients with fever received 15 courses of empiric cefotaxime therapy alone; in 8 courses, no definite site of infection or pathogen was isolated. broad-spectrum antibiotics had been administered to 23 patients before cefotaxime. thirty-seven bacterial pathogens were isolated from 25 patients. three such pathogens were resistant to cefotaxime and required alternative therapies. pathogenic isolates included 13 serratia marcescens, 12 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4 escherichia coli, 2 klebsiella pneumoniae, 2 providencia stuartii, 1 enterobacter cloacae, 1 haemophilus influenzae, 1 enterococcus, and 1 staphylococcus aureus. of the treatment courses, 25 of 38 resulted in a favorable response to cefotaxime, including 9 of 15 in granulocytopenic patients. superinfection was seen in one patient. the emergence  of resistance was documented in another patient. of 15 patients with multiply resistant pathogens, 12 improved with cefotaxime. of 12 patients with pseudomonas aeruginosa, 6 favorably responded. possible complications of cefotaxime were observed in 14 of 42 treatment courses. cefotaxime is most useful in treatment of infections due to multiply resistant, gram-negative pathogens other than pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == uk31214, a new aminoglycoside and derivative of kanamycin b.
AB  == the in vitro activity of uk31214, a kanamycin b derivative, was studied against 250 recent isolates and compared with other aminoglycosides. against the enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of proteus mirabilis and providencia stuartii) uk31214 and amikacin had similar degrees of activity (mode minimum inhibitory concentration [mic], 1 microgram/ml). proteus mirabilis and p. stuartii strains were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to amikacin than to uk31214. pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were equally susceptible to both amikacin and uk31214 (mode mic, 4 microgram/ml), but tobramycin was the most active antimicrobial agent tested (mode mic, 0.25 microgram/ml). the gentamicin-resistant strains of p. aeruginosa were equally susceptible to uk31214 and amikacin. strains of staphylococcus aureus were more susceptible to gentamicin or tobramycin than to uk31214 or amikacin (mode mic, 0.5 microgram/ml). a synergistic interaction between uk31214 and carbenicillin was demonstrated.

TI  == comparative activities of the oxa-beta-lactam ly127935, cefotaxime, cefoperazone, cefamandole, and ticarcillin against multiply resistant gram-negative bacilli.
AB  == a total of 91 multiply resistant bacterial strains, including klebsiella pneumoniae (32 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (16 strains), and serratia marcescens (43 strains), were collected during hospital epidemics of nosocomial infection from 1975 to 1979. these strains were resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, chloramphenicol, and ampicillin. their susceptibility to three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams, ly127935 (a 1-oxa-beta-lactam), cefotaxime (hr 756), and cefoperazone (t 1551), was compared with the susceptibility of random strains of nine species of aerobic gram-negative bacilli collected in the  same hospital in 1979. susceptibility to cefamandole and ticarcillin was also determined. strains of staphylococci and streptococci from that hospital and two  nearby city-county hospitals were also compared for the three new cephalosporins  and other effective antibiotics. the agar dilution method was used to measure the minimum inhibitory concentration for each antibiotic. the multiply resistant strains (minimum inhibitory concentration for gentamicin >/= 8 mug/ml) usually were as susceptible to the three new broad-spectrum beta-lactams as were non-multiply resistant strains. both klebsiella pneumoniae and serratia marcescens, including multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains, were most susceptible to the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935 and cefotaxime. p. aeruginosa  (both multiply resistant and non-multiply resistant strains) were most susceptible to cefoperazone. all three new beta-lactams were active against non-multiply resistant strains of escherichia coli, enterobacter spp., proteus spp., and citrobacter spp. providencia stuartii were most susceptible to cefotaxime and the 1-oxa-beta-lactam ly127935. the three new beta-lactams were all less active against staphylococci (especially methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) than cephalothin. streptococcus pyogenes and s. pneumoniae were very susceptible to cefotaxime and cefoperazone, though less susceptible to  ly127935. none of the three new beta-lactams was active against s. faecalis. all  were very active against both penicillinase-positive and -negative strains of neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == comparative bactericidal effect of ceforanide (bl-s 786) and five other cephalosporins in an in vitro pharmacokinetic model.
AB  == the bactericidal activity of ceforanide was compared, in an in vitro kinetic model, with that of five other cephalosproins: cephalothin, cefazolin, cefamandole, cefuroxime, and cefoxitin. cultures of various pathogens in 95% human serum were incubated for 12 hours in the presence of the cephalosporins whose concentrations were modified periodically-by addition of a concentrated solution of drug or dilution with unmedicated serum-in order to simulate the variation of antibiotic concentration in human blood after one-gram intramuscular dose. one gram-positive strain and six gram-negative strains were used. bactericidal activity was assessed by monitoring changes in the number of colony-forming units. tests showed that against klebsiella pneumoniae, ceforanide was the most active of the six cephalosporins. proteus mirabilis was more susceptible to ceforanide and cefuroxime than to the other compounds; enterobacter cloacae to ceforanide, cefuroxime, and cefamandole; escherichia coli to ceforanide, cefuroxime, cefamandole, and cefazolin. the number of viable cells of staphylococcus aureus was reduced below detectable levels by all cephalosporins except cefoxitin. on the other hand, providencia stuartii was virtually unaffected by all of the cephalosporins except cefoxitin.

TI  == hr 756, a highly active cephalosporin: comparison with cefazolin and carbenicillin.
AB  == hr 756, a new parenteral cephalosporin, was compared with cefazolin and carbenicillin for activity against a total of 264 strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, klebsiella spp., proteus mirabilis, proteus spp. (indole positive), enterobacter spp., salmonella typhi, serratia marcescens, providencia stuartii, and staphylococcus aureus. in every comparison, except that with the last organism, hr 756 was clearly more active than cefazolin and carbenicillin. all three compounds had similar activity against penicillin-susceptible staphylococci; against penicillin-resistant strains, hr 756 and cefazolin were equally active and superior to carbenicillin. hr 756 was compared with penicillin for activity against strains of streptococcus pyogenes,  lancefield group d streptococci, and neisseria gonorrhoeae; with ampicillin against haemophilus influenzae; and with cefoxitin against bacteriodes fragilis.  hr 756 was clearly more active than the respective reference compounds in all of  these comparisons, except those involving the streptococci. hr 756 and penicillin were essentially equally active against s. pyogenes; against lancefield group d,  penicillin was 32 times as active as hr 756. hr 756 not only compared favorably with the reference compounds with respect to relative activity, but also effected growth inhibition of essentially all test organisms (p. aeruginosa and group d streptococci excepted) at remarkably low concentrations ranging from 0.015 to 2.0 mug/ml. a series of seven transfers of selected strains of e. coli, klebsiella spp., s. aureus, and p. aeruginosa through medium containing hr 756 led to emergence of strains with significant levels of resistance to the agent. resistance to hr 756 was retained for at least seven transfers through plain medium.

TI  == in vitro studies with sch 21420 and sch 22591: activity in comparison with six other aminoglycosides and synergy with penicillin against enterococci.
AB  == in vitro tests were performed with sch 21420 and sch 22591 to determine (i) their activity in comparison to six other aminoglycosides against 343 clinical isolates, and (ii) whether synergy with penicillin g could be demonstrated with enterococci. in broth dilution tests, sch 22591 was more active than the seven other aminoglycosides against staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, and most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. sch 22591 was as active as tobramycin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. the activity of sch 21420 was comparable to gentamicin, sisomicin, netilmicin, and tobramycin but greater than amikacin or kanamycin against s. aureus and most genera of enterobacteriaceae. sch 21420, amikacin, and kanamycin were (i) more active than the other five aminoglycosides  against proteus rettgeri and providencia stuartii, but (ii) less active than the  other five aminoglycosides against neisseria gonorrhoeae, enterococci, most nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli, proteus mirabilis, and proteus morganii. studies on the bactericidal activity of sch 22591 with penicillin indicated a synergistic interaction against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin and kanamycin. this could be demonstrated with combinations containing 3.0 to 6.0 mug of sch 22591 per ml and was comparable to that observed with penicillin/gentamicin. penicillin plus sch 21420 (25 mug/ml) also demonstrated synergy against enterococci, including strains highly resistant to streptomycin. however, synergy did not occur against strains highly resistant to  kanamycin. these latter results were similar to those obtained in tests with penicillin/kanamycin.

TI  == in vitro activity of bl-s640 against gram-negative bacilli and staphylococcus aureus compared with activity of four other semisynthetic cephalosporins.
AB  == the in vitro activity of bl-s640 (cefatrizine) was determined against 674 recent  clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus and enterobacteriaceae. activity against s. aureus was less than that of cephapirin, cephalothin, and cefazolin, but greater than that of cephalexin. activity against gram-negative isolates was  variable: bl-s640 was slightly less potent than cefazolin against escherichia coli and klebsiella, but more active than the other compounds. as for the more resistant gram-negative genera, bl-s640 was significantly superior to the control cephalosporins. the effect of inoculum size on the antibacterial activity was moderate for most organisms except enterobacter, providencia stuartii, and indole-positive proteus, the median minimal inhibitory concentrations of which were 6 to 27 times lower when determined with a 10(-4)-diluted culture compared with the undiluted one. the stability in aqueous solution at 37 c was remarkably  high at the lower ph values, but low at the neutral point.
