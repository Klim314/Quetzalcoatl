photocatalytic and biocidal activities of novel coating systems of mesoporous and dense tio(2)-anatase containing silver nanoparticles.
here we describe the development of novel nanostructured coating systems with improved photocatalytic and antibacterial activities. these systems comprise a layer of sio2 followed by a layer of mesoporous or dense tio2-anatase, and doping with silver nanoparticles (ag nps). the coatings were synthesized via a sol-gel technique by combining colloidal ag nps with tio2 and sio2 sols. the photocatalytic activity was studied through methyl orange decomposition under uv light. results showed a great increase of photocatalytic activity by ag nps doping. the most active photocatalyst corresponded to the ag-sio2/tio2 mesoporous system, associated with the porosity of the coatings and with the decrease of e-h recombination for the presence of ag nps. all the tio2 coatings showed a strong bactericidal activity against planktonic forms of gram-negative (enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli) and gram-positive (listeria monocytogenes) pathogens, as well as a strong germicidal effect against deadly spores of human gas gangrene- and anthrax-producing bacteria (clostridium perfringens and bacillus anthracis, respectively). the bactericidal and sporocidal activity was improved by doping the coatings with ag nps, even more when nanoparticles were in the outer layer of tio2, because they are more accessible to the environment. the mechanisms responsible for the increase of photocatalytic and bactericidal behaviors related to ag np doping were studied by spectroscopic ellipsometry, uv-vis spectroscopy, photoluminescence and anodic stripping voltammetry. it was found that the separation of the electron-hole pair contributed to the enhancement of photocatalysis, whereas the effect of the local electric field reinforcement was probably present. a possible involvement of a decrease of band-gap energy and dispersion by silver nanoparticles is ruled out. bactericidal efficacy was increased by ag(+) ion release. overall, the results included in this article show that the architecture of the films may tune photocatalytic and bactericidal properties.
multiple effects of escherichia coli nissle 1917 on growth, biofilm formation, and inflammation cytokines profile of clostridium perfringens type a strain cp4.
clostridium perfringens is an important gram-positive pathogen responsible for food poisoning, necrotic enteritis, gas gangrene, and even death. escherichia coli nissle 1917 (ecn) is a well-characterized probiotic strain with demonstrated benefits. in this study, we evaluated the effects of ecn on growth, toxin production, biofilm formation, and inflammatory cytokine responses of c. perfringens. in vitro co-culture experiments demonstrated that ecn inhibited growth, gas production, and toxin production (alpha-toxin and netb) of c. perfringens in a dose-dependent manner. the growth inhibition effect was not observed when c. perfringens was incubated with ecn cell-free supernatants (cfse), suggesting that growth inhibition was caused by nutrition competition during co-incubation. in vitro studies demonstrated that pre-incubation with ecn did not inhibit c. perfringens attachment to caco-2 cells, but did reduce c. perfringens total number, toxin production, and cytotoxicity after 24 h. the similar growth inhibition results were also observed during the formation of c. perfringens biofilm. finally, pre-incubation of ecn with raw264.7 cells significantly decreased the production of inflammatory cytokines caused by the introduction of c. perfringens. our results indicate that ecn can inhibit many of the pathological effects of c. perfringens in vitro conditions.
a retrospective study on the etiological diagnoses of diarrhea in neonatal piglets in ontario, canada, between 2001 and 2010.
laboratory surveillance data from the animal health laboratory, university of guelph, on the etiological diagnoses of neonatal diarrhea in piglets were analyzed to determine the relative importance and trends of different enteric pathogens in ontario. a total of 237 cases, including live and dead 1- to 7-day-old piglets, were submitted for diagnosis of gastrointestinal illness between 2001 and 2010. the combined frequencies for cases of gastrointestinal illness involving escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens type a, rotavirus, and clostridium difficile, either as single pathogens or a complex of pathogens, accounted for 56% of the total cases. in a total of 33% of cases of gastrointestinal illness, an etiological agent was not identified. the frequency of cases diagnosed with enterotoxigenic e. coli was decreased from 2007. cases submitted in 2010 were more likely to be diagnosed with c. perfringens type a compared to cases submitted in 2002 to 2007 (p < 0.05). there was a significant trend for cases submitted in the winter to be diagnosed with c. perfringens type a, enterotoxigenic e. coli, rotavirus, and cystoisospora suis (formerly isospora suis) (p < 0.05). enterotoxigenic e. coli was less likely diagnosed if c. difficile, c. perfringens, or rotavirus were detected (p < 0.05). younger piglets were more likely to be diagnosed with c. perfringens type a (p < 0.05) and c. difficile (p < 0.05) than older piglets. this study shows that e. coli, c. perfringens type a, rotavirus, and c. difficile are enteric pathogens of concern for ontario swine farrowing operations and further research is required to understand the reasons for the cases that are not diagnosed.
bacteriocin production by bifidobacterium spp. a review.
bacteriocins are ribosomally-synthesized antibacterial peptides. these compounds  are produced by a broad variety of different bacteria belonging mainly to the genus bifidobacterium, to which health promoting properties have frequently been attributed. however, despite the fact that the identification of bifidobacterium-associated bacteriocins was first reported in 1980 and that they exhibit antimicrobial activity against pathogenic microorganisms such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, and escherichia coli, relatively little information is still available about the antimicrobial compounds produced by strains of this genus. more detailed understanding of the action mechanisms of these antimicrobials could allow us to determine the extent to which their production contributes to the probiotic properties of specific bifidobacteria strains and, potentially, be of crucial significance for ultimate preservation of functional foods or pharmaceutical applications. here we review what is already known about their structure, classification, mode of action, functionality, immunity, production and purification.
the principal fucosylated oligosaccharides of human milk exhibit prebiotic properties on cultured infant microbiota.
breast-fed infant microbiota is typically rich in bifidobacteria. herein, major human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are assessed for their ability to promote the growth of bifidobacteria and to acidify their environment, key features of prebiotics. during in vitro anaerobic fermentation of infant microbiota, supplementation by hmos significantly decreased the ph even greater than supplementation by fructooligosaccharide (fos), a prebiotic positive control. hmos elevated lactate concentrations, increased the proportion of bifidobacterium spp. in culture, and through their fermentation into organic acids, decreased the proportion of escherichia and clostridium perfringens. three principal components of hmos, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose and 3-fucosyllactose, were consumed in these cultures. these three principal oligosaccharides of human milk were then individually tested as supplements for in vitro growth of four individual representative strains of infant gut microbes. bifidobacterium longum jcm7007 and b. longum atcc15697 efficiently consumed oligosaccharides and produced abundant lactate and short-chain fatty acids, resulting in significant ph reduction. the specificity of fermentation differed by microbe species and strain and by oligosaccharide structure. escherichia coli k12 and c. perfringens did not utilize appreciable fucosylated oligosaccharides, and a typical mixture of organic acid fermentation products inhibited their growth. in summary, 2'-fucosyllactose, lactodifucotetraose, and 3-fucosyllactose, when cultured with b. longum jcm7007 and b. longum atcc15697, exhibit key characteristics of a prebiotic in vitro. if these bifidobacteria are representative of pioneering or keystone species for human microbiota, fucosylated hmos could strongly promote colonization and maintenance of a mutualist symbiotic microbiome. thus, these simple glycans could mediate beneficial effects of human milk on infant health.
temporal flux and spatial dynamics of nutrients, fecal indicators, and zoonotic pathogens in anaerobic swine manure lagoon water.
confined animal feeding operations (cafos) often use anaerobic lagoons for manure treatment. in the usa, swine cafo lagoon water is used for crop irrigation that is regulated by farm-specific nutrient management plans (nmps). implementation of stricter us environmental regulations in 2013 will set soil p limits; impacting land applications of manure and requiring revision of nmps. precise knowledge of lagoon water quality is needed for formulating nmps, for understanding losses of n and c in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, and for understanding risks of environmental contamination by fecal bacteria, including zoonotic pathogens. in this study we determined year-round levels of nutrients and bacteria from swine cafo lagoon water. statistical analysis of data for ph, electrical conductivity (ec), inorganic and organic c, total n, water-soluble and total minerals (ca, cu, fe, k, mg, mn, p, and zn) and bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococci, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter spp., listeria spp., salmonella spp., and staphylococci) showed that all differed significantly by dates of collection. during the irrigation season, levels of total n decreased by half and the n:p ratio changed from 9.7 to 2.8. some seasonal differences were correlated with temperature. total n and inorganic c increased below 19 degrees c, and decreased above 19 degrees c, consistent with summer increases in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions. water-soluble cu, fe, and zn increased with higher summer temperatures while enterococci and zoonotic pathogens (campylobacter, listeria, and salmonella) decreased. although their populations changed seasonally, the zoonotic pathogens were present year-round. increasing levels of e. coli were statistically correlated with increasing ph. differences between depths were also found. organic c, total nutrients (c, ca, cu, fe, mg, mn, n, p, and zn) and c. perfringens were higher in deeper samples, indicating stratification of these parameters. no statistical interactions were found between collection dates and depths.
evaluation of impact of exposure of sudan azo dyes and their metabolites on human intestinal bacteria.
sudan azo dyes are banned for food usage in most countries, but they are illegally used to maintain or enhance the color of food products due to low cost, bright staining, and wide availability of the dyes. in this report, we examined the toxic effects of these azo dyes and their potential reduction metabolites on 11 prevalent human intestinal bacterial strains. among the tested bacteria, cell growth of 2, 3, 5, 5, and 1 strains was inhibited by sudan i, ii, iii, iv, and para red, respectively. at the tested concentration of 100 mum, sudan i and ii inhibited growth of clostridium perfringens and lactobacillus rhamnosus with decrease of growth rates from 14 to 47%. sudan ii also affected growth of enterococcus faecalis. growth of bifidobacterium catenulatum, c. perfringens, e. faecalis, escherichia coli, and peptostreptococcus magnus was affected by sudan iii and iv with decrease in growth rates from 11 to 67%. c. perfringens was the only strain in which growth was affected by para red with 47 and 26% growth decreases at 6 and 10 h, respectively. 1-amino-2-naphthol, a common metabolite of the dyes, was capable of inhibiting growth of most of the tested bacteria with inhibition rates from 8 to 46%. however, the other metabolites of the dyes had no effect on growth of the bacterial strains. the dyes and their metabolites had less effect on cell viability than on cell growth of the tested bacterial strains. clostridium indolis and clostridium ramosum were the only two strains with about a 10 % decrease in cell viability in the presence of sudan azo dyes. the present results suggested that sudan azo dyes and their metabolites potentially affect the human intestinal bacterial ecology by selectively inhibiting some bacterial species, which may have an adverse effect on human health.
longitudinal study of clostridium difficile and antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli in healthy horses in a community setting.
point prevalence studies have reported carriage rates of enteric pathogens in healthy horses, but longitudinal data are lacking. commensal e. coli is an indicator organism to evaluate antimicrobial resistance of enteric bacteria, yet there are limited data for horses. the objectives of this study were to investigate and molecularly characterize isolates of clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens and salmonella, collected sequentially over a one year period, and to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile for e. coli. fecal samples were collected monthly from 25 adult horses for one year. selective cultures were performed for all above bacteria. c. difficile isolates were characterized via pcr toxin gene profiling and ribotyping. broth microdilution was performed to assess antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of e. coli. toxigenic clostridium difficile was isolated from 15/275 (5.45%) samples from 10/25 (40%) horses. four horses were positive at multiple sampling times but different ribotypes were found in three. ribotypes included 078 (n=6), 001 (n=6) and c (n=3). c. perfringens was not isolated, nor was salmonella. e. coli was isolated from 232/300 (77%) fecal samples. resistance to >/= 1 and >/= 3 antimicrobials was present in 31/232 (13.4%) and 6/232 (2.6%) respectively. only two horses shed the same strain of toxigenic c. difficile for more than one month, indicating that shedding is transient. the high number of ribotype 078 is consistent with recent emergence of this strain in the local horse population. the low prevalence of antibiotic resistance in commensal e. coli suggests that healthy horses are not likely a major reservoir of resistance for enteric bacteria.
effects of non-fermented and fermented soybean milk intake on faecal microbiota and faecal metabolites in humans.
the effects of non-fermented soybean milk (nfsm) and fermented soybean milk (fsm) intake on the faecal microbiota and metabolic activities in 10 healthy volunteers were investigated. soybean oligosaccharides, raffinose and stachyose were utilized by bifidobacteria except for bifidobacterium bifidum, but most strains of escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens could not use them. during the dietary administration of fsm, the number of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the faeces increased (p < 0.05), and clostridia decreased (p < 0.05). moreover, the concentrations of faecal sulphide were decreased (p < 0.01) in the intake of fsm. during the dietary administration of nfsm, the number of bifidobacteria tended to increase. these results indicate that the consumption of soybean milk, especially fsm, is related to improvement of the intestinal environment.
antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
a chitosan dextran-based (cd) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. the microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations. in addition, the time-kill efficacy of cd hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. cd hydrogel was found to be effective against staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli, and clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 mg/liter. dextran aldehyde (da) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the cd hydrogel with mbc ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. s. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than e. coli. candida albicans and pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to cd hydrogel and da. scanning and transmission electron microscopy of e. coli and s. aureus incubated with cd hydrogel and da alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. motility and chemotaxis tests showed e. coli to be inhibited when incubated with da. the antibacterial activity of cd hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of gram-positive infections.
[antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 produced by enterococcus faecium strain lwp760].
antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin s760 (enterocin) produced by enterococcusfaecium strain lwp760 was studied. bacteriocin s760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kda and pl of 9.8. enterocin s760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. mics of the bacteriocin s760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for escherichia coli 0157:h117, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae and corynebacterium diphteriae. it is also active against antibioticresistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii (with mics of 0.05-3 mg/l), klebsiella pneumoniae (with mics of 6 mg/l), pseudomonas aeruginosa (with mics of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of candida albicans, candida krusei and aspergillus niger (with mics of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). enterocin s760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
bacterial monocultures, propionate, butyrate and h2o2 modulate the expression, secretion and structure of the fasting-induced adipose factor in gut epithelial cell lines.
previous research showed that an intestinal microbial community represses the fasting-induced adipose factor (fiaf) in the gut epithelium, thereby increasing fat storage in the host. this study was designed to investigate the overall effect of different bacterial species and metabolites on fiaf in intestinal (caco-2, ht-29 and hct-116) and hepatic (hepg2) cancer cell lines. first, we showed that fiaf was present in different isoforms, and secreted as n-glycosylated proteins, exclusively at the basal side of the cell monolayer. second, co-incubation of cell lines with bacterial monocultures and metabolites altered both fiaf production and isoform appearance. propionate and/or butyrate treatment increased fiaf expression and cleavage in all tested cell lines. in contrast, different bacteria induced cell line-specific fiaf modulation. clostridium perfringens induced fiaf isoform changes in caco-2 cells. enterococcus faecalis and bacteroides thetaiotaomicron treatment resulted in cell line-specific fiaf increases, whereas escherichia coli significantly decreased fiaf expression in hct-116 cells. treatment with h(2) o(2) and peroxide-producing e. faecalis strains induced fiaf isoform changes in caco-2 cells. since bacteria and bacterial metabolites alter both fiaf production and isoform appearance, further investigation may reveal an important role for bacteria in fiaf-regulated physiological processes, such as cell differentiation and fat metabolism.
effect of dietary prebiotic supplementation on the performance, intestinal microflora, and immune response of broilers.
this study investigated the effects of dietary supplementation with the prebiotics fructo-oligosaccharide (fos) and mannan-oligosaccharide (mos) on the performance, small intestinal microflora, and immune response of broilers. two hundred forty 1-d-old ross broiler chickens were randomly assigned to 6 dietary treatment groups: control, avilamycin (6 mg/kg), 0.25% fos, 0.5% fos, 0.025% mos, and 0.05% mos. each treatment was fed to 4 replicates of 10 birds per diet for 4 wk. except for the 0.5% fos group, the overall bw gains of birds treated with avilamycin and prebiotics were significantly(p < 0.05) higher than those of the control group. no significant differences were found between the control and supplemented groups in overall feed intake, feed conversion, and mortality. the 0.05% mos group was significantly (p < 0.05) lower than the control and 0.5% fos groups in heterophil:lymphocyte ratio and basophil level. concentrations of plasma iga and igg were not significantly different among the treatment groups. quantitative real-time pcr indicated that supplementation of the diet with avilamycin or prebiotics caused significant (p < 0.05) changes in the small intestinal microbial community, as determined in samples obtained at the ileocecal junction. the populations of clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli decreased with 0.25% fos, 0.05% mos, or avilamycin, and lactobacilli increased in the 0.25% fos and 0.25% mos treatment groups. total bacteria increased in the 0.25% fos and 0.05% mos treatments and decreased in the avilamycin treatment. feeding 0.25% fos and 0.05% mos resulted in an increase in lactobacillus community diversity in the ileum. our results showed that 0.25% fos and 0.05% mos were comparable with avilamycin in improving productivity in broilers raised in wire floor cages up to 28 d of age. plasma immunoglobulins were not affected by prebiotics, but the heterophil:lymphocyte ratio, basophil level, and microbial population in the ileum were significantly affected.
companion animals symposium: microbes and gastrointestinal health of dogs and cats.
recent molecular studies have revealed complex bacterial, fungal, archaeal, and viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. more than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, fusobacteria, and actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. of significance for gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. however, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. specific pathogens (e.g., salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. there is mounting evidence that microbes play an important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). current theories for the development of ibd favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine ibd. commonly observed microbial changes are increased proteobacteria (i.e., escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in clostridium clusters xiva and iv (i.e., lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, faecalibacterium spp.). this would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.
dietary cellulose, fructooligosaccharides, and pectin modify fecal protein catabolites and microbial populations in adult cats.
twelve young adult (1.7 +/- 0.1 yr) male cats were used in a replicated 3 x 3 latin square design to determine the effects of fiber type on nutrient digestibility, fermentative end products, and fecal microbial populations. three diets containing 4% cellulose, fructooligosaccharides (fos), or pectin were evaluated. feces were scored based on the 5-point system: 1 being hard, dry pellets, and 5 being watery liquid that can be poured. no differences were observed (p > 0.100) in intake of dm, om, cp, or acid-hydrolyzed fat; dm or om digestibility; or fecal ph, dm%, output on an as-is or dm basis, or concentrations of histamine or phenylalanine. crude protein and fat digestibility decreased (p = 0.079 and 0.001, respectively) in response to supplementation with pectin compared with cellulose. both fos and pectin supplementation resulted in increased fecal scores (p < 0.001) and concentrations of ammonia (p = 0.003) and 4-methyl phenol (p = 0.003). fecal indole concentrations increased (p = 0.049) when cats were supplemented with fos. fecal acetate (p = 0.030), propionate (p = 0.035), and total short-chain fatty acid (p = 0.016) concentrations increased in pectin-supplemented cats. fecal butyrate (p = 0.010), isobutyrate (p = 0.011), isovalerate (p = 0.012), valerate (p = 0.026), and total branched-chain fatty acids + valerate (p = 0.008) concentrations increased with supplementation of fos and pectin. fecal cadaverine (p < 0.001) and tryptamine (p < 0.001) concentrations increased with supplementation of fos and pectin. fecal tyramine concentrations decreased (p = 0.039) in fos-supplemented cats, whereas spermidine concentrations increased (p < 0.001) in pectin-supplemented cats. whereas fecal concentrations of putrescine (p < 0.001) and total biogenic amines (p < 0.001) increased with fos and pectin, the concentrations of these compounds were increased (p < 0.001) in cats supplemented with pectin. fecal bifidobacterium spp. concentrations increased (p = 0.006) and escherichia coli concentrations decreased (p < 0.001) in fos-supplemented cats. fecal concentrations of clostridium perfringens (p < 0.001), e. coli (p < 0.001), and lactobacillus spp. (p = 0.030) also increased in pectin-supplemented cats. in addition to increasing populations of protein-fermenting microbiota, pectin increased production of fermentative end products associated with carbohydrate compared with protein fermentation. pectin and fos may be useful fiber sources in promoting intestinal health of the cat.
growth-inhibiting activities of phenethyl isothiocyanate and its derivatives against intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activities of sinapis alba l. seed-derived materials were examined on the growth of bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. longum, clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, escherichia coli, lactobacillus acidophilus, and l. casei. the active component of s. alba seeds was purified using silica gel column chromatography and hplc and was identified as phenethyl isothiocyanate by various spectroscopic analyses. the antimicrobial activity of phenethyl isothiocyanate varied according to the dose and bacterial strain tested. phenethyl isothiocyanate strongly inhibited the growth of c. difficile and c. perfringens at 1 mg/disc, and weakly (+) inhibited its growth at 0.1 mg/disc. furthermore, phenethyl isothiocyanate moderately (++) inhibited the growth of e. coli at a dose of 2 mg/disc, but did not inhibit the growth of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli. addition of various functional groups to isothiocyanates resulted in selective inhibitory activity against harmful bacteria with low concentrations of aromatic isothiocyanates demonstrating greater inhibitory activity against clostridia and e. coli than aliphatic isothiocyanates. in conclusion, aromatic isothiocyanates containing phenethyl-, benzyl-, and benzoyl-groups might be useful in the development of novel preventive and therapeutic agents against diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria.
indicator microorganisms and pathogens removal function performed by copepods in  constructed wetlands.
removal efficiency of indicator and pathogenic microorganisms in constructed wetlands were analyzed, and microorganisms removal function performed by copepods was determined. the results showed that the constructed wetlands effectively reduced escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, total coliforms, and fecal coliforms, the salmonella spp. removal efficiency was relatively low and the clostridium perfringens removal was the least. at copepods concentrations of 3.0 x 10(2)/l, and 6.0 x 10(2)/l, high die-off rates were observed for indicator and pathogenic microorganisms compared to the control group, and indicator and pathogenic microorganisms in samples with higher concentration of copepods decreased much more rapidly than those in samples with lower concentration. these results suggest that predation by copepods is an important mechanism for the removal of bacteria in constructed wetlands.
detection and characterization of an abc transporter in clostridium hathewayi.
an abc transporter gene from clostridium hathewayi is characterized. it has duplicated atpase domains in addition to a transmembrane protein. its deduced amino acid sequence has conserved functional domains with atpase components of the multidrug efflux pump genes of several bacteria. cloning this transporter gene into c. perfringens and e. coli resulted in decreased sensitivities of these bacteria to fluoroquinolones. it also decreased the accumulation and increased the efflux of ethidium bromide from cells containing the cloned gene. carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenylhydrazone (cccp) inhibited both accumulation and efflux of ethidium bromide from these cells. the atpase mrna was overexpressed in the fluoroquinolone-resistant strain when exposed to ciprofloxacin. this is the first report of an abc transporter in c. hathewayi.
lactobacillus isolates from weaned piglets' mucosa with inhibitory activity against common porcine pathogens.
twelve lactobacilli isolates from mucosa of 3-5-week-old weaned pigs were found to exert good antimicrobial activity against common porcine pathogens (s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, c. perfringens). two of them produced in addition to lactic acid also considerable amounts of acetic acid, and 6 of them produced hydrogen peroxide and metabolites other than organic acids. isolates 4/26 and 2/25 (identified as l. crispatus or l. amylovorus) were inhibitory against most strains of s. aureus, b. cereus and e. coli, and especially the strain 4/26 survived well in simulated gastric and intestinal juice. diarrhea-causing e. coli o8k88h9 ent(+) was successfully inhibited by the growing culture as well as by the catalase-treated and neutralized supernatant of l. reuteri 12/26. mucin degradation and multiple resistance to antibiotics were not observed.
impact of feed supplementation with antimicrobial agents on growth performance of broiler chickens, clostridium perfringens and enterococcus counts, and antibiotic resistance phenotypes and distribution of antimicrobial resistance determinants in escherichia coli isolates.
the effects of feed supplementation with the approved antimicrobial agents bambermycin, penicillin, salinomycin, and bacitracin or a combination of salinomycin plus bacitracin were evaluated for the incidence and distribution of antibiotic resistance in 197 commensal escherichia coli isolates from broiler chickens over 35 days. all isolates showed some degree of multiple antibiotic resistance. resistance to tetracycline (68.5%), amoxicillin (61.4%), ceftiofur (51.3%), spectinomycin (47.2%), and sulfonamides (42%) was most frequent. the levels of resistance to streptomycin, chloramphenicol, and gentamicin were 33.5, 35.5, and 25.3%, respectively. the overall resistance levels decreased from day 7 to day 35 (p < 0.001). comparing treatments, the levels of resistance to ceftiofur, spectinomycin, and gentamicin (except for resistance to bacitracin treatment) were significantly higher in isolates from chickens receiving feed supplemented with salinomycin than from the other feeds (p < 0.001). using a dna microarray analysis capable of detecting commonly found antimicrobial resistance genes, we characterized 104 tetracycline-resistant e. coli isolates from 7- to 28-day-old chickens fed different growth promoters. results showed a decrease in the incidence of isolates harboring tet(b), bla(tem), suli, and aada and class 1 integron from days 7 to 35 (p < 0.01). of the 84 tetracycline-ceftiofur-resistant e. coli isolates, 76 (90.5%) were positive for bla(cmy-2). the proportions of isolates positive for suli, aada, and integron class 1 were significantly higher in salinomycin-treated chickens than in the control or other treatment groups (p < 0.05). these data demonstrate that multiantibiotic-resistant e. coli isolates can be found in broiler chickens regardless of the antimicrobial growth promoters used. however, the phenotype and the distribution of resistance determinants in e. coli can be modulated by feed supplementation with some of the antimicrobial agents used in broiler chicken production.
a dose-response evaluation of spray-dried yeast cell wall supplementation of diets fed to adult dogs: effects on nutrient digestibility, immune indices, and fecal microbial populations.
the yeast cell wall (ycw) preparation, safmannan, was evaluated as a dietary supplement for adult dogs. using a 5 x 5 latin square design with 14-d periods, adult dogs cannulated in the terminal ileum were supplemented with 0, 0.05, 0.25, 0.45, or 0.65% ycw based on daily food allowance. apparent ileal nutrient digestibility responded cubically (p = 0.07 to 0.10) to ycw supplementation. ileal nutrient digestibility tended (p = 0.09) to be greater with ycw supplementation compared with control. apparent total tract digestibility responded cubically (p < 0.05) to ycw supplementation. total white blood cell and eosinophil counts tended (p < 0.09) to decrease quadratically with ycw supplementation, with the lowest counts at the 0.25% supplementation level, whereas monocyte counts decreased (p < 0.05) linearly with ycw supplementation. serum immunoglobulin a (iga) concentrations tended (p = 0.09) to respond cubically to ycw, with the lowest value at the 0.25% supplementation level. ileal iga tended (p < 0.09) to respond quadratically, with the greatest ileal iga concentration at 0.25% ycw. using serial dilution and plating enumeration techniques, fecal escherichia coli concentrations decreased linearly (p = 0.01) with ycw supplementation, whereas clostridium perfringens responded cubically (p = 0.09). cubic trends were noted for e. coli (p = 0.10) and lactobacilli (p = 0.08) concentrations, as evaluated by quantitative pcr analysis. total fecal dna was most similar to the control treatment at 0.25% ycw. although the effects on immunological indices appear limited, our results suggest that ycw supplementation in dogs at less than 1% may affect ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, and the colonization of the gut by e. coli may be decreased.
application of real-time quantitative pcr for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using taqman(r) real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr). thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, e. coli o157:h7, helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella sp., and staphylococcus aureus. the sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic dna (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using a. hydrophila purified dna. samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. in duplicate samples, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, c. perfringens and e. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. this qpcr method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the environment canada guidelines.
growth-inhibiting activity of active component isolated from terminalia chebula fruits against intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibitory activity of materials derived from the fruit of terminalia  chebula was evaluated against six intestinal bacteria by means of an impregnated paper disk agar diffusion method. the butanol fraction of t. chebula extract had profound growth-inhibitory activity at a concentration of 5 mg per disk. the biologically active component isolated from the t. chebula fruits was identified with a variety of spectroscopic analyses as ethanedioic acid. the growth responses varied in accordance with the bacterial strain, chemical, and dosage tested. in a test with concentrations of 2 and 1 mg per disk, ethanedioic acid had strong and moderate inhibitory activity against clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli, respectively, with no associated adverse effects on the growth of the four tested lactic acid-producing bacteria. ellagic acid derived from t. chebula fruits exerted a potent inhibitory effect against c. perfringens and e. coli, but little or no inhibition was observed with treatments of behenic acid, p-caryophyllene, eugenol, isoquercitrin, oleic acid, ca-phellandrene, 3-sitosterol, stearic acid, a-terpinene, terpinen-4-ol, terpinolene, or triacontanoic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological properties of t. chebula fruits.
comparison of the concentrations of phenolic compounds in olive oils and other plant oils: correlation with antimicrobial activity.
the antimicrobial activity of different edible vegetable oils was studied. in vitro results revealed that the oils from olive fruits had a strong bactericidal action against a broad spectrum of microorganisms, this effect being higher in general against gram-positive than gram-negative bacteria. thus, olive oils showed bactericidal activity not only against harmful bacteria of the intestinal microbiota (clostridium perfringens and escherichia coli) also against beneficial microorganisms such as lactobacillus acidophilus and bifidobacterium bifidum. otherwise, most of the foodborne pathogens tested (listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica, yersinia sp., and shigella sonnei) did not survive after 1 h of contact with olive oils. the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl oleuropein and ligstroside aglycons, hydroxytyrosol and tyrosol, were the phenolic compounds that statistically correlated with bacterial survival. these findings were confirmed by testing each individual phenolic compound, isolated by hplc, against l. monocytogenes. in particular, the dialdehydic form of decarboxymethyl ligstroside aglycon showed a potent antimicrobial activity. these results indicate that not all oils classified as "olive oil" had similar bactericidal effects and that this bioactivity depended on their content of certain phenolic compounds.
synergy in polymicrobial infections in a mouse model of type 2 diabetes.
human diabetics frequently suffer delayed wound healing, increased susceptibility to localized and systemic infections, and limb amputations as a consequence of the disease. lower-limb infections in diabetic patients are most often polymicrobial, involving mixtures of aerobic, facultative anaerobic, and anaerobic bacteria. the purpose of this study is to determine if these organisms contribute to synergy in polymicrobial infections by using diabetic mice as an in vivo model. the model was the obese diabetic mouse strain bks.cg-m +/+ lepr(db)/j, a model of human type 2 diabetes. young (5- to 6-week-old) prediabetic mice and aged (23- to 24-week-old) diabetic mice were compared. the mice were injected subcutaneously with mixed cultures containing escherichia coli, bacteroides fragilis, and clostridium perfringens. progression of the infection (usually abscess formation) was monitored by examining mice for bacterial populations and numbers of white blood cells at 1, 8, and 22 days postinfection. synergy in the mixed infections was defined as a statistically significant increase in the number of bacteria at the site of injection when coinfected with a second bacterium, compared to when the bacterium was inoculated alone. e. coli provided strong synergy to b. fragilis but not to c. perfringens. c. perfringens and b. fragilis provided moderate synergy to each other but only in young mice. b. fragilis was anergistic (antagonistic) to e. coli in coinfections in young mice at 22 days postinfection. when age-matched nondiabetic mice (c57blks/j) were used as controls, the diabetic mice exhibited 5 to 35 times the number of cfu as did the nondiabetic mice, indicating that diabetes was a significant factor in the severity of the polymicrobial infections.
decrease of enteric micro-organisms from rural sewage sludge during their composting in straw mixture.
aims: to study the decrease of enteric micro-organisms including viable nematode  eggs, enteroviruses, faecal indicators (escherichia coli and enterococci) and pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella sp. and clostridium perfringens) of a rural sewage sludge when it is composted for 7 months in mixture with straw. methods and results: numbers of the test organisms and the physico-chemical parameters were measured on a monthly basis on the mixture, on the compost after being turned, and on the pile in three positions representing the part by which air is incoming, the bottom of the pile and the part through which air is outgoing. the lowest temperature in the pile was observed at the bottom, where it did not exceed 50 degrees c against 66 degrees c in the two other areas. there were no significant differences between the three areas in terms of micro-organism survival. infectious enteroviruses were inactivated rapidly and were not found after the first turning whereas some genomes were detected until after the third turning. escherichia coli and enterococci presented a similar survival rate and their number decreased by 4 log(10) whereas salmonella decayed at a greater rate than l. monocytogenes. the numbers of c. perfringens decreased gradually to reach a final concentration in the mature compost of about 10(2) cfu g(-1) dry matter (d.m.), which was similar to that of the faecal indicators. conclusions: the hygienic effect of sludge composting in mixture with straw results in a significant reduction of enteric micro-organisms, the concentration of the faecal indicators in the final product being < 64 most probable number g(-1) d.m. the concentrations of salmonella, enteroviruses and viable nematode eggs in the final product were not detectable which is in accordance with the french legislation. significance and impact of the study: the results which pointed out the different behaviour of the test micro-organisms reflect the difficulty to propose a relevant indicator of hygienization. otherwise, they show that composting is an efficient means for hygienization of sludge of rural wastewater treatment, where the straw is available close to their place of production.
[search of promising strains of bifidobacteria and lactobacillus for the development of new biopreparations].
for the first time the species composition of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in  clinically healthy young children has been studied. as revealed in this study, the dominating species of bifidobacteria are b. longum, b. adolescentis and b. infantis, while the dominating species of lactobacilli are lactobacillus acidophilus and l. rhamnosus. in 83 isolated cultures of bifidobacteria and 34 isolated species of lactobacilli the activity of acid formation and the antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, clostridium perfringens have been tested. b. longum strain 58b, b. infantis strain 37b, l. rhamnosus strain 12l and l. acidophilus strain 27l, typical for children of this age group, having good antagonistic activity and pronounced acid-forming properties, have been selected. these strains hold good promise to be used as the basis for the development of a complex probiotic preparation for correcting intestinal microflora in young children.
growth-inhibiting effects of seco-tanapartholides identified in artemisia princeps var. orientalis whole plant on human intestinal bacteria.
aims: the present work aimed at isolating antibacterial constituents from the whole plant of artemisia princeps var. orientalis active towards nine human intestinal bacteria. methods and results: the growth-inhibiting activities of materials derived from the artemisia whole plant towards test bacteria were examined using an impregnated paper disc method. the biologically active constituents of the artemisia whole plant were characterized as the sesquiterpene lactones seco-tanapartholides a and b by spectroscopic analysis. in a test using 1 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b produced a clear inhibitory effect against clostridium perfringens, bacteroides fragilis and staphylococcus aureus. these compounds did not affect the growth of test lactic acid-producing bacteria (bifidobacterium adolescentis, bif. breve, lactobacillus acidophilus and lact. casei) and escherichia coli, whereas weak growth inhibition towards bif. bifidum was observed. at 0.5 mg per disc, seco-tanapartholides a and b exhibited moderate growth inhibition towards cl. perfringens but weak growth inhibition towards bact. fragilis and staph. aureus. conclusions: inhibitory action of seco-tanapartholides a and b towards specific bacteria without any adverse effects on lactic acid-producing bacteria may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of a. princeps var. orientalis whole plant. significance and impact of the study: these naturally occurring artemisia whole plant-derived materials could be useful as a new preventive agent against various diseases caused by harmful intestinal bacteria such as clostridia.
effects of gamma ray and electron-beam irradiations on survival of anaerobic and  facultatively anaerobic bacteria.
an extension of the approval for food irradiation is desired due to the increase  in the incidence of food poisoning in the world. one anaerobic (clostridium perfringens) and four facultatively anaerobic (bacillus cereus, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enteritidis) bacteria irradiated with gamma ray or electron beam (e-beam) were tested in terms of survival on agar under packaging atmosphere. using pouch pack, effects of two irradiations on survival of anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria were evaluated comparatively. e-beam irradiation was more effective than gamma ray irradiation in decreasing the d10 value of b. cereus at 4 degrees c, slightly more effective in that of e. coli o157, and similarly effective in that of the other three bacteria at 4 degrees c. the gamma irradiation of the bacteria without incubation at 4 degrees c before irradiation was more effective than that of the bacteria with incubation overnight at 4 degrees c before irradiation in decreasing the d10 values of these bacteria (b. cereus, e. coli o157, and l. monocytogenes). furthermore, ground beef patties inoculated with bacteria were irradiated with 1 kgy by e-beam (5 mev) at 4 degrees c. the inoculated bacteria in the 1-9 mm beef patties were killed by 1 kgy e-beam irradiation and some bacteria in more than 9 mm beef patties were not killed by the irradiation.
viability of clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes surviving mild heat or aqueous ozone treatment on beef followed by heat, alkali, or salt stress.
the threat of pathogen survival following ozone treatment of meat necessitates careful evaluation of the microorganisms surviving under such circumstances. the objective of this study was to determine whether sublethal aqueous ozone treatment (3 ppm of o3 for 5 min) of microorganisms on beef surfaces would result in increased or decreased survival with respect to subsequent heat, alkali, or nacl stress. a mild heat treatment (55 degrees c for 30 min) was used for comparison. reductions in three-strain cocktails of clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes on beef following the heat treatment were 0.14, 0.77, and 1.47 log10 cfu/g, respectively, whereas reductions following ozone treatment were 1.28, 0.85, and 1.09 log10 cfu/g, respectively. c. perfringens cells exhibited elevated heat resistance at 60 degrees c (d60 [time at 60 degrees c required to reduce the viable cell population by 1 log10 units or 90%] = 17.76 min) following heat treatment of beef (55 degrees c for 30 min) but exhibited reduced viability at 60 degrees c following ozone treatment (d60 = 7.64 min) compared with the viability of untreated control cells (d60 = 13.84 min). the d60-values for l. monocytogenes and e. coli o157:h7 following heat and ozone exposures were not significantly different (p > 0.05). c. perfringens cells that survived ozone treatment did not exhibit increased resistance to ph (ph 6 to 12) relative to non-ozone-treated cells when grown at 37 degrees c for 24 h. the heat treatment also resulted in decreased numbers of surviving cells above and below neutral ph values for both e. coli o157:h7 and l. monocytogenes relative to those of non-heat-treated cells grown at 37 degrees c for 24 h. there were significant differences (p < 0.05) in c. perfringens reductions with increasing nacl concentrations. the effects of nacl were less apparent for e. coli and l. monocytogenes survivors. it is concluded that pathogens surviving ozone treatment of beef are less likely to endanger food safety than are those surviving sublethal heat treatments.
antimicrobial activity of ayurvedic tablet "hadrabi".
the ethanolic extract of "hadrabi" powder was tested for antimicrobial activites  against gram positive organisms-staphylococus aureus, bacillus subtilis, clostridium perfringens and gram negative organisms-pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella paratyphi -b, escherichia coli & klebsiella pneumoniae significant antimicrobial activity of the extract was found in this study at the dose of 1250 mg.
selective responses of three ginkgo biloba leaf-derived constituents on human intestinal bacteria.
the selective responses of ginkgo biloba leaf-derived materials against six intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared with that of bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, and quercetin. the components of g. biloba leaves were characterized as kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside), kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside, and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) by spectroscopic analysis. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. at 2 mg/disk, kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) and quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) revealed potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside showed a clear inhibitory effect on escherichia coli. at 0.5 mg/disk, quercetin 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) showed a strong activity against c. perfringens, but weak activity was exhibited by kaempferol 3-o-alpha-(6' "-p-coumaroylglucosyl-beta-1,4-rhamnoside) against c. perfringens and kaempferol 3-o-(2' '-o-beta-d-glucopyranosyl)-alpha-l-rhamnopyranoside against e. coli. no inhibition was observed from treatments conducted with bilobalide, ginkgolides a and b, kaempferol, or quercetin. furthermore, these isolated compounds did not inhibit bifidobacterium bifidum, b. longum, b. adolescentis, or lactobacillus acidophilus.
selective growth inhibitor toward human intestinal bacteria derived from pulsatilla cernua root.
among 21 medicinal plants, the growth-inhibiting activity of pulsatilla cernua root-derived materials toward human intestinal bacteria was examined by using an impregnated paper disk method. the biologically active components of p. cernua roots were characterized as 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid and 3,4-dihydroxycinnamic acid by spectroscopic analysis. the activity was compared with that of six commercially available cinnamic acid derivatives trans-cinnamaldehyde, trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. the growth responses varied with each bacterial strain tested. two isolated compounds revealed a potent inhibition against clostridium perfringens, and moderate to weak activity against escherichia coli was exhibited by 4-hydroxy-3-methoxycinnamic acid. weak or no inhibitory activity was obtained against the bifidobacteria or lactobacillus acidophilus. the inhibitory effect was much more pronounced in c. perfringens and e. coli as compared to b. adolescentis, b. bifidum, b. fragilis, b. longum, or l. acidophilus. cinnamaldehyde exhibited a strong growth-inhibiting activity, but no inhibition was observed from treatments with trans-cinnamic acid, cinnamyl alcohol, 2-methoxycinnamic acid, 3-methoxycinnamic acid, and 4-methoxycinnamic acid. these results may be an indication of at least one of the pharmacological actions of p. cernua root.
improved agar diffusion method for detecting residual antimicrobial agents.
the improved agar diffusion method for determination of residual antimicrobial agents was investigated, and the sensitivities of various combinations of test organisms and assay media were determined using 7 organisms, 5 media, and 31 antimicrobial agents. bacillus stearothermophilus and synthetic assay medium (sam) showed the greatest sensitivity for screening penicillins (penicillin g and ampicillin). the combination of bacillus subtilis and minimum medium (mm) was the most sensitive for tetracyclines (oxytetracycline and chlortetracycline), b. stearothermophilus and sam or micrococcus luteus and mueller-hinton agar (mha) for detecting tylosin and erythromycin, b. subtilis and mha for aminoglycosides (streptomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and dihydrostreptomycin), b. stearothermophilus and sam for polyethers (salinomycin and lasalocid), and b. subtilis and mm or clostridium perfringens and gam for polypeptides (thiopeptin, enramycin, virginiamycin, and bacitracin). however, gram-negative bacterium escherichia coli atcc 27166 and mm were better for screening for colistin and polymixin-b. for detecting the synthetic drugs tested, the best combination was b. subtilis and mm for sulfonamides, e. coli 27166 and mm for quinolones (oxolinic acid and nalidixic acid), b. subtilis and mm for furans (furazolidone), and the bioluminescent bacterium photobacterium phosphoreum and luminescence assay medium for chloramphenicol and oxolinic acid. the results showed that the use of four assay plates, b. stearothermophilus and sam, b. subtilis and mm, m. luteus and mha, and e. coli 27166 and mm, was superior to the currently available techniques for screening for residual antimicrobial agents in edible animal tissues.
enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against ent. faecalis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lact. sake, listeria innocua, propionibacterium acidipropionici, propionibacterium sp., clostridium perfringens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella typhimurium. one of the four pathogenic strains of escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. no antimicrobial activity was recorded against bacillus cereus, cl. sporogenes, cl. tyrobutyricum, leuconostoc cremoris, pediococcus pentosaceus, staphylococcus carnosus and streptococcus thermophilus. enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to proteinase k, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees c for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a ph of 1.0-5.0 and ph 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 au ml-1, but increased further to 1600 au ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. the peptide is approximately 3.4 kda in size, as determined after partial purification with amberlite xad-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. the mechanism of antimicrobial activity against lact. sake lmg 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
non-digestible oligosaccharides used as prebiotic agents: mode of production and  beneficial effects on animal and human health.
prebiotic agents are food ingredients that are potentially beneficial to the health of consumers. the main commercial prebiotic agents consist of oligosaccharides and dietary fibres (mainly inulin). they are essentially obtained by one of three processes: 1) the direct extraction of natural polysaccharides from plants; 2) the controlled hydrolysis of such natural polysaccharides; 3) enzymatic synthesis, using hydrolases and/or glycosyl transferases. both of these enzyme types catalyse transglycosylation reactions, allowing synthesis of small molecular weight synthetic oligosaccharides from mono- and disaccharides. presently, in europe, inulin-type fructans, characterised by the presence of fructosyl units bound to the beta-2,1 position of sucrose, are considered as one of the carbohydrate prebiotic references. prebiotics escape enzymatic digestion in the upper gastrointestinal tract and enter the caecum without change to their structure. none are excreted in the stools, indicating that they are fermented by colonic flora so as to give a mixture of short-chain fatty acids (acetate, propionate and butyrate), l-lactate, carbon dioxide and hydrogen. by stimulating bifidobacteria, they may have the following implications for health: 1) potential protective effects against colorectal cancer and infectious bowel diseases by inhibiting putrefactive bacteria (clostridium perfringens ) and pathogen bacteria (escherichia coli, salmonella, listeria and shigella ), respectively; 2) improvement of glucid and lipid metabolisms; 3) fibre-like properties by decreasing the renal nitrogen excretion; 4) improvement in the bioavailability of essential minerals; and 5) low cariogenic factor. these potential beneficial effects have been largely studied in animals but have not really been proven in humans. the development of a second generation of oligosaccharides and the putative implication of a complex bacterial trophic chain in the intestinal prebiotic fermentation process are also discussed.
growth-inhibiting effects of coptis japonica root-derived isoquinoline alkaloids  on human intestinal bacteria.
the growth-inhibiting activity of coptis japonica (makino) root-derived materials toward eight human intestinal bacteria was examined using an impregnated paper disk method and compared to that of four commercially available isoquinoline alkaloids [berberine sulfate (bs), berberine iodide (bi), palmatine chloride (pc), and palmatine sulfate(ps)], as well as that of thea sinensis leaf-derived epigallocatechin gallate (egcg). the biologically active constituents of the coptis extract were characterized as the isoquinoline alkaloids berberine chloride (bc), palmatine iodide (pi), and coptisine chloride (cc) by spectral analysis. the growth responses varied with both chemical and bacterial strain used. in a test using 500 microg/disk, bc and pi produced a clear inhibitory effect against bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium bifidum, clostridium perfringens, and clostridium paraputrificum, whereas weak or no inhibition was observed in bifidobacterium adolescentis, lactobacillus acidophilus, lactobacillus casei, and escherichia coli. at 1000 microg/ disk, cc revealed weak or no growth inhibition toward all test bacteria, whereas egcg exhibited weak growth inhibition against only c. perfringens and c. paraputrificum. among various isoquinoline alkaloids, bc exhibited more potent inhibitory activity toward c. perfringens than bi and bs, whereas the inhibitory effect was more pronounced in pi compared to pc and ps. the coptis root-derived materials did not promote growth of b. longum and c. perfringens.
reversal of tetracycline resistance mediated by different bacterial tetracycline  resistance determinants by an inhibitor of the tet(b) antiport protein.
active efflux is a useful strategy by which bacteria evade growth inhibition by antibiotics. certain semisynthetic tetracycline (tc) analogs, substituted at the 13th carbon at c-6 on ring c of the tc molecule, blocked tc efflux as revealed in everted membrane vesicles from class b tc-resistant (tcr) escherichia coli (m. l. nelson, b. h. park, j. s. andrews, v. a. georgian, r. c. thomas, and s. b. levy, j. med. chem. 36:370-377, 1993). a representative c-13-substituted analog, 13-cyclopentylthio-5-oh-tc (13-cptc), was shown to competitively inhibit tc translocation by the tet(b) protein, blocking the uptake of tc into vesicles and therefore the efflux of tc from whole cells. against tcr e. coli, 13-cptc, when used in combination with doxycycline, produced synergistic inhibition of growth. 13-cptc was shown to increase the uptake of [3h]tc into the resistant cells. 13-cptc alone was a potent growth inhibitor against tc-susceptible (tcs) and tcr staphylococcus aureus and enterococci specifying class k or class l efflux-dependent tc resistance mechanisms or, unexpectedly, the class m ribosomal protection mechanism. these findings indicate that derivatives of tc, identified by their ability to block the tet(b) efflux protein, can restore tc activity against tcr bacteria bearing either of the two known resistance mechanisms. blocking drug efflux and increasing intracellular drug concentrations constitute an effective approach to reversing tc resistance and may be generally applicable to other antibiotics rendered ineffective by efflux proteins.
the effect of in vitro bacterial association on virulence of entamoeba histolytica.
when trophozoites of axenic e. histolytica strains nih : 200 were associated in vitro with escherichia coli k12 for three hours at 37 degrees c, the virulence was enhanced as shown by increased cytopathogenicity to baby hamster kidney (bhk) cell monolayer. further, the trophozoites were observed to adhere to the polystyrene surface, a hitherto unreported phenomenon. the co-association of e. histolytica trophozoites with bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens for three hours duration at 37 degrees c neither led to increase in cytotoxicity potential nor to adherence phenomenon; in contrast significant inhibition of cytotoxicity was observed. we have thus shown that while co-association of e. histolytica (nih : 200) with e. coli k12 leads to enhanced amoebic virulence, that with anaerobic bacteric leads to its inhibition.
development of selected faecal microfloras and of phagocytic and killing capacity of neutrophils in young pigs.
nine healthy piglets, weaned at the age of 35 days and emanating from two litters, were studied from 7 to 63 days of age. the development of their faecal flora was analysed by bacteriological quantification of coliforms, e. coli, enterococci and clostridium perfringens. the numbers of coliforms, e. coli and enterococci decreased from about 10(8) cfu/g faeces on day 7 to about 10(5) at the end of the study. clostridium perfringens, with an initial value of 10(4) cfu/g faeces, was not found in any faecal sample from day 21 onwards. at each sampling occasion the similarity between the floras of different pigs were investigated by biochemical fingerprinting and calculated as correlation coefficients between metabolic fingerprints. this was performed for the coliform and the enterococcal floras. initially, the coliform floras had a low homogeneity (rmean = 0.6), indicating large initial differences between the piglets. from day 14 post-partum until weaning the homogeneity was stable at a high level (rmean = 0.9). on day 3 post-weaning a marked decrease of the homogeneity was seen (rmean = 0.5), which later returned to the level before weaning. the enterococcal floras had a high homogeneity (rmean = 0.8-0.9) through the study and was only slightly affected by weaning. the function and development of the phagocytic and killing capacity of neutrophil granulocytes was monitored by flow cytometry and chemiluminescence. no changes in these functions were seen over time or between litters.
safe poultry meat production in the next century.
the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level. in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.
growth inhibition of clostridium difficile by intestinal flora of infant faeces in continuous flow culture.
growth of clostridium difficile was inhibited more strongly in continuous flow (cf) culture with c. difficile-negative faeces of infants than with c. difficile-positive faeces. culture of faecal flora of infants yielded a greater variety of bacterial species in c. difficile-negative than in c. difficile-positive faeces. in the mixed cf culture of c. difficile with enterococcus avium, bacteroides distasonis, eubacterium lentum, c. ramosum, c. perfringens and either escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from c. difficile-negative faeces, inhibition of growth of c. difficile was demonstrated when the ph of the culture medium was decreased. amino-acid analysis of cf cultures showed considerable utilisation of aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine. a marked increase in concentrations of citrulline and ornithine was found in the culture that inhibited growth of c. difficile. the addition of citrulline and ornithine into a gifu anaerobic medium (gam) broth produced no inhibition of growth of c. difficile. the addition of the mixture of the depleted amino acids (aspartic acid, serine, threonine, arginine and asparagine) to the culture filtrate or adjustment of the ph of the culture filtrate induced considerable growth of c. difficile. these results suggest that the inhibition of growth of c. difficile may be due to consumption of amino acids by intestinal flora, and not to the presence of inhibitors produced by the intestinal flora.
sequential study of bacterial antibody levels and faecal flora in rheumatoid arthritis patients taking sulphasalazine.
faecal and serum samples were collected from 31 patients with active ra during treatment with dmard sulphasalazine (sasp). these were examined for changes in faecal flora and antibodies to bacterial antigens respectively. faecal counts of clostridium perfrigens but not escherichia coli or total aerobic or anaerobic counts fell significantly after 2 weeks of treatment, this decrease being maintained throughout the treatment period. there was, however, no relationship between changes in the faecal carriage of this micro-organism and response to drug treatment, as assessed using clinical and biochemical indicators of disease activity. changes in antibody levels to antigen preparations of this organism were also unrelated to response to drug treatment. these results suggest that the anti-rheumatic properties of sasp are independent of its antibacterial effect on bacteria in the bowel and also that neither faecal carriage of, nor antibody responses to this bacterium are involved in disease pathogenesis. antibody levels to an antigen preparation of cl. perfringens were found to be significantly lower in those patients who respond well to sasp than those patients who show poor response; this may prove useful as a clinical marker for predicting those patients likely to respond to sasp therapy.
localization of the receptor-binding region of clostridium perfringens enterotoxin utilizing cloned toxin fragments and synthetic peptides. the 30 c-terminal amino acids define a functional binding region.
in this study a short sequence encoding the receptor-binding activity of the much larger 35-kda enterotoxin elaborated by clostridium perfringens was localized by recombinant dna techniques. defined fragments corresponding to portions of the enterotoxin gene were cloned into an escherichia coli expression vector system, and these lysates were analyzed for their ability to compete for binding with native c. perfringens enterotoxin (cpe). the lysate containing cpe290-319 (cpe sequence encompassing residues 290-319) was shown to compete with 125i-cpe for specific binding sites on rabbit intestinal brush border membranes. to confirm this finding, a peptide corresponding to the cpe amino acid sequence 290-319 was synthesized and found to completely block cpe specific binding. to demonstrate directly that cpe290-319 can act as a competitive antagonist of cpe cytotoxicity for physiologic receptors, vero cells were preincubated with either e. coli lysates containing cpe290-319 or the synthetic peptide corresponding to this sequence. preincubation of vero cells with either the lysate or the peptide completely protected these cells from cpe challenge. this information localizes the c-terminal 30 residues of cpe (cpe290-319) as a linear sequence sufficient for recognition and binding to the eukaryotic cpe receptor.
pore-forming toxins: experiments with s. aureus alpha-toxin, c. perfringens theta-toxin and e. coli haemolysin in lipid bilayers, liposomes and intact cells.
three quite different bacterial toxins (s. aureus alpha-toxin, c. perfringens theta-toxin and e. coli haemolysin) induce the leakage of phosphorylated metabolites from lettre cells and of calcein from liposomes; in each case leakage is inhibited by zn2+ greater than ca2+ greater than mg2+. inhibition is not due to displacement of toxin from the membrane, since divalent cations inhibit leakage through pre-formed pores. electrical conductivity across phospholipid bilayers is induced by each of the three toxins; in each case the probability of channels being in the open state is reduced by divalent cations. although the pores induced in phospholipid bilayers and liposomes vary greatly in size (theta-toxin much greater than haemolysin greater than alpha-toxin), in lettre cells the lesions appear more uniform, suggestive of a limiting effect in cells.
the antibody response of normal mice to immunization with single-stranded dna of  various species origin.
to further assess the mechanism for the induction of anti-dna antibodies, the response of balb/c mice to immunization with single-stranded dna of various species origin was determined. anti-dna levels of mice immunized with escherichia coli dna as complexes with methylated bsa in adjuvant were significantly greater by elisa than those from mice immunized similarly with calf thymus dna. furthermore, comparison of the responses of mice immunized with complexes of dna from calf thymus, chicken blood, clostridium perfringens, e. coli, human placenta, or salmon testes indicated that the bacterial dnas induced the highest antibody levels. the antibody response to e. coli dna was shown by inhibition elisa to have two populations, one binding unique determinants in e. coli dna and the other cross-reactive with determinants expressed on all dnas tested. these results indicate that dna molecules, when complexed to a protein carrier, differ in their immunogenic potential, likely because of the presence of unique sequences or structures rarely presented by mammalian host dna.
inhibition of n-acetylneuraminate lyase by n-acetyl-4-oxo-d-neuraminic acid.
we show that the 4-oxo analogue of n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid strongly inhibits n-acetylneuraminate lyase (neuac aldolase, ec 4.1.3.3) from clostridum perfringens (ki = 0.025 mm) and escherichia coli (ki = 0.15 mm). in each case the inhibition was competitive. n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid; n-acetylneuraminate lyase; n-acetyl-d-neuraminic acid analog; 5-acetamido-3,5-dideoxy-beta-d-manno-non-2,4-diulosonic acid; 2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-n-acetyl-4-oxo-neuraminic acid; competitive inhibitor.
characterization of a bacteriocinogenic plasmid from clostridium perfringens and  molecular genetic analysis of the bacteriocin-encoding gene.
the bacteriocinogenic plasmid pip404 from clostridium perfringens was isolated and cloned in escherichia coli, and its physical map was deduced. expression of the bcn gene, encoding bacteriocin bcn5, is inducible by uv irradiation of c. perfringens and thus resembles the sos-regulated bacteriocin genes of enteric bacteria. the location of bcn on pip404 was established by a dot-blot procedure, using specific hybridization probes to analyze mrna samples from induced and uninduced cultures. from the nucleotide sequence of its gene, the molecular weight of bcn5 was deduced to be 96,591, and a protein of this size was secreted by bacteriocin-producing cultures of c. perfringens. the primary structure of the protein suggests that it may function as an ionophore, since a hydrophobic domain, resembling those of the ionophoric colicins, is present at the cooh terminus. no bacteriocin activity could be detected in e. coli harboring plasmids bearing the bcn gene, even when the transcriptional and translational signals were replaced by those of lacz. a possible explanation may be found in the unusual codon usage of the adenine-thymine-rich bcn gene, as this shows a preference for codons with a high adenine-plus-thymine content, especially in the wobble position. many of the frequently used codons correspond to those recognized by minor trna species in e. coli. consequently, bcn expression might be limited by trna availability in this bacterium.
in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141, a new semisynthetic cephamycin, compared with those of five cephalosporins.
the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141 was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.
antimicrobial activity of amniotic fluid in south indian women.
samples of amniotic fluid obtained from 48 south indian women in the third trimester of pregnancy were studied for antimicrobial activity. the growth of staphylococcus albus, candida albicans and clostridium perfringens was inhibited by nearly all samples studied while the growth of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by 50%, 42% and 18% of samples respectively. the growth of streptococcus faecalis was not inhibited. using radial immunodiffusion, igg was measurable in all 10 samples studied (mean 23 mg/dl), whereas iga was measurable in only three of these samples (mean 1.32 mg/dl). however, while specific iga against c. albicans was detected by indirect immunofluorescence in 93% of samples, specific igg against c. albicans was detected in only 26% of samples (p less than 0.001). amniotic fluid obtained from parous women had greater inhibitory activity against e. coli (p less than 0.05) than did the amniotic fluid obtained from nulliparae.
[study of the microbial multiplication in the muscle just after slaughter (author's transl)].
the bactericidal or bacteriostatic activity of the serum, the muscle and the rabbit meat juice was followed after slaughter on animals vaccinated or not against e. coli, p. putida, cl. perfringens. rabbit serum is bactericidal against gram negative bacteria, p. putida and e. coli. on the contrary it is without effect on cl. perfringens. muscle has no inhibitory effect against e. coli and cl. perfringens on animals vaccinated or not. p. putida is inhibited or partially eliminated from rabbit muscle just after slaughter. vaccination does not increase the bacteriostatic or bactericidal activities of the sera, the meat juices and intact muscles.
[comparison of antibacterial activity of cefmenoxime with other cephalosporins against clinically isolated bacteria (author's transl)].
we examined the antibacterial activity of mx in comparison with those of other ceps, using aerobic gram-positive cocci, aerobic gram-negative bacilli and anaerobic bacteria, 870 strains in total, all isolated from clinical specimens, in 1979 and 1980. against streptococcus, cmx showed superior antibacterial activity than those of cfx, cmz, cxm and ctm. against h. influenzae, cmx also showed superior antibacterial activity than those of cfx, cmx, cxm, ctm and cez. abpc-and pipc-resistant strains were sensitive to cmx. ctx, cpz and czx also showed antibacterial activities equivalent to that of cmx. against enteric bacteria, e. coli, klebsiella, e. cloacae, serratia, c. freundii and proteus, cmx showed superior antibacterial activity than those of cfx, cmz, cxm, ctm and cez. especially, against e. coli, klebsiella, p. mirabilis, p. rettgeri and p. inconstans, cmx showed strong antibacterial activity. as to non-fermentation bacteria, cmx's antibacterial activity was relatively weak except p. putrefaciens, alcaligenes and comamonas. however, it was superior than that of cez. in comparison with other ceps, the strength of cmx varied according to the kinds of bacteria. as to anaerobic bacteria, cmx showed strong antibacterial activity against peptococcus, peptostreptococcus, lactobacillus, propionibacterium, c. perfringens, veillonella and fusobacterium. however, its antibacterial activity against bacteroides was similar to those of other ceps.
the control of bacterial contamination in carcass meal with propionic acid.
the effect of the addition of 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10% respectively of propionic acid on known numbers of bacteria added to or contained in carcass meal was examined. escherichia coli was totally inhibited by 2% propionic acid, while 5% of the acid both inhibited salmonella typhimurium and brought about a 74,7% reduction in the total aerobic bacterial count.
bacteriological quality and shelf life of ground beef.
the bacteriological quality of unfrozen raw ground beef was evaluated after 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18 days of storage at 29 +/- 1 f (-1.7 +/- 0.6 c). at the time of fabrication, all of the ground beef samples contained 10(6) or fewer total aerobic and psychrotrophic bacteria/g; 81% contained 100 or fewer coliforms/g; 94% contained 100 or fewer escherichia coli/g; and all of the samples contained 100 or fewer coagulase-positive staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens/g. total aerobic and psychrotrophic bacteria increased by 1 log between 3 and 18 days of storage. coliform and e. coli counts decreased during storage, whereas coagulase-positive s. aureus and c. perfringens counts did not change significantly. these data indicate that meat processors, wholesalers, and retailers could improve the bacteriological quality and prolong the shelf life of ground beef packaged in oxygen-impermeable film if the temperature of product never exceeded 29 +/- 1 f (-1.7 +/- 0.6 c).
competitive inhibition of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis  by heterologous deoxyribonucleic acid.
glucosylated deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) from phages t4 and t6 competes poorly with homologous dna causing only a slight decrease of transformation in group h streptococcus strain challis. other types of heterologous dnas (micrococcus luteus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, calf thymus and non-glucosylated phage t6 dna), in contrast to glucosylated t4 and t6 dnas, compete with transforming dna to the normal, high extent. these results indicate that as in transformation of bacillus subtilis, the presence of glucose attached to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine in phage t6 dna considerably decreases the interaction of such dna with competent cells of the challis strain. it also indicates that the guanine plus cytosine content of dna is not decisive in determining its interaction with competent cells.
determination of melting sequences in dna and dna-protein complexes by difference spectra.
a graphical formula is presented for determining the base ratio of melted dna. by use of this formula, the composition of sequences which melt in different portions of the melting curves of clostridium dna, escherichia coli dna, and mouse dna were determined. as the dna melts, the per cent of adenine and thymine (at) in the melted sequences decreases linearly with temperature. the average composition of sequences which melt in a given part of the melting curve is proportional to the base ratio of the dna. the concentration and average composition of sequences were determined for three parts of the melting curves of the dna samples, and a frequency distribution curve was constructed. the curve is symmetrical and has a maximum at about 56% at. the distribution of gc-rich sequences on the e. coli chromosome was estimated by shearing, partially melting, and fractionating the dna on hydroxylapatite. gc-rich sequences appear to occur every thousand base pairs, and have a maximum length of about 180 base pairs. the graphical formula was applied to the determination of the composition of sequences which melt in different parts of the melting curve of chromatin. throughout the melting curve, the composition of the melting sequences is about 60% at, which appears to suggest that relatively long sequences are melting simultaneously. their melting temperature may be a function of the composition of the protein on different parts of the dna. the problem of light scattering in dna-protein and dna was also investigated. a formula is presented which corrects for light scattering by relating the intensity of the scattered light to the rate of change of absorbance of dna with wavelength.
