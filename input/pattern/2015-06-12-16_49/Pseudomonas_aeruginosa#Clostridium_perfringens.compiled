TI  - Characterization, validation and application of a DNA microarray for the detection of mandatory and other waterborne pathogens.
AB  - Culture methods for the detection of indicator bacteria are currently used for detection of waterborne bacteria. The need for an increased range of analyzed bacteria coupled with the obtainment of rapid and early results justify the development of a DNA microarray for the identification of waterborne pathogens. This DNA microarray has 16 implanted probes with a median size of 147 bases, targeting 12 different parameters, including all mandatory indicator microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, total and fecal coliforms and enterococci. The validation performed with DNA extracted from pure microbial cultures showed the suitability of the probes for detection of the target microorganism. To overcome the high dilution of water samples it was included either a prior culture step of bacterial contaminants retained after filtering 100 ml of water, or a 10-fold increase in the volume of filtered water, that resulted in the increase of the detected bacteria. The analysis of complex environmental water samples using culture methods and the DNA microarray revealed that the latter detected the same parameters plus other bacteria tested only in the DNA microarray. The results show that this DNA microarray may be a useful tool for water microbiological surveillance.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of traditional medicinal plants from Ankober District, North Shewa Zone, Amhara Region, Ethiopia.
AB  - CONTEXT: Traditional medicinal plants have long been used in Ethiopia to treat human and livestock ailments. Despite a well-documented rich tradition of medicinal plant use in the country, their direct antimicrobial effects are still poorly known. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the antimicrobial activity of 19 medicinal plant species that were selected based on the ethnobotanical information on their traditional use to treat infectious diseases in Ankober District. METHODS: About 23 different ethanol extracts of plants obtained by maceration of various parts of 19 medicinal plant species were studied for potential antimicrobial activity using a broth microdilution method against Bacillus cereus, Bacteroides fragilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. RESULTS: Plant extracts from Embelia schimperi Vatke (Myrsinaceae) showed the strongest antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) value of 64 microg/ml against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes, and S. pyogenes. Growth inhibitory activities were also observed for extracts of Ocimum lamiifolium Hochst. (Lamiaceae) against S. pyogenes, and those of Rubus steudneri Schweinf. (Rosaceae) against S. epidermidis at an MIC value of 128 microg/ml. Generally, 74% of ethanol extracts (17 extracts) showed antimicrobial activity against one or more of the microbial strains tested at an MIC value of 512 microg/ml or below. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Results confirm the antimicrobial role of traditional medicinal plants of Ankober and warrant further investigations on promising medicinal plant species so as to isolate and characterise chemicals responsible for the observed strong antimicrobial activities.
TI  - [Harmonization of microbiologicaland parasitological indices of epidemic safety of drinking water with the international requirements].
AB  - For the purpose of harmonization of microbiological and parasitological indices and benchmarks there was performed the comparative analysis of the requirements for the quality of drinking water in respect of the epidemic safety on the basic regulations of Russia, the Directive Council of the European Union EU, WHO, the United States, Canada, Australia, Finland, Sweden, Brazil, France, Japan and China. As a result, there were revealed the priority bacteriological, virological and parasitological parameters: E. coli--indicator of recent fecal contamination, coliforms, heterotrophic bacteria colony count (Heterotrophic plate count), which is in the water legislation of the Russian Federation is characterized as total bacterial count (TBC), being an integral index of the quality of wastewater treatment technologies and hygienic condition of the water supply systems, coliphages as an indicator of viral contamination. In the Guidelines for drinking-water quality control, WHO and a set of countries there is recommended a more wide range of indicators: enterococci, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, enteroviruses, parasitological indices. With aim of harmonization of the requirements for the quality of drinking water in the Russian Federation with international approaches to the revision of the Sanitary Regulations and Norms (SanPin) 2.1.4.1074 into the project there are introduced priority indicator parameters of bacterial, viral and parasitic contamination of water, evidence-based guidelines.
TI  - A waterborne outbreak and detection of cryptosporidium oocysts in drinking water  of an older high-rise apartment complex in seoul.
AB  - From May to June 2012, a waterborne outbreak of 124 cases of cryptosporidiosis occurred in the plumbing systems of an older high-rise apartment complex in Seoul, Republic of Korea. The residents of this apartment complex had symptoms of watery diarrhea and vomiting. Tap water samples in the apartment complex and its adjacent buildings were collected and tested for 57 parameters under the Korean Drinking Water Standards and for additional 11 microbiological parameters. The microbiological parameters included total colony counts, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus, fecal streptococcus, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cryptosporidium oocysts, Giardia cysts, total culturable viruses, and Norovirus. While the tap water samples of the adjacent buildings complied with the Korean Drinking Water Standards for all parameters, fecal bacteria and Cryptosporidium oocysts were detected in the tap water samples of the outbreak apartment complex. It turned out that the agent of the disease was Cryptosporidium parvum. The drinking water was polluted with sewage from a septic tank in the apartment complex. To remove C. parvum oocysts, we conducted physical processes of cleaning the water storage tanks, flushing the indoor pipes, and replacing old pipes with new ones. Finally we restored the clean drinking water to the apartment complex after identification of no oocysts.
TI  - Identification of pathogen bacteria and protozoa in treated urban wastewaters discharged in the Ebro River (Spain): water reuse possibilities.
AB  - The aim of this research work is to identify the presence of pathogens, bacteria  and protozoa, in different treated urban wastewaters and to relate biological pollution with the processes used in wastewater treatment plants. A study of the possibilities for water reuse is carried out taking into account bacterial and parasite composition. The analysed bacteria and protozoa are: Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens (spore), Salmonella spp., Legionella spp., helminths eggs, Giardia, Cryptosporidium spp. and free-living amoebae (FLA). The selected municipal wastewater treatment plants (MWTPs) are located in Navarra (Spain) and the main difference between them is the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some plants. The results concerning bacteriological identification showed contamination of mainly faecal origin, and the use of natural lagoons as tertiary treatment in some MWTPs produced an important disinfection effect. Moreover, pathogen parasites such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium were not detected in the samples studied although FLA were identified in all cases.
TI  - Determination of microbial quality and plasmid-mediated multidrug resistant bacteria in fountain drinking water sources in Turkey.
AB  - The bacterial contamination as the total aerobic bacteria, coliform and fecal coliform numbers were determined and analyzed for temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen in seasonally collected water samples from fifteen different stations placed in Adana-Tufanbeyli road line during March 2008 - January 2009. In addition, antibiotic resistance profiles of isolates were examined against frequently used antibiotics, and analyzed plasmid DNAof multiple antibiotic resistant (MAR) isolates. Total aerobic bacteria in fountain water samples was determined as 3 x 10(3) CFU ml(-1) and total and fecal coliforms were determined 460 MPN/100 ml. Results obtained from biochemical analysis showed that 121 of the isolates were Proteus vulgaris, 69 Escherichia coli, 51 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 28 Citrobacter spp. According to these results, the existence of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in stations 2 and 10, and Streptococcus faecalis in stations 11 and 15 respectively were confirmed. Clostridium perfringens was not detected in water samples. A total of 273 isolates were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by agar disc diffusion methods. A total of sixteen antibiotics were used for determination of antibiotic resistance of isolates. Resistance to bacitracin, vancomycine, cephalothin and ampicillin was detected in 77, 77, 63 and 50%, respectively. Multiple antibiotic resistance (MAR) value > or = 0.25 was determined in 68.4% of identified 273 isolates and meaning of this percentage were resistant to four and more antibiotics. Plasmid DNA was isolated from 22 isolates with multiple antibiotic resistance index ranged from 0.3 to 0.6 taken randomly by agarose-gel electrophoresis, some of them contain a high-molecular weight plasmid DNA. Highlight of our study that the appearance of potential antibiotic resistances in fountain drinking water requires increased surveillance for risk assessment and prevention strategies to protect public health.
TI  - Immunotoxin-mediated targeting of claudin-4 inhibits the proliferation of cancer  cells.
AB  - Immunotoxins are engineered chimeric proteins that consist of a fragment of a toxin fused to a modified antibody or growth factor capable of targeting specific cells. Furthermore, these proteins can be targeted to receptors that are commonly overexpressed on cancer cells. The majority of immunotoxins function by binding to cells, translocating into the cytosol and inhibiting protein synthesis. In this study, the expression of claudin4 (CLDN4) in various cancer cells was analysed as a potential target for immunotoxins. To target CLDN4-expressing cancer cells, the c-terminal CLDN4binding domain of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE) was fused to the Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (ETA) domain to create an immunotoxin (CPEETA'). Subsequently, the capacity of such an immunotoxin in suppressing the proliferation of CLDN4-positive cancer cells was investigated. We report that head and neck squamous carcinoma cells (HN5) have an elevated CLDN4 expression compared to the other cell lines tested. Our findings further demonstrate that CPEETA' is highly potent against MCF-7 breast [50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) 9.8 ng/ml] and HN5 head/neck (IC50 8.8 ng/ml) cancer cell lines, while it has no cytotoxic effects on HeLa cells (CLDN4negative). The immunotoxin was subsequently expressed in the tumour colonising oncolytic strain, Clostridium ghonii. Most importantly, the strictly anaerobic Clostridium ghonii was able to overexpress and secrete a functional CPEETA' fusion protein. Our findings open the possibility of the targeted delivery of the immunotoxin locally to tumour sites at a high concentration using strictly anaerobic Clostridium ghonii for the treatment of CLDN4-positive cancer cells.
TI  - Municipal landfill sites as sources of microorganisms potentially pathogenic to humans.
AB  - The present research was aimed at assessing the quality of air and soil on the premises and in the vicinity of the municipal landfill sites in Torun with regard to the presence of pathogenic bacteria, potentially dangerous to humans. Air samples (the impaction method using a MAS-100 impactor) and soil samples were collected from seven sampling sites including the operating and closed landfill cells, sampling sites located near leachate ponds, and sampling sites located outside the above premises. The research also involved assessing microbial air contamination in three indoor spaces on the premises of the landfill sites. Microbial tests involved the determination of the number of culturable mesophilic, mannitol-positive, and alpha- and beta-hemolytic bacteria in the air, determination of the number of coliform bacteria, spore-forming Clostridium perfringens in soil, and the presence of Salmonella in soil. The results indicate that bioaerosol emitted by this municipal facility is the source of hemolytic bacteria (</= 300 CFU m(-3) of air), as well as of pathogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis). The highest risk of exposure to biological agents was determined in the sorting facility. Over sixty percent of air samples in this sampling site presented high pollution degree with mesophilic bacteria (500-2000 CFU m(-3) of air) and over one fourth of air samples presented very high pollution degree (>2000 CFU m(-3) of air). Indoor air in other rooms was considered highly/moderately contaminated (100-2000 CFU m(-3) of air). The highest risk related to the presence of Salmonella, Clostridium perfringens, and coliform bacteria in soil was determined at the operating landfill cell and near the leachate pond of the closed landfill cell. At the operating landfill cell the total coli ranged from 4-1226 MPN g(-1) of dry mass of soil and Clostridium perfringens ranged from <LOD-1604 CFU g(-1) of dry mass of soil. The results question the strategy of municipal landfill sites in densely populated areas, and emphasize the need for regular monitoring of microbiological tests in their vicinity as well as for control strategies in order to protect workers at landfill sites. The results of the study should be used for future decisions on the location of municipal landfill sites and suggest the need for better environmental control technologies in the sites that are already functioning.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of essential oils from Mediterranean aromatic plants against several foodborne and spoilage bacteria.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of essential oils extracted from a variety of aromatic plants, often used in the Portuguese gastronomy was studied in vitro by the agar diffusion method. The essential oils of thyme, oregano, rosemary, verbena, basil, peppermint, pennyroyal and mint were tested against Gram-positive (Listeria monocytogenes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, and Staphylococcus epidermidis) and Gram-negative strains (Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). For most essential oils examined, S. aureus, was the most susceptible bacteria, while P. aeruginosa showed, in general, least susceptibility. Among the eight essential oils evaluated, thyme, oregano and pennyroyal oils showed the greatest antimicrobial activity, followed by rosemary, peppermint and verbena, while basil and mint showed the weakest antimicrobial activity. Most of the essential oils considered in this study exhibited a significant inhibitory effect. Thyme oil showed a promising inhibitory activity even at low concentration, thus revealing its potential as a natural preservative in food products against several causal agents of foodborne diseases and food spoilage. In general, the results demonstrate that, besides flavoring the food, the use of aromatic herbs in gastronomy can also contribute to a bacteriostatic effect against pathogens.
TI  - Ceftazidime-avibactam: a novel cephalosporin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combination.
AB  - Avibactam (formerly NXL104, AVE1330A) is a synthetic non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor that inhibits the activities of Ambler class A and C beta-lactamases and some Ambler class D enzymes. This review summarizes the existing data published for ceftazidime-avibactam, including relevant chemistry, mechanisms of action and resistance, microbiology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy and safety data from animal and human trials. Although not a beta-lactam, the chemical structure of avibactam closely resembles portions of the cephem bicyclic ring system, and avibactam has been shown to bond covalently to beta-lactamases. Very little is known about the potential for avibactam to select for resistance. The addition of avibactam greatly (4-1024-fold minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] reduction) improves the activity of ceftazidime versus most species of Enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzyme(s). Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of avibactam also improves the activity of ceftazidime (~fourfold MIC reduction). Limited data suggest that the addition of avibactam does not improve the activity of ceftazidime versus Acinetobacter species or most anaerobic bacteria (exceptions: Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Prevotella spp. and Porphyromonas spp.). The pharmacokinetics of avibactam follow a two-compartment model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration of ceftazidime. The maximum plasma drug concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) of avibactam increase linearly with doses ranging from 50 mg to 2,000 mg. The mean volume of distribution and half-life of 22 L (~0.3 L/kg) and ~2 hours, respectively, are similar to ceftazidime. Like ceftazidime, avibactam is primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. Pharmacodynamic data suggest that ceftazidime-avibactam is rapidly bactericidal versus beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli that are not inhibited by ceftazidime alone.Clinical trials to date have reported that ceftazidime-avibactam is as effective as standard carbapenem therapy in complicated intra-abdominal infection and complicated urinary tract infection, including infection caused by cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative isolates. The safety and tolerability of ceftazidime-avibactam has been reported in three phase I pharmacokinetic studies and two phase II clinical studies. Ceftazidime-avibactam appears to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date.In conclusion, avibactam serves to broaden the spectrum of ceftazidime versus ss-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The exact roles for ceftazidime-avibactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. Potential future roles for ceftazidime-avibactam include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant Gram-negative-bacilli producing extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) and/or AmpC ss-lactamases. In addition, ceftazidime-avibactam may be used in combination (with metronidazole) for suspected polymicrobial infections. Finally, the increased activity of ceftazidime-avibactam versus P. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit in patients with suspected or documented P. aeruginosa infections.
TI  - Phytochemical profiles of volatile constituents from Centaurea ragusina leaves and flowers and their antimicrobial effects.
AB  - The volatile oils obtained from the leaves and flowers of the Croatian endemic plant Centaurea ragusina L. were evaluated for antimicrobial activity. The chemical compositions, determined by GC and GC-MS, were complex, with sesquiterpenes the most abundant class of compound. Nonterpene hydrocarbons were also identified in high quantities, while acids and ketones were found in high quantities only in the leaf volatile oil. Aldehydes, alcohols, esters and other compounds were identified in lower quantities. Antimicrobial effects of the volatile samples were investigated by using the disc diffusion and microdilution assays. They were found to inhibit a wide range of bacteria and fungi, causing in vitro growth inhibition at a concentration of 250 microg/mL. The volatile oils displayed great antibacterial potential with MIC values ranging from 16 to 128 microg/mL against the Gram-positive bacteria Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus, and lesser activity against the Gram-negative bacteria Cronobacter sakazakii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal strains (MIC = 32-128 microg/mL).
TI  - Opportunistic pathogens and faecal indicators in drinking water associated biofilms in Cluj, Romania.
AB  - Biofouling occurs without exception in all water systems, with undesirable effects such as biocorrosion and deterioration of water quality. Drinking water associated biofilms represent a potential risk to human health by harbouring pathogenic or toxin-releasing microorganisms. This is the first study investigating the attached microbiota, with potential threat to human health, in a public water system in Romania. The presence and the seasonal variation of viable faecal indicators and opportunistic pathogens were investigated within naturally developed biofilms in a drinking water treatment plant. Bacterial frequencies were correlated with microbial loads in biofilms as well as with physical and chemical characteristics of biofilms and raw water. The biofilms assessed in the current study proved to be extremely active microbial consortia. High bacterial numbers were recovered by cultivation, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Aeromonas hydrophila, intestinal enterococci and Clostridium perfringens. There were no Legionella spp. detected in any biofilm sample. Emergence of opportunistic pathogens in biofilms was not significantly affected by the surface material, but by the treatment process. Implementation of a water safety plan encompassing measures to prevent microbial contamination and to control biofouling would be appropriate.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. Most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory tract (37.1%) sites were identified. A total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. Of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were Gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens. The distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the same time. The most prevalent pathogenic isolates were Escherichia coli (15.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), Burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and Enterococcus spp. (9.3%). The drug susceptibility results showed that most of the Gram-negative bacilli, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. Most of the Gram-positive cocci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and Synercid/dalfopristin. Characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.
TI  - Survival trends of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Clostridium perfringens in a sandy South Florida beach.
AB  - The search for alternative indicators of disease-risk from non-enteric pathogens  at the beach revealed high densities of targeted bacteria. To explain the high numbers of potential non-enteric pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, in beach sand, we investigated factors affecting their survival and distribution, as well as those of a potential fecal indicator, Clostridium perfringens. Results indicated greater S. aureus and P. aeruginosa survival and proliferation in sterile beach sand, than seawater, with diminished numbers upon exposure to natural micro-predators. C. perfringens remained relatively consistent with initial numbers. Intermediate sand particles (850 mum-2 mm) constituted the major micro-niche; creating implications for beach classification programs. Colonization of sterile sand boxes at the beach by S. aureus and P. aeruginosa confirmed the filtering action (>100x) of beach sand. The use of these potential pathogens in periodic sanitary evaluation of beach sand quality is indicated, regardless of the factors influencing their abundance.
TI  - Development and application of a polymicrobial, in vitro, wound biofilm model.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this investigation was to develop an in vitro, polymicrobial, wound biofilm capable of supporting the growth of bacteria with variable oxygen requirements. METHODS AND RESULTS: The strict anaerobe Clostridium perfringens was isolated by cultivating wound homogenates using the drip-flow reactor (DFR), and a three-species biofilm model was established using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Cl. perfringens in the colony-drip-flow reactor model. Plate counts revealed that MRSA, Ps. aeruginosa and Cl. perfringens grew to 7.39 +/- 0.45, 10.22 +/- 0.22 and 7.13 +/- 0.77 log CFU per membrane, respectively. The three-species model was employed to evaluate the efficacy of two antimicrobial dressings, Curity AMD and Acticoat, compared to sterile gauze controls. Microbial growth on Curity AMD and gauze was not significantly different, for any species, whereas Acticoat was found to significantly reduce growth for all three species. CONCLUSIONS: Using the colony-DFR, a three-species biofilm was successfully grown, and the biofilms displayed a unique structure consisting of distinct layers that appeared to be inhabited exclusively or predominantly by a single species. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The primary accomplishment of this study was the isolation and growth of an obligate anaerobe in an in vitro model without establishing an artificially anaerobic environment.
TI  - Bacteria and their toxins tamed for immunotherapy.
AB  - Bacterial toxins share the ability to enter host cells to target various intracellular proteins and to modulate host immune responses. Over the last 20 years, toxins and their mutated variants, as well as live attenuated bacteria, have been exploited for vaccination and immunotherapy of various infectious, malignant and autoimmune diseases. The ability of Bordetella pertussis adenylate cyclase toxin to translocate its adenylate cyclase domain across the host cell membrane, as well as the pathways of intracellular trafficking of Bacillus anthracis lethal and edema toxins, Shigella dysenteriae shiga toxin or Escherichia coli shiga-like toxin, have been repeatedly exploited for the delivery of antigenic epitopes into host cells and for stimulation of antigen-specific T cell responses. Similarly, E. coli alpha-hemolysin, or effector proteins of Yersinia and Salmonella secreted by the type III secretion systems, were used to facilitate the delivery of fused heterologous proteins or peptides for antigenic presentation. Vibrio cholerae cholera toxin, E. coli heat-labile enterotoxin, B. pertussis pertussis toxin or the Cry1A protein of Bacillus thuringiensis have shown a great potential to act as adjuvants and to stimulate mucosal as well as systemic immune responses. The immunotherapeutic potential of some toxins, like Clostridium perfringens perfringolysin O, Streptococcus intermedius intermedilysin, or Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumolysin needs to be evaluated further. The Bordetella adenylate cyclase toxoid used as a vaccine delivery tool, or Corynebacterium diphtheriae diphtheria toxin and Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A-based immunotoxins, are currently in various phases of clinical trials for cancer immunotherapy, as are some antigen-delivering Salmonella and Listeria monocytogenes strains.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of a chitosan dextran-based hydrogel for surgical use.
AB  - A chitosan dextran-based (CD) hydrogel, developed for use in endoscopic sinus surgery, was tested for antimicrobial activity in vitro against a range of pathogenic microorganisms. The microdilution technique was used to determine minimum inhibitory, minimum bactericidal, and minimum fungicidal concentrations. In addition, the time-kill efficacy of CD hydrogel was determined for two bacterial species. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy were carried out to elucidate the antimicrobial mechanism of this compound. CD hydrogel was found to be effective against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Clostridium perfringens at its surgical concentration of 50,000 mg/liter. Minimum bactericidal concentrations ranged from 2,000 to 50,000 mg/liter. Dextran aldehyde (DA) was found to be the antimicrobial component of the CD hydrogel with MBC ranging from 2,000 to 32,000 mg/liter. S. aureus appeared to be killed at a slightly faster rate than E. coli. Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more resistant to CD hydrogel and DA. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy of E. coli and S. aureus incubated with CD hydrogel and DA alone revealed morphological damage, disrupted cell walls, and loss of cytosolic contents, compatible with the proposed mode of action involving binding to cell wall proteins and disruption of peptide bonds. Motility and chemotaxis tests showed E. coli to be inhibited when incubated with DA. The antibacterial activity of CD hydrogel may make it a useful postsurgical aid at other body sites, especially where there is a risk of Gram-positive infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of different degree of hydrolysis of palm kernel expeller  peptides against spore-forming and non-spore-forming bacteria.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to determine inhibitory effect of palm kernel expeller (PKE) peptides of different degree of hydrolysis (DH %) against spore-forming bacteria Bacillus cereus, Bacillus circulans, Bacillus coagulans, Bacillus licheniformis, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus pumilus, Bacillus stearothermophillus, Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus thuringiensis, Clostridium perfringens; and non-spore-forming bacteria Escherichia coli, Lisinibacillus sphaericus, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella Typhimurium and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS AND RESULTS: A range of DH % (50-100) of PKE peptides was prepared using alcalase, and hydrolysis conditions were determined using response surface methodology (RSM). The influence of pH (6.5-10.5), temperature (35-65 degrees C), enzyme/substrate ratio (1-5%) and substrate concentration (1-2%) were studied on the response of the DH. The antibacterial activity of different DH % of PKE peptides was tested by using disc diffusion assay and micro-broth dilution assay. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test on each of the PKE peptides of different DH %, the 70 DH % PKE peptide showed greater inhibitory effect compared to the 100 DH % PKE peptide against B. cereus, B. coagulans, B. megaterium, B. pumilus, B. stearothermophillus, B. subtilis, B. thuringiensis, Cl. perfringens, Lisinibacillus sphaericus and L. monocytogenes. CONCLUSIONS: The 70 DH % PKE peptides exhibited greatest overall antibacterial effect of the various peptides of PKE evaluated. Further research is needed to determine the mode of action of PKE peptides. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Palm kernel expeller peptides, a natural plant product, effectively inhibited the growth of spore-forming and non-spore-forming Gram-positive bacteria. Potentially, PKE peptides could be used in food preservation and developed as antibacterial agent in the pharmaceutical industry.
TI  - Physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in Greece and its public health implications.
AB  - Ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. To evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100 ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of Epirus were studied. The following microbiological parameters were determined: Total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Yersinia spp., Escherichia coli, Campylobacter sp., Vibrio cholerae, Aeromonas spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens. E. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. Samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. Aeromonas spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter sp. and V. cholerae were not detected. Spore forms of C. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's P. aeruginosa and Yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. The presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. In view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - Rapid label-free identification of mixed bacterial infections by surface plasmon  resonance.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of mixed aerobic-anaerobic infection has been a challenge in clinical practice due to the phenotypic changes in complex environments. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor is widely used to detect DNA-DNA interaction and offers a sensitive and label-free approach in DNA research. METHODS: In this study, we developed a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) amplification technique and modified the traditional SPR detection system for rapid and simultaneous detection of mixed infections of four pathogenic microorganisms (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium tetani and Clostridium perfringens). RESULTS: We constructed the circulation detection well to increase the sensitivity and the tandem probe arrays to reduce the non-specific hybridization. The use of 16S rDNA universal primers ensured the amplification of four target nucleic acid sequences simultaneously, and further electrophoresis and sequencing confirmed the high efficiency of this amplification method. No significant signals were detected during the single-base mismatch or non-specific probe hybridization (P < 0.05). The calibration curves of amplification products of four bacteria had good linearity from 0.1 nM to 100 nM, with all R(2) values of >0.99. The lowest detection limits were 0.03 nM for P. aeruginosa, 0.02 nM for S. aureus, 0.01 nM for C. tetani and 0.02 nM for C. perfringens. The SPR biosensor had the same detection rate as the traditional culture method (P < 0.05). In addition, the quantification of PCR products can be completed within 15 min, and excellent regeneration greatly reduces the cost for detection. CONCLUSIONS: Our method can rapidly and accurately identify the mixed aerobic-anaerobic infection, providing a reliable alternative to bacterial culture for rapid bacteria detection.
TI  - Expression of a Clostridium perfringens type IV pilin by Neisseria gonorrhoeae mediates adherence to muscle cells.
AB  - Clostridium perfringens is an anaerobic, Gram-positive bacterium that causes a range of diseases in humans, including lethal gas gangrene. We have recently shown that strains of C. perfringens move across the surface of agar plates by a unique type IV pilus (TFP)-mediated social motility that had not been previously described. Based on sequence homology to pilins in Gram-negative bacteria, C. perfringens appears to have two pilin subunits, PilA1 and PilA2. Structural prediction analysis indicated PilA1 is similar to the pseudopilin found in Klebsiella oxytoca, while PilA2 is more similar to true pilins found in the Gram-negative pathogens Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Strains of N. gonorrhoeae that were genetically deficient in the native pilin, PilE, but supplemented with inducible expression of PilA1 and PilA2 of C. perfringens were constructed. Genetic competence, wild-type twitching motility, and attachment to human urogenital epithelial cells were not restored by expression of either pilin. However, attachment to mouse and rat myoblast (muscle) cell lines was observed with the N. gonorrhoeae strain expressing PilA2. Significantly, wild-type C. perfringens cells adhered to mouse myoblasts under anaerobic conditions, and adherence was 10-fold lower in a pilT mutant that lacked functional TFP. These findings implicate C. perfringens TFP in the ability of C. perfringens to adhere to and move along muscle fibers in vivo, which may provide a therapeutic approach to limiting this rapidly spreading and highly lethal infection.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of the enniatin B, produced by Fusarium tricinctum in liquid culture, and cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 cells.
AB  - The enniatins (ENs) are bioactive compounds of hexadepsipeptidic structure produced by several strains of Fusarium sp. The EN B was purified from extracts of Fusarium tricinctum growth on liquid culture of potato dextrose broth (PDB), using a semipreparative liquid chromatography (LC) followed by an analytical LC. The purity and the structure of the isolated compound were confirmed by the determination of the extinction coefficient and with electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) study. The pure fraction of EN B was utilized to determine the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus, and to study the cytotoxic effects on Caco-2 differentiated and undifferentiated cells. The results obtained demonstrated that in several antibiograms, EN B induced the inhibition of the grown microorganisms tested and no significant differences over control were detected when Caco-2 cells were exposed to EN B, at any of the concentrations used.
TI  - Enterococcus faecalis virulence regulator FsrA binding to target promoters.
AB  - The FsrABDC signal transduction system is a major virulence regulator in Enterococcus faecalis. The FsrC sensor histidine kinase, upon activation by the gelatinase biosynthesis-activating pheromone (GBAP) peptide encoded by the fsrBD genes, phosphorylates the FsrA response regulator required for the transcription of the fsrBDC and the gelE-sprE genes from the fsrB promoter and the gelE promoter, respectively. FsrA belongs to the LytTR family of proteins, which includes other virulence regulators, such as AgrA of Staphylococcus aureus, AlgR of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and VirR of Clostridium perfringens. The LytTR DNA-binding domain that characterizes these proteins generally binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by a number of bases that place the repeats on the same face of the DNA helix. In this study, we demonstrated that FsrA also binds to two imperfect direct repeats separated by 13 bp, based on the consensus sequence of FsrA, T/AT/CAA/GGGAA/G, which is consistent with the binding characteristics of LytTR domains.
TI  - Turn a diarrhoea toxin into a receptor-mediated therapy for a plethora of CLDN-4-overexpressing cancers.
AB  - Molecular targeted therapy (MTT) represents the new generation of anti-cancer arsenals. In this study, we report an alternative approach using a hybrid toxin that utilises the high-affinity of receptor-binding fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (CPE). CPE naturally binds to CLDN-4 through the C-terminal 30 amino acid. However, recent studies have shown that CLDN-4 is also overexpressed on a range of cancer cells. We thus constructed a cDNA comprising C-CPE and a well characterised toxic domain of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin A (C-CPE-ETA'). The recombinant C-CPE-ETA' fusion protein was shown to retain the specificity of binding to CLDN-4 and initiating rapid penetration into cytosol in five different CLDN-4 positive cancer cells (Breast-MCF7, Skin-A431, Colon-SW480, Prostate-PC3 and DU145) but not to CLDN-4 negative cells (Hela, HUVEC). C-CPE-ETA' was strongly cytotoxic towards CLDN-4 positive cancer cell, as opposed to cells lacking CLDN-4 expression. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the recombinant fusion protein had significant anti-cancer ability in CLDN-4 positive cancer models in vivo. Subcutaneously implanted MCF7 and SW480 xenograft tumours were significantly decreased or abolished after three repeated injection of the hybrid toxin. Taken together, our results convincingly show that the hybrid toxin targets CLDN-4 positive cancer through receptor-binding, and causes significant tumour cell apoptosis, suggesting its potential as an alternative molecular targeted therapy against a plethora of CLDN-4 positive cancers.
TI  - Standardized comparison of antiseptic efficacy of triclosan, PVP-iodine, octenidine dihydrochloride, polyhexanide and chlorhexidine digluconate.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study presents a comparative investigation of the antimicrobial  efficacy of the antiseptics PVP-iodine, triclosan, chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide used for pre-surgical antisepsis and antiseptic treatment of skin, wounds and mucous membranes based on internationally accepted standards. METHODS: MICs and MBCs were determined in accordance with DIN 58940-7 and 58940-8 using Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Enterococcus faecalis (including vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus), Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Haemophilus influenzae and Candida albicans. The microbicidal efficacy was determined in accordance with DIN EN 1040 and 1275 using S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans. RESULTS: For chlorhexidine, octenidine and polyhexanide, MIC(48) and MBC(24) ranged from 16 to 32 mg/L. Maximum values for triclosan ranged from 256 to 512 mg/L, with an efficacy gap against P. aeruginosa, while the maximum values of PVP-iodine were 1024 mg/L, with a gap against S. pneumoniae. Comparing the minimal effective concentrations, octenidine was most effective. After 1 min, only octenidine and PVP-iodine fulfil the requirements for antiseptics. CONCLUSIONS: Tests under standardized and harmonized conditions help to choose the most efficacious agent. When a prolonged contact time is feasible, ranking of agents would be polyhexanide = octenidine > chlorhexidine > triclosan > PVP-iodine. This is consistent with the recommendations for antisepsis of acute wounds. Polyhexanide seems to be preferable for chronic wounds due to its higher tolerability. If an immediate effect is required, ranking would be octenidine = PVP-iodine>> polyhexanide > chlorhexidine > triclosan.
TI  - Antibacterial effect of the bioactive compound beauvericin produced by Fusarium proliferatum on solid medium of wheat.
AB  - To obtain the bioactive compound beauvericin (BEA), Fusarium proliferatum CECT 20569 was grown on a solid medium of wheat, utilizing the technique of the solid state fermentation (SSF), being this mycotoxin purified by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with a reverse phase semi-preparative column using as the mobile phase acetonitrile/water in gradient condition. The purity of the BEA was verified by analytical HPLC and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS). The pure fractions of BEA were utilized to determinate the antibiotic effects on several bacterial strains that are considered normally pathogens of the intestinal tract as: Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecium, Salmonella enterica, Shigella dysenteriae, Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia enterocolitica, Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.
TI  - Role of host cell polarity and leading edge properties in Pseudomonas type III secretion.
AB  - Type III secretion (T3S) functions in establishing infections in a large number of Gram-negative bacteria, yet little is known about how host cell properties might function in this process. We used the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the ability to alter host cell sensitivity to Pseudomonas T3S to explore this problem. HT-29 epithelial cells were used to study cellular changes associated with loss of T3S sensitivity, which could be induced by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin or perfringolysin O. HL-60 promyelocytic cells are innately resistant to Pseudomonas T3S and were used to study cellular changes occurring in response to induction of T3S sensitivity, which occurred following treatment with phorbol esters. Using both cell models, a positive correlation was observed between eukaryotic cell adherence to tissue culture wells and T3S sensitivity. In examining the type of adhesion process linked to T3S sensitivity in HT-29 cells, a hierarchical order of protein involvement was identified that paralleled the architecture of leading edge (LE) focal complexes. Conversely, in HL-60 cells, induction of T3S sensitivity coincided with the onset of LE properties and the development of actin-rich projections associated with polarized cell migration. When LE architecture was examined by immunofluorescent staining for actin, Rac1, IQ-motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) and phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI3 kinase), intact LE structure was found to closely correlate with host cell sensitivity to P. aeruginosa T3S. Our model for host cell involvement in Pseudomonas T3S proposes that cortical actin polymerization at the LE alters membrane properties to favour T3S translocon function and the establishment of infections, which is consistent with Pseudomonas infections targeting wounded epithelial barriers undergoing cell migration.
TI  - A novel tumor-targeted therapy using a claudin-4-targeting molecule.
AB  - Carcinogenesis is often accompanied by dysfunctional tight junction (TJs), resulting in the loss of cellular polarity. Claudin, a tetra-transmembrane protein, plays a pivotal role in the barrier and fence functions of TJs. Claudin-4 is deregulated in various cancers, including breast, prostate, ovarian, and gastric cancer. Claudin-4 may be a promising target molecule for tumor therapy, but the claudin-targeting strategy has never been fully developed. In the present study, we prepared a claudin-4-targeting molecule by fusion of the C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) with the protein synthesis inhibitory factor (PSIF) derived from Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin. PSIF was not cytotoxic to claudin-4-expressing cells, whereas C-CPE-PSIF was cytotoxic. Cells that express claudin-1, -2, and -5 were less sensitive to C-CPE-PSIF. Pretreatment of the cells with C-CPE attenuated C-CPE-PSIF-induced cytotoxicity, and mutation of C-CPE in the claudin-4-binding residues attenuated the cytotoxicity of C-CPE-PSIF. TJ-undeveloped cells were more sensitive to C-CPE-PSIF than TJ-developed cells. It is noteworthy that polarized epithelial cells are sensitive to C-CPE-PSIF applied to the basal side, whereas the cells were less sensitive to C-CPE-PSIF applied to the apical side. Intratumoral injection of C-CPE-PSIF reduced tumor growth. This is the first report to indicate that a claudin-4-targeting strategy may be a promising method to overcome the malignant tumors.
TI  - Antimicrobial effect of oxidized cellulose salts.
AB  - Antimicrobial properties of oxidized cellulose and its salts in linters (-L) and  microsphere (-M) form (OKCEL H-L, OKCEL Zn-M, OKCEL ZnNa-L, OKCEL ZnNa-M and OKCEL Ag-L) were tested by a dilution method against a spectrum of microbial strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Aspergillus niger, Penicillium chrysogenum, Rhizopus oryzae, Scopulariopsis brevicaulis, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis. OKCEL Ag-L exhibited antimicrobial activity in the range 0.1-3.5% w/v against all the bacteria and fungi involved in this study. Strong inhibition by OKCEL ZnNa-M was observed for Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus licheniformis, Rhizopus oryzae, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis in the range 0.5-2.0% w/v. Antimicrobial effects of oxidized cellulose and its salts in textile form were investigated by a diffusion and dilution method against the spectrum of above-cited microbial strains extended by Clostridium perfringens. Generally, OKCEL Ag-T, OKCEL Zn-T and OKCEL H-T showed high antimicrobial activity against populations of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus licheniformis and Staphylococcus epidermidis. OKCEL Zn-T was the only sample suppressing the growth of species.
TI  - Ribosome protection prevents azithromycin-mediated quorum-sensing modulation and  stationary-phase killing of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, azithromycin has been shown to reduce virulence factor production, to retard biofilm formation, and to exhibit bactericidal effects on stationary-phase cells. In this study we analyzed whether these azithromycin-mediated effects require interaction with the ribosome. We blocked the access of azithromycin to the ribosome in P. aeruginosa PAO1 by expressing the 23S rRNA methylase ErmBP from Clostridium perfringens. Ribosome protection prevented the azithromycin-mediated reduction of elastase and rhamnolipid production, as well as the inhibition of swarming motility. Ribosome protection also prevented the killing of stationary-phase cells, suggesting that the cell-killing effect of azithromycin does not result solely from membrane destabilization. We further show that rhamnolipids are involved in cell killing, probably by increasing the uptake of the hydrophobic azithromycin molecule. These results have important implications for the treatment with azithromycin of patients chronically colonized by P. aeruginosa and might explain the variability in the efficacy of azithromycin treatments.
TI  - Nucleoside analogues are activated by bacterial deoxyribonucleoside kinases in a  species-specific manner.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the bactericidal activity of antiviral and anticancer  nucleoside analogues against a variety of pathogenic bacteria and characterize the activating enzymes, deoxyribonucleoside kinases (dNKs). METHODS: Several FDA-approved nucleoside analogue drugs were screened for their potential bactericidal activity against several clinical bacterial isolates and type strains. We identified and subcloned the genes coding for putative deoxyribonucleoside kinases in Escherichia coli, Pasteurella multocida, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. These genes were tested for their ability to increase the susceptibility of a dNK-deficient E. coli strain to various analogues. We overexpressed, purified and characterized the substrate specificity and kinetic properties of the recombinant enzymes from S. enterica and B. cereus. RESULTS: The tested Gram-negative bacteria were susceptible to 3'-azido-3'-deoxythymidine (AZT) in the concentration range 0.032-31.6 microM except for a single E. coli isolate and two Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates which were resistant to the tested AZT concentrations. Purified recombinant S. enterica thymidine kinase phosphorylated AZT efficiently with a Km of 73.3 microM and k(cat)/Km of 6.6 x 10(4) s(-1) M(-1) and is the activator of this drug in vivo. 2',2'-Difluoro-2'-deoxycytidine (gemcitabine) was a potent antibiotic against Gram-positive bacteria in the concentration range between 0.001 and 1.0 microM. The B. cereus deoxyadenosine kinase had a Km for gemcitabine of 33.5 microM and k(cat)/Km of 5.1 x 10(3) s(-1) M(-1) and activates gemcitabine in vivo. S. enterica and B. cereus are now amongst the first bacteria with a completely characterized set of dNK enzymes. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial dNKs efficiently activate nucleoside analogues in a species-specific manner. Therefore, nucleoside analogues have a potential to be employed as antibiotics in the fight against emerging multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - The effect of multifunctional polymer-based gels on wound healing in full thickness bacteria-contaminated mouse skin wound models.
AB  - We determined whether a two-part space-conforming polyethylene glycol/dopa polymer-based gel promoted healing of contaminated wounds in mice. This silver-catalysed gel was previously developed to be broadly microbiocidal in vitro while being biocompatible with human wound cell functioning. Full-thickness wounds were created on the backs of mice. The wounds were inoculated with 10(4) CFU of each of four common skin wound contaminants, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumanii and Clostridium perfringens. The wounds were then treated with our multifunctional polymer-based gel, the commercially available NewSkin product, or left to heal untreated. The untreated wounds were overtly infected, and presented detectable bacterial loads over the entire 21-day healing period, while the gel and NewSkin groups presented significantly smaller rises in bacterial levels and were cleared of detectable colonies by the third week, with the gel group clearing the bacteria earlier. While all three groups healed their wounds, the polymer-based gel-treated group demonstrated significantly earlier re-epithelialization and dermal maturation (P<0.05). This was reflected in a quick regain of tensile strength. This accelerated dermal maturation and regain in strength was noted in mice treated with the polymer-based gel when compared to wound treated with the commercially available Aquacel-Ag dressing (P<0.05). What distinguishes the polymer-based gel from these other products is that it is incorporated within the healing wound. These preclinical studies show that the anti-microbial polymer gel not only supports but also accelerates healing of bacterially contaminated wounds.
TI  - Application of real-time quantitative PCR for the detection of selected bacterial pathogens during municipal wastewater treatment.
AB  - Bacteria were detected at five stages of municipal wastewater treatment using TaqMan(R) real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR). Thirteen probe and primer sets were tested for diverse pathogens that may be present in wastewater, including Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, E. coli O157:H7, Helicobacter pylori, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Listeria monocytogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella sp., and Staphylococcus aureus. The sensitivity of the assay was 100 fg of genomic DNA (=22 gene copies), based on a standard curve generated using A. hydrophila purified DNA. Samples from five stages of wastewater treatment were collected, including raw wastewater, primary effluents, mixed liquor, waste activated sludge and final effluents. In duplicate samples, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, C. perfringens and E. faecalis were detected throughout the wastewater process, and their numbers decreased by 3.52-3.98, 4.23-4.33, 3.15-3.39, and 3.24 orders of magnitude respectively, between the raw wastewater and final effluent stage. This qPCR method was effective for the detection of pathogens in wastewater and confirmed that the risk of exposure to pathogens in the wastewater discharge was well within the Environment Canada guidelines.
TI  - Sensitive quantitative detection of commensal bacteria by rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-PCR.
AB  - A sensitive rRNA-targeted reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) method was developed for exact and sensitive enumeration of subdominant bacterial populations. Using group- or species-specific primers for 16S or 23S rRNA, analytical curves were constructed for Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the threshold cycle value was found to be linear up to an RNA amount of 10(-3) cell per RT-PCR. The number of bacteria in culture was determined by RT-qPCR, and the results correlated well with the CFU count over the range from 10(0) to 10(5) CFU. The bacterial counts obtained by RT-qPCR were the same as the CFU counts irrespective of the growth phase in vitro, except for C. perfringens during starvation periods; the viable cell counts obtained by using a combination of 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining and SYTO9-propidium iodide double staining were in good agreement with the RT-qPCR counts rather than with the CFU counts. The RT-qPCR method could detect endogenous Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa in feces of hospitalized patients (n = 38) at a level of 10(3) cells per g of feces, and for enumeration of S. aureus or P. aeruginosa spiked into human peripheral blood, the lower detection limit for RT-qPCR quantification of the bacteria was 2 cells per ml of blood, suggesting that this method was equivalent to the conventional culture method. As only 5 h was needed for RT-qPCR quantification, we suggest that rRNA-targeted RT-qPCR assays provide a sensitive and convenient system for quantification of commensal bacteria and for examining their possible invasion of a host.
TI  - Effect of neuraminidase on adherence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to human buccal epithelial cells. Inhibition of adhesion by monosaccharides.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the actiion of Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase on the adherence of 28 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa which were isolated from humans, different animals and environment to human buccal epithelial cells (BECs). Two reference strainns--NCTC 6749 and ATCC 27853 were also examined. Incubation of cells with the enzyme significantly increased bacterial adherence (a mean number of bacteria adhering to cells amounted 19.62 +/- 9.20, for controls - 7.54 +/- 5.86). The reference strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa showed the following adherence: NCTC 6749-43.04 (control 20.83) and ATCC 27853-22.21 (control 5.51). This study demonstrates that asialogangliosides function as receptors on buccal epithelial cells for P. aeruginosa strains. Monosaccharides inhibition studies showed an inhibition of adhesion of P. aeruginosa (two reference strains - NCTC 6749 and ATCC 27853, two hospital strains - 80/85 and 351) to normal BECs in the presence of N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. D-galactose is the best inhibitor of bacterial adhesion to neuraminized BECs. All monosaccharides used had a significant effect on P. aeruginosa adherence to trypsinized BECs. These data suggest a difference in the receptors on the three types of BECs.
TI  - Comparative evaluation of BacT/ALERT 3D and BACTEC systems for the recovery of pathogens causing bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare BacT/ALERT (BTA) and BACTEC 9240 (BAC), two continuously monitoring automated blood culture systems, for the recovery of bloodstream pathogens and standard media available for these systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples from 100 adults and 50 paediatric patients suspected of having bloodstream infections were inoculated at the bedside into non-vented BTA and BAC standard blood culture bottles and incubated in their respective instruments. The time to growth detection (TD) was recorded for each bottle that became positive. A quantitative assay was also carried out with 5 standard bloodstream pathogens to assess TD of each pathogen as well as the quantity of organisms recovered. RESULTS: A total of 23 isolates representing true infections were recovered by both BTA and BAC bottles, indicating a blood culture positivity rate of 15.3%, 18 (78.3%) by BTA bottles and 13 (56.5%) by BAC. Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens were recovered only by the BTA system. The average TDs were 19.0 and 24.6 h for BTA and BAC, respectively. Analysis of the quantitative growth of known pathogens in both systems was more or less the same for Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and P. aeruginosa but slightly different for Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The anaerobic bottle ofthe BTA did not support the growth of H. influenzae below an inoculum of 10(10) CFU/ml whereas the BAC did so at a lower inoculum of 10(8) CFU/ml. TD for S. pneumoniae in the BTA was about half of that in the BAC. CONCLUSIONS: The BTA system appears to be more efficient in detecting common bloodstream pathogens asa higher inoculum is needed for the BAC system to detect the same organism.
TI  - The stability of micro-organisms preserved in LENTICULE discs, demonstrated by repeat sample distributions of the EQUAL Scheme for Indicator Organisms (water microbiology).
AB  - AIMS: To demonstrate the stability of microorganisms preserved in LENTICULE discs, employed by the EQUAL Scheme for Indicator Organisms. METHODS AND RESULTS: Five sample batches containing several indicator organism parameters were each despatched in two separate distributions at intervals of up to 24 months apart. A comparison of participants' median counts and bar charts of their cumulated results was then made. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that LENTICULE discs provided a remarkably stable preparation format for the maintenance of viable organisms in reproducible numbers. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Complex mixtures of organisms can be maintained in stable numbers for extended periods of time at a freezer temperature of -20 degrees C and satisfactorily transported without the requirement for cold chain conditions.
TI  - Metabolic activation of bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene, 4-aminobiphenyl, and benzidine by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other human endogenous bacteria.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen of the human urinary tract, and other selected human endogenous bacteria were investigated for metabolic activation of the bladder procarcinogens, 2-aminofluorene (2-AF), 4-aminobiphenyl (4-AB), and benzidine (Bz). The cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and intestinal anaerobes, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Eubacterium aerofaciens produced increased histidine revertant frequencies with the tester strain Salmonella typhimurium TA98 in the Ames Salmonella mutagenicity assay. In addition, the cell-free extracts of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens each showed the presence of a cytochrome P450 absorption peak in the carbon monoxide (CO) difference spectrum. This was not demonstratable for the other bacteria. Our findings indicate that human endogenous bacteria, which are opportunistic pathogens of the urinary bladder, can metabolically activate the bladder procarcinogens 2-AF, 4-AB, and Bz into mutagens. The metabolic activation by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacteroides fragilis, and Eubacterium aerofaciens is mediated by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. For those organisms that induced metabolic activation but did not show a P450 absorption peak with the cell-free extracts, other oxidative enzymes may be involved.
TI  - Pollution status of swimming pools in south-south zone of south-eastern Nigeria using microbiological and physicochemical indices.
AB  - Microbiological and physicochemical characteristics of swimming pools in South Eastern states of Nigeria (Akwa Ibom and Cross River) were investigated. The bacterial isolates included Enterococcus faecalis, Clostridium perfringens, Bacillus cereus and Escherichia coli. Others were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus epidermidis, while fungal isolates were Penicillium sp, Rhizopus sp, Aspergillus versicolor Fusarium sp, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Mucor sp, Candida albicans, Aspergillus niger and Absidia sp. The total viable count of microorganims in Ibeno (B) and Uyo (E) swimming pools were 6 x 10(6) cfu/ml and for Calabar (H) swimming pool, 3.3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. The total coliform counts were 10(6) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (G) swimming pools and 2 x 10(7) cfu/100 ml for Calabar (H) swimming pools while the fungal count ranged from 5 x 10(6) cfu/ml to 3 x 10(7) cfu/ml. Physical and chemical parameters known to be hazardous to health were also identified. The presence of high levels of coliform and fecal coliform bacteria (E. coli) revelaed that the swimming pools have not met the World Health Organization (WHO) standard for recreational waters. The swimming pools constitute a serious public health hazard.
TI  - Photochemical treatment of platelet concentrates with amotosalen and long-wavelength ultraviolet light inactivates a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial contamination of platelet (PLT) concentrates can result in  transfusion-transmitted sepsis. A photochemical treatment (PCT) process with amotosalen HCl and long-wavelength ultraviolet light (UVA), which cross-links nucleic acids, was developed to inactivate bacteria and other pathogens in PLT concentrates. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: High titers of pathogenic aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive bacteria (10 species), aerobic Gram-negative bacteria (7 species), and spirochetes (2 species) were added to single-donor PLT concentrates containing 3.0 x 10(11) to 6.0 x 10(11) PLTs in approximately 300 mL of 35 percent plasma and 65 percent PLT additive solution (InterSol, Baxter Healthcare) or saline. After PCT with 150 micro mol per L amotosalen and 3 J per cm(2) UVA, residual bacterial levels were detected by sensitive microbiologic methods. RESULTS: The level of inactivation of viable bacteria was expressed as log reduction. Log reduction of Gram-positive bacteria for Staphylococcus epidermidis was > 6.6; for Staphylococcus aureus, 6.6; for Streptococcus pyogenes, > 6.8; for Listeria monocytogenes, > 6.3; for Corynebacterium minutissimum, > 6.3; for Bacillus cereus (vegetative), > 5.5; for Lactobacillus sp., > 6.4; for Bifidobacterium adolescentis, > 6.0; for Propionibacterium acnes, > 6.2; and for Clostridium perfringens, > 6.5. Log reduction of Gram-negative bacteria for Escherichia coli was > 6.4; for Serratia marcescens, > 6.7; for Klebsiella pneumoniae, > 5.6; for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4.5; for Salmonella choleraesuis, > 6.2; for Yersinia enterocolitica, > 5.9; and for Enterobacter cloacae, 5.9. Log reduction of spirochetes for Treponema pallidum was 6.8 to 7.0, and for Borrelia burgdorferi, > 6.9. CONCLUSION: PCT inactivates high levels of a broad spectrum of pathogenic bacteria. The inactivation of bacteria in PLT concentrates offers the potential to prospectively prevent PLT-transfusion-associated bacteremia.
TI  - In vitro activity of ertapenem: review of recent studies.
AB  - Ertapenem is a long-acting, 1beta-methyl parenteral Group 1 carbapenem antibiotic that has a broad antibacterial spectrum and once-a-day dosing supported by clinical studies. Ertapenem is active against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacteriaceae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and most species of anaerobic bacteria. Isolates from a variety of infections (intra-abdominal infections, skin/soft-tissue infections, community-acquired pneumonia, pelvic infections and urinary tract infections) are inhibited by ertapenem. It has restricted activity against nosocomial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci. Ertapenem has potent activity against the majority of anaerobic isolates from intra-abdominal infections, and against most of the aerobes isolated from these infections, with the exceptions of the nosocomial pathogens mentioned above. MIC(90)s for most species of Enterobacteriaceae were <1 mg/L, significantly lower than those of imipenem. MIC(90)s for most Bacteroides fragilis group isolates ranged from 1 to 4 mg/L, and MIC(90)s were species specific for Clostridium, ranging from 0.06 mg/L for Clostridium perfringens to 4 mg/L for Clostridium clostridioforme. Ertapenem was equivalent to or better than piperacillin-tazobactam in activity against most anaerobic species isolated from these infections, and was more potent than piperacillin-tazobactam and ceftriaxone against the most common skin pathogens (e.g. methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus). Ertapenem was highly active against most of the pathogens isolated from patients with community-acquired pneumonia, except for isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (which are infrequent causes of community-acquired infection); these isolates were also resistant to ceftriaxone. Resistance to ertapenem is most commonly attributable to a variety of mechanisms including alterations in penicillin-binding proteins in Gram-positive organisms, and combinations of potent metallo-beta-lactamase enzymes, porin protein defects and efflux pumps in Gram-negative organisms.
TI  - Distribution of potential type II restriction sites (palindromes) in prokaryotes.
AB  - Restriction-modification systems are used as a defensive mechanism against inappropriate invasion of foreign DNA. The recognition sequences for the common type II restriction enzymes and their corresponding methylases are usually palindromes. In this study, we identified the most over- and underrepresented words in DNA of four bacteria: Escherichia coli, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using maximum order Markov chain analysis, we found that palindromic words were most often more underrepresented than their non-palindromic counterparts. No strict rule for the intragenic palindrome content could be derived, but for three of the bacteria there was a weak correlation between codon usage bias and palindrome content. A clear drop in palindrome counts was observed in the Shine-Dalgarno region for B. subtilis and C. perfringens, but not in E. coli or P. aeruginosa. It was also shown that palindromes in eubacteria and archaebacteria seem to occur slightly more infrequently than expected on the basis of the genomic GC-content, but some exceptions to this principle exist.
TI  - Identification of species of Brucella using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy.
AB  - Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is a technique that has been used  over the years in chemical analysis for the identification of substances and is one that may be applied to the characterisation of microorganisms. The marked tendency of Brucella towards variation in the smooth rough phase, together with the laboriousness and risk involved in the methods used in their identification, make their classification difficult. We studied the type strains of the different species and biovars of Brucella and 11 isolates of human origin of Brucella melitensis, six corresponding to biovar 1, one to biovar 2 and five to biovar 3. The results of linear discriminant analysis performed using the data provide an above 95% likelihood of correct classification, over half of which are in fact above 99% for the vast majority of Brucella strains. Only one case of B. melitensis biovar 1 has been incorrectly classified. The rest of the microorganisms studied (Staphylococcus aureus, Strteptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) have been classified correctly in all cases to a likelihood of over 80%. In the graphic representation of the analysis, a grouping of these can be seen in clusters, which include the different species. One of these comprises B. melitensis, another Brucella abortus, and another wider one is made up of Brucella suis. The Brucella canis, Brucella ovis and Brucella neotomae strains appear separate from the previously described groups.
TI  - Duplication is more common among laterally transferred genes than among indigenous genes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent developments in the understanding of paralogous evolution have prompted a focus not only on obviously advantageous genes, but also on genes that can be considered to have a weak or sporadic impact on the survival of the organism. Here we examine the duplicative behavior of a category of genes that can be considered to be mostly transient in the genome, namely laterally transferred genes. Using both a compositional method and a gene-tree approach, we identify a number of proposed laterally transferred genes and study their nucleotide composition and frequency of duplication. RESULTS: It is found that duplications are significantly overrepresented among potential laterally transferred genes compared to the indigenous ones. Furthermore, the GC3 distribution of potential laterally transferred genes was found to be largely uniform in some genomes, suggesting an import from a broad range of donors. CONCLUSIONS: The results are discussed not in a context of strongly optimized established genes, but rather of genes with weak or ancillary functions. The importance of duplication may therefore depend on the variability and availability of weak genes for which novel functions may be discovered. Therefore, lateral transfer may accelerate the evolutionary process of duplication by bringing foreign genes that have mainly weak or no function into the genome.
TI  - Analysis of nucleotide distribution in the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) using the Z curve method.
AB  - The nucleotide distribution of all 33,527 open reading frames (ORFs) (> or =300 bp) in the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) has been analyzed using the Z curve method. Each ORF is mapped onto a point in a 9-dimensional space. To visualize the distribution of mapping points, the points are projected onto the principal plane based on principal component analysis. Consequently, the distribution pattern of the 33,527 points in the principal plane shows a flower-like shape, in which there are seven distinct regions. In addition to the central region, there are six petal-like regions around the center, one of which corresponds to 7172 coding sequences. The central region and the remaining five petal-like regions correspond to the intergenic sequences and out-of-frame non-coding ORFs, respectively. It is shown that selective pressure produces a remarkable bias of the G+C content among three codon positions, resulting in the interesting phenomenon observed. A similar phenomenon is also observed for other bacterial genomes with high genomic G+C content, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA01 (G+C = 66.6%). However, for the genomes of Bacillus subtilis (G+C = 43.5%) and Clostridium perfringens (G+C = 28.6%), no similar phenomenon was observed. The finding presented here may be useful to improve the gene-finding algorithms for genomes with high G+C content. A set of supplementary materials including the plots displaying the base distribution patterns of ORFs in 12 prokaryotes is provided on the website http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/highGC/.
TI  - Bioactivity of Backhousia citriodora: antibacterial and antifungal activity.
AB  - Backhousia citriodora products are used as bushfoods and flavorings and by the aromatherapy industry. The antimicrobial activity of 4 samples of B. citriodora oil, leaf paste, commercial tea (0.2 and 0.02 g/mL), and hydrosol (aqueous distillate) were tested against 13 bacteria and 8 fungi. Little or no activity was found to be associated with the leaf tea and hydrosol, respectively. Leaf paste displayed antimicrobial activity against 7 bacteria including Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and a hospital isolate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The 4 essential oils were found to be effective antibacterial and antifungal agents; however, variation was apparent between oils that did not correlate with citral content. The antimicrobial activity of B. citriodoraessential oils was found to be greater than that of citral alone and often superior to Melaleuca alternifolia essential oil. B. citriodora has significant antimicrobial activity that has potential as an antiseptic or surface disinfectant or for inclusion in foods as a natural antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Innate immune responses of human neonatal cells to bacteria from the normal gastrointestinal flora.
AB  - The hygiene hypothesis postulates that the prevalence of allergy has increased due to decreased microbial stimulation early in life, leading to delayed maturation of the immune system. The aim of this study was to examine the cytokine pattern produced from cord blood mononuclear cells relative to adult cells after stimulation with bacterial strains from the normal flora. Mononuclear cells from cord and adult blood samples were stimulated with the following bacteria: Bifidobacterium adolescentis, Enterococcus faecalis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Streptococcus mitis, Corynebacterium minutissimum, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides vulgatus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Veillonella parvula, and Neisseria sicca. The levels of interleukin 12 (IL-12), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-10, and IL-6 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The TNF-alpha production was also analyzed after blocking CD14, Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2), and TLR-4 prior to stimulation with bacteria. The levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha were similar in cord and adult cells. Gram-positive bacteria induced considerably higher levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha than gram-negative bacteria in both cord and adult cells. The levels of IL-6 were significantly higher in newborns than in adults, whereas the levels of IL-10 were similar in newborns and adults. Gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria induced similar levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in cord cells. L. plantarum bound or signaled through CD14, TLR-2, and TLR-4, whereas E. coli acted mainly through CD14 and TLR-4. These results indicate that the innate immune response in newborns to commensal bacteria is strong and also suggest that different bacterial strains may have differential effects on the maturation of the immune system of infants.
TI  - A novel type of conserved DNA-binding domain in the transcriptional regulators of the AlgR/AgrA/LytR family.
AB  - Sequence analysis of bacterial genomes revealed a novel DNA-binding domain. This  domain is found in several response regulators of the two-component signal transduction system, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa AlgR, involved in the regulation of alginate biosynthesis and in the pathogenesis of cystic fibrosis; Clostridium perfringens VirR, a regulator of virulence factors, and in several regulators of bacteriocin biosynthesis, previously unified in the AgrA/ComE family. Most of the transcriptional regulators that contain this DNA-binding domain are involved in biosynthesis of extracellular polysaccharides, fimbriation, expression of exoproteins, including toxins, and quorum sensing. We refer to it as the LytTR ('litter') domain, after Bacillus subtilis LytT and Staphylococcus aureus LytR response regulators, involved in regulation of cell autolysis. In addition to response regulators, the LytTR domain is found in combination with MHYT, PAS and other sensor domains.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of ayurvedic tablet "hadrabi".
AB  - The Ethanolic extract of "Hadrabi" powder was tested for antimicrobial activites  against gram positive organisms-Staphylococus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Clostridium perfringens and gram negative organisms-Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella paratyphi -B, Escherichia coli & Klebsiella pneumoniae Significant antimicrobial activity of the extract was found in this study at the dose of 1250 mg.
TI  - Topical mafenide hydrochloride aqueous spray in initial management of massive contaminated wounds with devitalized tissue.
AB  - Since at least WWII, some open, contaminated wounds involving massive soft tissue injury and vascular damage have resulted in "irreversible shock," despite prompt rescue, hemorrhage control, and blood and fluid replacement, without signs of clinical infection. In animal studies, survival time was related statistically to the dosage of Clostridium perfringens in multicontaminated explosive wounds. Survival time was lengthened by the application of some topical antibacterial agents, but actual recovery was achieved only with topical mafenide hydrochloride solution aqueous spray, which resulted in negative clostridium. perfringens cultures. Although not related statistically to survival time, the mafenide hydrochloride spray also controlled the Pseudomonas aeruginosa in these wounds. Mafenide hydrochloride had the American trade name of Sulfamylon from about 1942 until 1998, when another pharmaceutical company patented Sulfamylon as the trade name for mafenide acetate, a weaker antibacterial agent. However, mafenide hydrochloride still is available from chemical companies. Mafenide hydrochloride solution spray has been used successfully in treatment of patients with severe by contaminated wounds and deep burns, and its use in initial care should be revisited.
TI  - Ertapenem: a new carbapenem.
AB  - Ertapenem is a new 1-beta-methyl carbapenem, stable to dehydropeptidase, which binds preferable to penicillin-binding proteins (PBP) 2 and 3. Ertapenem has a broad antibacterial spectrum with MIC90 values < 0.5 mg/l for penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Citrobacter spp., Klebsiella spp., Serratia spp., Proteus spp., Clostridium perfringens, Fusobacterium spp. Peptostreptococcus spp. and anaerobic Streptococcus spp. Ertapenem exhibits a bactericidal mode of action as shown by time-killing curves and exhibits a short PAE of 1.4 - 2.6 h against the Gram-positive strains but no PAE against Gram-negative strains. In an infection model in mice, it has been shown that ertapenem and imipenem were highly efficacious at a level of 2 mg/kg in bacterial clearance in comparison to ceftriaxone, cefepime, ceftazidime, cefazolin, cefonicid, cefotaxime and meropenem. In comparison to other available carbapenems, ertapenem has a long half-life of 4.5 h and is developed as a single daily dose carbapenem. The protein binding is dose-dependent and is estimated to 94% at concentrations under 100 mg/l and approximately 85% at 300 mg/l. Cmax after a dose of 1 g in healthy volunteers has been estimated to 190 mg/l. Given the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic data, it may be predicted that ertapenem will have an effect on most Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp. and Acinetobacter spp. For pathogens with a MIC of 0.5 mg/l, the estimated T > MIC will be 50% (of 24 h) and for pathogens with a MIC of 1 mg/l 31%. For anaerobic bacteria with MIC values between 1-2 mg/l, the T > MIC may not be sufficient for bacterial eradication. However, clinical trials have to confirm this hypothesis.
TI  - Microbiological status of commercially available medicinal herbal drugs--a screening study.
AB  - One hundred and thirty-eight medicinal herbal drugs obtained from different suppliers were examined for microbial contaminants and for the detectability of pathogenic microorganisms. For this purpose, several microbiological standard parameters (total aerobic mesophilic count, enterobacteria, coliforms, aerobic sporeformers, yeasts and moulds, enterococci, lactobacilli, pseudomonades and aeromades) and selective methods for the detection of indicator microorganisms and pathogens (E. coli, enterohaemorrhagic E. coli [EHEC], Salmonella, Campylobacter jejuni, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens, Listeria, coagulase-positive staphylococci, Candida albicans, potentially aflatoxigenic moulds) were applied. The microbial load of the samples varied considerably. While none of the samples contained EHEC, Salmonellae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Listeriae, Staphylococcus aureus or Candida albicans, four samples were E. coli positive, two samples were presumptively Campylobacter jejuni positive and nine herbal drugs contained a potentially aflatoxigenic mould flora. Further details regarding different viable count classes as well as preparation techniques are discussed.
TI  - Evaluation of an automated culture system for detecting bacterial contamination of platelets: an analysis with 15 contaminating organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 1 in 2000 platelet components are bacterially contaminated. The time to detection of 15 seeded organisms in platelets recovered from an automated culture system was studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Isolates of Bacillus cereus, Bacillus subtilis, Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, Corynebacterium species, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Propionibacterium acnes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Serratia marcescens, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans were inoculated into Day 2 apheresis platelet components to obtain a final concentration of approximately 10 and 100 CFU per mL (2 units/organism). Each bag was sampled 10 times (20 mL/sample). Four mL of each sample was inoculated into standard aerobic and anaerobic bottles and into aerobic and anaerobic bottles containing charcoal; 2 mL was inoculated into pediatric aerobic bottles (so as to maintain a 1:10 ratio of sample to media) and 1 mL into thioglycollate broth. RESULTS: With the exception of P. acnes, all organisms were detected in a mean of 9.2 to 25.6 hours. A range of 10 serial dilutions in inoculating concentrations was associated with an overall 10.1-percent difference in detection time. A mean of 74.4 and 86.2 hours (100 and 10 CFU/mL inocula, respectively) was required for the detection of P. acnes in anaerobic bottles. CONCLUSION: Bacteria thought to be clinically significant platelet contaminants can be detected in 9.2 to 25.6 hours when the starting concentration is approximately 10 to 100 CFU per mL. P. acnes required considerably longer incubation times for detection (in either aerobic or anaerobic bottles). However, P. acnes is of questionable clinical significance. Such a detection system could be used in either a blood collection center or a transfusion service to screen platelet concentrates for bacterial contamination. Such testing (with sterile sampling performed so as to maintain a closed-bag system) would be expected to save lives and might allow an extension of platelet storage.
TI  - Detection of phospholipase C in nontuberculous mycobacteria and its possible role in hemolytic activity.
AB  - Phospholipase C plays a key role in the pathogenesis of several bacterial infections, for example, those caused by Clostridium perfringens and Listeria monocytogenes. Previous studies have reported multiple copies of plc genes homologous to Pseudomonas aeruginosa plcH and plcN genes encoding the hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase C enzymes in the genomes of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, M. marinum, M. bovis, and M. ulcerans. In this study we analyzed the possible relationship between phospholipase C and hemolytic activity in 21 strains of nontuberculous mycobacteria representing nine different species. Detection of phospholipase C enzymatic activity was carried out using thin-layer chromatography to detect diglycerides in the hydrolysates of radiolabeled phosphatidylcholine. DNA sequences of M. kansasii and M. marinum homologous to the genes encoding phospholipase C from M. tuberculosis and M. ulcerans were identified by DNA-DNA hybridization and sequencing. Finally, we developed a direct and simple assay to detect mycobacterial hemolytic activity. This assay is based on a modified blood agar medium that allows the growth and expression of hemolysis of slow-growing mycobacteria. Hemolytic activity was detected in M. avium, M. intracellulare, M. ulcerans, M. marinum, M. tuberculosis, and M. kansasii mycobacteria with phospholipase C activity, but not in M. fortuitum. No hemolytic activity was detected in M. smegmatis, M. gordonae, and M. vaccae. Whether or not phospholipase C enzyme plays a role in the pathogenesis of nontuberculous mycobacterial diseases needs further investigation.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activity of levofloxacin against hospital isolates: a multicentre study.
AB  - The objective of this study was to evaluate the activity of the fluoroquinolone,  levofloxacin, against hospital isolates of bacteria. MICs of levofloxacin were determined for 2154 strains by agar dilution. Breakpoints for susceptibility testing were calculated using the agar diffusion technique with 5 micrograms discs. The activity of levofloxacin against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible Enterobacteriaceae (n = 668) was higher (MIC50/90 0.06-0.12 mg/L) than previously reported for ofloxacin. As seen with other fluoroquinolones, this activity was reduced against nalidixic acid-resistant and pefloxacin-intermediate and -resistant strains (MIC 1-8 mg/L). MICs for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 104) were between 0.12 and 128 mg/L. Levofloxacin had good activity against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 12; MIC 0.06-0.25 mg/L), but the activity was reduced against nalidixic acid- and pefloxacin-resistant strains (n = 80; MIC 1-32 mg/L). Haemophilus influenzae (n = 70), Haemophilus parainfluenzae (n = 47) and Moraxella catarrhalis (n = 64) were inhibited by low concentrations of levofloxacin (MICs 0.016-0.03 mg/L, 0.03-0.12 mg/L) and 0.03-0.12 mg/L, respectively). Clostridium perfringens (n = 23; MIC 0.25-1 mg/L) was more susceptible than Bacteroides fragilis (n = 60; MIC 0.5-4 mg/L). Levofloxacin showed superior activity compared with ofloxacin against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (n = 107; MIC 0.03-0.5 mg/L); the resistant strains (MICs 2-32 mg/L) were usually also resistant to methicillin. Levofloxacin was less effective against enterococci (n = 105; MIC 1-32 mg/L), but streptococci (n = 192) and pneumococci (n = 129), including 58 penicillin-non-susceptible strains, were inhibited by low concentrations (MICs 0.5-2 mg/L). According to the regression curve, zone diameters were usually 20-22 mm, 17-19 mm and 15-16 mm for MICs of 1, 2 and 4 mg/L, respectively. In conclusion, this study, performed on a large number of strains, confirms the superior anti-bacterial activity of levofloxacin compared with ofloxacin, especially against pathogens isolated from respiratory tract infections.
TI  - Evaluation of microbial hazards during processing of Spanish prepared Flamenquin.
AB  - Flamenquin is a traditional, prepared, frozen meat product from the south of Spain made with minced pork, chicken, and cooked ham. Since it is a prepared raw meat product some microbial hazards could be associated with the process of making it. Microbiological analyses have been performed throughout the various steps of processing over a 1-year period to evaluate microbial hazards in the commercial process. High levels of microorganisms were observed all through the processing of this product, the mincing and mixing steps being where major microbial contamination was observed. Pathogenic bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were detected during processing. Raw materials and food handlers were the principal sources of microbial contamination. A modification of processing to include a heating step after mincing and mixing and an improvement in hygiene practices could eliminate the microbial hazards. Both modifications should be noted for the implementation of a hazard analysis of critical control points (HACCP) program in commercial flamenquin processing.
TI  - MEN 10700, a new penem antibiotic: in-vitro activity and its correlation with beta-lactamase stability, PBP affinity and diffusion through the bacterial cell wall.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of MEN 10700, a novel penem, was compared with that of imipenem, ritipenem, ampicillin/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin against 1088 strains taken from 21 genera, including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that MEN 10700 was very active against staphylococci and streptococci (MIC90 < or = 0.5 mg/L) and against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90 < or = 2 mg/L), with reduced activity only against Providencia stuartii (MIC90 = 8 mg/L). MEN 10700 was also active against anaerobic species such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis as well as Moraxella catarrhalis. It was moderately active against Enterococcus faecalis and inactive against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Aeromonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Its antibacterial spectrum was thus slightly narrower than that of imipenem, but compared favourably with those of a third-generation cephalosporin and ritipenem. MEN 10700 was highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases and was a poor inducer of class I enzymes. It bound penicillin-binding protein 2 with the highest affinity and easily permeated the outer membrane of Escherichia coli.
TI  - Synergistic activity of trovafloxacin with other agents against gram-positive and -negative organisms.
AB  - The synergistic activity of trovafloxacin with other agents against 55 Gram-positive and -negative bacteria was determined by checkerboard titration. Synergistic fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) indices (< or = 0.5) were seen in two methicillin-susceptible and one methicillin-resistant Staphyloccocus aureus with teicoplanin, one of each of the latter two with vancomycin; one methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus with rifampin and one with fusidic acid; five Stenotrophomonas maltophilia with cefoperazone; three Pseudomonas aeruginosa with ticarcillin/clavulanate, four with aztreonam, two with ceftazidime, one with tobramycin, one with cefoperazone, and one with ceftriaxone; one pneumococcus with ceftriaxone; one Enterococcus faecalis with ceftriaxone, and one with vancomycin; two Bacteroides fragilis with metronidazole, two with clindamycin, and one with cefoxitin; and one Clostridium perfringens with metronidazole and one with clindamycin. All other FIC indices were additive/indifferent (0.51-2.0), and no antagonistic FIC indices (> 4.0) were observed.
TI  - Comparative sensitivity of 13 species of pathogenic bacteria to seven chemical germicides.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relative resistance of diverse human bacterial pathogens to commonly used germicidal agents has not been established. METHODS: We measured by titration the survival of thirteen different bacteria after exposure to glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde, hydrogen peroxide, peracetic acid, cupric ascorbate, sodium hypochlorite, or phenol. RESULTS: Our comparative experiments allowed classification of the organisms' survival into four groups: (a) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus showed the most resistance, (b) Clostridium perfringens, Salmonella typhimurium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed intermediate resistance, (c) Listeria monocytogenes, Shigella sonnei, and Vibrio parahaemolyticus survived some treatments with chemical agents only in the presence of protecting protein (serum albumin), and (d) Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio vulnificus, Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia enterocolitica did not survive any of the treatments applied. CONCLUSION: We found species that more frequently survived exposure to germicidal agents were also those most commonly reported in association with hospital infections. Our findings suggest that resistance to disinfectants may be more important than pathogenicity in determining the relative prominence of an organism as an agent responsible for nosocomial infections.
TI  - Bacterial phospholipases and their role in virulence.
AB  - Virulence of many bacterial pathogens is based, at least in part, on the action of phospholipases. The consequences may be immediate and direct, as in the action of Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin on red cells or platelets, or subtle, as with phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases of Listeria monocytogenes and other bacteria.
TI  - Role of hemolytic and nonhemolytic phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa for inflammatory mediator release from human granulocytes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pseudomonas aeruginosa phospholipase C (PLC) is a critical component  in the pathogenesis of severe P. aeruginosa infections. However, P. aeruginosa can produce a hemolytic (PLC-H) as well as a nonhemolytic (PLC-N) variant, both having a MW of about 77 kD. In the past, studies did not distinguish between both types of PLC with regard to the induction of inflammatory mediators from human cells. METHODS: We compared the ability of P. aeruginosa PLC-H and PLC-N to generate leukotriene B4 (by HPLC) and oxygen (O2-) metabolites (luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence), and to release beta-glucuronidase and histamine (fluorophotometry from human granulocytes. Therefore, human neutrophilic granulocytes (PMN; 1 x 10(7)) or human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (5 x 10(6)) were treated with purified P. aeruginosa PLC-H (up to 10 units) as well as culture supernatants (cutoff: MW > 50,000) of P. aeruginosa PAOl capable of producing both PLC-H and PLC-N, and PAOl mutant strains deficient in the production of either or both phospholipases. Controls were PLC-H from Clostridium perfringens and PLC-N from Bacillus cereus. RESULTS: PLC-H-containing P. aeruginosa culture supernatant, purified P. aeruginosa PLC-H as well as PLC-H from P. perfringens activated human leukocytes for a significant (p < 0.05) increase in inflammatory mediator release. In this regard, purified PLC-H (10 units) from P. aeruginosa activated human PMN for a significant increase in the generation of oxygen metabolites (30 +/- 5.4 x 10(3) cpm) and in leukotriene B4 (6.1 +/- 2.0 ng), in the release of beta-glucuronidase (15.8 +/- 1.1%) and of histamine (25.8 +/- 6.2%) as compared to the corresponding control values (3 +/- 1 x 10(3) cpm; 0.2 +/- 0.1 ng; 5.1 +/- 1.0%, 5.1 +/- 1.5%). Culture supernatants containing no PLC or only PLC-N, as well as PLC-N from B. cereus, failed to activate or only slightly stimulated human granulocytes for inflammatory mediator release. CONCLUSION: The data thus provide evidence that P. aeruginosa PLC-H can be a potent inducer of inflammatory mediator release, at least in vitro. Our results therefore contribute to the understanding of the pathophysiological role of P. aeruginosa PLCs.
TI  - Collagenase gene (colA) is located in the 3'-flanking region of the perfringolysin O (pfoA) locus in Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - The 3'-flanking region of the beta-galactosidase gene (pbg), which is located downstream of the perfringolysin O gene (pfoA), and the 5'-flanking region of the collagenase gene (colA) of Clostridium perfringens strains NCTC8237 and 13, respectively, were analyzed. Southern analysis revealed that the colA gene is located 6.5 kb downstream of the pbg gene in the chromosome of C. perfringens. Sequence analysis showed that between the pbg and colA genes were the arcABDC and ahrC genes, whose putative products were quite similar to enzymes of the arginine deiminase pathway of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the arginine repressor/activator of Bacillus subtilis, respectively. It is concluded that the genomic structure of the pfoA-colA region consists of pfoR-pfoA-ORF54-pbg-arcABDC-ahrC-colA.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of faropenem, a novel oral penem, was studied in comparison with other beta-lactam antimicrobials against 711 recent clinical isolates including Gram-negative, Gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria. MIC data showed that faropenem was active against most members of the Enterobacteriaceae (MICs < or = 4 mg/L), with reduced activity against Serratia spp. (MIC90 = 32 mg/L). In common with its comparators, faropenem had weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC > 128 mg/L). Faropenem was active against staphylococci, although for MRSA MICs were raised (MIC90 = 2 mg/L) compared with those for MSSA (MIC90 = 0.12 mg/L). Faropenem was also found to be active against streptococci, Neisseria spp., Enterococcus faecalis and beta-lactamase-producing and non-producing strains of Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis. Of the anaerobic bacteria studied, faropenem was most active against peptostreptococci and Clostridium perfringens (MIC90 < or = 1 mg/L) and Bacteroides fragilis (MIC90 = 4 mg/L). An increase in inoculum from 10(4) to 10(6) cfu raised faropenem MICs for Morganella morganii from 0.06-1 mg/L to 2-4 mg/L and for MRSA from 0.25-2 mg/L to 8 mg/L (a similar increase was not observed for MSSA). The MICs of faropenem were not affected by the presence of either 20% or 70% (v/v) serum. MICs for faropenem to 11 well characterized beta-lactamase producers were similar to those of non-producers. In hydrolysis studies, faropenem was shown to be highly stable to a number of beta-lactamases, including TEM-1, SHV-1, the extended spectrum beta-lactamases, TEM-3 and TEM-9, and the beta-lactamase produced by Staphylococcus aureus (NCTC 11561).
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem compared to nine other antimicrobial agents: importance of its stability when used in agar dilution systems.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of meropenem was tested against 426 clinical isolates  representing a wide range of aerobic and anaerobic species. The in vitro activity of meropenem was compared with that of iminpenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, piperacillin and tobramycin against aerobic isolates, and also compared with that of imipenem, metronidazole, cefoxitin, clindamycin and piperacillin against the anaerobic isolates. Meropenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against Gram negative aerobes, anaerobes, Gram positive anaerobes and most of the Gram positive aerobes. The MIC90 of meropenem against the Enterobacteriaceae ranged from 0.03 mg/l to 0.125 mg/l. Meropenem was very active against extended spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, most Acinetobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile (MIC90 of 1.0 mg/l), Clostridium perfringens and other Clostridium species. Even though imipenem exhibited better activity against the coagulase negative staphylococci, meropenem still had MIC's which were less than the break point (8.0 mg/l). The stability of meropenem in agar was determined indirectly by plotting the geometric mean MIC of control strains over a period of two weeks. Mean MIC of six control strains for meropenem was 0.05 mg/l and remained constant over 10 days, whereas the mean MIC of imipenem rose to 0.24 mg/l after two days and to 3.4 mg/l after 10 days. Meropenem was therefore far more stable in agar than imipenem. This has implications for laboratories using agar dilution as it requires less frequent plate preparation and decreased labour costs.
TI  - Management of intra-abdominal infections. The case for intraoperative cultures and comprehensive broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage. The Canadian Intra-abdominal Infection Study Group.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy is superior to limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy in intra-abdominal infections. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study. SETTING: University-affiliated hospitals in Canada. PATIENTS: Two hundred thirteen patients with intra-abdominal infections and planned operative or percutaneous drainage. INTERVENTION: Limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of cefoxitin sodium, 2 g, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 109). Comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy consisted of a combination of imipenem and cilastatin sodium, 500 mg, intravenously, every 6 hours (n = 104). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Failure to cure the intra-abdominal infection (persistence of infection or death). RESULTS: Of initial isolates, 98% were sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium compared with 72% for cefoxitin. No difference was found in the failure rate between treatment groups. Among various reasons for failure (including technical), 12 of 80 patients in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group had resistant organisms at a second intervention compared with 1 of 74 in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group (P < .003, chi 2). One death in the limited-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was due to autopsy-proved disseminated Pseudomonas aeruginosa (blood, peritoneum, lung, and pleural fluid) that was resistant to cefoxitin, and the other was associated with peritonitis due to cefoxitin-resistant Enterobacter cloacae. One death in the comprehensive broad-spectrum empirical antimicrobial therapy group was associated with peritonitis from Clostridium perfringens that was sensitive to imipenem plus cilastin sodium, and the other was associated with peritonitis from Pseudomonas aeruginosa that was resistant to imipenem plus cilastin sodium. CONCLUSION: Treatment failure of intra-abdominal infection may be due, in part, to the presence of resistant pathogens at the site of infection. Therefore, routine culture of these sites seems worthwhile and empirical therapy should be as comprehensive as possible and should cover all potential pathogens.
TI  - Improved immobilization of DNA to microwell plates for DNA-DNA hybridization.
AB  - An improved and simplified protocol for DNA immobilization was developed to enhance DNA-DNA hybridization on microwell plates. Target DNA was immobilized by simple dry-adsorption. Efficiencies of DNA immobilization and retention were enhanced 1.4-6.5 times and 4.2-19.6 times, respectively, compared with a conventional method. The overall hybridization efficiency was increased 3.1-5.2 times. This simple new protocol can reduce the consumption of scarce DNA samples.
TI  - Role of Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase in inflammatory mediator release from human inflammatory effector cells (platelets, granulocytes, and monocytes.
AB  - Previously, we have shown that Pseudomonas aeruginosa lipase and phospholipase C  (PLC), two extracellular lipolytic enzymes, interact with each other during 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE) generation from human platelets. In this regard. the addition of purified P. aeruginosa lipase to PLC-containing crude P. aeruginosa culture supernatants enhances the generation of the chemotactically active 12-HETE from human platelets. Therefore, we analyzed the interaction of purified P. aeruginosa lipase and purified hemolytic P. aeruginosa PLC with regard to inflammatory mediator release from human platelets, neutrophilic and basophilic granulocytes, and monocytes. Purified P. aeruginosa PLC, but not purified lipase by itself, induced 12-HETE generation from human platelets, the generation of leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and oxygen metabolites, enzyme release from human neutrophils, and histamine release from basophils but diminished interleukin-8 (IL-8) release from human monocytes in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of purified lipase enhanced PLC-induced 12-HETE and LTB4 generation, did not influence enzyme, histamine, or IL-8 release, but diminished the PLC-induced chemiluminescent response. Similar results were obtained when the hemolytic PLC from Clostridium perfringens was used instead of P. aeruginosa PLC. For further comparison, we used the well-defined calcium ionophore A23187 and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) as stimuli. Lipase enhanced calcium ionophore-induced LTB4 generation and beta-glucuronidase release but reduced calcium ionophore-induced and PMA-induced chemiluminescence. In parallel, we analyzed the role of lipase in a crude P. aeruginosa culture supernatant containing PLC and lipase. Lipase activity in the P. aeruginosa culture supernatant was inhibited by treatment with the lipase-specific inhibitor hexadecylsulfonyl fluoride, leaving the activity of PLC unaffected. The capacity of "lipase-inactivated culture supernatant" to induce 12-HETE and LTB4 generation was diminished by 50 to 100%. Our results suggest that the simultaneous secretion of lipase and PLC by P. aeruginosa residing in an infected host may result in severe pathological effects which cannot be explained by the sole action of the individual virulence factor on inflammatory effector cells.
TI  - New gene from nine Bacillus sphaericus strains encoding highly conserved 35.8-kilodalton mosquitocidal toxins.
AB  - A new gene encoding a 35.8-kDa mosquitocidal toxin (Mtx3; 326 amino acids) was isolated from Bacillus sphaericus SSII-1 DNA. Mtx3 is a new type of mosquitocidal toxin with homology to the Mtx2 mosquitocidal toxin of B. sphaericus SSII-1, the epsilon-toxin of Clostridium perfringens, and the cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mtx3 gene is highly conserved and widely distributed in both high- and low-toxicity mosquito larvicidal strains of B. sphaericus.
TI  - In vitro activity of the tricyclic beta-lactam GV104326.
AB  - GV104326 is a novel tricyclic beta-lactam (a trinem or, formerly, tribactam). The in vitro activity of GV104326 was compared with those of cefuroxime, cefixime, amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, cefpirome, and ciprofloxacin. GV104326 had in vitro activity generally similar to that of cefixime against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (MIC at which 90% of the isolates are inhibited [MIC90], < or = 2 micrograms/ml), with cefuroxime and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid being 8- to 32-fold less active and with cefpirome being 4- to 8-fold more active against members of this family. The trinem had no activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC90, > 128 micrograms/ml) but was the most active agent against Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. GV104326 was particularly active against gram-positive cocci. Ninety percent of methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains were susceptible to 0.03 microgram of GV104326 per ml, making it the most active agent studied. Enterococci and Lancefield group A and B streptococci were generally equally or somewhat more susceptible to GV104326 than they were to amoxicillin. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were highly susceptible to GV104326, and those strains which showed decreased susceptibility to penicillin were generally twofold more susceptible to the trinem than to amoxicillin. Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis were highly susceptible to GV104326 (MIC90s, 0.12 and 0.03 microgram/ml, respectively). The anaerobes Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, and Peptostreptococcus spp. were more susceptible to the trinems (formerly tribactams) than to the other agents studied.
TI  - A Bacillus sphaericus gene encoding a novel type of mosquitocidal toxin of 31.8 kDa.
AB  - A size-fractionated genomic library of Bacillus sphaericus strain SSII-1 was constructed and screened for toxicity against larvae of the mosquito Culex quinquefasciatus (Cq). One toxin-producing clone, pS35, was identified and a 2.7-kb subclone was completely sequenced. An open reading frame of 879 bp encoding a 31.8-kDa protein (designated Mtx2) was identified. Purified, recombinant Mtx2 was toxic to Cq larvae. Mtx2 shows no significant homology to known insecticidal toxins, but has homology to two toxins active against mammalian cells, namely the epsilon-toxin of Clostridium perfringens and the cytotoxin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thus, Mtx2 represents a new type of mosquitocidal toxin.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of quinupristin/dalfopristin. Rationale for clinical use.
AB  - Most Gram-positive organisms are highly susceptible to the streptogramin, quinupristin/dalfopristin (RP 59500; Synercid). Minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of isolates (MIC90) were < or = 1 mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, S. haemolyticus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. pyogenes and Listeria monocytogenes. Importantly, quinupristin/dalfopristin shows similar activity against methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains of S. aureus, and streptococci with benzylpenicillin (penicillin G)- or erythromycin-acquired resistance. Enterococci have varying susceptibility to quinupristin /dalfopristin, although most isolates tested are susceptible to the drug, including vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant Enterococcus faecium. E. faecalis are generally the least susceptible. Among the Gram-negative respiratory pathogens Moraxella catarrhalis is susceptible and Haemophilus influenzae is moderately susceptible to quinupristin/ dalfopristin; however, Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. are resistant. The drug is active against anaerobic organisms tested, including Clostridium perfringens, Lactobacillus spp., Bacteroides fragilis and Peptostreptococcus. Synergy has been demonstrated in vancomycin-resistant and multiresistant E. faecium, and methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus with the combination of vancomycin and quinupristin/ dalfopristin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin shows antibacterial activity in vivo in animal models of infection, including methicillin-sensitive and -resistant S. aureus infection in rabbits, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae in mice, and erythromycin-sensitive and -resistant viridans group streptococci infections in rats. The drug is rapidly bactericidal against Gram-positive organisms (with the exception of enterococci) at concentrations similar to or within 4-fold of the MIC, and it has a long postantibiotic effect both in vitro and in vivo.
TI  - Assessment of the efficacy of a low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma sterilization system.
AB  - The STERRAD 100 sterilization system (Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd) uses low temperature hydrogen peroxide gas plasma for sterilization of heat labile equipment. The efficacy of the machine was tested by contaminating a standard set of instruments with different organisms and using a filtration method to assess recovery of organisms from the wash fluids of instruments post-sterilization. Experiments were performed under clean (the organism only) and dirty (organism mixed with egg protein) conditions. A parallel study conducted using a 3M STERIVAC ethylene oxide sterilizer could not be completed owing to closure of the ethylene oxide plant. For sterilization of instruments with long and narrow lumens, hydrogen peroxide adaptors are necessary. The STERRAD 100 sterilizer can achieve effective sterilization of heat labile instruments with a reduction of 6 log10 cfu/mL of organisms tested. This method has the advantages over ethylene oxide sterilization of safety, ease of maintenance and no requirement for aeration time.
TI  - E-4695, a new C-7 azetidinyl fluoronaphthyridine with enhanced activity against gram-positive and anaerobic pathogens.
AB  - E-4695, (-)-7-[3-(R)-amino-2-(S)-methyl-1-azetidinyl]-1-cyclopropyl-1,4- dihydro-6-fluoro-4-oxo-1,8-naphthyridine-3-carboxylic acid, is a new fluorinated naphthyridine with an azetidine moiety. The MICs of E-4695 at which 90% of the isolates were inhibited (MIC90s) were 0.06 to 0.5 microgram/ml for gram-positive cocci, including species of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and the MIC90s against gram-negative pathogens such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae (with the exception of Providencia spp. [MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml]) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 0.015 to 0.5 microgram/ml. E-4695 inhibited 90% of the Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis isolates at 0.25 and 4 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against gram-positive cocci the potency of E-4695 was 2- to 8-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin, 4- to 8-fold higher than that of ofloxacin, and 8- to 16-fold higher than that of fleroxacin. Against enteric bacteria and P. aeruginosa the potency of E-4695 was, in general, similar to that of ciprofloxacin and eightfold higher than those of ofloxacin and fleroxacin. E-4695 was four- and eightfold more potent than ciprofloxacin against C. perfringens and B. fragilis isolates, respectively. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin showed similar properties when the effects of pH or magnesium concentration were tested on them. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin had substantial reductions of activity only when pH decreased below 4.8. E-4695 and ciprofloxacin activities were not markedly affected by the presence of 5 or 10 mM Mg2+. The presence of serum and human urine at pH 7.2 decreased the activity of E-4695 between two- and fourfold. After an oral dose of 50 mg/kg of body weight, the maximum level in serum, the biological half-life, and the area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 10 h for E-4695 were 13.2 microgram/ml, 3.3 h, and 45.6 microgram . h/ml, respectively. The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 4 h for ciprofloxacin was 2.3 microgram . h/ml at the same dose. Fifty-percent effective doses (ED50S) against Staphylococcus aureus HS-93 infections in mice were 4.5 mg/kg with E-4695 and 37.6 mg/kg with ciprofloxacin. Infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae 29206 was more effectively treated with E-4695 (ED50, 41,2 mg/kg) than with ciprofloxacin (ED50, 200 mg/kg). The ED50 of E-4695 for infections with Streptococcus pneumoniae 1625 was 132.2 mg/kg; ciprofloxacin was ineffective at 400 mg/kg against this strain. E-4695 was also more potent than ciprofloxacin in treatment of infections caused by gram-negative organisms such as Escherichia coli HM-42 (ED50S, 1.0 and 3.9 mg/kg, respectively). The ED50S of E-4695 and ciprofloxacin were 33.0 and 145.5 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa HS-116 and 9.6 and 18.9 mg/kg against P. aeruginosa B-120, respectively. The therapeutic efficacy of E-4695 may depend not only on its in vitro activity but also on its improved pharmacokinetic properties.
TI  - Growth conditions influence expression of cell surface hydrophobicity of staphylococci and other wound infection pathogens.
AB  - The initial adhesion of microbes to tissue and solid surfaces can be mediated by  hydrophobic interaction. Expression of microbial cell surface hydrophobicity (CSH) is influenced by growth conditions, and often best expressed after growth under nutrient-poor conditions, or "starvation". In the present study, the CSH of 133 strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus faecalis, group A streptococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptococcus magnus, and of 8 Candida albicans strains was measured by the salt aggregation test after growth on hematin agar in a 5% CO2 atmosphere, or under anaerobiosis. Cells of all but 8 strains expressed pronounced or moderate CSH, i.e., they aggregated in 0.01-2 M ammonium sulfate. When the agar surface was covered by human serum (diluted 1:5) to mimic growth conditions in a wound, 94 strains expressed higher CSH, and 44 strains the same CSH as after growth without serum. The CSH of 12 strains of different species was measured after growth on blood, hematin and PDM agar, with or without serum, and in an aerobic or a 5% CO2 atmosphere. The highest CSH was expressed after growth in 5% CO2 with serum, and the lowest growth after on blood agar in aerobic atmosphere. Identical results were obtained with native and heat-inactivated (56 C, 20 min) serum. The reduced surface tension obtained in 5% CO2, as well as yet unidentified serum factors, promotes expression of CSH.
TI  - Cloning and sequencing of a 36-kb region of the Bacillus subtilis genome between  the gnt and iol operons.
AB  - Within the framework of an international project for the sequencing of the entire Bacillus subtilis genome, a 36-kb chromosome segment, which covers the region between the gnt and iol operons, has been cloned and sequenced. This region (36447 bp) contains 33 complete open reading frames (ORFs; genes) including the four gnt genes and one partial gene. A homology search for the products of the 33 complete ORFs revealed significant homology to known proteins in 16 of them such as tetracycline resistance protein (Clostridium perfringens), asparagine synthetase (Arabidopsis thaliana), aldehyde dehydrogenase (Pseudomonas oleovorans), 2,5-dichloro-2,5-cyclohexadiene-1, 4-diol dehydrogenase (P. paucimobilis), heat shock protein HtpG (Escherichia coli), galactose-proton symporter (E. coli), auxin-induced protein (common tobacco), glucitol operon repressor (E. coli) and methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (P. aeruginosa). Unlike the regions we sequenced so far, this region contained two short sequence multiplications: one was a tandem sequence duplication (409 and 410 bp), and the other a triplication consisting of two highly conserved 118-bp tandem sequences preceded by a less conserved similar sequence (129 bp). The reasons for the presence of these sequence multiplications in the gnt to iol region were deduced.
TI  - Induction of inflammatory mediator release (12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid) from human platelets by Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - The role of platelets in acute and chronic infection has been widely discussed in various disease processes. We studied the effects of two lipolytic enzymes (phospholipase C, lipase) secreted by Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with regard to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) generation from human platelets. Both phospholipase C (PLC) and lipase were secreted into the culture supernatant at the end of the logarithmic growth phase. Indeed, only culture supernatants obtained from the late logarithmic/early stationary phase of CF strains induced the generation of 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) (from 15 +/- 9 to 370 +/- 98 ng, n = 7). Purified P. aeruginosa lipase itself generated only small amounts of 12-HETE from human platelets with a maximum of 30 +/- 7 ng/10(8) platelets at the highest concentration tested (20 nkat). A partially purified culture supernatant from P. aeruginosa strain PAO1 containing phospholipase C and lipase, but lacking glycolipid and protease activities, induced time- and dose-dependently a significant 12-HETE generation from human platelets. Maximal 12-HETE generation was observed at the highest enzyme concentrations tested (PLC: 1.35 nkat, lipase: 3.7 nkat/10(8) platelets). To analyze whether lipase exhibits a modulatory role on PLC-induced 12-HETE generation from human platelets we inhibited lipase activity in the P. aeruginosa partially purified culture supernatant by treatment with the lipase-specific inhibitor hexadecylsulfonylfluoride (AMSF) leaving the activity of PLC unaffected (lipase-free culture supernatant). The capacity of lipase-free culture supernatant to induce 12-HETE generation was diminished by up to 100% depending on the PLC activity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Detection by in vitro amplification of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) gene from Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus is described for the specific amplification of the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) gene of Clostridium perfringens. A set of primers selected for their high specificity could detect Cl. perfringens in stools with a detection limit of approximately 5 x 10(2) bacteria, after bi-amplification. A modified PCR without thermal steps was performed to rapidly amplify, with a yield of 60%, the DNA template. With this PCR method Cl. perfringens alpha-toxin gene could be detected within 2 h. The PCR method detected alpha-toxin positive Cl. perfringens but did not react with phospholipase C-producing Bacillus cereus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Cl. sordellii and Cl. bifermentans. The amplified PCR products were screened through ethidium bromide agarose gel electrophoresis or, in only 1 h, with the PhastSystem (Pharmacia). This PCR satisfies the criteria of specificity, sensitivity and rapidity required for a useful tool in epidemiology and for the diagnosis of the pathogen Cl. perfringens as it may be used directly on stool samples.
TI  - Antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin B, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the N-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  - A physiologically diverse range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin B, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. The list of susceptible organisms includes Escherichia coli, Salmonella enteritidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, Yersinia enterocolitica, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens. Concentrations of lactoferricin B required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and the culture medium used. The peptide showed activity against E. coli O111 over the range of pH 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. Its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of Na+, K+, Mg2+ or Ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. Lactoferricin B was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. Pseudomonas fluorescens, Enterococcus faecalis and Bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.
TI  - Antibacterial in vitro-activity of meropenem against 200 clinical isolates in comparison to 11 selected antibiotics.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of meropenem, a new parenteral carbapenem, was tested  in vitro by an agar dilution method against 200 clinical isolates (gram-negative/positive aerobes and anaerobes). Meropenem was compared with imipenem, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin; and metronidazole, cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, vancomycin when appropriate. Meropenem and imipenem exhibited an extended spectrum of activity with low minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs). Only one strain each of Enterococcus faecium and Pseudomonas (Xanthomonas) maltophilia were resistant. Of the carbapenems, imipenem was slightly more active against Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus agalactiae, and staphylococci, but meropenem was obviously more active against enterobacteriaceae and Clostridium perfringens. Both, meropenem and imipenem had similar activities towards Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus, Streptococcus pyogenes and Bacteroides sp. All other antibiotics tested were less potent than the carbapenems with the exception of ciprofloxacin which generally exhibited similar antibacterial activities, except for anaerob microorganisms.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of the new antibiotic vermisporin.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of vermisporin, a new antibiotic produced by fermentation of the fungus Ophiobolus vermisporis, was tested in vitro. Vermisporin inhibited 90% of Bacteroides fragilis and other Bacteroides spp. at 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-1 micrograms/ml). Clostridium perfringens were inhibited by 1 microgram/ml (range 0.25-2 micrograms/ml). Vermisporin inhibited 90% of Staphylococcus aureus, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, at 0.5 micrograms/ml (range 0.12-0.5 micrograms/ml). Vermisporin MICs for group A, B, C, F and G streptococci were < 1 microgram/ml when tested in Haemophilus Test Medium but > or = 8 micrograms/ml in the presence of blood. Vermisporin MICs for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Haemophilus influenzae exceeded 64 micrograms/ml. Inhibited organisms had MBCs 16- to 32-fold above the MICs.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of new streptogramins, RP 59500, RP 57669 and RP 54476, alone and in combination.
AB  - RP 59500 is a 30:70 mixture of RP 57669 and RP 54476. The activity of RP 59500 and its two components against Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was compared with that of clarithromycin, roxithromycin, azithromycin and rokitamycin. RP 59500 inhibited 90% of erythromycin-susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci at less than or equal to 1 mg/L (range 0.06-2 mg/L). Both inducibly and constitutively-resistant strains of S. aureus, as well as strains resistant to rifampicin, gentamicin and ciprofloxacin, were inhibited. Streptococcus pyogenes, including erythromycin-resistant isolates, and group C and G streptococci were inhibited by 0.5 mg/L. Streptococcus pneumoniae and viridans group streptococci were inhibited by 1 mg/L. The MIC90 was 4 mg/L for Haemophilus influenzae and 1 mg/L for Moraxella catarrhalis. RP 59500 did not inhibit Enterobacteriaceae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The activity of RP 59500 against streptococci was less than that of the four other macrolides. Clostridium perfringens strains were highly susceptible, as were Bacteroides spp. RP 59500, when combined with ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime or gentamicin, did not have altered activity against susceptible species or alter the activity of the other component of the combination against susceptible species. MBCs in serum were increased two- to four-fold for S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae and S. aureus, compared with MBCs in broth, but RP 59500 was as active at pH 6 as at pH 7, and there was not an appreciable inoculum effect. RP 59500 has potential use as an agent against inducibly and constitutively erythromycin-resistant isolates of Gram-positive species and selected anaerobic organisms.
TI  - Production of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa neuraminidase is increased under hyperosmolar conditions and is regulated by genes involved in alginate expression.
AB  - The pathogenesis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) is a complex process attributed to specific characteristics of both the host and the infecting organism. In this study, the properties of the PAO1 neuraminidase were examined to determine its potential role in facilitating Pseudomonas colonization of the respiratory epithelium. The PAO1 neuraminidase was 1000-fold more active than the Clostridium perfringens enzyme in releasing sialic acid from respiratory epithelial cells. This effect correlated with increased adherence of PAO1 to epithelial cells after exposure to PAO1 neuraminidase and was consistent with in vitro studies demonstrating Pseudomonas adherence to asialoganglioside receptors. The regulation of the neuraminidase gene nanA was examined in Pseudomonas and as cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. In hyperosmolar conditions neuraminidase expression was increased by 50% (P less than 0.0004), an effect which was OmpR dependent in E. coli. In Pseudomonas the osmotic regulation of neuraminidase production was dependent upon algR1 and algR2, genes involved in the transcriptional activation of algD, which is responsible for the mucoid phenotype of Pseudomonas and pathognomonic for chronic infection in CF. Under the hyperosmolar conditions postulated to exist in the CF lung, nanA is likely to be expressed to facilitate the initial adherence of Pseudomonas to the respiratory tract.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of BAY Y3118, a new full-spectrum fluoroquinolone.
AB  - BAY Y3118, 1-cyclopropyl-7-(2,8-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-8-yl)-6-fluoro-8- chloro-1,4-dihydro-4-oxo-3-quinolinecarboxylic acid hydrochloride, is a new fluoroquinolone with antibacterial activity against an expanded spectrum of species including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and also anaerobes such as Bacteriodes fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. MIC90s for S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. faecalis, and S. pneumoniae clinical isolates were 0.125, 0.25, 0.125 and 0.25 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against methicillin- and/or quinolone-resistant S. aureus, MIC50 levels of BAY Y3118 were 10- to 100-fold lower than those of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, or ciprofloxacin. The potency of BAY Y3118 against all members of the Enterobacteriaceae generally was equal to or 2-fold greater than that of ciprofloxacin or tosufloxacin. BAY Y3118 was also highly active against Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Increasing inoculum concentrations had a minimal effect on MIC determinations. The drug was determined to be bactericidal based upon reference MBCs and time-kill curves. From the results presented here, it was concluded that this new compound surpasses other known 4-quinolones both in spectrum and activity and that its further evaluation by in vitro, in vivo, and clinical studies seems warranted.
TI  - Activity of mersacidin, a novel peptide, compared with that of vancomycin, teicoplanin, and daptomycin.
AB  - Mersacidin, a new peptide antibiotic, was four- to eightfold less active (MIC for 90% of isolates, 8 micrograms/ml) than vancomycin, teicoplanin, or daptomycin against Staphylococcus aureus. Coagulase-negative staphylococci were inhibited by 8 micrograms/ml, and the MICs of mersacidin for hemolytic streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were 4 to 8 micrograms/ml. The mersacidin MICs for anaerobic organisms were as follows: Clostridium perfringens, 4 micrograms/ml; Propionibacterium acnes, 8 micrograms/ml; peptococci, 1 microgram/ml; and peptostreptococci, 8 micrograms/ml. Mersacidin had no activity against members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Neisseria and Haemophilus species, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The size of the inoculum, the pH of the assay (5.5 to 7.5), the type of medium, and the anaerobic conditions had minimal effects on the MICs and MBCs of mersacidin. Overall, mersacidin proved less active than available glycopeptides and peptolides.
TI  - Newly documented antimicrobial activity of quinolones.
AB  - The improved antimicrobial activity of newer fluoroquinolones and novel applications recently found for the drugs already marketed are reviewed. Several new compounds are more active against gram-positive bacteria than the presently marketed fluoroquinolones. WIN 57273, the most potent compound in vitro on a weight basis, is 16 to 128 times more active than ciprofloxacin against various staphylococci, streptococci, Enterococcus spp., Corynebacterium spp., Listeria monocytogenes and Bacillus spp. BMY 40062, PD 117558, PD 127391, sparfloxacin, temafloxacin and tosufloxacin also show enhanced in vitro efficacy against these species. These drugs also possess increased activity against various anaerobes, notably Clostridium perfringens, Clostridium difficile and the Bacteroides fragilis group. Mycobacterium tuberculosis, rapidly growing mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium chelonae, and Mycobacterium leprae are often susceptible to quinolones displaying bactericidal activity which is potentially useful for curing difficult-to-treat mycobacteriosis. In addition, a number of new products, notably those containing a cyclopropyl group, are more active than reference fluoroquinolones against Mycobacterium leprae. Sparfloxacin, BMY 40062 and WIN 57273 compare favorably with older fluoroquinolones in the killing of intracellular Legionella spp., and several of the newer compounds have greater antichlamydial potency. Improved antibacterial activity has also been found against Mycoplasma hominis, Ureaplasma urealyticum, Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas maltophilia. By contrast, the newer quinolones have similar or less activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae. Recently, pefloxacin, ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were found to be active against protozoa, including Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi and Leishmania donovani, but not against Toxoplasma gondii. In the near future, more specific research testing unusual pathogens may lead to the identification of quinolones with more selective activity.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of E-4497, a new 3-amine-3-methyl-azetidinyl tricyclic fluoroquinolone.
AB  - The in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of a new tricyclic fluoroquinolone, E-4497 [S(-)-9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(3-amine-3-methyl-azetidin-1-yl)-7-oxo- 2,3-dihydro- 7H-pyrido-(1,2,3-de)-1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid], were evaluated in comparison with those of DR-3355 [S-(-)-ofloxacin], norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 was more potent than norfloxacin and as potent as or more potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus faecalis. With the exception of Providencia spp., E-4497 inhibited 90% of the Enterobacteriaceae at less than or equal to 0.25 micrograms/ml. Against enteric bacteria, E-4497 was similar in potency to norfloxacin but less potent than DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MICs of E-4497, DR-3355, norfloxacin, and ciprofloxacin for 90% of strains were 2, 2, 4, and 0.5 micrograms/ml, respectively. Against Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis, E-4497 (MICs for 90% of strains, 2 and 8 micrograms/ml, respectively) was two- to fourfold more active than norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin. E-4497 activity decreased moderately in the presence of 10 mM Mg2+. Urine at pH 5.5 caused a significant decrease in activity compared with urine at pH 7.2. However, the presence of serum either had no effect or increased the activity of E-4497. In general, E-4497 was bactericidal at the MIC. In systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice, the protective effect of E-4497 was generally greater than that of norfloxacin and comparable to those of DR-3355 and ciprofloxacin.
TI  - The in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  - For Enterobacteriaceae, MIC50s and MIC90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: Escherichia coli 0.12 and 0.5, Salmonella spp. and Shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, Proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. Klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. Enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, Citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, Serratia marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive Proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and Providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. The activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. Cefodizime was noticeably less active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii with MICs ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. Haemophilus spp. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as N. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC50s and MIC90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). Cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC50 and MIC90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. Enterococci were generally resistant: Streptococcus pyogenes and Str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (MIC50 and MIC90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes, with lower values for Clostridium perfringens (MIC50 and MIC90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for Bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). These results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.
TI  - [Fournier's disease: a report of 9 cases].
AB  - Nine cases of Fournier's gangrene diagnosed between 1982 and 1989 are reported. All were males with a mean age of 76 (47-82 years). Seven had a history of alcoholism and one had non insulin-dependent diabetes. Six patients also had an anal fistula which may have been the starting point of the infection. The causal agents were two anaerobes (Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis) two gram-negatives (Morganella morgagni and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and one, an unidentified gram-positive. In three patients a mixed intestinal flora was isolated and in another no germs were found. All were treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgery. Seven patients survived and two died.
TI  - In vitro activity and beta-lactamase stability of the new oral cephalosporin Bay  v 3522.
AB  - The activity of the new oral cephalosporin Bay v 3522 was compared to that of six other beta-lactam agents. Bay v 3522 inhibited methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis at less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, compared to MICs of greater than or equal to 8 micrograms/ml for the other cephalosporins tested. It was more active against Streptococcus pyogenes (MIC less than or equal to 0.06 microgram/ml) than cefuroxime, cefixime, cephalexin and cefaclor. Groups B, C and G streptococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.12 microgram/ml, while the MI"90 for Streptococcus bovis and viridans streptococci was 0.5 and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. The MIC90 for enterococci and Listeria monocytogenes was 8 micrograms/ml. Clostridium perfringens was inhibited by 0.12 microgram/ml, but most Bacteroides spp. were resistant. The MIC90 for beta-lactamase positive Escherichia coli (producing primarily TEM-1) was greater than 64 micrograms/ml and for beta-lactamase negative strains 16 micrograms/ml. The MIC90 for high-level beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was greater than 64 micrograms/ml versus 4 micrograms/ml for other isolates. The MIC90 for Moraxella catarrhalis was 2 micrograms/ml, for Haemophilus influenzae 1 micrograms/ml, and for Neisseria gonorrhoeae 4 micrograms/ml. Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Proteus mirabilis, Providencia spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were resistant. Bay v 3522 was destroyed by TEM-1, SHV-1, TEM-3 and P99 beta-lactamases.
TI  - Occlusive dressings. Does dressing type influence the growth of common bacterial  pathogens?
AB  - We studied the effect of different occlusive dressings and of air exposure on the growth of four pathogenic bacteria in wounds. Partial-thickness wounds on domestic pigs were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each wound was covered with three dressings (DuoDERM, Opsite, or Vigilon), or left exposed to air. Groups of wounds were sampled at 24, 48, and 72 hours. Staphylococcus aureus reached high levels beneath all of the dressings and in the air-exposed wounds. The numbers of C perfringens and B fragilis were greatly reduced in the air-exposed wounds and slightly reduced in the Opsite-covered wounds. The numbers of P aeruginosa were greatest in the Opsite- and Vigilon-covered wounds. The results indicate that occlusive dressings are not indicated in wounds that clinically appear to be grossly contaminated or that may contain anaerobic organisms.
TI  - [In vitro activity of imipenem against hospital bacteria].
AB  - Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae: the different bacterial groups exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25 micrograms/ml), except for Serratia (0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml), Proteus mirabilis (0.5 micrograms/ml), indole-positive Proteus (2 micrograms/ml) and Providencia (1 mu/ml). The MICs of cefotaxime-resistant strains (cephalosporinase hyperproducing or very broad spectrum betalactamase producing) were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2 micrograms/ml), although resistant strains by decrease of permeability were observed, and against Acinetobacter (mode MIC 0.25-0.5 micrograms/ml). The MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.5) for Haemophilus and from 0.25 to 1 micrograms/ml for Neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of the betalactamase producing status. The MICs for N. meningitidis were less than 0.06 micrograms/ml. Methicillin-susceptible staphylococci had low MICs ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 0.016). The MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely from 0.016 to 64 micrograms/ml and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci and pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008 to 0.03 micrograms/ml). The MICs for enterococci varied from 0.12 to 32 micrograms/ml (mode MIC 1-2). With the exception of Clostridium difficile, anaerobic bacteria were inhibited by concentrations lower than 1 (mode MIC 0.06 for C. Perfringens and 0.03 for Bacteroides fragilis).
TI  - In vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, a dual-action cephalosporin, compared with activities of other antibiotics.
AB  - The in vitro activity of Ro 23-9424, which is desacetyl-cefotaxime linked to fleroxacin, was compared with the activities of cefotaxime, desacetyl-cefotaxime, fleroxacin, ofloxacin, and ciprofloxacin. It inhibited the majority of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae, except for some Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter freundii, and Enterobacter cloacae strains, at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml and had an MIC for 90% of strains tested (MIC90) of 8 micrograms/ml against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Most group A, B, C, and G streptococci and Streptococcus pneumoniae were inhibited at less than or equal to 0.25 microgram/ml. Ninety percent of the staphylococci were inhibited at less than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml, except for some methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates. The MIC90S of Ro 23-9424 for Enterococcus faecalis and Listeria monocytogenes were greater than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml. Ninety percent of Clostridium perfringens isolates were inhibited by less than or equal to 2 micrograms/ml, whereas Bacteroides fragilis had an MIC90 of 32 micrograms/ml. There was a minimal inoculum size effect. The MICs and MBCs were either identical or within a twofold dilution. The MICs of Ro 23-9424 for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Citrobacter freundii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus increased 16- to 128-fold after 2 weeks of transfer in the presence of Ro 23-9424, showing that the presence of two agents does not prevent resistance.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in patients with bacteremic infections. The Spanish Group for the Study of Ciprofloxacin.
AB  - The efficacy and safety of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of 68 episodes of bacteremia were studied. Patients were treated intravenously (30 cases), orally (13 cases), or with sequential intravenous/oral therapy (25 cases). Intravenous doses ranged from 200 to 400 mg per day and oral doses ranged from 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day. According to the criteria of McCabe and Jackson, 39 cases had nonfatal and 29 had ultimately fatal underlying diseases. The clinical condition of patients at the start of therapy was critical or poor in 40 cases and fair or good in 28. Sixty-four of the 68 episodes of bacteremia were monomicrobial and the remaining four were polymicrobial. The causative micro-organisms were: Escherichia coli (18 episodes), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 episodes), Acinetobacter sp. (10 episodes), Salmonella sp. (seven episodes), Enterobacter sp. (six episodes), Proteus sp. (four episodes), Serratia sp. (four episodes), Haemophilus influenzae (three episodes), Klebsiella sp. (three episodes), Staphylococcus aureus (2 episodes), and Morganella morganii (two episodes). Overall clinical efficacy of ciprofloxacin was 94 percent (64 of 68 patients). Bacteremia persisted in four patients (failure rate of 6 percent). Five organisms persisted: Acinetobacter sp. (two patients), P. aeruginosa (one patient), Enterobacter sp. (one patient), and Serratia sp. (one patient). Side effects were phlebitis associated with intravenous administration (four cases), dizziness (four cases), and superinfection (six cases). Superinfecting organisms and sites were as follows: Enterococcus faecalis, wound (2 cases); Candida sp., urinary tract infection (one case); Acinetobacter anitratus (ciprofloxacin resistant), urinary tract infection (one case); Staphylococcus epidermidis, blood (one case); and Clostridium perfringens, blood (one case). Ciprofloxacin administered either intravenously, orally, or intravenously followed by the oral route is effective therapy in the treatment of severe bacteremic infections.
TI  - Standardisation of quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early detection of bacteria in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood cultures with strains of aerobic, facultative and obligate anaerobic bacteria were studied by quantitative direct gas liquid chromatography for early diagnosis of bacteraemias. Small amounts of volatile and nonvolatile fatty acids were detected in uninoculated blood cultures. Bacteroides fragilis produced acetic (27.6 mumol/ml), propionic (1.0 mumol/ml), isovaleric, (0.6 mumol/ml), lactic (4.5 mumol/ml) and succinic (2.7 mumol/ml) acids after 48 h. Blood cultures inoculated with Clostridium perfringens and Fusobacterium nucleatum produced large amount of butyric acid (2.5 and 18.8 mumol/ml respectively) along with acetic, propionic, lactic and succinic acids on day 2 of incubation. Blood cultures with Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Staphylococcus aureus, beta-haemolytic streptococci (group A) produced only acetic, lactic and succinic acids. Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced only small amounts of succinic (0.6 mumol/ml) and acetic acids (2.4 mumol/ml) on day 5 of incubation. Blood cultures inoculated with anaerobic bacteria produced multiple volatile fatty acids within 24 to 48 h of incubation. Since these acids could be detected earlier than the organism in cultures, they may be useful in the early diagnosis of anaerobic bacteraemias/septicaemias.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of the new oral penem ALP-201 against aerobic and anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the new penem derivative ALP-201 against 226 aerobic and 350 anaerobic clinical bacterial isolates was determined using agar dilution techniques. For comparison amoxicillin, cefaclor, ceftazidime, doxycycline, erythromycin, imipenem and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were also tested with aerobic bacteria, and cefoxitin, chloramphenicol, clindamycin, imipenem, metronidazole and piperacillin with anaerobic bacteria. ALP-201 was found to be highly active against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Haemophilus influenzae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, anaerobic cocci, Propioni-bacterium acnes, Clostridium perfringens, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides spp. and fusobacteria. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium difficile were resistant to ALP-201. When tested against aerobic bacteria using a high inoculum or using the broth dilution technique, the activity of ALP-201 showed little dependence on inoculum size and the bactericidal activity was similar to the inhibitory activity. Further investigations are warranted with ALP-201, which is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract after oral administration.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of AT-4140, a new broad-spectrum quinolone.
AB  - AT-4140, 5-amino-1-cyclopropyl-6,8-difluoro-1,4-dihydro-7-(cis-3,5- dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-4-oxoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid, showed broad and potent antibacterial activity. Its MICs for 90% of the strains tested were 0.1 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against gram-positive organisms, such as members of the genera Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, and Enterococcus, and 0.0125 to 1.56 micrograms/ml against gram-negative organisms, such as members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and the genera Pseudomonas, Branhamella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, and Neisseria. Its MICs were 0.025 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against glucose nonfermenters, such as members of the genera Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Alcaligenes, Moraxella, Flavobacterium, and Brucella; 0.2 to 0.78 micrograms/ml against anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens and Bacteroides fragilis; 0.0125 to 0.05 micrograms/ml against Legionella spp.; 0.0125 to 0.2 micrograms/ml against Mycoplasma spp.; 0.031 to 0.063 micrograms/ml against Chlamydia spp.; and 0.1 to 0.3 micrograms/ml against Mycobacterium spp. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-negative organisms were comparable to those of ciprofloxacin and higher than those of ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin. The potencies of AT-4140 against gram-positive organisms, glucose nonfermenters, anaerobes, Mycoplasma spp., Chlamydia spp., and Mycobacterium spp. were generally higher than those of the quinolones with which AT-4140 was compared. AT-4140 showed good oral efficacy against systemic infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice. Its efficacy was better when a daily dose was given once than when it was given in two doses. Good efficacies of the orally administered drug were also observed in pulmonary, dermal, and urinary tract infection models in mice. The in vivo efficacies of AT-4140 were equal to or better than those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, enoxacin, and norfloxacin.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  - Lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. In this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated antimicrobials. Lomefloxacin was very active against Enterobacteriaceae (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (MIC90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of Enterococcus faecalis (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). In common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of Neisseria spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Haemophilus spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Legionella spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), Vibrio spp. (MIC90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and Campylobacter jejuni (MIC90, 1 microgram/ml). Lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of Bacteroides spp. (MIC90, 16 micrograms/ml) or Clostridium difficile MIC90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of Clostridium perfringens (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), Peptostreptococcus spp. (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Chlamydia trachomatis (MIC90, 4 micrograms/ml), Mycoplasma hominis (MIC90, 2 micrograms/ml), and Urea-plasma urealyticum (MIC90, 8 micrograms/ml). Lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the MIC with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of Escherichia coli and S. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the MIC. These results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by S. aureus.
TI  - Bacterial overgrowth in the jejunum of ICR mice and Wistar rats orally administered with a single lethal dose of fusarenon-X, a trichothecene mycotoxin.
AB  - A single oral dose of fusarenon-X (F-X), a trichothecene mycotoxin, resulted in abnormal microflora in the jejunum in ICR mice and Wistar rats with some differences in dose response between the species. In the acute phase, enterobacteria, streptococci, Clostridium perfringens and bacteroides showed remarkably increased counts in the jejunum of mice and rats dosed with F-X while lactobacilli showed a decrease in count. F-X brought an invasion of Pseudomonas aeruginosa into the livers, lungs, kidneys and spleens of ICR mice. Changes in the jejunal microflora appeared after 7 h in ICR mice and after 24 h in Wistar rats after a single oral dose of F-X of 7.5 and 4.0 mg/kg b.w., respectively, and the microflora returned to its normal state at 72 h in mice and 96 h in rats. The changes of intestinal microflora were followed by alterations in the growth curves of both animal species. The pH in the glandular stomach was also greatly enhanced before changes in the jejunal microflora. Acute F-X intoxication may be an involved manifestation of essential cytotoxicity of F-X mycotoxin alone and secondary bacterial overgrowth in the bowel.
TI  - Molecular cloning and nucleotide sequence of the alpha-toxin (phospholipase C) of Clostridium perfringens.
AB  - A fragment of DNA containing the gene coding for the phospholipase C (alpha-toxin) of Clostridium perfringens was cloned into Escherichia coli. The cloned DNA appeared to code only for the alpha-toxin and contained both the coding region and its associated gene promoter. The nucleotide sequence of the cloned DNA was determined, and an open reading frame was identified which encoded a protein with a molecular weight of 42,528. By comparison of the gene sequence with the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein, a 28-amino-acid signal sequence was identified. The gene promoter showed considerable homology with the E. coli sigma 55 consensus promoter sequences, and this may explain why the gene was expressed by E. coli. The cloned gene product appeared to be virtually identical to the native protein. A 77-amino-acid stretch that was close to the N terminus of the alpha-toxin showed considerable homology with similarly located regions of the Bacillus cereus phosphatidylcholine, preferring phospholipase C and weaker homology with the phospholipase C from Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of clove oil dispersed in a concentrated sugar solution.
AB  - Essential oil of clove, dispersed (0.4% v/v) in a concentrated sugar solution, had a marked germicidal effect against various bacteria and Candida albicans. Staphylococcus aureus (five strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, and Escherichia coli inoculated at a level of 10(7) cfu/ml, and C. albicans (inoculum 4.0 x 10(5) cfu/ml) were killed (greater than 99.999%) after 2-7 min in a laboratory broth supplemented with 63% (v/w) of sugar, and containing 0.4% (v/w) of essential oil of clove. Added organic matter (i.e. human or bovine serum) did not impair its antimicrobial activity. Sugar was not necessary for the antimicrobial activity of clove oil, but the concentrated sugar solution provided a good vehicle for obtaining an oil dispersion that is relatively stable for certain practical applications.
TI  - Bacteriological findings in patients with bone marrow transplantation (Karl Marx  University Leipzig, 1985-1987).
AB  - The results of the bacteriological surveillance cultures for 26 patients with bone marrow transplantation (Karl Marx University Leipzig, G.D.R., 1985-1987) are presented. 5.9% of all surveillance cultures contained facultatively pathogenic germs (with Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the most frequent representative, which was the reason of a sepsis in two patients). Coagulasenegative Staphylococci and other germs with an obscure pathogenicity were isolated upon a large scale, especially from the mucous membrane regions. There are hints, that above all special strains of coagulasenegative Staphylococci "colonize" the patient's body (also for longer periods) and turn into the blood too. During the total decontamination intestinal anaerobic flora is absent. After closing of total decontamination Clostridium perfringens is the first detectable anaerobic species. During the selective decontamination systemic applications of antibiotics are able to obliterate anaerobic findings for certain periods. Recommendations for an effective arrangement of the surveillance cultures of bone marrow transplantation patients are given.
TI  - Microbiological and virological analysis of water from two water filtration plants and their distribution systems.
AB  - The microbial flora of the water produced by two water filtration plants and their drinking water distribution system were evaluated: the Pont-Viau (PV) and the Repentigny (RE) water filtration plants. Untreated water entering the plants contained 3.6 (PV) and 16.8 most probable number of infectious units (mpniu)/L (RE) enteric viruses and total coliform bacteria counts were 300,000 (PV) and 500,000 cfu/L (RE). Treated water leaving the plant was essentially free of all the bacterial indicators measured (total, stressed, and fecal coliforms; Aeromonas hydrophila; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Clostridium perfringens; enterococci) as well as of human enteric viruses. Heterotrophic plate counts at 20 and 35 degrees C were low in the freshly treated water leaving the plants, but bacterial regrowth was observed in both distribution systems at all sampling sites. Average counts for the heterotrophic plate count (20 degrees C) were between 10(6) and 10(7) cfu/L and counts were clearly increased with the distance from the plant. The most numerous bacterial genera encountered were Bacillus, Flavobacterium, and Pseudomonas (nonaeruginosa).
TI  - [Aerobic and anaerobic bacterial flora of crural ulcers].
AB  - In a group of 600 patients treated in the Metropolitan Dermatological Hospital in Warsaw bacteriological examination were carried out of swabs from the untreated crural ulcers. In 95% of these cultures growth of pathological aerobic organisms was obtained. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (St. aureus) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus vulgaris, Enterobacter sp and E. coli) prevailed. In 27% of cases the cultured strains were resistant to the generally available antibiotics. In the second group in 70 patients no growth of anaerobes exclusively was noted. Pathological aerobes and anaerobes in the same case were found in 45% of cultures. In the remaining ones pathogenic aerobes were present with a similar frequency as in the preceding group. Of the anaerobes the most frequently cultured species were Gram-negative bacteria such as Bacteroides melaninogenicus, Bacteroides sp, and Bacteroides fragilis. Among pathogenic anerobic cocci Peptostreptococcus and Peptococcus were most frequent. In 2 cases spore-forming anaerobic bacteria (Clostridium perfringens) were obtained. Forty-eight percent of anaerobes were resistant to the commonly used antibiotics.
TI  - Ciprofloxacin in combination with metronidazole.
AB  - Ciprofloxacin has a reduced activity against anaerobic pathogens. Therefore, a combination of ciprofloxacin with an antimicrobial agent active against anaerobes, such as metronidazole, seems to be interesting for the treatment of mixed aerobic/anaerobic infections. High metronidazole concentrations (10 mg/l or 40 mg/l) neither affected the bactericidal efficacy of ciprofloxacin on aerobic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterococcus faecalis, nor on the anaerobic pathogens Clostridium perfringens and Clostridium difficile, as demonstrated by kill-kinetic curves. The same high concentrations, as well as lower therapeutically achievable concentration (2 mg/l or 5 mg/l) of metronidazole in combination with ciprofloxacin were slightly more potent for the tested clostridia than ciprofloxacin or metronidazole alone.
TI  - Simplified methods for the microbiological evaluation of bottled natural mineral  waters.
AB  - The conventional methods for the microbiological examination of natural mineral water were compared with a simplified procedure. The results indicate that when indicator micro-organisms are present in water, they may not be detected in the simplified method. An alternative procedure, including the determination of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is suggested.
TI  - Comparative activity of the 4-quinolones.
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the 4-quinolones ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, pefloxacin, difloxacin, A-56620, and CI-934 are consistent world-wide, with allowances for differences in acquired resistance. MICs of these drugs for Enterobacteriaceae correlate with those of nalidixic acid, but resistance to the quinolones is rare if a breakpoint of greater than 2 mg/L is accepted. Most intestinal pathogens are sensitive. Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and other Pseudomonas species except Pseudomonas maltophilia are usually sensitive. Ciprofloxacin is generally the most active of the 4-quinolones against these organisms. All of the new agents have antistaphylococcal activity, but that of norfloxacin and ofloxacin is borderline. Against streptococci, including enterococci and pneumococci, the drugs' activity is moderate or poor. Haemophilus influenzae and Branhamella catarrhalis are very sensitive. Gonococci and meningococci are also highly sensitive to the new agents, but activity against Chlamydia trachomatis and the mycoplasmas is borderline. The organisms associated with nonspecific vaginal infection are not very sensitive. Anaerobes except Bacteroides ureolyticus and Clostridium perfringens are mostly resistant.
TI  - Pathogenicity of Clostridium species with other bacteria in mixed infections.
AB  - The relationship of clostridial isolates with other bacteria in mixed infections  was studied by means of a subcutaneous abscess model in mice. We used 26 isolates of seven clostridial species, two Bacteroides spp., eight Gram-positive facultative or anaerobic cocci and three enteric Gram-negative aerobic rods. Abscesses were induced by all seven Clostridium perfringens and three C. butyricum isolates and by some of the others. Selective antimicrobial therapy experiments showed that enteric Gram-negative rods were of equal or greater significance in the formation of abscesses than were clostridial strains in mixed infections. Enhancement or suppression of each component of the mixed infection was studied by comparing the number of each bacterium to its number when injected alone. Enhancement was observed mainly with C. perfringens in mixed infections. By contrast, other Clostridium spp. were less able to induce enhancement. Clostridium difficile and C. sporogenes often inhibited other bacterial species. This study demonstrated the synergistic and antagonistic relationship between clostridial species and other bacteria.
TI  - Bacteremia and fungemia in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome.
AB  - Forty-nine episodes of bacteremia and fungemia occurred in 38 of 336 patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome seen at our institution since 1980. There were five types of infections. Infections commonly associated with a T-cell immunodeficiency disorder comprised 16 episodes and included those with Salmonella species, Listeria monocytogenes, Cryptococcus neoformans, and Histoplasma capsulatum. Infections commonly associated with a B-cell immunodeficiency disorder included those with Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae. Infections occurring with neutropenia were caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus faecalis. Other infections occurring in the hospital were caused by Candida albicans, Staphylococcus epidermidis, enteric gram-negative rods, Staphylococcus aureus, and mixed S. aureus and group G streptococcus. Other infections occurring out of the hospital included those with S. aureus, Clostridium perfringens, Shigella sonnei, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and group B streptococcus. Because two thirds of the septicemias were caused by organisms other than T-cell opportunists, these pathogens should be anticipated during diagnostic evaluation and when formulating empiric therapy.
TI  - Opportunistic infections in hysterectomy-derived, barrier-maintained guinea pigs.
AB  - Guineapigs were rederived by hysterectomy and associated with a colonization-resistant enteric microflora (CRF) of mouse origin to establish a strict barrier-maintained breeding colony. Infections were suspected in 55 of 209 animals autopsied. From 65 of 67 tissue samples selected for bacteriological examination 167 isolates, belonging to 16 usually non-pathogenic bacterial species or groups, were isolated mostly from cases of mastitis, typhlitis, enteritis, otitis media and pneumonia. Faecal streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, Citrobacter spp., C. freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca and Enterobacter cloacae accounted for 86.8% of all isolates. Variations in the recovery rate of these 8 species during the study and a gradual decline in the incidence of infections were observed. Elimination by rederivation of the autochthonous bacterial flora seemed to have predisposed to opportunistic infections by aerobic and facultatively anaerobic bacteria. Enteric colonization resistance to the growth of these bacteria was presumably insufficiently provided by the CRF of mouse origin and might be remedied by using a flora of guineapig origin.
TI  - The antagonism of tetracycline and ferric iron in vivo.
AB  - To test the hypothesis that the in-vivo antibiotic action of tetracycline might be affected by ferric iron and the enhancement of infection by ferric iron by tetracycline, the actions of intraperitoneal antibiotic and local ferric ammonium citrate, given separately and together, were measured in the dorsal skin of guinea-pigs bearing lesions due to staphylococci, streptococci, a Proteus sp., an Erysipelothrix sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Tetracycline, given in two intraperitoneal doses of 25 mg/kg at 0 and 2 h after intracutaneous challenge, maintained plasma concentrations of 4-6 micrograms/ml for more than the first 4 h of infection, after which the local lesions had become largely insusceptible to the antibiotic. The intracutaneous injection of Fe 10 micrograms in a volume of 0.1 ml containing the bacteria was sufficient to enhance infection by those strains susceptible to this effect. The in-vivo efficacy of tetracycline was not always related to low MIC; a low MIC was sometimes associated with little action and a high MIC with moderate action. Sixteen organisms were tested. The iron diminished the tetracycline effect only feebly with one staphylococcal strain and the strain of E. rhusiopathiae. In only one case, with a strain of Proteus sp., was the tetracycline action grossly diminished. On the other hand, tetracycline diminished the enhancement effect of iron moderately with three strains of staphylococci and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and C. perfringens, and strongly with two strains of staphylococci, a group-C streptococcus and one strain each of K. pneumoniae, E. rhusiopathiae and A. hydrophila. It is evident that the diminution of tetracycline action by moderate excess of readily available Fe , whether endogenous or administered, is an unlikely event (three instances among the 16 tested) whereas the diminution of the infection-enhancing effect of iron by tetracycline is much more likely (12 instances among the 16). Insofar as a decrease in iron available for enhancement of infection is valid evidence of a diminution of the iron available for necessary physiological processes of the subject treated, our results suggest that these processes might be affected by tetracycline.
TI  - [Multicenter study of the in vitro effect of imipenem (N-formimidoyl-thienamycin) on hospital bacteria].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of imipenem were evaluated by agar dilution for 2 895 bacterial strains isolated in 9 hospitals. Imipenem proved highly active against Enterobacteriaceae, with an MIC less than or equal to 0.25 for 63% of the 1 556 tested strains, less than or equal to 1 for 89.6% and less than or equal to 4 for 99%. The different groups of Enterobacteriaceae exhibited similar mode MICs (0.12 to 0.25), with the exception of Serratia (0.25-0.5), P. mirabilis (0.5), indole-positive Proteus (2), and Providencia (1). MICs of most cefotaxime-resistant strains were within the susceptibility range. Imipenem also exhibited satisfactory activity against P. aeruginosa (mode MIC 1-2) and Acinetobacter sp. (mode MIC: 0.25-0.5). MICs ranged from 0.03 to 4 (mode MIC: 0.5) for Haemophilus sp. and 0.25 to 1 for Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase-production status. MICs for Meningococci were less than or equal to 0,06. Methicillin-susceptible Staphylococci had low MICs, ranging from 0.008 to 0.5 (mode MIC : 0.016); MICs for methicillin-resistant strains varied widely, from 0.016 to 64, and were higher after incubation at 30 degrees C. Streptococci, except for Enterococci, and Pneumococci were highly susceptible (usually 0.008-0.03); MICs for Enterococci varied from 0,12 to 32 (mode MIC: 1-2). Except for four C. difficile strains, all tested anaerobic strains were inhibited by concentrations less than or equal to 1 (mode MICs: 0.06 for C. perfringens and 0.03 for B. fragilis).
TI  - [In vitro activity of ceftriaxone on hospital bacteria. Results of a multicenter  study].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftriaxone were determined by agar dilution for 2 099 strains isolated in six teaching hospitals. MICs were less than 1 microgram/ml for the great majority of Enterobacteriaceae, with mode MICs varying across groups from less than 0.008 micrograms/ml for Proteus (mirabilis and indole-positive) to 0.25 for Enterobacter. Only a few resistant strains were found, mainly among Enterobacter and Citrobacter. Ceftriaxone proved noticeably less active against P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter (mode MICs: 16 micrograms/ml). Haemophilus sp. and Gonococci, regardless of beta-lactamase production status, as well as Neisseria meningitidis, were highly susceptible (MIC less than 0.008-0.032). Ceftriaxone was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (MIC: 2 to 8 micrograms/ml) and failed to inhibit methicillin resistant strains. Enterococci were slightly susceptible or resistant, whereas the other Streptococci and Pneumococci had low MICs (0.03-0.25). A fairly wide range of MICs was found for anaerobes (Clostridium: 0.06-2, Bacteroides: 0.5-32). Our data show that its particularly strong activity against Proteus, Haemophilus and Neisseria sets ceftriaxone apart from the other third-generation cephalosporins.
TI  - Tracheobronchial mucin receptor for Pseudomonas aeruginosa: predominance of amino sugars in binding sites.
AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a common respiratory tract colonizer and pathogen, adheres to injured tracheal cells and to tracheobronchial mucin. These phenomena suggest that there are specific receptors for this organism in the respiratory tract. The receptor on injured tracheal cells contains n-acetylneuraminic acid as the principal sugar, but the structure of the receptor in mucin has not been described. Using a microtiter plate assay to study bacterial adherence to mucin, we have partially characterized the mucin receptor for P. aeruginosa. The receptor for both nonmucoid and mucoid strains is sensitive to periodate oxidation, suggesting that it is carbohydrate in nature, and the amino sugars n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylneuraminic acid inhibited the adherence of both types of strains. Nonmucoid strains were more sensitive to inhibition by n-acetylneuraminic acid than to inhibition by n-acetylglucosamine, but the mucoid strains varied in their sensitivities to inhibition by each amino sugar. Preincubation of mucin with heat-inactivated influenza A virus (which binds to neuraminic acid) significantly reduced the adherence of P. aeruginosa. Treatment of mucin with Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase also reduced bacterial adherence significantly. Treatment of mucin with pronase did not affect adherence. Our results suggest that n-acetylglucosamine and n-acetylneuraminic acid are important constituents of the binding sites for P. aeruginosa on human tracheobronchial mucin.
TI  - Assessment of head-space gas-liquid chromatography for the rapid detection of growth in blood cultures.
AB  - Blood for transfusion was inoculated with between 10(0) and 10(2) colony-forming  units (CFU) per ml of each of 59 microbial isolates and added to cooked meat broth. At intervals up to 72 h incubation, the cultures were examined by conventional visual inspection and automated head-space gas-liquid chromatography (HS-GLC). Forty-six isolates including all those examined of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, S. faecalis, S. milleri, S. mitior, S. mitis, S. salivarius, S. sanguis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Morganella morganii, Serratia sp., Enterobacter cloacae, Bacterioides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, Candida albicans, C. krusei and Torulopsis glabrata, and three isolates of Staphylococcus epidermidis, were detected by HS-GLC. HS-GLC failed to detect the growth of eleven isolates including all those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. Haemophilus influenzae, Corynebacterium sp. and two isolates of S. epidermidis. The growth of all 59 isolates were detected by visual inspection. No significant difference was found between HS-GLC analysis and visual inspection in the speed of detection of bacterial isolates. All the yeast isolates were detected by HS-GLC after 24 h incubation, indicating that it may be possible to detect fungemias earlier by HS-GLC analysis than by other methods.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Protective role of intestinal flora against infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa in mice: influence of antibiotics on colonization resistance.
AB  - Swiss white mice were given ampicillin, clindamycin, kanamycin, metronidazole, or streptomycin in drinking water for a period of 3 weeks. One week after the initiation of antibiotic administration, the treated mice and untreated control mice were challenged orally with approximately 10(8) viable, streptomycin-resistant (SR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. All five of the antibiotics decreased the resistance of the mice to intestinal colonization with SR P. aeruginosa, as reflected by an increased fecal carriage of the organism and an increase in population levels of SR P. aeruginosa in feces as compared with untreated controls. Metronidazole was least effective in this regard. The antibiotics lowered the dose of SR P. aeruginosa that resulted in implantation in 50% of the mice ID50 to various degrees. Administration of streptomycin, the most effective antibiotic, caused a 10,000-fold decrease in ID50 as compared with untreated controls. Oral inoculation of approximately 10(8) organisms of SR P. aeruginosa resulted in translocation of the organism to the mesenteric lymph nodes, spleens, or livers of 13 or 17 streptomycin-treated mice, 1 of 20 clindamycin-treated mice, and 1 of 14 metronidazole-treated mice. Translocation was not observed, however, in ampicillin- or kanamycin-treated animals. Antibiotic activity was detected in the cecal contents of streptomycin-, kanamycin, and clindamycin-treated mice but not in the cecal contents of ampicillin- or metronidazole-treated animals.
TI  - The activity of enoxacin against clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with that of five other agents, and factors affecting that activity.
AB  - The activity of enoxacin against 362 clinical bacterial isolates in comparison with norfloxacin, nalidixic acid, ampicillin, latamoxef (moxalactam) and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. Typical MICs for enterobacteria lay between 0.12 and 1.0 mg/l. Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. tended to be more resistant. Enoxacin was also active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (mean MIC 0.5 mg/l) and highly active against fastidious Gram-negative aerobes. Typical MICs for Staphylococcus aureus were 1-2 mg/l while streptococci were more resistant (16-32 mg/l). Enoxacin had no useful activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens. Enoxacin was generally more active at pH 8 than pH 6, and in broth than in urine. It was bactericidal in its action. Daily serial passage from growth in broth containing enoxacin caused decreased sensitivity which was limited to four- to 16-fold greater than the original MIC. Enoxacin was about half as active as norfloxacin against enterobacteria, equally active against staphylococci, and some two to four times less active against streptococci.
TI  - Clostridium perfringens bacteremia in prosthetic valve endocarditis. Diagnosis by peripheral blood smear.
AB  - A patient with two prosthetic valves had clinical evidence of infectious endocarditis caused by Clostridium perfringens. The diagnosis was made by routine examination of the peripheral blood smear. To our knowledge, no previous reports have been made of clostridial endocarditis in prosthetic valves with the presence of clostridia in the peripheral blood smear.
TI  - [Recent advances in the molecular mechanism of action of bacterial toxins, in particular of diphtheria, cholera, coli, botulinum and shigella toxins as well as tetanospasmin and the toxins of staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - Great progress was achieved in the clarification of the molecular structure and the mechanism of action of the toxins of pathogenic forms of bacteria. Proportions of toxins of Corynebacterium diphtheriae and of Pseudomonas aeruginosa transfer from the NAD and ADP-ribose protein to an amino acid of the elongation factor 2. Thus the protein synthesis is much inhibited. The cholera toxin and the L-toxin from Escherichia coli have a similar structure. They transfer an ADP-ribose portion from NAD to the GTP-protein of the adenylate cyclase complex, by which means the GTPase activity is reduced. The increase of the cAMP content leads to an increase of the permeability of the cells of the intestinal epithelium. The tetanospasmin decreases the production of the inhibitingly acting neurotransmitters ( glycin ) from intermediate neurons and thus evokes spasms. The botulinum toxin inhibits the release of acetylcholine from the motor end-plates and leads to paralyses. Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium perfringens form among others cytolysins which are injurious to membranes.
TI  - [Effect of the ingestion of wheat bran on the fecal microbial flora of human donors and of recipient gnotoxenic mice, and on the barrier effects exerted by these flora against various potentially pathogenic microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of bran ingestion on the flora of the human digestive tract was studied using two methods: quantitative enumeration of various microbial populations of the faecal flora, and a demonstration of the antagonistic effect exerted by the faecal flora against various potentially pathogenic bacteria of the environment. Since this latter study cannot be effected in human subjects, we used a model constituted by axenic mice inoculated with patients' flora. Faecal samples from 3 human donors receiving bran-containing diets were obtained prior to treatment and 30 days thereafter. These faecal samples were inoculated into axenic mice fed a diet with or without bran. The dominant floras of the human donors, before and after bran ingestion, were highly similar. The faecal floras of the gnotoxenic mice resembled those of the donors and no change resulting from the presence of bran in the diet could be observed. The drastic or permissive barrier effects exerted in the gnotoxenic mice by the human donors against Clostridium perfringens, Staphylococcus aureus, Candida albicans and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were not modified by the presence of bran in the diet. The large variability between animals in the barrier effect against Clostridium difficile masked any possible role of the bran. Study of the transit of Bacillus spores in the digestive tract of various mouse groups showed the existence of differences according to the origin of the inoculated floras, but not according to the presence or absence of bran in the diet.
TI  - The intestinal microflora of infants: composition of fecal flora in breast-fed and bottle-fed infants.
AB  - The fecal flora of 35 breast-fed and 35 bottle-fed babies was determined. Bifidobacteria were the predominant fecal bacteria in both groups. Conversely, the counts of most of the other bacteria, such as bacteroides, eubacteria, peptococci, veillonella, clostridia, enterobacteria, streptococci, and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. The frequencies of occurrence of lecithinase positive clostridia, clostridia-others, pseudomonas and bacilli in the bottle-fed group were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed group. Twenty-one genera and 103 species or biovars of microorganisms were isolated from the feces of the breast-fed group and 20 genera and 97 species or biovars from the bottle-fed group. The organism that showed the highest number and the highest frequency of occurrence in both groups was Bifidobacterium breve. Bifidobacterium infantis, which was formerly the most prevalent Bifidobacterium species in baby feces, was never isolated in this study. Further, the counts and incidences of Clostridium paraputrificum, C. perfringens, and Bacillus subtilis, the counts of C. clostridiiforme, Bacteroides vulgatus, Veillonella parvula, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus bovis, S. faecalis, and S. faecium and the incidences of C. difficile, C. tertium, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the bottle-fed infants were significantly higher than those in the breast-fed infants.
TI  - Effect of erythromycin on microbial antagonisms: a study in gnotobiotic mice associated with a human fecal flora.
AB  - The effect of erythromycin base was studied on intestinal resistance to colonization of gnotobiotic mice inoculated with a human fecal flora and challenged with six microbial strains potentially pathogenic for immunocompromised patients. Fecal concentrations of erythromycin were greater than 1,000 micrograms/g in the human donor and in mice. Total intestinal bacterial counts were not significantly different in the human donor and in the recipient mice and were not affected by erythromycin treatment. Strains of various species from the dominant flora (greater than 10(9) colony-forming units/g) and resistant to greater than 1,000 micrograms of erythromycin/ml were present before and persisted during treatment. Strains sensitive to such concentrations - particularly all enterobacteria-were eliminated. Treatment did not reduce colonization resistance against Candida albicans, Clostridium perfringens, and erythromycin-sensitive Escherichia coli. It reduced but did not eliminate some colonization resistance against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium difficile, and erythromycin-resistant E coli.
TI  - [Determination of in vivo and in vitro toxin activity. I. A new method of determining in vitro activity].
AB  - The potency of 5 toxins of different microbial species has been studied by common in vivo methods and by the in vitro method based on measuring the relative test-microbe growth inhibiting units 50. The possibility of using this method for the determination of toxicity in vitro with a view of studying the potency of diphtheria and gas-gangrene exotoxins, as well as that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin, is substantiated.
TI  - Evidence for mucins and sialic acid as receptors for Pseudomonas aeruginosa in the lower respiratory tract.
AB  - The nature of the receptors for mucoid and nonmucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa was investigated by using adherence to injured tracheal epithelium as a model. Bovine submaxillary mucin and crude rat tracheal mucin inhibited the adherence of both types of P. aeruginosa. Among the sugars present in these mucins only N-aceylneuraminic acid inhibited adherence. Inhibition of adherence probably involved the binding of N-acetylneuraminic acid to the bacterial cells and not to the tracheal cells. The mucoid strain appeared to be much more sensitive to inhibition by N-acetylneuraminic acid. Periodate oxidation and cholera filtrate also reduced the adherence of both strains, but Clostridium perfringens neuraminidase treatment did not alter adherence. A nonmucoid isogenic mutant of an unstable mucoid strain was also inhibited by N-acetylneuraminic acid. These data suggest that the receptor for P. aeruginosa is a sialic acid moiety on cell surfaces or in mucins.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of niridazole. II. Effects on aerobic and anaerobic bacteria].
AB  - Niridazole which is chemically related to metronidazole is endowed with much better antibacterial activity. First, several genera of aerobic bacteria, such as Salmonella and Escherichia, are susceptible to niridazole, whereas metronidazole is completely ineffective. There exist, however, some particular strains which are naturally resistant to niridazole. The in vitro activity of niridazole is still increased, if these facultative anaerobic bacteria are tested under anaerobic growth conditions. Second, niridazole has a higher in vitro activity against anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides spp., Clostridium spp., Fusobacterium spp. and Peptococcus sp., than metronidazole. Extremely low MIC values of niridazole were found ranging from 0.0037 to 0.06 microgram/ml. Propionibacterium acnes, which are resistant to the action of metronidazole, are also relatively resistant to niridazole.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo activity of DL-8280, a new oxazine derivative.
AB  - DL-8280, 9-fluoro-3-methyl-10-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-7-oxo-2,3-dihydro-7H- pyrido-(1,2,3-de)1,4-benzoxazine-6-carboxylic acid, is a new nalidixic acid analog with a broad spectrum of antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, including obligate anaerobes. The activity of DL-8280 against Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and Clostridium perfringens was roughly comparable to that of norfloxacin and far exceeded that of pipemidic acid and nalidixic acid. DL-8280 had greater activity against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Pseudomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter spp., and Bacteroides fragilis than did norfloxacin, pipemidic acid, and nalidixic acid. Nalidixic acid-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin-resistant gonococci, and clindamycin-resistant obligate anaerobes were also susceptible to DL-8280. The activity of DL-8280 was affected very little by inoculum size, and its action was bactericidal at two times the minimal inhibitory concentrations at most. Administered orally to mice experimentally infected with Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Serratia marcescens, or P. aeruginosa, DL-8280 was 2 to 7 times more effective than norfloxacin and 7 to more than 50 times more active than pipemidic acid.
TI  - Enrichment medium and control system for isolation of Campylobacter fetus subsp.  jejuni from stools.
AB  - Enrichment culture with a semisolid medium increased by 6% the isolation rate of  Campylobacter fetus subsp. jejuni. The semisolid enrichment medium was also used successfully as a transport medium for Campylobacter isolates. A blood agar plate streaked with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Clostridium perfringens, and a laboratory strain of Campylobacter was a good control system for the microaerophilic atmosphere. Good growth of all three organisms indicated satisfactory conditions for culturing Campylobacter.
TI  - [Experimental and clinical experiences with the synthetic skin cover of polyvinylalcohol-formaldehyde foam (PVA)].
AB  - Animal experimental research and clinical experience in polyvinylalcohol formaldehyde foam (PVA) as a temporary skin cover: The usefulness of PVA as a temporary skin cover of burns and infected wounds was studied in animals. On the back of 20 pigs full thickness burns were produced and wounds were infected, then examined macroscopically, histologically and bacteriologically over a period of 18 days. PVA showed a better wound cleansing, a significantly reduced bacterial flora and a more rapid growth of the epithelium in comparison with three other materials. The clinical use of PVA in the treatment of compound fractures with a severe damage of soft tissue, of infected wounds and of burns also demonstrated a quick cleansing of the wound and an induction of a dense and vascularised granulation tissue. Thus considerable infections could be avoided and early grafting was possible.
TI  - In vitro activity of LY127935.
AB  - LY127935 is a unique new beta-lactam antibiotic. Its activity against 536 clinical isolates was studied by using microdilution methods of susceptibility testing and compared with the activities of cefamandole, cefoxitin, and cephalothin. The lowest concentrations required to inhibit at least 90% of strains tested (MIC(90)s) of LY127935 for Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae ranged from 2 to 8 mug/ml. The MIC(90)s for other staphylococci and streptococci were higher. The MIC(90)s for Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas species ranged from 0.12 to 8 mug/ml and 8 to >32 mug/ml, respectively. The MIC(90)s for anaerobes ranged from 2 to >32 mug/ml. As determined by MIC(90)s, LY127935 was consistently the least active antibiotic against facultatively anaerobic gram-positive cocci and the most active against aerobic and facultatively anaerobic gram-negative bacilli. Its position with respect to activity against anaerobes varied from being the most active against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridium perfringens to the least active against anaerobic cocci. In a population of multidrug-resistant isolates, concentrations of 8 mug or less of LY127935 per ml inhibited 82% of Enterobacteriaceae; concentrations of 32 mug or less per ml inhibited 100% of Enterobacteriaceae and 40% of P. aeruginosa. Increasing the inoculum size by 100-fold did not increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations of LY127935 or cefoxitin but did increase minimal inhibitory concentrations of cefamandole and cephalothin for some Enterobacteriaceae. All four drugs were bactericidal; minimal bactericidal concentrations were the same or one concentration higher than minimal inhibitory concentrations for 91 to 96% of strains tested. The broad spectrum and marked in vitro activity of LY127935 make it a promising new antibiotic.
TI  - Gastroenteritis: etiology, pathophysiology and clinical manifestations.
AB  - The infectious etiologic agents of gastroenteritis are manifold and have only recently been studied in greater depth. Part of the problem in studies pertaining to diarrhea is the difficulty in identifying fecal "pathogens" among an enormous number of indigenous fecal microorganisms. Finally, the recognition of the pathogenicity of enterotoxins has created an awareness of the complexity of gastrointestinal physiology with host-parasite interactions.
TI  - Qualitative study of paradoxical zone phenomenon of penicillins against 17 bacterial species of clinical importance.
AB  - Using a triple agar layer technique and enzymatic inactivation of penicillin, the occurrence of a paradoxical zone phenomenon (illustrated by a typical 'target' image around the reservoir of antibiotic) was determined for several bacterial species specially chosen with regards to their taxonomic position, clinical importance and penicillin susceptibility. Among gram-positive bacteria, a paradoxical zone was obtained for approximately 43% of the strains studied here (all 10 strains of Staphylococcus aureus, all 10 strains of Streptococcus faecalis, 7 of 10 strains of group B beta-hemolytic streptococci, 1 of 10 group A strains, 3 of 10 strains of alpha-hemolytic streptococci, 3 of 10 strains of Clostridium perfringens but for none of 10 strains each of Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Listeria monocytogenes). Among gram-negative bacteria, a target image was regularly obtained with Haemophilus influenzae (all 10 strains tested) and Proteus species (9 of 10 strains) but with none of the following species: Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Bacteroides fragilis. Therapeutic implications of these observations are difficult to assess, and need further investigation.
TI  - Anaerobes in human biliary tracts.
AB  - During a 2-year period, 1,892 patients underwent biliary tract surgery at the Mayo Clinic. Both aerobic and anaerobic cultures of bile were performed in 371 of these patients. Sixty-nine percent of the cultures were positive, and 41% (117) of these grew anaerobes, although they were present in pure culture only twice. Mixed cultures most commonly contained four different organisms (three aerobes and one anaerobe). Bacteroides fragilis was the single most commonly isolated anaerobe and ranked fourth in terms of overall isolates behind Escherichia coli, group D streptococci, and Klebsiella B. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total group D streptococci, and Klebsiella. B. fragilis accounted for 7.0% of the total aerobic and anaerobic isolates and was present in 21% of all positive cultures. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Clostridium perfringens ranked fifth and sixth, providing 6.5 and 5.9% of all isolates, respectively. This study demonstrates the frequent presence of anaerobes in patients with bactibilia and suggests that they be considered in the formulation of antimicrobial therapy for infections involving human biliary tracts.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of some vinyl-substituted 2-nitroimidazoles.
AB  - In previous studies 1-methyl-2-nitro-1H-imidazole-5-carboxaldehyde and 1-methyl-2-nitro-5-vinyl-1H-imidazole were found to posses interesting antimicrobial activities. We have now prepared some 2-nitro-1H-imidazoles in which the 5-vinyl chain bears selected functional groups (CHO, COCH3, NO2) as well as nitrogen-condensation derivatives of the carbonyl functions. Furthermore, 5-methyl-2-nitro-1-vinyl-1H-imidazole has been synthesized. All the compounds, and some intermediates, have been assayed for antimicrobial activity. Several of them exhibited significant antibacterial and antitrichomonal activity in mice.
TI  - Life and the outer planets I. Performance of terrestrial organisms in ammonia-rich systems.
AB  - Survival and growth of organisms has been demonstrated at 298 degrees K in NH3 atmospheres, including ammonia-methane mixtures. Included are bacteria such as Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, fungi such as Penicillium notatum and Torula utilis. Although the biological response in onion and other species of Allium is limited to germination, standard metabolic poisons were active even in 15 M aqueous NH3, at 250 degrees K. The most extreme example of compatibility between NH3-rich environments and terrestrial life was the retention of metabolic capabilities by conidia of Penicillium after 6 months at 233 degrees K in a liquid ammonia-glycerol medium. Tritiated thymidine, uridine and amino acids were incorporated by these conidia unless subjected to intense gamma-radiation. Observations spanning the past decade suggest that the analogies between H2O and NH3 as solvent media or -OH and -NH2, as functional groups are probably valid. Chemical-biological evolution similar to early terrestrial evolution could be compatible with chemical conditions presumed to exist on the outer planets and some of their satellites.
TI  - Isolation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other bacterial species from ornamental aquarium plants.
AB  - Ornamental aquarium plants were demonstrated to carry as many as 10(8) viable mesophilic bacteria per g. Gram-negative organisms predominated among the 19 genera of bacteria identified. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was readily isolated from 53% of the samples tested.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of oxidized regenerated cellulose.
AB  - It has been demonstrated that oxidized regenerated cellulose promptly and markedly reduces the bacterial census of ten different strains of common pathogens when exposed to them in vitro. This was not true of two other hemostatic agents tested, namely, absorbable gelatin sponge and topical thrombin. Wounds in guinea pigs in which oxidized regenerated cellulose was placed and infected with one of three pathogens had healing per primum in 39 of 40 instances. In similar control wounds and incisions in which absorbable gelatin sponge was placed, sepsis of the wound developed in 19 of 20 of the control group and in 39 of 40 guinea pigs in the absorbable gelatin sponge group.
TI  - [Early bacteriological diagnosis of infections after osteosynthesis (author's transl)].
AB  - Postoperative infections after osteosynthesis belong to the most serious complications in traumatology. Efforts to prevent this danger by routine antibiotic prophylaxis are mainly rejected nowadays. Instead, it is studies whether infections can be diagnosed by bacteriological culture of secretions from Redon drains in patients with osteosynthesis for the purpose of starting an early specific antibiotic therapy. Bacteria were cultured from secretions of wounds in 11.3% of samples from 177 patients. Staph. aureus was found most frequently and was responsible for most of the postoperative infections (Tab. 1).

TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.

All prokaryotic 16S species contained all of the modified oligomers tested, with the sole exception that one such oligomer was missing in Alcaligenes faecalis. The post-transcriptional modifications in all of these oligomers except one appear to occur at the later stagesin ribosomal maturation.

TI  - Inhibition of protease production of various bacteria by ammonium salts: its effect on toxin production and virulence.
AB  - Production of protease by many bacteria was found to be inhibited by ammonium salts, and the enzyme production was more sensitive to the salts than was growth of the organisms. Inhibition of protease production by some pathogenic bacteria may result in the recognition of an exotoxin which otherwise would have been digested by the protease. In the case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, qualitatively different toxicities could be demonstrated in the culture fluids, depending on the presence or absence of protease in such a fluid. The toxicity of the culture in the presence of a high titer of protease may be due primarily to the protease, whereas the toxicity exhibited in the absence of protease could be due to proteinacious exotoxin. Producers of high titers of protease tended to be less virulent in vivo than producers of low titers of the enzyme, which exert their toxicities by a separate exotoxin.

TI  - Collagenolytic activity of bacteria.
AB  - Actively growing aerobic and anaerobic bacteria were screened by a plate assay, with reconstituted guinea pig collagen as a substrate, for their ability to produce a collagenolytic factor. Collagenolytic activity was not demonstrated among the aerobic organisms tested, with the exception of one strain of Staphylococcus aureus (only when grown under anaerobic conditions). Collagenolytic activity, however, was detected in cultures of Clostridium tetani and Bacteroides species other than B. melaninogenicus. Collagenolytic activity of these organisms could be confirmed by measuring the amount of hydroxyproline liberated from the collagen gel during growth. Although collagenase production by Pseudomonas aeruginosa has been suggested in previous reports, our results were negative. An extracellular fraction of P. aeruginosa was able to hydrolyze a synthetic hexapeptide Cbz-glycyl-l-prolyl-glycyl-glycyl-l-prolyl-l- alanine, but was without detectable effect on reconstituted collagen.

AB  - Growing microcolonies of bacteria can be detected by their light-scattering property. We have described a system in which growing bacteria in glass capillaries filled with nutrient agar are counted as the capillaries move through a narrow beam of light. Increased counts after incubation indicate the presence of viable organisms in the original sample; the equipment can detect colonies when they grow to a diameter of 8 microm. Aerobic, anaerobic, and facultative organisms can grow in the capillary environment. The sensitivities of several organisms to antibiotics were determined by adding antibiotics to the agar before the capillaries were filled.

The nucleotidases were found to be very active in Proteus vulgaris, in which organism they were studied in detail. The relative activities, the pH optima, and the effect of metal ions were investigated. It was concluded that bacterial 3- and 5-nucleotidases are distinct and separate enzymes.

AB  - Smith, Rodney F. (University of Maryland, Baltimore), Donald E. Shay, and Norman  J. Doorenbos. Antimicrobial action of nitrogen-containing steroids. J. Bacteriol. 85:1295-1299. 1963.-A new group of 16 synthetic nitrogen-containing steroids have been tested against a variety of microorganisms for antimicrobial properties. The gradient plate screening method, serial dilution, and dry weight techniques were used in the studies. The organisms tested consisted of 14 gram-negative bacteria, 10 gram-positive bacteria, 2 actinomycetes, 7 yeasts, and 8 molds. Inhibitory properties were found to be specific and potent in four compounds, with inhibitory concentrations as low as 0.37 mug/ml. Three of the active steroids are 4-aza cholestanes and one is a 4-nor-3,5-secocholestane amide. Sensitivity to the compounds was greatest in the gram-positive bacteria, followed by the yeasts and molds. The gram-negative bacteria were not inhibited. All 16 steroids interfered to some extent with pigmentation in Serratia marcescens but not with pigment production in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In a few instances, some of the molds were stimulated by the steroids at a concentration of 250 mug/ml.
