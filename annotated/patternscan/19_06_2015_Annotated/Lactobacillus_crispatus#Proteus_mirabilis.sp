TI  == the effects of bee pollen extracts on the broiler chicken's gastrointestinal microflora.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of bee pollen ethanolic extracts on the in vivo gastrointestinal tract microflora colonization of broiler chickens. a completely randomized experiment based on six treatments (different concentrations of bee pollen - 0, 5, 15, 25, 35 and 45 g kg(-1) diet) was used during 7 weeks. the highest count of faecal enterococci was found in the experimental group with the addition of 15 g of pollen (8.85 +/- 0.87 log cfu g(-1)) per 1 kg of feed mixture. the highest count of lactobacilli was detected in the experimental group with 35 g of pollen per 1 kg of feed mixture and the highest number of the enterobacteriaceae genera count was found in the control group (8.43 +/- 0.15 log cfu g(-1)). moreover, the maldi tof ms biotyper identified the following genera: escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, klebsiella  oxytoca, as well as lactobacillus acidophilus, l. crispatus, l. fermentum and l.  salivarius from the lactobacilli group and enterococcus avium, e. casseliflavus,  e. cecorum, e. faecalis, e. faecium, e. gallinarum, e. hirae and e. malodoratus from the enterococci group. additionally, the in vitro antimicrobial activities of pollen against five bacteria species isolated from gastrointestinal tracts of  chickens were tested. the best antimicrobial effect of the pollen extract was detected against k. oxytoca.

TI  == assessment of the capacity of lactobacillus to inhibit the growth of uropathogens and block their adhesion to vaginal epithelial cells.
AB  == to gain insight into the mechanisms by which lactobacillus blocks the adherence of uropathogens to vaginal epithelial cells and inhibits their growth, 15 lactobacillus strains and 22 uropathogens were studied. lactobacilli from hemagglutination group iii, identified as lactobacillus crispatus, showed greater capacity to block uropathogen adherence than those from hemagglutination groups ii and i (61.9%, 49.5%, and 52.6% of blockage, respectively). pseudomonas aeruginosa pa5 and klebsiella pneumoniae kp7 were the uropathogens most susceptible to blockage, and staphylococcus aureus sa11 and proteus mirabilis pm1 were the most resistant. lactobacillus inhibited uropathogen growth better in liquid assays; the 3 lactobacillus groups showed similar inhibitory power (72.3%, 71.9%, and 74.2% of light transmittance). p. aeruginosa pa5 was the most inhibited, and enterococcus species e15 was the least inhibited. there is considerable variation among lactobacillus strains regarding their adherence to uroepithelium, blockage of uropathogen attachment, and inhibition of uropathogen  growth. although these properties are independent, they may coincide and therefore allow for these strains to balance the vaginal ecosystem and to make them useful as probiotics.
