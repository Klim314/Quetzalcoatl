TI  == probiotic bifico cocktail ameliorates helicobacter pylori induced gastritis.
AB  == aim: to determine the protective effect of triple viable probiotics on gastritis  induced by helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) and elucidate the possible mechanisms  of protection. methods: colonization of bifico strains in the mouse stomach was determined by counting colony-forming units per gram of stomach tissue. after treatment with or without bifico, inflammation and h. pylori colonization in the  mouse stomach were analyzed by hematoxylin and eosin and giemsa staining, respectively. cytokine levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and milliplex. the activation of nuclear factor (nf)-kappab and mapk signaling in human gastric epithelial cells was evaluated by western blot analysis. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify tlr2, tlr4 and myd88 mrna expression in the mouse stomach. results: we demonstrated that bifico, which contains a mixture of enterococcus faecalis, bifidobacterium longum and lactobacillus acidophilus, was tolerant to the mouse stomach environment and was able to survive both the 8-h and 3-d courses of administration. although bifico treatment had no effect on the colonization of h. pylori in the mouse stomach, it ameliorated h. pylori-induced gastritis by significantly inhibiting the expression of cytokines and chemokines such as tnf-alpha, il-1beta, il-10, il-6, g-csf and mip-2 (p < 0.05). these results led us to hypothesize that bifico treatment would diminish the h. pylori-induced inflammatory response in gastric mucosal epithelial cells in vitro via the nf-kappab and mapk signaling pathways. indeed, we observed a decrease in the expression of the nf-kappab subunit p65 and in the phosphorylation of ikappab-alpha, erk and p38. moreover, there was a significant decrease in the production of il-8, tnf-alpha, g-csf and gm-csf (p < 0.05), and the increased expression of tlr2, tlr4 and myd88 induced by h. pylori in the stomach was also significantly reduced following bifico treatment (p < 0.05). conclusion: our results suggest that the probiotic cocktail bifico can ameliorate h. pylori-induced gastritis by inhibiting the inflammatory response in gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == acarbose treatment affects the serum levels of inflammatory cytokines and the gut content of bifidobacteria in chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
AB  == background: the effects of acarbose add-on therapy on gut microbiota and inflammatory cytokines were investigated in chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm). methods: ninety-five dm patients were randomly allocated to two groups: 59 to group a who received antidiabetic treatment that included acarbose  150 mg/day, and 36 to group b who received similar treatment to group a but without acarbose. forty-five healthy volunteers were selected as a control group. serum concentrations of inflammatory cytokines were determined by elisa, and the  contents of 16s rdna of gut bacteria were determined by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. general linear analysis for repeated measurements was  used to analyze trend differences between the two diabetic groups. results: after 4 weeks of antidiabetic treatment, the gut contents of bifidobacterium longum and enterococcus faecalis were significantly increased in both diabetes groups. the increase of bifidobacterium longum (p = 0.004) and the decrease of lipopolysaccharides (lps) (p < 0.001) and prothrombin activator inhibitor-1 (p =  0.003) were more significant in group a. decreases of monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and lps were more significant in patients whose hba1c decrease was >/=1%, but there were no significant differences in the changes of other cytokines and gut bacteria between patients with hba1c <7% and >/=7%. pearson correlation analysis showed that changes of enterococcus faecalis were negatively correlated with lps, while multiple linear regression analysis showed a positive  correlation of bifidobacterium longum with acarbose treatment and the high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentration. conclusions: acarbose treatment can increase the content of gut bifidobacterium longum in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and decrease some inflammatory cytokines independently of its antihyperglycemic effects.

TI  == use of selected lactic acid bacteria in the eradication of helicobacter pylori infection.
AB  == helicobacter pylori is among the major pathogenic bacteria that cause chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease and is related to the development of gastric cancer. several chemicals, including antibiotics, have been used to eradicate h.  pylori; however, they do not always curb the infection. ten representative type strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab) were screened for antagonism toward h. pylori via inhibition of urease activity. strains inhibiting the binding of h. pylori to human gastric cell line cells and suppressing h. pylori-induced interleukin-8 (il-8) production were also screened. of these, pediococcus pentosaseus (sl4), which inhibited the adhesion of h. pylori to mkn-45 gastric cancer cells, bifidobacterium longum (bg7), with urease inhibiting activity, and  lactococcus lactis (sl3), and enterococcus faecalis (sl5), which suppressed h. pylori-induced il-8 production within mkn-45 and ags cells, were selected. in mouse model, these lab stains in combination significantly suppressed il-8 levels in serum. gastric ph also recovered to normal values after the administration of  these lab. these stains effectively suppressed h. pylori viability, although not  to the extent of antibiotic treatment. when used as probiotics, lab may help decrease the occurrence of gastritis and reduce the risk of h. pylori infection without, inducing side effects.

TI  == utilization of major fucosylated and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides by isolated human gut microbes.
AB  == human milk oligosaccharides (hmos) are not digested in the proximal intestine. in distal intestine, hmos collectively modify the microbiota, but the response of individual bacteria to individual components of the hmos is not well defined. here, each of 25 major isolates of the human intestinal microbiota was fed individual major fucosylated and sialylated hmos in anaerobic culture. this allowed for an assessment of the influence of specific hmos on the growth and metabolic products of individual microbiota bacteria. most bifidobacteria spp. and bacteroides spp. grew, induced alpha-l-fucosidase activity, and produced abundant lactate or short-chain fatty acids (scfas) when fed 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl), 3-fl, and lactodifucotetraose (ldft). lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830, enterococcus faecalis atcc19433, and streptococcus thermophilus atcc19258 exhibited slight growth, ph reduction, and lactate production when supplemented with 2'-fl or 3-fl, but not ldft. supplementation with 3'-sialyllactose (3'-sl) and 6'-sl promoted moderate growth of bifidobacterium longum jcm7007, 7009, 7010, 7011, 1272, 11347, atcc15708, bacteroides vulgatus atcc8482, and b. thetaiotaomicron atcc29148; accordingly, these bacteria exhibited greater neuraminidase activity and produced copious lactate, scfa, or both. lactobacillus delbrueckii atcc7830 also consumed 6'-sl. in contrast, clostridium spp., l. rhamnosus atcc53103, e. faecalis atcc29200, staphylococcus spp., enterobacter spp., and escherichia coli k12 did not consume milk oligosaccharides nor produce appreciable acidic fermentation products. specific bifidobacteria and bacteroides differentially digest specific individual hmos, with the major fucosylated milk oligosaccharides most strongly stimulating key species of mutualist symbionts. this suggests strategies for treating dysbiosis of the microbiota and associated inflammatory disorders.

TI  == effects of antibiotics on bacterial species composition and metabolic activities  in chemostats containing defined populations of human gut microorganisms.
AB  == the composition and metabolic activities of the human colonic microbiota are modulated by a number of external factors, including diet and antibiotic therapy. changes in the structure and metabolism of the gut microbiota may have long-term  consequences for host health. the large intestine harbors a complex microbial ecosystem comprising several hundreds of different bacterial species, which complicates investigations on intestinal physiology and ecology. to facilitate such studies, a highly simplified microbiota consisting of 14 anaerobic and facultatively anaerobic organisms (bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium longum, bifidobacterium infantis, bifidobacterium pseudolongum, bifidobacterium adolescentis, clostridium butyricum, c. perfringens, c. bifermentans, c. innocuum, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, lactobacillus acidophilus) was used in this investigation. ampicillin [9.2 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to two chemostats  operated at different dilution rates (d; 0.10 h(-1) and 0.21 h(-1)), and metronidazole [76.9 mug (ml culture)(-1)] was added to a third vessel (d = 0.21 h(-1)). perturbations in bacterial physiology and metabolism were sampled over a  48-h period. lactobacillus acidophilus and c. bifermentans populations did not establish in the fermentors under the imposed growth conditions. ampicillin resulted in substantial reductions in bacteroides and c. perfringens populations  at both dilution rates. metronidazole strongly affected bacteroides communities but had no effect on bifidobacterial communities. the bacteriostatic effect of ampicillin on bifidobacterial species was growth rate dependent. several metabolic activities were affected by antibiotic addition, including fermentation product formation and enzyme synthesis. the growth of antibiotic-resistant bifidobacteria in the large bowel may enable them to occupy ecological niches left vacant after antibiotic administration, preventing colonization by pathogenic species.

TI  == antimicrobial potential for the combination of bovine lactoferrin or its hydrolysate with lactoferrin-resistant probiotics against foodborne pathogens.
AB  == previous reports have shown that several probiotic strains can resist the antibacterial activity of bovine lactoferrin (blf), but the results are inconsistent. moreover, a portion of orally administered apo-blf is digested in vivo by pepsin to yield blf hydrolysate, which produces stronger antibacterial activity than that observed with apo-blf. however, whether blf hydrolysate affects the growth of probiotic strains is unclear. therefore, various probiotic  strains in taiwan were collected and evaluated for activity against apo-blf and blf hydrolysate in vitro. thirteen probiotic strains were evaluated, and the growth of lactobacillus acidophilus atcc 4356, lactobacillus salivarius atcc 11741, lactobacillus rhamnosus atcc 53103, bifidobacterium longum atcc 15707, and bifidobacterium lactis bcrc 17394 were inhibited by both apo-blf and blf hydrolysate. the growth of 8 strains were not affected by apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, including l. rhamnosus atcc 7469, lactobacillus reuteri atcc 23272,  lactobacillus fermentum atcc 11739, lactobacillus coryniformis atcc 25602, l. acidophilus bcrc 14065, bifidobacterium infantis atcc 15697, bifidobacterium bifidum atcc 29521, and pediococcus acidilactici atcc 8081. however, apo-blf and  its hydrolysate inhibited the growth of foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the supernatants produced by l. fermentum, b. lactis, and b.  longum inhibited the growth of most pathogens. importantly, a combination of apo-blf or blf hydrolysate with the supernatants of cultures of the organisms described above showed synergistic or partially synergistic effects against the growth of most of the selected pathogens. in conclusion, several probiotic strains are resistant to apo-blf and blf hydrolysate, warranting clinical studies to evaluate the antimicrobial potential for the combination of apo-blf or its hydrolysate with specific probiotics.

TI  == anti-inflammatory effects of the genus bifidobacterium on macrophages by modification of phospho-i kappab and socs gene expression.
AB  == although beneficial roles of probiotics for inflammatory bowel diseases have been reported, their direct action on immune cells has not been elucidated. in this study, we investigated how three species of bifidobacterium and enterococcus faecalis differentially modulate production of cytokines from lipopolysaccharide  (lps)-stimulated macrophages in vitro using raw264.7 cells. the mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines were remarkably increased after exposure to lps, e. faecalis alone and lps combined with e. faecalis. in contrast, il-10 mrna levels  were significantly decreased after exposure to e. faecalis compared with exposure to bifidobacterium species. when cells were exposed to bifidobacterium species combined with lps, mrna levels of il12p40 were decreased by co-culture with b. breve and b. longum, il-1 beta mrna levels were decreased by b. breve and b. adorescentis and tnf-alpha mrna levels were decreased by b. adolescentis compared with lps alone. the three species of bifidobacterium significantly inhibited phosphorylation of i kappab-alpha induced by lps. the mrna levels of socs1 and socs3 were increased by exposure to lps alone; however, the mrna levels of socs1  or socs3 were increased more by exposure to bifidobacterium species combined with lps. conversely, e. faecalis combined with lps induced significantly lower levels of socs mrna than those induced by bifidobacterium species combined with lps. these results indicated that certain species of genus bifidobacterium could negatively modulate mrna levels of proinflammatory cytokines produced from lps-stimulated raw264.7 cells, which is possibly related to inhibition of i kappab-alpha phosphorylation and stimulation of socs signalling.

TI  == [the primary screening of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli strains to develop effective probiotic preparations based on them].
AB  == 10 bifidobacterium strains and 10 lactobacillus strains were studied for their antagonistic activity with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and for their sensitivity to antibiotics, widely used in clinical practice. l. acidophilus strain 5/4, l. acidophilus strain 18/4, b. adolescentis strain ux, b. longum strain 44 exhibited the highest antagonistic activity and the highest degree of antibiotic resistance. the restriction analysis of the chromosomal dna  of these strains was then made and their plasmid content was studied, making it possible to recognize these strains in future in the course of in vivo experiments.

TI  == [the vaginal bifidobacterium flora in women of reproductive age].
AB  == the composition of vaginal bifidoflora in 56 clinically healthy women of reproductive age was studied. the study revealed that four species of bifidobacteria, viz. bifidobacterium bifidum, b. breve, b. adolescentis 2 and b.  longum, dominated in the composition of this bifidobacterial population. nine out of 11 isolated strains were found to be capable of inhibiting indicator microorganisms staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis when tested in vitro; in addition, strains b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. bifidum g1, b. breve p2 and  b. longum z4 inhibited klebsiella ozaenae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli and were also active acid producers. three of these 4 bifidobacterial strains were capable of adhesion to vaginal epitheliocytes, while b. bifidum g1 was practically incapable of adherence to these cells, similarly to b. bifidum strain 791 of intestinal origin. in addition, the spectra of antibiotic susceptibility varied from strain to strain, but all bifidobacterial strains were susceptible to benzylpenicillin and resistant to lomefloxacin, most of them being also resistant to cyprofloxacin and gentamicin. thus the data presented in this work are indicative of the possibility and advantages of using bifidobacterial strains belonging to this ecological niche as probiotics for the correction of the microflora of the urogenital tract in females.

TI  == [the antagonistic activity of bifidobacteria in vitro and in vivo studied by using gnotobiological technology].
AB  == the antagonistic activity of 4 strains of bifidobacteria (b. adolescentis 2 f1, b. longum z4, b. breve r2 and b. bifidum g1), isolated from the vagina of healthy females of the reproductive age, with respect to escherichia coli, klebsiella ozaenae, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa and gardnerella vaginalis were studied in vitro and in vivo. the in vitro experiments revealed that all above-mentioned bifidobacteria were capable of inhibiting the growth of all indicator bacterial strains. still of all the bifidobacteria under  study had different levels of activity. b. adolescentis strain 2 f1 exhibited the highest inhibiting activity in vitro. in contrast to in vitro experiments, in vivo experiments with b. breve r2 demonstrated its high antagonistic activity with respect to e. coli. the data thus obtained indicate that in the study of antagonistic activity the use of the in vivo model as also expedient, for it is mainly in vivo that probiotic preparations show their activity.

TI  == growth of a human intestinal desulfovibrio desulfuricans in continuous cultures containing defined populations of saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting bacteria.
AB  == ecological and physiological effects of the sulphate-reducing bacterium (srb) desulfovibrio desulfuricans on other intestinal organisms were investigated in anaerobic chemostats (dilution rate approximately 0.2 h-1). reproducible defined  bacterial communities were used in these experiments, comprising 14 different saccharolytic and amino acid fermenting species: bifidobacterium longum, bif. adolescentis, bif. pseudolongum, bif. infantis, bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, bact. vulgatus, lactobacillus acidophilus, enterococcus faecalis, ent. faecium, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, cl. butyricum, cl. innocuum, cl. bifermentans. lactobacillus and cl. bifermentans populations never rose above minimum detection limits (log10 2.0 and 4.0, respectively) under the experimental conditions employed in these studies. inclusion of des. desulfuricans in bacterial cultures (c. log10 8.4 viable cells ml-1) resulted in marked reductions (i.e. greater than 1 log) in planktonic cell population densities of several species, particularly bif. longum, cl. perfringens and bif. pseudolongum. the two bacteroides species were unaffected by des. desulfuricans, while numbers of cl. butyricum increased. extensive wall growth developed in the srb culture, consisting mainly of des. desulfuricans (log10 9.2 viable cells ml-1), bact. thetaiotaomicron and bact. vulgatus, with lesser numbers of facultative anaerobes, cl. perfringens and bif. longum. wall growth was associated with a reduction in planktonic cell mass and increased acid production by the cultures.  chemotaxonomic study of chemostat microbiotas, on the basis of cellular fatty acid methyl ester (fame) analyses, showed the existence of characteristic bacteroides (c15) and bifidobacterial (c18) markers, but desulfovibrio markers (i-c15:0, c16:0, i-c17:1) could be identified. the metabolic activities of saccharolytic organisms were altered in the srb chemostat, including synthesis of a number of hydrolytic enzymes involved in carbohydrate breakdown, such as alpha-galactosidase, alpha-glucosidase and beta-galactosidase, together with several mucinolytic enzymes. high concentrations of sulphide (8.2 mmol 1-1) were  detected in the srb chemostat, suggesting that this metabolite may have been inhibitory to some species. saccharolytic organisms growing in the srb fermenter  utilized more starch, but less galactose-containing polymers, which correlated with the observed glycosidase activities. profound differences were also recorded with respect to fermentation product formation in the chemostats, where a major switch to acetate production occurred in the srb culture, with concomitant reductions in propionate, butyrate and lactate, which is an important electron donor for desulfovibrios.
