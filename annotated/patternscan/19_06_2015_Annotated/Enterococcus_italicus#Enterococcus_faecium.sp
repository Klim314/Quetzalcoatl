TI  == characterization of lactic acid bacteria isolated from artisanal travnik young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks over four seasons.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the composition of lactic acid bacteria  (lab) in autochthonous young cheeses, sweet creams and sweet kajmaks produced in  the vlasic mountain region of central bosnia and herzegovina near the town of travnik over a four season period. these three products were made from cow's milk by a traditional method without the addition of a starter culture. preliminary characterization with phenotype-based assays and identification using rep-pcr with a (gtg)5 primer and 16s rdna sequence analysis were undertaken for 460 lab isolates obtained from all the examined samples. fifteen species were identified  as follows: lactococcus lactis, lactococcus raffinolactis, lactococcus garviae, lactobacillus casei, lactobacillus plantarum, lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus italicus, leuconostoc mesenteroides, leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, leuconostoc lactis, streptococcus thermophilus and streptococcus mitis. a wide genotypic and  phenotypic heterogeneity of the species was observed, particularly within the lc. lactis strains. in all of the tested dairy products across four seasons, a significantly positive correlation (r = 0.690) between the presence of lactococci and enterococci and a negative correlation (r = 0.722) between the presence of lactococci and leuconostocs were recorded. forty-five percent of the lactobacilli and 54.4% of the lactococci exhibited proteolytic activity, whereas 18.7% of the  total lab isolates exhibited antimicrobial activity.

TI  == taxonomic and molecular characterization of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts in nunu, a ghanaian fermented milk product.
AB  == produced from raw unpasteurized milk, nunu is a spontaneously fermented yoghurt-like product made in ghana and other parts of west africa. despite the importance of nunu in the diet of many africans, there is currently only limited  information available on the microorganisms associated with nunu processing. with the aim of obtaining a deeper understanding of the process and as a first step towards developing starter cultures with desired technological properties for nunu production, a microbiological characterization of nunu processing in three different towns in the upper east region of ghana, namely bolgatanga, paga and navrongo, was carried out. lactic acid bacteria (lab) and yeasts associated with  nunu processing were isolated and identified using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods including morphological and carbohydrate fermentation tests, (gtg)5-based rep-pcr, multiplex pcr, and 16s and 26s rrna gene sequencing. the lab counts during nunu processing increased from 4.5 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 8.7 +/- 1.8 log cfu/ml at 24 h of fermentation while yeasts counts increased from 2.8 +/- 1.2 log cfu/ml at 0 h to 5.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml by the end of fermentation. lactobacillus fermentum was the dominant lab throughout the fermentations with lactobacillus plantarum and leuconostoc mesenteroides playing  prominent roles during the first 6-8 h of fermentation as well. less frequently isolated lab included lactobacillus helveticus, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus italicus, weissella confusa and a putatively novel lactococcus spp.  the yeasts involved were identified as candida parapsilosis, candida rugosa, candida tropicalis, galactomyces geotrichum, pichia kudriavzevii and saccharomyces cerevisiae with p. kudriavzevii and s. cerevisiae being the dominant yeast species.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of enterococcus species isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and ten enterococcal isolates (178 enterococcus faecium, 68 e. durans, 49 e. faecalis, 8 e. italicus, 3 e. gallinarum, 3 e. casseliflavus, and 1 e. hirae) from slovak bryndza cheese were evaluated for susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents (vancomycin, teicoplanin, ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, erythromycin, rifampicin, nitrofurantoin, and ciprofloxacin). all enterococcal isolates from bryndza cheese were susceptible to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, vancomycin, and teicoplanin as determined by the disk diffusion method. vancomycin resistance genes vana and vanb were not detected. resistance rates of enterococcal isolates to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin were 24, 26, 2, and 1 %, respectively. thirty-six % of e. faecium isolates and 22 % of the e. faecalis isolates were resistant to erythromycin. resistance to rifampicin was similar in e. faecium (31 %) and e. faecalis (29 %). both e. faecium and e. faecalis strains showed the same resistance to ciprofloxacin (2 %). e. durans isolates showed low levels of resistance to rifampicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, and nitrofurantoin (1-4 %). forty-eight (30 %) of the e. faecium isolates, two (3 %) of the e. durans isolates, and six (12 %) of the e. faecalis isolates exhibited multidrug resistance. the highest frequency of resistant enterococci was observed in bryndza produced in winter season.

TI  == molecular identification and diversity of enterococci isolated from slovak bryndza cheese.
AB  == three hundred and eight presumed enterococcal isolates were recovered from bryndza, a soft sheep milk cheese. the cheese samples were obtained from five different commercial distributors in slovakia and were taken at three different seasonal intervals. all isolates were identified to the species level using genotypic tools. species-specific pcr using ddl genes highlighted the predominance of enterococcus faecium (176 isolates) and assigned 50 isolates to the species enterococcus faecalis. the remaining 82 isolates were classified using repetitive element sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (pcr) with primer (gtg)(5)-(gtg)(5)-pcr, in combination with phenylalanyl-trna synthase gene (phes) sequence analysis and by whole-cell protein analysis (sds-page). these strains were identified as enterococcus durans (59 strains), enterococcus italicus (8 strains), enterococcus casseliflavus (3 strains), enterococcus gallinarum (3 strains), enterococcus hirae (1 strain), and 8 strains were members of the species lactococcus lactis. of the seven enterococcal species isolated, three of them, e. durans, e. faecalis and e. faecium were present in all samples  studied, with e. faecium as the predominant one. the precise identification of enterococci in bryndza cheese is an essential step in the process of evaluation of their functional properties which will be further studied and assessed.
