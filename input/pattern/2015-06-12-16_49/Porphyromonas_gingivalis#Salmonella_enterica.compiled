TI  - Transcriptome dynamics-based operon prediction in prokaryotes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inferring operon maps is crucial to understanding the regulatory networks of prokaryotic genomes. Recently, RNA-seq based transcriptome studies revealed that in many bacterial species the operon structure vary with the change of environmental conditions. Therefore, new computational solutions that use both static and dynamic data are necessary to create condition specific operon predictions. RESULTS: In this work, we propose a novel classification method that integrates RNA-seq based transcriptome profiles with genomic sequence features to accurately identify the operons that are expressed under a measured condition. The classifiers are trained on a small set of confirmed operons and then used to classify the remaining gene pairs of the organism studied. Finally, by linking consecutive gene pairs classified as operons, our computational approach produces condition-dependent operon maps. We evaluated our approach on various RNA-seq expression profiles of the bacteria Haemophilus somni, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Our results demonstrate that, using features depending on both transcriptome dynamics and genome sequence characteristics, we can identify operon pairs with high accuracy. Moreover, the combination of DNA sequence and expression data results in more accurate predictions than each one alone. CONCLUSION: We present a computational strategy for the comprehensive analysis of condition-dependent operon maps in prokaryotes. Our method can be used to generate condition specific operon maps of many bacterial organisms for which high-resolution transcriptome data is available.
TI  - Both the unique and repeat regions of the Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutin A  are involved in adhesion and invasion of host cells.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is one of the major etiologic agents of adult periodontitis and has been associated with cardiovascular diseases. It expresses multiple hemagglutinins that are significant virulence factors and play an important role in bacterial attachment and invasion of host cells. The objective of this study was to determine the impact of P. gingivalis hemagglutinin A (HagA) on the attachment to and invasion of human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) and gingival epithelial cells (GEC). Bacterial strains expressing the HagA protein (or subunits), including Escherichia coli carrying plasmid pEKS5, E. coli carrying plasmid ST2, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium with plasmid pNM1.1 were used in this study. The strains were tested for their ability to attach to and invade HCAEC and GEC using antibiotic protection assays. In addition, the unique 5' N-terminal non-repeated segment of HagA was purified in recombinant form and a monoclonal antibody was created against the polypeptide. The monoclonal antibody against the unique portion of HagA was tested for inhibitory activity in these assays. The attachment of both E. coli strains expressing HagA fragment to host cells was significantly increased compared to their respective controls. However, they did not invade GEC or HCAEC. Interestingly, HagA expression in the Salmonella strain increased both adherence to and invasion of HCAEC, which may be due to the presence of the entire hagA ORF. A monoclonal antibody against the unique 5' N-terminal portion of HagA reduced invasion. Further experiments are needed to determine the role of the unique and the repeat segments of P. gingivalis HagA.
TI  - Effect of expression level on immune responses to recombinant oral Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccines.
AB  - Live, attenuated Salmonella has been used to express heterologous antigens for development of oral vaccines. Often, expression must be regulated because of deleterious effects on the Salmonella vector. The effect of varying expression levels on immune response parameters has not been well defined. In this study we introduced mutations in the -10 region of the trc promoter in the expression plasmid to generate series of vaccine strains with different levels of expression of a model antigen, the hemagglutinin HagB from Porphyromonas gingivalis. There was no difference in growth rates of the Salmonella vaccine strains containing the wild-type, the mutant plasmids or the empty expression vector. The primary IgG response in serum in mice orally immunized with the wild-type strain peaked 3-4 weeks earlier than the intermediate expression level strains, suggesting that high expression levels may favor an earlier response. While there was a trend for anti-HagB recall responses to correlate with higher expression level, the peak levels were not significantly different even for expression levels as low as 33% of wild-type. A similar trend in terms of response level was seen with serum and salivary IgA. The subclass of the IgG response was predominately IgG2a regardless of expression level, consistent with a Th1 response. These data suggest that isotype distribution, immune response level and T helper cell profile are largely unaffected over a wide range of expression levels.
TI  - Subversion of antimicrobial calprotectin (S100A8/S100A9 complex) in the cytoplasm of TR146 epithelial cells after invasion by Listeria monocytogenes.
AB  - Expressed by squamous mucosal keratinocytes, calprotectin is a complex of two EF-hand calcium-binding proteins of the S100 subfamily (S100A8 and S100A9) with significant antimicrobial activity. Calprotectin-expressing cells resist invasion by Porphyromonas gingivalis, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. typhimurium). To understand the interactions between calprotectin and invasive bacteria, we studied the distribution of calprotectin in the cytoplasm of TR146 epithelial cells. In response to L. monocytogenes, calprotectin mobilized from a diffuse cytoplasmic distribution to a filamentous pattern and colocalized with the microtubule network. Listeria more frequently invaded cells with mobilized calprotectin. Calprotectin mobilization was listeriolysin O-dependent and required calcium (extracellular and intracellular) and an intact microtubule network. In the presence of preformed microtubules in vitro, the anti-Listeria activity of calprotectin was abrogated. To facilitate intraepithelial survival, therefore, Listeria mobilizes calprotectin to colocalize with cytoplasmic microtubules, subverting anti-Listeria activity and autonomous cellular immunity.
TI  - Expression of a Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin on the surface of a Salmonella vaccine vector.
AB  - Live, attenuated Salmonella strains can serve as vectors for the delivery of recombinant vaccine antigens for development of oral mucosal vaccines. Various vaccine parameters can affect the immune responses elicited by Salmonella vectors, including the expression level, location and timing of expressed antigens. We have previously established immunogenic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains which cytoplasmically express hemagglutinin B (HagB) of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a putative periodontal pathogen. In this study, we sought to determine whether the 39 kDa HagB protein could be stably expressed on the surface of an avirulent Salmonella vaccine strain. The hagB gene was cloned into an expression plasmid as a C-terminal fusion with Lpp-OmpA, a hybrid surface display system. High expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB proved to be toxic to the vaccine strain, and it was necessary to introduce attenuating mutations in the trc promoter. Stable expression was obtained in transformants with promoter mutations that resulted in low levels of expression. The expression of Lpp-OmpA-HagB was confirmed by ELISA and Western blot. Localization to the outer membrane/periplasm was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy using immunogold labeling, surface labeling of whole mounts using electron microscopy, flow cytometry, and by quantitation of HagB in cytoplasmic, as well as inner and outer cell membrane fractions. When delivered orally in mice, the surface-expressing strain induced higher serum IgG and IgA responses to HagB than a cytoplasmic expressing strain, while responses in secretions were comparable. These results suggest that surface localization may differentially enhance the immunogenicity of antigens expressed by live, avirulent Salmonella vaccine vectors.
TI  - L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide production of a murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cell line stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The aim of this study was to determine nitric oxide (NO) production of a murine macrophage cell line (RAW 264.7 cells) when stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharides (Pg-LPS). RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with i) various concentrations of Pg-LPS or Salmonella typhosa LPS (St-LPS), ii) Pg-LPS with or without L-arginine and/or NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), an arginine analog or iii) Pg-LPS and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) with or without anti-IFN-gamma antibodies or interleukin-10 (IL-10). Tissue culture supernatants were assayed for NO levels after 24 h in culture. NO was not observed in tissue culture supernatants of RAW 264.7 cells following stimulation with Pg-LPS, but was observed after stimulation with St-LPS. Exogenous L-arginine restored the ability of Pg-LPS to induce NO production; however, the increase in NO levels of cells stimulated with Pg-LPS with exogenous L-arginine was abolished by NMMA. IFN-gamma induced independent NO production by Pg-LPS-stimulated macrophages and this stimulatory effect of IFN-gamma could be completely suppressed by anti-IFN-gamma antibodies and IL-10. These results suggest that Pg-LPS is able to stimulate NO production in the RAW 264.7 macrophage cell model in an L-arginine-dependent mechanism which is itself independent of the action of IFN-gamma.
TI  - Interactions of Porphyromonas gingivalis with host cells: implications for cardiovascular diseases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent epidemiological studies have suggested a contribution of periodontitis in atherosclerotic diseases. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain such a connection involving general inflammatory responses and/or specific effects of periodontal bacteria on host tissues. METHODS: The role of the periodontopathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis as a potential contributor to atherosclerosis has been investigated in model systems using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and murine J774 macrophage cell cultures. RESULTS: P. gingivalis 381 was demonstrated to induce foam cell formation in J774 macrophage cell cultures in the presence of low-density lipoproteins. The active bacterial component involved in this process appears to be lipopolysaccharide. This effect was not limited to these organisms as several other Gram-positive and Gram-negative oral bacteria exhibited the same property. In addition, in a more specific manner, P. gingivalis induced monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 secretion in HUVEC cultures. CONCLUSIONS: The fimbriae of strain 381 are important, but are not required, for this inductive effect. Taken together, these results suggest a potential role for P. gingivalis in several steps involved in atherosclerotic lesion formation.
TI  - Modulation of an interleukin-12 and gamma interferon synergistic feedback regulatory cycle of T-cell and monocyte cocultures by Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide in the absence or presence of cysteine proteinases.
AB  - Interleukin 12 (IL-12) is an efficient inducer and enhancer of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) production by both resting and activated T cells. There is evidence that human monocytes exposed to IFN-gamma have enhanced ability to produce IL-12 when stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, it was demonstrated that LPS from the oral periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis stimulated monocytes primed with IFN-gamma to release IL-12, thereby enhancing IFN-gamma accumulation in T-cell populations. P. gingivalis LPS was shown to enhance IL-12 induction of IFN-gamma in T cells in a manner independent from TNF-alpha contribution. The levels of T-cell IL-12 receptors were not affected by P. gingivalis LPS and played only a minor role in the magnitude of the IFN-gamma response. These data suggest that LPS from P. gingivalis establishes an activation loop with IL-12 and IFN-gamma with potential to augment the production of inflammatory cytokines in relation to the immunopathology of periodontitis. We previously reported that the major cysteine proteinases (gingipains) copurifying with LPS in this organism were responsible for reduced IFN-gamma accumulation in the presence of IL-12. However, the addition of the gingipains in the presence of LPS resulted in partial restoration of the IFN-gamma levels. In the destructive periodontitis lesion, release of gingipains from the outer membrane (OM) of P. gingivalis could lead to the downregulation of Th1 responses, while gingipain associated with LPS in the OM or in OM vesicles released from the organism could have net stimulatory effects.
TI  - Mouthrinses: a comparative microbiological study.
AB  - This study was performed in order to evaluate the efficacy of different mouthrinses whose use is extended in Spain. Six different antiseptic mouthrinses were studied by means of determination of Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella typhimurium, Bacillus subtilis, Streptococcus mutans, Prevotella intermedia, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Also in vivo experiments were carried out in volunteers by the use of mouthrinses and evaluation of bacterial populations before and after the treatment. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death was determined. Results suggested that the determination of MIC values is not a reliable method to evaluate the antibacterial effect of such products. On the other hand those rinsing solutions based on the effect of oxygen, such as those containing carbamide peroxide have a greater efficacy against anaerobic bacteria compared with rinses whose active molecule is a disinfectant. Finally, the kinetics of bacterial death demonstrates that the essential oil rinse kills bacteria much faster. All tested mouthrinses were active as antibacterial although those based on oxygen production or essential oils were more active than solutions based on chlorhexidine and Triclosan.
TI  - Sodium ion cycle in bacterial pathogens: evidence from cross-genome comparisons.
AB  - Analysis of the bacterial genome sequences shows that many human and animal pathogens encode primary membrane Na+ pumps, Na+-transporting dicarboxylate decarboxylases or Na+ translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, and a number of Na+ -dependent permeases. This indicates that these bacteria can utilize Na+ as a coupling ion instead of or in addition to the H+ cycle. This capability to use a Na+ cycle might be an important virulence factor for such pathogens as Vibrio cholerae, Neisseria meningitidis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, and Yersinia pestis. In Treponema pallidum, Chlamydia trachomatis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, the Na+ gradient may well be the only energy source for secondary transport. A survey of preliminary genome sequences of Porphyromonas gingivalis, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and Treponema denticola indicates that these oral pathogens also rely on the Na+ cycle for at least part of their energy metabolism. The possible roles of the Na+ cycling in the energy metabolism and pathogenicity of these organisms are reviewed. The recent discovery of an effective natural antibiotic, korormicin, targeted against the Na+ -translocating NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, suggests a potential use of Na+ pumps as drug targets and/or vaccine candidates. The antimicrobial potential of other inhibitors of the Na+ cycle, such as monensin, Li+ and Ag+ ions, and amiloride derivatives, is discussed.
TI  - Environmental cues and gene expression in Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans.
AB  - Microorganisms typically adapt to environmental cues by turning on and off the expression of virulence genes which, in turn, allows for optimal growth and survival within different environmental niches. This adaptation strategy includes sensing and responding to changes in nutrients, pH, temperature, oxygen tension, redox potential, microbial flora, and osmolarity. For a bacterium to adhere to, penetrate, replicate in, and colonize host cells, it is critical that virulence genes are expressed during certain periods of the infection process. Thus, throughout the different stages of an infection, different sets of virulence factors are turned on and off in response to different environmental signals, allowing the bacterium to effectively adapt to its varying niche. In this review, we focus on the regulation of virulence gene expression in two pathogens which have been implicated as major etiological agents in adult and juvenile periodontal diseases: Porphyromonas gingivalis and Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans. Understanding the mechanisms of virulence gene expression in response to the local environment of the host will provide crucial information in the development of effective treatments targeted at eradication of these periodontal disease pathogens.
TI  - Biological properties of lipid A isolated from Flavobacterium meningosepticum.
AB  - The biological properties of the lipid A from Flavobacterium meningosepticum, which we recently isolated and whose complete chemical structure has been determined (H. Kato, T. Iida, Y. Haishima, A. Tanaka, and K. Tanamoto. J. Bacteriol. 180:3891--3899, 1998), were studied. The lipid A exhibited generally moderate activity compared to Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar abortus equi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) used as a control in the assay systems tested; lethal toxicity in galactosamine-sensitized mice, mitogenicity in mouse spleen cells, induction of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) release from mouse peritoneal macrophages and J774-1 mouse macrophage-like and human THP-1 line cells, nitric oxide induction activity from J774-1 cells, and Limulus gelation activity. The moderate activity of the F. meningosepticum lipid A may be explained by its unique fatty acid composition and the lack of a phosphate group in position 4'. It is noteworthy that the lipid A apparently induced TNF-alpha release from peritoneal macrophages in LPS-unresponsive C3H/HeJ mice and that the activation was suppressed by the LPS-specific antagonist, succinylated lipid A precursor. Significant splenocyte mitogenicity in C3H/HeJ mice was also observed with the lipid A. Taken together with the previous results concerning Porphyromonas gingivalis lipid A, which has a high level of structural similarity to the lipid A of F. meningosepticum, and the induction of TNF-alpha release in macrophages from C3H/HeJ mice, the lipid A of F. meningosepticum, which has novel fatty acids, may possibly play an role for the activation of C3H/HeJ macrophages.
TI  - Nitric oxide production by murine spleen cells stimulated with Porphyromonas gingivalis-derived lipopolysaccharide.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to determine whether Porphyromonas gingivalis-lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) may stimulate nitric oxide (NO) production by murine spleen cells. Spleen cells derived from Balb/c mice were cultured in the presence of Pg-LPS or LPS from Salmonella Typhosa. The cell were also cultured in the presence of Pg-LPS with or without L-arginine, L-arginine plus NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), or IFN-gamma. Furthermore, the plastic non-adherent spleen cells were stimulated with Pg-LPS and L-arginine. The results showed that Pg-LPS failed to stimulate splenic NO production by themselves. Exogenous L-arginine or IFN-gamma up-regulated the NO production of Pg-LPS-stimulated spleen cells, but the stimulatory effects of L-arginine were completely blocked by NMMA. It was also demonstrated that in the presence of Pg-LPS and L-arginine, splenic macrophages were the cellular source of NO. These results suggest, therefore, that P. gingivalis-LPS may induce murine splenic macrophages to produce NO in a L-arginine and an IFN-gamma-dependent mechanism.
TI  - Long-term immunological memory induced by recombinant oral Salmonella vaccine vectors.
AB  - We have previously shown that Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing  the hagB hemagglutinin gene from Porphyromonas gingivalis can induce primary and recall immune responses in serum and secretions in mice; however, the longevity of memory induced by oral Salmonella carriers has not been adequately demonstrated. In this study, we examined the capacity of mice to mount a recall response 52 weeks after primary immunization. Recall responses were seen in serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA following boosting at week 52, and in most cases, they were equal to or greater than the primary responses. Significant mucosal IgA recall responses in saliva and vaginal wash were also detected following boosting at week 52. In addition, there was a considerable residual response in secretions at week 51, prior to boosting. These results indicate that oral Salmonella vectors can induce long-term memory to recombinant HagB and are particularly effective at inducing long-lasting mucosal responses as well as at inducing the capacity for mucosal recall responses.
TI  - Effect of preexisting immunity to Salmonella on the immune response to recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing a Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin.
AB  - Recombinant Salmonella strains expressing foreign heterologous genes have been extensively studied as live oral vaccine delivery vectors. We have investigated the mucosal and systemic immune responses following oral immunization with a recombinant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium expressing the hemagglutinin HagB from Porphyromonas gingivalis, a suspected etiological agent of adult periodontal disease. We have previously shown a primary mucosal and systemic response following oral immunization with chi4072/pDMD1 and recall responses following boosting at 14 weeks after primary immunization. In this study, we examined the effects of earlier boosting as well as the effects of deliberately induced immunity to the Salmonella carrier strain on subsequent immune responses. Mice boosted at week 7 following immunization, a point which corresponded to the peak of the primary response, generally showed lower responses than those boosted at week 14. When mice were preimmunized with the Salmonella carrier alone and then immunized with the recombinant strain 7 or 14 weeks later, significant reductions were seen for serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies at week 14 and for salivary IgA at week 7. No reductions were seen in serum IgA or vaginal wash IgA antibodies. Mice appear to be refractory to boosting with orally administered salmonellae at 7 weeks. Deliberate immunization with the carrier strain did not appreciably affect recall responses at 14 weeks, with the exception of the serum IgG responses, nor did it affect colonization of the Peyer's patches.
TI  - Porphyromonas gingivalis virulence factors and invasion of cells of the cardiovascular system.
AB  - Our laboratory is interested in the genes and gene products involved in the interactions between Porphyromonas gingivalis (Pg) and the host. These interactions may occur in either the periodontal tissues or other non-oral host tissues such as those of the cardiovascular system. We have previously reported the cloning of several genes encoding hemagglutinins, surface proteins that interact with the host tissues, and are investigating their roles in the disease process. Primary among these is HagA, a very large protein with multiple functional groups that have significant sequence homology to protease genes of this species. Preliminary evidence indicates that an avirulent Salmonella typhimurium strain containing hagA is virulent in mice. These data indicate that HagA may be a key virulence factor of Pg. Additionally, we are investigating the invasion of primary human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) by Pg because of the recent epidemiological studies indicating a correlation between periodontal disease (PD) and coronary heart disease (CHD). We found that some, but not all, strains of Pg are able to invade these cells. Scanning electron microsopy of the infected HCAEC demonstrated that the invading organisms initially attached to the host cell surface as aggregates and by a "pedestal"-like structure. By transmission electronmicroscopy it could be seen that internalized bacteria were present within multimembranous compartments localized with rough endoplasmic reticulum. In addition, invasion of the HCAEC by Pg resulted in an increase in the degradation of long-lived cellular proteins. These data indicate that Pg are present within autophagosomes and may use components of the autophagic pathway as a means to survive intracellularly. However, Pg presence within autophagosomes in KB cells could not be observed or detected. It is therefore likely that Pg uses different invasive mechanisms for different host cells. This and the role of HagA in invasion is currently being investigated further.
TI  - Expression and immunogenicity of hemagglutinin A from Porphyromonas gingivalis in an avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis is a major etiologic agent of periodontitis, a chronic inflammatory disease that ultimately results in the loss of the supporting tissues of the teeth. Previous work has demonstrated the usefulness of avirulent Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium strains as antigen delivery systems for protective antigens of pathogens that colonize or cross mucosal surfaces. In this study, we constructed and characterized a recombinant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium avirulent vaccine strain which expresses hemagglutinin A and carries no antibiotic resistance markers. HagA, a major virulence-associated surface protein, is a potentially useful immunogen that contains an antigenic epitope which, in humans, elicits an immune response that is protective against subsequent colonization by P. gingivalis. The hagA gene, including its promoter, was cloned into a balanced-lethal Salmonella vector and transferred to the vaccine strain. Heterologous expression of HagA was demonstrated in both Escherichia coli JM109 and S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain chi4072. The HagA epitope was present in its native configuration as determined by immunochemistry and immunoelectron microscopy. Purified recombinant HagA was recognized by sera from mice immunized with the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium vaccine strain. The HagA-specific antigen of the vaccine was also found to be recognized by serum from a periodontal patient. This vaccine strain, which expresses the functional hemagglutinin protein, induces a humoral immune response against HagA and may be useful for developing a protective vaccine against periodontal diseases associated with P. gingivalis.
TI  - Oral immunization with recombinant Salmonella typhimurium expressing a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin: effect of boosting on mucosal, systemic and immunoglobulin G subclass response.
AB  - Live avirulent Salmonella typhimurium are convenient vaccine vectors for the delivery of recombinant antigens for the induction of mucosal and systemic immunity. The hagB gene encodes a hemagglutinin of Porphyromonas gingivalis, a suspected causal agent in human adult periodontal disease. In previous studies, we have shown that hagB can be expressed in avirulent S. typhimurium and is immunogenic when given orally to mice. In this study, we evaluated recall responses in both serum and mucosal secretions after boosting. In addition, we have examined the immunoglobulin G (IgG) subclass response in serum to both HagB and the Salmonella carrier. Mice were orally immunized with S. typhimurium expressing the hagB gene and then boosted 14 weeks later. Responses were measured through 27 weeks. Both primary and recall IgG and IgA responses were seen in serum to the purified HagB as well as to the Salmonella carrier. Likewise, mucosal primary and recall responses were seen in saliva, fecal extracts and vaginal washes although the kinetics of the responses differed. The anti-HagB response in serum was dominated by IgG2a during the peak of primary response, prior to boosting and during the peak of the recall response. The anti-S. typhimurium response shifted from predominantly IgG3 following primary immunization to IgG2a after boosting. The IgG1 response was minimal against each antigen. This pattern of IgG subclass distribution is consistent with a Th1-type response. These data indicate that avirulent S. typhimurium is capable of delivering a putative virulence factor from P. gingivalis and inducing a primary and recall response in both serum and secretions and provides a means of studying P. gingivalis virulence factors and for the development of a potential vaccine.
TI  - Contrasting effects of lipopolysaccharides (endotoxins) from oral black-pigmented bacteria and Enterobacteriaceae on platelets, a major source of serotonin, and on histamine-forming enzyme in mice.
AB  - By measurement of serotonin levels, the translocation of platelets to various tissues was examined following intravenous injection of a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) into C3H/HeN mice. There was a rapid platelet accumulation (within 5 min and particularly in the lung), followed by a slower accumulation in the liver, which reached its plateau 3-5 h later. The severity of the anaphylactoid shock corresponded well with the magnitude of the rapid response. LPSs from the oral black-pigmented bacteria, Porphyromonas gingivalis and Prevotella intermedia, were much more potent in inducing the rapid platelet response than were those from the Enterobacteriaceae Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium. However, LPSs from these Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria in inducing the slow platelet response. There was also a contrast between their abilities to induce histidine decarboxylase, which forms histamine from histidine: LPSs from the Enterobacteriaceae were much more potent than those from black-pigmented bacteria.
TI  - Expression and immunogenicity of a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin  in Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  
TI  - Systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice orally immunized with avirulent Salmonella typhimurium expressing a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin.
AB  - Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a variety of virulence factors that may have a  function in the periodontal disease process. Determination of the role of these various factors in pathogenesis and identification of a means for protecting the host from the destructive effects of this organism are areas of vigorous investigation. In this study we demonstrate the potential of avirulent Salmonella typhimurium strains to stimulate a specific systemic and mucosal immune response to a cloned P. gingivalis hemagglutinin (HagB). An avirulent strain of S. typhimurium, chi 4072, expressing the hagB gene of P. gingivalis 381 on the plasmid pDMD1 was intragastrically administered to BALB/c mice. These mice mounted a serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA primary response against the hagB gene product and a mucosal immune response as measured by evaluation of saliva. IgA antibodies were also detected in bile. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using attenuated S. typhimurium strains as carriers of P. gingivalis virulence factors for subsequent evaluation of the systemic and mucosal immune response against these antigens. This system will provide a means for evaluating the virulence factors of P. gingivalis for their suitability in the construction of potential vaccines.
TI  - Isolation and characterization of a cloned Porphyromonas gingivalis hemagglutinin from an avirulent strain of Salmonella typhimurium.
AB  - Identification of surface macromolecules of Porphyromonas gingivalis that act as  virulence factors in periodontal disease has important implications for studying host-parasite interactions as well as for potential vaccine development. The objective of this study was to determine whether a cloned, P. gingivalis hemagglutinin gene could be expressed in an intact form in an avirulent Salmonella typhimurium vaccine construct and to characterize the recombinant protein. The recombinant protein was purified from the vaccine strain, characterized, and tested for biological activity as a competitive inhibitor of hemagglutination. Cells of S. typhimurium SL3261/pST7 grown in Luria broth were broken by sonic disruption and fractionated. The purified recombinant protein was found to inhibit hemagglutination of erythrocytes by whole P. gingivalis cells. The same purified protein was analyzed for its N-terminal amino acid sequence and amino acid composition and found to match that predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the cloned gene. These results indicate that a surface macromolecule of P. gingivalis can be expressed in an intact and biologically active form in a Salmonella carrier strain.
