TI  - Antimicrobial activity of preparation Bioaron C.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of sirupus Bioaron C, a preparation, whose main ingredient is an extract from the leaves of Aloe arborescens, was tested against different microorganisms isolated from patients with upper respiratory tract infections. The experiments were performed on 40 strains: 20 strains of anaerobic bacteria, 13 strains of aerobic bacteria and 7 strains of yeast-like fungi from the genus Candida and on 18 reference strains (ATCC). The antimicrobial activity of Bioaron C (MBC and MFC) was determined at undiluted concentration. Bioaron C proved to be very effective against the microorganisms causing infections. At the concentration recommended by the producer, the preparation showed biocidal activity (MBC, MFC) against the strains of the pathogenic microorganisms, which cause respiratory infections most frequently, including, among others, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Parvimonas micra, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus anginosus, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, already after 15 min. The MIC of Bioaron C against most of the tested microorganisms was 5 to 100 times lower than the usually applied concentration. The great antimicrobial activity means that the preparation may be used in the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory tract. Bioaron C may be an alternative or complement to classical therapy, especially in children.
TI  - Bacterial pathogens related to chronic suppurative otitis media in individuals with cleft palate: bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize the microbial etiology of chronic suppurative otitis media comparing the methods of classical bacteriological culture and polymerase chain reaction. DESIGN/SETTING/PATIENTS: Bacteriological analysis by classical culture and by molecular polymerase chain reaction of 35 effusion otitis samples from patients with cleft lip and palate attending the Hospital for Rehabilitation of Craniofacial Anomalies of the University of Sao Paulo, Bauru, Brazil. INTERVENTIONS: Collection of clinical samples of otitis by effusion through the external auditory tube. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Otolaryngologic diagnosis of chronic suppurative otitis media. RESULTS: Positive cultures were obtained from 83% of patients. Among the 31 bacterial lineages the following were isolated. In order of decreasing frequency: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (54.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (25.9%), and Enterococcus faecalis (19.2%). No anaerobes were isolated by culture. The polymerase chain reaction was positive for one or more bacteria investigated in 97.1% of samples. Anaerobe lineages were detected by the polymerase chain reaction method, such as Fusobacterium nucleatum , Bacteroides fragilis , and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius . CONCLUSIONS: Patients with cleft lip and palate with chronic suppurative otitis media presented high frequency of bacterial infection in the middle ear. The classical bacteriological culture did not detect strict anaerobes, whose presence was identified by the polymerase chain reaction method.
TI  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis due to Peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  - Primary sternal osteomyelitis (PSO) is a rare syndrome. In adults, it usually occurs with underlying predisposing factors, such as immunodeficiency, or intravenous (IV) drug abuse. The infecting organism in these patients is usually Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Peptostreptococcus species are Gram-positive anaerobic cocci and are part of the normal flora of human mucocutaneous surfaces. Peptostreptococcus infection can occur in all body sites, including the central nervous system, head, neck, chest, abdomen, pelvis, skin, bone, joint, and soft tissue. Here, we report on a 32-year-old previously healthy Chinese man who was diagnosed with PSO and P. anaerobius was yielded in the bacterial culture. He was treated empirically with antibiotics, but these failed. After additional limited surgical intervention with debridement, the PSO was cured.
TI  - Breast abscess bacteriologic features in the era of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus epidemics.
AB  - HYPOTHESIS: Increasing rates of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections have also affected the microbial profile of breast abscesses. OBJECTIVE: To update the decade-old bacteriologic description of breast abscesses to improve the choice of initial antibacterial drug therapy. DESIGN: Retrospective case series. SETTING: County hospital emergency department. PATIENTS: Forty-four women (mean age, 41 years; age range, 20-63 years) with breast abscesses. METHODS: All cultures from the breast abscesses of patients were reviewed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The microbiologic features and sensitivities of breast abscesses. RESULTS: Of 46 specimens only 28 showed bacterial yield (61%). Of these, 11 (39%) were polymicrobial, for an average of 1.4 isolates per specimen. The most common organism was S aureus, present in 12 of 37 aerobic cultures (32%), with MRSA in 7 (58%). The remaining organisms included coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (16%), diphtheroids (16%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Proteus mirabilis (5%), and other isolates (22%). All MRSA was sensitive to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and linezolid. Only 2 patients (29%) were sensitive to levofloxacin. Two anaerobic cultures were positive for Propionibacterium acnes and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius. CONCLUSIONS: Staphylococcus aureus is the most common pathogenic organism in modern breast abscesses. Many breast abscesses have community-acquired MRSA, with more than 50% of all S aureus and 19% of all cultures being MRSA. This finding parallels the local and national increases in MRSA reported in other soft-tissue infections. With increasing bacterial resistance and more minimally invasive management of breast abscesses, understanding the current bacteriologic profile of these abscesses is essential to determining the correct empirical antibiotic drug therapy.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftobiprole against aerobic and anaerobic strains isolated  from diabetic foot infections.
AB  - Against 443 aerobic and anaerobic bacteria isolated from diabetic foot infections, ceftobiprole MICs (microg/ml) at which 90% of the isolates tested were inhibited were as follows: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 1; methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and Staphylococcus lugdunensis, 0.5; Anaerococcus prevotii, 0.125; Finegoldia magna, 0.5; Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, 1; Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, 4; Escherichia coli and Enterobacter species, 0.125; Klebsiella species, 2; and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 8.
TI  - [Effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  - The effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (PO) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (Shigella flexneri, Salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Prevotella melaninogenica, Propionibacterium propionicum, Clostridium difficile) and fungi (Candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. The study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of PO decreased antilysozyme activity (ALA) and the anticomplement activity in Klebsiella, Shigella, Propionibacterium, Clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus Candida, but increased ALA in nonhemolytic Escherichia. Under the action of PO an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. The data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of PO on the microbiocenosis of the intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.
TI  - [A clinical study on ceftazidime in the treatment of intractable respiratory infections].
AB  - Ceftazidime (CAZ) was administered to 51 patients (37 males, 14 females) with respiratory infections including severe cases, accompanied by various underlying respiratory diseases. The clinical efficacy and side effects of CAZ were investigated. The mean age and body weight of these 51 cases were 62.6 years and 48.0 kg, respectively. CAZ was administered by intravenous drip infusion (daily dose of 2-4 g) for a mean of 14.7 days to a mean total dose of 56.7 g. Clinical efficacy rates were 64% (18 of 28 cases), 80% (16 of 20 cases) and 67% (2 of 3 cases) for airway and intermediary regional infections, pneumonia (including lung abscess) and pyothorax, respectively. In the bacteriological study, efficacy rates and bacterial eradication rates were 69% and 67%, 33% and 20%, 100% and 100%, and 100% and 100% for infections caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (6 cases), Streptococcus pneumoniae (6 cases) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4 cases), respectively, and bacterial eradication was achieved in both of 2 cases of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius and 2 cases of Haemophilus influenzae, and 1 case each of Peptococcus sp., Fusobacterium necrophorum and Serratia marcescens. Side effects observed were eruption in 1 case (2%) and elevated GOT, GPT and Al-P values in 1 case (2%), but these cases tended to recover after CAZ treatment was discontinued.
TI  - Controlled evaluation of trypticase soy broth with and without gelatin and yeast  extract in the detection of bacteremia and fungemia.
AB  - The addition of gelatin to blood culture media has been suggested to prevent the  inhibition of Neisseria meningitidis, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Gardnerella vaginalis, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius that is caused by sodium polyanetholsulfonate. To determine the effect of such supplementation on the overall yield of microorganisms, we compared the yield and speed of detection of clinically important microorganisms from 5422 paired 10-ml samples of blood cultured in Trypticase soy broth (TSB) containing 0.03% sodium polyanetholesulfonate (SPS) and TSB/SPS containing 1.2% gelatin and 1.0% yeast extract (mTSB). The atmosphere of incubation (open venting unit) and ratio of blood to broth (1:5) were the same for both samples. Only cultures with adequate blood sample (greater than or equal to 80% of stated volume) were compared statistically. Addition of gelatin and yeast extract resulted in inhibited growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (p less than 0.01), fungi (p less than 0.05), and the overall set of microorganisms encountered (p less than 0.001). It delayed growth of Enterobacteriaceae (p less than 0.001) but reduced the time to recover staphylococci (p less than 0.02). Of 12 isolates of species usually inhibited by SPS, seven grew only with the addition of gelatin and yeast extract, none grew only without supplementation, and five grew in both media. Although gelatin and yeast extract may improve the yield of some specific bacteria, the routine use of these additives cannot be recommended for all blood culture media.
TI  - Bactericidal effects of photoradiation therapy with hematoporphyrin derivative.
AB  - Hematoporphyrin derivative (Hpd) localizes selectively in malignant and rapidly metabolizing tissues and undergoes a cytotoxic reaction when exposed to light of a specific wavelength. Hpd has been studied extensively with regard to the diagnosis and treatment of tumors but not with regard to bactericidal activity. This investigation assessed the effect of light-activated Hpd on various microorganisms, on human polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and on the interactions of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and bacteria. Light-activated Hpd was 99.9% bactericidal against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Bacteroides fragilis, Streptococcus M-G intermedius, Streptococcus mutans, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Peptococcus magnus, and Clostridium perfringens, but did not affect Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or Candida albicans. Photoactivation of Hpd rendered 98% of polymorphonuclear leukocytes inviable. Combinations of light-activated Hpd and polymorphonuclear leukocytes had a 4-log (99.99%) bactericidal effect on both intra- and extracellular S. aureus. The ability of Hpd to localize in inflammatory tissues may have therapeutic applications in the treatment of abscesses.
TI  - Effects of storage in an anaerobic transport system on bacteria in known polymicrobial mixtures and in clinical specimens.
AB  - An anaerobic transport system (ATS) which provides for catalytic removal of oxygen was evaluated by using in vitro-prepared polymicrobial mixtures of logphase bacteria and clinical specimens. Inoculated swabs were stored at room temperature in (i) aerobic, (ii) anaerobic glove box, and (iii) ATS environments, and bacteria were quantitated after 2, 24, 48, and 72 h. Bacteria in a three-part mixture of Bacteroides fragilis, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and Escherichia coli and in a five-part mixture of B. fragilis, P. anaerobius, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa survived 72 h of storage in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments, but the anaerobic species were inactivated in the aerobic storage except for B. fragilis in pure culture or in the three-part mixture. Changes in relative proportions among the species in a mixture were least in the ATS and anaerobic glove box environments and greatest during the aerobic storage, particularly in the five-part mixture. Bacteria present in pure or mixed culture in clinical specimens generally survived 72 h of storage in the ATS. These data indicate that changes in relative proportions occur with prolonged storage even under anaerobic conditions, but that the ATS would be most effective for preserving anaerobic bacteria and preventing drastic concentration changes and overgrowth of facultative and aerobic bacteria.
TI  - Deconjugation of bile acids by human intestinal bacteria.
AB  - The purpose of this report is to present the deconjugation of bile acids by numbers of strains of bacteria in the small intestine and feces. The small intestinal juice was aseptically aspirated by a double lumen tube with a rubber cover on the tip devised by us ("Fukushima Type 1"). Bile acids were analyzed with thin layer chromatography. THE RESULTS: 1) Among aerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split conjugated bile acids was enterococcus, and most of the strains split were Staphylococcus (S.) epidermidis and Lactobacillus (L.) bifidus. Species of which none of the strains split were Escherichia (E.) coli, E. communior, E. freundii, L. plantarum, L. acidophilus, L. buchneri, L. cellobiosus, L. bulgaricus, S. aureus, Aerobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, candida, proteus, serratia, and almost none of the species split was Intermediate coliform bacilli. 2) Among anaerobic bacteria, species of which all of the strains split were Bacteroides (B.) vulgatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. uniformis, Corynebacterium (C.) granulosum, C. avidum, Peptostreptococcus (Peptostrept.) putridus, Eubacterium (Eubact.) lentum, Peptococcus (Pept.) grigoroffii, Pept. anaerobius, Veillonella (V.) orbiculus, and most of the strains split were Coryne. diphtheroides, Eubact. parvum, Peptostrept. intermedius. Species of which none of the strains split were Coryne, parvum, Peptostrept. micros, V. alcalescens, V. parvula, Catenabacterium (Catena.) catenaforme, and Catena. filamentosum. 3) All or none, or almost all or none, of the strains of each species tested split conjugated bile acids, and it seems probably that the presence or absence of this ability would be a proper character of eachspecies.
TI  - Survival of anaerobic and aerobic bacteria on cotton swabs in three transport systems.
AB  - The capacity of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria to survive on cotton swabs placed  into a dry gassed-out CO2-filled tube (DGT), dry sterile aerobic tube (DAT), and a tube containing a modified Stuarts' transport medium (MST), was assessed. Pseudomonas aeruginosa increased in numbers by 2 and 3 logs when stored in MST and DAT, respectively. The viability of P. aeruginosa, although retarded when compared to MSA and DAT, was not adversely affected by the CO2 environment in the DGT. The MST maintained relatively constant numbers of Streptococcus pyogenes during the 48-h storage period. The DAT and the DGT were unable to maintain the viability of S. pyogenes. Staphylococcus aureus, when stored in a DGT, DAT, or MST, was maintained in relatively constant numbers throughout the entire storage period. Of the four anaerobic bacteria evaluated (Bacteroides fragilis ssp. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides melaninogenicus ssp. asaccharolyticus, Fusobacterium nucleatum, and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius), only B. fragilis ssp. thetaiotamicron survived the 48-h storage period in the DGT. Under these test conditions the DGT did not adequately maintain the viability of the majority of anaerobic bacteria tested (when held on cotton swabs). However, the MST did maintain the viability of all species tested for at least the first 2 h of storage.
TI  - Bactericidal activity of aerobic and anaerobic polymorphonuclear neutrophils.
AB  - Human polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) were made anaerobic by nitrogen washout (oxygen saturation <1%, Eh < -42 mV at pH 7.0), and the ability of the cells to kill bacteria was assayed and compared to the bactericidal activity of aerobic PMN. Anaerobic PMN were able to kill Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus, viridans streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Bacteroides fragilis, Clostridium perfringens, and Peptococcus magnus normally. Organisms that were not killed normally by anaerobic PMN included Staphylococcus aureus (strains Wood 46 and 502a), Escherichia coli, Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus vulgaris, and Salmonella typhimurium. These findings suggest that mechanisms other than those dependent on hydrogen peroxide may be important in the killing of some bacteria.
