TI  == isolation and purification of a campylobacter upsaliensis autolysin.
AB  == autolytic activity in the soluble and sediment fractions of sonicates of the spiral and the coccoid form of campylobacter upsaliensis could not be demonstrated by native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page). autolysins were detected, however, by using denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-page gels containing either purified escherichia coli peptidoglycan or whole cells of micrococcus luteus (micrococcus lysodeikticus) as the turbid substrate, with subsequent renaturation by treatment with triton x-100 buffer. in renaturing gels that contained escherichia coli peptidoglycan, 14 putative autolytic bands ranging from 200 to 12 kda were detected. in similar gels containing whole cells of m. luteus, only a single band appeared with a molecular mass of 34 kda. this band corresponded to one of the bands present in the gels containing escherichia coli peptidoglycan. this common autolysin was isolated by  adsorbing it from campylobacter upsaliensis soluble fractions onto m. luteus cells and then subjecting these cells to renaturing sds-page in gels containing escherichia coli peptidoglycan. the 34-kda autolysin differed from a single 51-kda autolysin unique to the m. luteus cells, and when isolated from an sds-page gel, was pure when tested by isoelectric focusing. the n-terminal amino  acid sequence analysis showed the first 15 amino acids of the 34-kda autolysin to have 67% identity to a part of antigenic protein peb4 of campylobacter jejuni. the purified autolysin was used to immunize rabbits and the antibodies produced precipitated autolytic activity from cell lysates. the specificity of the antibodies was shown by western blotting: only a single specific band occurred, with a molecular mass of 34 kda, and thus it seems unlikely that the 34-kda autolysin was derived from any of the other autolysins that were detected.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.
