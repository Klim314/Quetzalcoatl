TI  == comparative study of nasal bacterial carriage in pediatric patients from two different geographical regions.
AB  == the aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of bacterial carriage in the anterior nares of two different patient cohorts, aged 5-15 years. by use of a sensitive enrichment broth, gram-positive and -negative bacteria were cultured from the two cohorts of each 100 patients at the referral clinic in eritrea and at a german university hospital. in the german cohort, 27% of the patients were positive either for gram-negative (n=5) or -positive bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus (n=8; mrsa (n=2)), staphylococcus epidermidis (n=12), corynebacterium spp. (n=4), and streptococcus pyogenes (n=1). in comparison, the  eritrean cohort revealed 33% bacterial carriers in the anterior nares. among the  identified species were s. aureus (n=2), s. epidermidis (n=13), streptococcus haemolyticus (n=9), and gram-negative rods including klebsiella pneumoniae/oxytoca (n=5), enterobacter agglomerans (n=4), escherichia coli (n=2), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=1). noteworthy, none of the eritrean patients were  positive for mrsa. in both cohorts there was no co-occurrence of gram-positive and -negative bacteria in the anterior nares. however, we observed in two subjects of the eritrean cohort co-colonization with s. epidermidis and s. haemolyticus. the occurrence of gram-negative bacteria was less significant by age in the german cohort, whereas in the eritrean cohort gram-negative bacteria were more frequently detected in carriers aged 5-9 years. continued surveillance  of s. aureus and gram-negative bacteria carriage deserves further attention and might help to determine future trends in the characteristics of nasal carriage, subsequent incidence of infections, and the potential effectiveness of targeted population based intervention.

TI  == vaginal bacterial flora and cytology in proestrous bitches: role on fertility.
AB  == the study of canine vaginal cytology underwent limited evolution over the years.  presence and significance of inflammatory cells in vaginal smears are little considered aspects in the bitch. moreover, occurrence of vaginal bacteria in breeding bitches during follicular phase of the reproductive cycle, in absence of clinical signs of infection, involves the difficult question of antibiotics administration. the aim of this study was to relate findings in vaginal cytology  (presence of neutrophils, lymphocytes, eosinophils, erytrocytes and bacteria) and microbial environment during proestrus with fertility outcomes (development of pregnancy, uterine infection, resorption, abortion and neonatal mortality). bacteria sensitivity to antibiotics normally used in small animal practice was also evaluated. bacteria isolated from vagina, in order of frequency, were enterococcus faecalis, streptococcus beta-haemolyticus, pasteurella multocida, e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, e. coli haemolyticus, arcanobacterium pyogenes, streptococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and acinetobacter spp. no mycoplasmas were observed. the present study showed that proestrous cytological aspects do not affect fertility. eosinophils were never detected, while erythrocytes were always detected. during diestrus, e. coli was found in all pregnant bitches that developed clinical symptoms of uterine disorders (n = 3), resulting in uterine infection, resorption or abortion, but without statistical significance. vaginal presence of streptococcus spp. in proestrus was instead negatively associated with development of uterine infections (p = 0.005). therefore, streptococcus spp. could have a protective competitive role against more dangerous pathogens affecting fertility of the bitch. among the 12 antibiotics tested, gram-negative bacteria showed a significant sensitivity towards the amoxicillin and clavulanic acid association (p = 0.038). however, antibiotic treatment before mating, on the basis of positive culture, yet in the absence of clinical signs, seems to be unnecessary besides harmful leading to imbalance in vaginal commensal flora with adverse effects on fertility. in conclusion, vaginal bacteria, neutrophils, lymphocytes and erytrocytes should be considered as physiological aspect in the bitch during  proestrus that does not require antibiotic therapy when asymptomatic.

TI  == susceptibility of common aerobic pathogens to tigecycline: results of a surveillance study in germany.
AB  == tigecycline is a novel antimicrobial agent for parenteral use encompassing a broad spectrum of bacterial pathogens, including multi-resistant organisms. here, we report the results of the first nationwide surveillance trial that was conducted in order to evaluate the susceptibility of bacterial isolates to tigecycline in a european country prior to its clinical use. a total of 2,610 gram-positive and gram-negative organisms recovered from hospitalized patients were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined using the microdilution method. all enterococci, staphylococci (including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus; mrsa), and streptococci tested were  tigecycline-susceptible, except one isolate of staphylococcus haemolyticus. among the gram-negative bacteria, 100% of the escherichia coli isolates (including extended spectrum beta-lactamase [esbl]-producers) were tigecycline-susceptible,  while about 10% of the enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were resistant. based on the results of this surveillance study, tigecycline may  represent a suitable option most notably for the empiric treatment of bacterial mixed infections, including in clinical situations in which multi-resistant organisms are suspected.

TI  == [bacterial causes of meningitis in newborns].
AB  == introduction: bacterial meningitis jeopardizes the life of affected newborns and  in survived children often leaves permanent sequels. the sooner the diagnosis is  established and the therapy is started, the more a prosperous outcome can be expected. when the indication is established, lumbar punction should be performed. on the basis of the results of cytological and biochemical analyses of the cerebrospinal fluid (csf) that point to bacterial meningitis, the initial therapy should begin even before the results of bacteriological analyses. it is important to know which causes are to be expected in order to make an adequate choice of antibiotics for initial therapy. the aim of this study is to identify the causes of meningitis, frequency of their occurrings and mortality-rate in the affected newborns. patients and methods: a prospective study was carried out in the paediatric department of the institute from january 1, 1978 to december 31, 2000. patients originated from all parts of yugoslavia. after the establishing of indication, lumbar punction was performed. csf was sent to cytological, biochemical and bacteriological analyses. diagnosis of meningitis was established when at least two criteria of four were fulfilled: 1. isolation of the cause by csf culture; 2. elevation of csf leukocyte count more than 20 with predominance of polymorphonuclear leukocytes; 3. hypoglucorrhachia (glycaemia less than 40 mg  percent or less than 50 percent of glycaemia); 4. identification of bacteria by the gram stain of csf sediment. in 173 newborns the cause of bacterial meningitis was confirmed. results and discussion: causes of meningitis were as follows: e. coli in 46 newborns (n) (26.5%), streptococcus b haemolyticus group b in 35 n (20.2%), k. pneumoniae in 27 n (15.6%), k. oxytoca in 3 n (1.7%), proteus spp in  14 n (8%), salmonella spp in 12 n, pseudomonas spp in 9 n, streptococcus pneumoniae in 9 n, acinetobacter calcoaceticus in 4 n, enterobacter spp in 3 n, l. monocytogenes and serratia marcescens and staphylococcus aureus in 2 n each, and in one n. meningitidis, streptococcus group d, citrobacter, morganella morganii and alkaligenes xilosoxidans. over the period 1978-1987, the most frequent causes were: e. coli (28.2%), sbhb (26.8%) and klebsiella spp (11.3%). over the period 1991-2000, order and frequency of causes had been changed: klebsiella spp (26.8%), e. coli (19.2%), sbhb (14.1%), etc. in addition, new causes appeared, namely: morganella morganii, citrobacter, k. oxitoca and alkaligenes xylosoxidans (table 2). of a total of 173 patients, 52 (30.1%) died:  of 124 children with meningitis caused by gram-negative bacteria, 39 (31.4%) died, and of 49 children with gram-positive bacteria, 13 (26.5%) died (table 1).  comparing the first and the last decade, mortality decreased by only 0.2% (table  2). the explanation might be that the patients came to the institute too late, and after manifestation of resistant and multiresistant causes that obscured the  appropriate selection of antibiotics for initial therapy. the precious time between the onset of the disease and start of the therapy was lost in this way. newborns with bacterial meningitis should be treated only in health institutions  where the intensive care units for newborns exist. conclusion: the most frequent  causes of meningitis are the following: e. coli, sbhb and klebsiella pn. frequency of causes of meningitis changed with time. new uncommon causes have appeared. the mortality-rate remained very high.

TI  == evaluation of the uro-quick, a new rapid automated system, for the detection of well-characterized antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  == the uro-quick system has been employed to detect antibiotic resistance in genotypically and/or phenotypically well-characterized bacterial species including those that might not be easily identified by routine procedure. in order to achieve full agreement between the antibiotic susceptibility results obtained by the reference method (nccls) and the uro-quick system, the optimal experimental conditions (inoculum size, time of incubation and antibiotic concentration) for each strain to be used by the automatic system were determined. the shorter time periods for generation of correct susceptibility results were 180 min for ampicillin- and ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli and for esbl- and inhibitor-resistant tem (irt)-producing e. coli; 360 min for penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, as well as for strains with reduced susceptibility to this antibiotic (both intermediate, and resistant isolates). the same time was required to detect erythromycin-resistant pneumococci irrespective of their mechanism of resistance (ribosomal methylation  and efflux-mediated), streptococcus pyogenes exhibiting the three erythromycin-resistance phenotypes (constitutive, inducible and m-type) and klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter aerogenes, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis and moraxella morganii refractory to third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, ciprofloxacin and other classes of antimicrobial agents; 480 min for penicillin-resistant, constitutive and inducible oxacillin-resistant (oxa-r) staphylococcus aureus and oxa-r staphylococcus epidermidis. the same period of time was also necessary to find the great majority of drug-resistance exhibited by pseudomonas aeruginosa. teicoplanin-resistant staphylococcus haemolyticus, vancomycin-resistant (vana, vanb, vanc) high-level aminoglycoside-resistant (hlar) enterococcus spp, and imipenem-resistant p. aeruginosa required longer incubation (24 h) to be detected. the results obtained indicate that uro-quick might be a reliable and promising instrument for the correct detection of the above antibiotic resistance markers.

TI  == different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to epigallocatechin gallate.
AB  == we examined the antibacterial effects of epigallocatechin gallate (egcg, the main constituent of tea catechins) against various strains of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods. compared to the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of egcg against s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hominis, and s. haemolyticus (50-100 micro g/ml), higher mics (>or=800 micro g/ml) were observed against gram-negative rods, including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and serratia marcescens. and difference was observed between the binding abilities of egcg with viable s. aureus and with e. coli. the bactericidal activity of egcg for s. aureus was blocked dose-dependently by purified peptidoglycan but not by lipopolysaccharide  or dextran. it was also found that peptone and protein, but not amino acids, in the culture medium greatly affected the antibacterial activity of egcg. these results indicate that the structure of the bacterial cell wall and the different  affinities of egcg with the various cell wall components are responsible for the  different susceptibilities of staphylococcus and gram-negative rods to egcg.

TI  == intestinal microflora in early infancy: composition and development.
AB  == the neonatal intestinal microbiota is a complex ecosystem composed of numerous genera, species and strains of bacteria. this enormous cell mass performs a variety of unique activities that affect both the colonic and systemic physiology. its primary activities include nutritive, metabolic, immunological and protective functions. most studies of infants have been based on faecal samples using the classical plating techniques with culturing on specific media.  the limitations of these methods must be taken into account when evaluating the varying results of the different studies. the establishment of the gut microbial  population is not strictly a succession in the ecological sense; it is rather a complex process influenced by microbial and host interactions and by external and internal factors. the climax intestinal flora is attained in successive stages. the foetal intestine is sterile and bathed in swallowed amniotic fluid. following delivery, multiple different antigens challenge the intestine of the newborn. the maternal intestinal flora is a source of bacteria for the neonatal gut. the bacterial flora is usually heterogeneous during the first few days of life, independently of feeding habits. after the first week of life, a stable bacterial flora is usually established. in full-term infants a diet of breast milk induces  the development of a flora rich in bifidobacterium spp. other obligate anaerobes, such as clostridium spp. and bacteroides spp., are more rarely isolated and also  enterobacteria and enterococci are relatively few. during the corresponding period, formula-fed babies are often colonized by other anaerobes in addition to  bifidobacteria and by facultatively anaerobic bacteria; the development of a "bifidus flora" is unusual. in other studies the presence of a consistent number  of bifidobacteria in infants delivered in large urban hospitals has not been demonstrated, whether the babies were bottle fed or exclusively breastfed. the predominant faecal bacteria were coliforms and bacteroides. according to these studies, environmental factors may be more important than breastfeeding in gut colonization after delivery. environmental factors are indeed extremely important for the intestinal colonization of infants born by caesarean section. in these infants, the establishment of a stable flora characterized by a low incidence of  bacteroides spp. and by the isolation of few other bacteria is consistently delayed. in extremely low-birthweight infants, hospitalization in neonatal intensive care units, characterized by prolonged antibiotic therapy, parenteral nutrition, delayed oral feedings and intubation seems to affect the composition of the intestinal microbiota. the gut is colonized by a small number of bacterial species; lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp. are seldom, if ever, identified. according to the few studies so far performed, the predominant species are enterococcus faecalis, e. coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus. hygienic conditions and antimicrobial procedures strongly influence the intestinal colonization pattern.

TI  == sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  == 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at kaohsiung chang gung memorial hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. the 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. the implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included enterobacter species (enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes), klebsiella species (klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca), escherichia coli, staphylococcus species (staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus haemolyticus), pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterococcus, serratia marcescens, citrobacter diversus, proteus mirabilis, streptococcus viridans and neisseria meningitidis. six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included e. cloacae in one, a. baumannii in one, k. pneumoniae in one and s. aureus in three. the management of  these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the  high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. however, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.

TI  == stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants.
AB  == aim: to serially characterise aerobic and anaerobic stool microflora in extremely low birthweight infants and to correlate colonisation patterns with clinical risk factors. methods: stool specimens from 29 infants of birthweight <1000 g were collected on days 10, 20, and 30 after birth. quantitative aerobic and anaerobic  cultures were performed. results: by day 30, predominant species were enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, enterbacter  cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, and staphylococcus haemolyticus. lactobacillus and bifidobacteria spp were identified in only one infant. in breast milk fed (but not in formula fed) infants, the total number of bacterial species/stool specimen increased significantly with time (2.50 (se 0.34) on day 10; 3.13 (0.38) on day 20; 4.27 (0.45) on day 30) as did quantitative bacterial counts; gram negative species accounted for most of the increase. on day 30, significant inverse correlations were found between days of previous antibiotic treatment and number of bacterial species (r=0.491) and total organisms/g of stool (r=0.482). gestational age, birthweight, maternal antibiotic or steroid treatment, prolonged rupture of the membranes, and mode of delivery did not seem to affect colonisation patterns. conclusions: the gut of extremely low birthweight infants  is colonised by a paucity of bacterial species. breast milking and reduction of antibiotic exposure are critical to increasing fecal microbial diversity.

TI  == [antibiotic sensitivity of pneumonia pathogens in newborns and problems of antibacterial therapy of the pathologic process].
AB  == the results of the bacteriological investigation of the secretion from the trachea, large bronchi and fauces of 36 newborns (including 27 preterms) with severe pneumonia were analyzed. 20 of them were born of women with complicating somatic, obstetric and gynecologic histories: candidiasis, herpes genitalis, chronic endometritis, adnexitis or chronic pyelonephritis that could be the risk  of the fetus intranatal infection. during the acute period of pneumonia in the newborns within the first 4-8 days of life mainly pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated (51.3 per cent), staphylococcus epidermidis, s. haemolyticus and enterococcus faecalis were less frequent (18.9, 8.1 and 5.4 per cent, respectively). klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus anhaemolyticus and other organisms were extremely rare. on the whole the gramnegative microflora predominated. the study of the antibiotic susceptibility showed that the majority of the p. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible to amikacin and polymyxin b, the isolates susceptible to ceftazidime were less frequent, 20-25 per cent of the isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefoperazone and imipenem and practically no isolates were susceptible to gentamicin. the s.epidermidis isolates were susceptible to rifampicin and vancomycin and in rare cases to fusidin and amikacin and resistant to oxacillin. when the treatment course was more than 15 days, the isolates proved to be susceptible to 1/3 of the presently  available antibiotics. because of the host low protective forces, peculiarities of the infection pathways and high frequency of the resistant strains it is valid to include netilmicin, imipenem, cefoperazone and ceftriaxone to the complex therapy of the newborns along with the substitution immunotherapy.

TI  == the pattern of micro-organisms and the efficacy of new macrolide in acute lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is one of the major health problems in developing countries such as indonesia. according to the national household health survey conducted by the ministry of health in 1992, lrtis still rank fourth as the main cause of death in indonesia. the problem of lrtis could be simply managed as long as the causative organism can be identified and the proper antibiotic known. in some occasions, it is not quite so easy to identify the causative micro-organism, especially in lower tract infections. there are several methods of obtaining specimens from lrtis for cultures. the easiest, most simple  way is to collect expectorated sputum. unfortunately, because of the high rate of contamination by upper respiratory tract flora, this method is not reliable. recognizing the difficulties with routine expectorated sputum cultures, two alternative approaches have been suggested. one approach is to bypass potential expectorated sputum 'contaminants' in the oropharynx by transtracheal aspiration  or transthoracic aspiration. the second approach is to modify the usual technique of processing expectorated sputum by either washing techniques or by quantitative cultures. azithromycin and clarithromycin are chemically related to macrolide erithromycin. both antibiotics retain the traditional macrolide spectrum of activity against gram-positive and atypical pneumonia pathogens, while demonstrating improved activity against gram-negative bacteria. the american thoracic society (ats) recommended the use of macrolide for outpatients with community-acquired pneumonia, without comorbidity and 60 years of age or younger. a total of 34 outpatients with acute lrtis were open-comparative, randomly allocated to treatment with the new macrolide in persahabatan hospital, jakarta,  1996. the purposes of this study were: (i) to identify the causative micro-organisms; and (ii) to evaluate the clinical efficacy of the new macrolide  in these infections. azithromycin 500 mg was given orally once a day for 3 days and was administered 1 h before or 2 h after every meal. clarithromycin 500 mg was given orally every 12 h for 10 days. the diagnosis of the patients were: 16 with pneumonia, 10 with acute bronchitis and 8 with acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. in this study of 34 patients, the sputum specimens were washed with n acetylcysteine before culture and we could only detect micro-organisms in one patient. before treatment, we found 47 strains in 33 (97.05%) patients and after  treatment we found five strains. from serological examination, only four (11.76%) atypical bacterial were detected. the most frequently found microorganisms were 23 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae (40.42%), 10 of streptococcus alpha haemolyticus (21.26%), five of streptococcus pneumoniae (10.63%) and five of staphylococcus aureus (10.63%). the atypical bacterial were: two legionella pneumophila, one mycoplasma pneumoniae and one chlamydia pneumoniae. the clinical efficacy of new macrolides were 100% and the bacteriological responses with eradication of 94.12% vs 70.59% of isolates in the azithromycin and clarithromycin groups are shown in table 1. there were no adverse reactions detected in the two treatment groups until the end of the study.

TI  == bacterial and ureaplasma colonization of the airway: radiologic findings in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == objective: we designed this retrospective study to compare radiologic findings in premature infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) in whom gram-positive cocci (gpc), gram-negative bacilli (gnb), or ureaplasma urealyticum were colonized. another objective was to correlate the radiologic findings of these patients with the clinical severity of bpd. study design: we correlated serial tracheal aspirates with radiographic findings from 183 infants whose birth weight was < or = 1250 gm. bpd severity was assessed by oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age (36 w pca) and at the time of discharge. two radiologists independently scored films taken at birth and 1, 7, 14, 21, 28, and 35 days of life. results: of the study population, 55% were male and 35% were black; 80% received surfactant and 69% received dexamethasone; 91% survived. gpc isolates from throat cultures were mainly staphylococcus [corrected] epidermidis and streptococcus haemolyticus. a superimposed gnb colonization was present in 37% of these infants. most common isolates were klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and escherichia coli. sepsis caused by gpc developed in 16% of all patients; 7% had sepsis caused by gnb. infants infected with gnb remained receiving oxygen at 36 w pca and at the time of discharge twice as often as those noninfected. radiologic findings: hyperinflation, interstitial changes, and generalized or localized emphysema were prominent features throughout. mean radiologic scores increased over time in a pattern similar among gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum infected and noninfected infants. high radiologic scores were not predictive at any time of infants who needed supplemental oxygen at 28 days and at 36 w pca. infants infected with u. urealyticum were neither clinically nor radiologically different than noncolonized neonates. conclusion: gpc, gnb, and u. urealyticum airway colonization is not associated with particular radiographic changes at any time. gnb-infected infants had the most severe bpd course, and yet they were radiologically indistinguishable from the other patients. u. urealyticum colonization does not result in more clinically severe bpd or demonstrate a unique radiologic course.

TI  == neonatal airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli: association with severity of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
AB  == background: airway colonization with gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and gram-positive cocci (gpc) is common in mechanically ventilated neonates. whether  gnb are related to nosocomial bloodstream infection (bsi) and/or to the severity  of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (bpd) is unknown. methods: we prospectively examine this relationship using a cohort design. data from 260 < or = 1250-g birth weight inborn infants (1991 to 1995) intubated > or = 2 weeks included 917 serial tracheal cultures and 583 blood cultures. the severity of bpd was assessed by duration of mechanical ventilation, oxygen dependency at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and the use of home oxygen supplementation. results: after 2 weeks of ventilation, 80% of the infants were colonized with gpc (staphylococus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus in 90% of the cases). superimposed on 36% of these infants was gnb airway colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (25%), enterobacter cloacae (25%), escherichia coli (25%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%), serratia marcescen (10%), acinetobacter baumannii and haemophilus influenzae (5%). comparison between 174 gpc- and 86 gnb-colonized infants showed  that demographics, birth weight, gestational age, perinatal risk factors and mortality were similar. fifteen percent of gnb-colonized infants developed bsi caused by gnb and 14% developed bsi caused by gpc. no significant temporal relationship between airway colonization and bsi was noted. gnb infants were ventilated longer and required oxygen at 36 weeks of postconceptional age and home oxygen supplementation twice as often as infants colonized only with gpc. gnb colonization was a predictor of severe bpd after controlling for ventilation. ureaplasma colonization occurred in 28% of gnb-colonized and 33% of noncolonized  infants and was not a predictor of bpd severity. conclusion: gnb airway colonization creates a moderate risk for bsi. antibiotic treatment does not regularly eradicate gnb. gnb airway colonization is associated with severe bpd, but further studies will be necessary before therapeutic efforts to eradicate gnb from the airways should be undertaken.
