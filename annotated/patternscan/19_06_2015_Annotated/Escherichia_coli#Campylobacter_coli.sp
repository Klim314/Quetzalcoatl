TI  == glycosnap: a high-throughput screening methodology for engineering designer glycosylation enzymes.
AB  == the campylobacter jejuni protein glycosylation locus (pgl) encodes enzymes for asparagine-linked (n-linked) glycosylation and serves as the prototype for n-glycosylation in bacteria. this pathway has been functionally transferred into  escherichia coli, thereby enabling efficient n-linked glycosylation of acceptor proteins with the c. jejuni heptasaccharide in this genetically tractable host. however, expansion of this bacterial system to encompass the vast biological diversity of potential glycans and target proteins often requires engineering of  the non-native enzymes to isolate variants with optimal or altered functions. here, we describe a genetic assay named glycosnap (glycosylation of secreted n-linked acceptor proteins) that facilitates engineering of glycosylation enzymes directly in e. coli. to date, this method has been successfully applied to screen (1) combinatorial libraries of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferases (osts) for relaxed substrate specificity and (2) acceptor site libraries to identify sequons recognized by natural osts as well as engineered variants.

TI  == a qmra for the transmission of esbl-producing escherichia coli and campylobacter  from poultry farms to humans through flies.
AB  == the public health significance of transmission of esbl-producing escherichia coli and campylobacter from poultry farms to humans through flies was investigated using a worst-case risk model. human exposure was modeled by the fraction of contaminated flies, the number of specific bacteria per fly, the number of flies  leaving the poultry farm, and the number of positive poultry houses in the netherlands. simplified risk calculations for transmission through consumption of chicken fillet were used for comparison, in terms of the number of human exposures, the total human exposure, and, for campylobacter only, the number of human cases of illness. comparing estimates of the worst-case risk of transmission through flies with estimates of the real risk of chicken fillet consumption, the number of human exposures to esbl-producing e. coli was higher for chicken fillet as compared with flies, but the total level of exposure was higher for flies. for campylobacter, risk values were nearly consistently higher  for transmission through flies than for chicken fillet consumption. this indicates that the public health risk of transmission of both esbl-producing e. coli and campylobacter to humans through flies might be of importance. it justifies further modeling of transmission through flies for which additional data (fly emigration, human exposure) are required. similar analyses of other environmental transmission routes from poultry farms are suggested to precede further investigations into flies.

TI  == antimicrobial impacts of essential oils on food borne-pathogens.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of twelve essential oil (pine oil, eucalyptus, thyme,  sage tea, lavender, orange, laurel, lemon, myrtle, lemon, rosemary and juniper) was tested by a disc diffusion method against food borne pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella paratyphi a, klebsiella pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus  faecalis, staphylococcus aureus). the major components in essential oils were monoterpenes hydrocarbons, alpha-pinene, limonene; monoterpene phenol, carvacrol  and oxygenated monoterpenes, camphor, 1,8-cineole, eucalyptol, linalool and linalyl acetate. although the antimicrobial effect of essential oils varied depending on the chemical composition of the essential oils and specific microorganism tested, majority of the oils exhibited antibacterial activity against one or more strains. the essential oil with the lowest inhibition zones was juniper with the values varied from 1.5 to 6 mm. however, the components of essential oil of thyme and pine oil are highly active against food borne pathogen, generating the largest inhibition zones for both gram negative and positive bacteria (5.25-28.25 mm vs. 12.5-30 mm inhibition zones). these results  indicate the possibility use of the essential oils on food system as antimicrobial agents against food-borne pathogen. the article also offers some promising patents on applications of essential oils on food industry as antimicrobial agent.

TI  == statistical approaches to developing a multiplex immunoassay for determining human exposure to environmental pathogens.
AB  == there are numerous pathogens that can be transmitted through water. identifying and understanding the routes and magnitude of exposure or infection to these microbial contaminants are critical to assessing and mitigating risk. conventional approaches of studying immunological responses to exposure or infection such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisas) and other monoplex  antibody-based immunoassays can be very costly, laborious, and consume large quantities of patient sample. a major limitation of these approaches is that they can only be used to measure one analyte at a time. multiplex immunoassays provide the ability to study multiple pathogens simultaneously in microliter volumes of samples. however, there are several challenges that must be addressed when developing these multiplex immunoassays such as selection of specific antigens and antibodies, cross-reactivity, calibration, protein-reagent interferences, and the need for rigorous optimization of protein concentrations. in this study, a design of experiments (doe) approach was used to optimize reagent concentrations  for coupling selected antigens to luminex xmap microspheres for use in an indirect capture, multiplex immunoassay to detect human exposure or infection from pathogens that are potentially transmitted through water. results from helicobacter pylori, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, and salmonella typhimurium singleplexes were used to determine the mean concentrations that would be applied to the multiplex assay. cut-offs to differentiate between exposed and non-exposed individuals were determined using finite mixed modeling (fmm). the statistical approaches developed facilitated the detection of immunoglobulin g (igg) antibodies to h. pylori, c. jejuni, toxoplasma gondii, hepatitis a virus, rotavirus and noroviruses (va387 and norwalk strains) in fifty-four diagnostically characterized plasma samples. of the characterized samples, the detection rate was 87.5% for h. pylori, and 100% for t. gondii assays and 89% for hav. further, the optimized multiplex assay revealed exposure/infection to several other environmental pathogens previously uncharacterized in the samples.

TI  == bacterial enteric infections among older adults in the united states: foodborne diseases active surveillance network, 1996-2012.
AB  == background: a growing segment of the population-adults aged >/=65 years-is more susceptible than younger adults to certain enteric (including foodborne) infections and experience more severe disease. materials and methods: using data  on laboratory-confirmed infections from the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet), we describe trends in the incidence of campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157, listeria monocytogenes, and nontyphoidal salmonella infections in adults aged >/=65 years over time and by age group and sex. we used data from foodnet and other sources to estimate the total number of illnesses, hospitalizations, and deaths in the united states caused by these infections each year using a statistical model to adjust for underdiagnosis (taking into account medical care-seeking, stool sample submission, laboratory practices, and test sensitivity). results: from 1996 to 2012, 4 pathogens caused 21,405 laboratory-confirmed infections among older adults residing in the foodnet surveillance area; 49.3% were hospitalized, and 2.6% died. the average annual rate of infection was highest for salmonella (12.8/100,000) and campylobacter (12.1/100,000). salmonella and listeria led as causes of death. among older adults, rates of laboratory-confirmed infection and  the percentage of patients who were hospitalized and who died generally increased with age. a notable exception was the rate of campylobacter infections, which decreased with increasing age. adjusting for underdiagnosis, we estimated that these pathogens caused about 226,000 illnesses ( approximately 600/100,000) annually among u.s. adults aged >/=65 years, resulting in approximately 9700 hospitalizations and approximately 500 deaths. conclusions: campylobacter, e. coli o157, listeria, and salmonella are major contributors to illness in older adults, highlighting the value of effective and targeted intervention.

TI  == constitutive expression of campylobacter jejuni truncated hemoglobin ctrhb improves the growth of escherichia coli cell under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
AB  == bacteria hemoglobin could bind to the oxygen, transfer it from the intracellular  microenvironment to the respiration process and sustain the energy for the metabolism and reproduction of cells. heterologous expression of bacteria hemoglobin gene could improve the capacity of the host on oxygen-capturing and allow it to grow even under microaerophilic condition. to develop a system based  on hemoglobin to help bacteria cells overcome the oxygen shortage in fermentation, in this study, campylobacter jejuni truncated hemoglobin (ctrhb) gene was synthesized and expressed under the control of constitutive expression promoters p2 and pspo1-ii in escherichia coli. as showed by the growth curves of  the two recombinants p2-ctrhb and pspo1-ii-ctrhb, constitutive expression of ctrhb improved cell growth under aerobic shaking-flasks, anaerobic capped-bottles and bioreactor conditions. according to the nmr analysis, this improvement might  come from the expression of hemoglobin which could boost the metabolism of cells  by supplying more oxygen to the respiratory chain processes. through semi-quantitative rt-pcr and co differential spectrum assays, we further discussed the connection between the growth patterns of the recombinants, the expression level of ctrhb and oxygen binding capacity of ctrhb in cells. based on the growth patterns of these recombinants in bioreactor, a possible choice on different type of recombinants under specific fermentation conditions was also suggested in this study.

TI  == application of bacteriophages in post-harvest control of human pathogenic and food spoiling bacteria.
AB  == bacteriophages have attracted great attention for application in food biopreservation. lytic bacteriophages specific for human pathogenic bacteria can  be isolated from natural sources such as animal feces or industrial wastes where  the target bacteria inhabit. lytic bacteriophages have been tested in different food systems for inactivation of main food-borne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica, shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni and cronobacter sakazkii, and also  for control of spoilage bacteria. application of lytic bacteriophages could selectively control host populations of concern without interfering with the remaining food microbiota. bacteriophages could also be applied for inactivation  of bacteria attached to food contact surfaces or grown as biofilms. bacteriophages may receive a generally recognized as safe status based on their lack of toxicity and other detrimental effects to human health. phage preparations specific for l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7 and s. enterica serotypes have been commercialized and approved for application in foods or as part of surface decontamination protocols. phage endolysins have a broader host specificity compared to lytic bacteriophages. cloned endolysins could be used as  natural preservatives, singly or in combination with other antimicrobials such as bacteriocins.

TI  == microbiological survey of birds of prey pellets.
AB  == a microbiological survey of 73 pellets collected from different birds of prey species housed at the wildlife rescue and rehabilitation center of napoli (southern italy) was performed. pellets were analyzed by culture and biochemical  methods as well as by serotyping and polymerase chain reaction. we isolated a wide range of bacteria some of them also pathogens for humans (i.e. salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium, campylobacter coli, escherichia coli o serogroups). this study highlights the potential role of birds of prey as asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic bacteria which could be disseminated in the environment not only through the birds of prey feces but also through their pellets.

TI  == acute-phase responses in cattle infected with hydatid cysts and microbial agents.
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of hydatid cysts and microbial agents on the acute-phase response in cattle. twenty-seven cattle with  hydatid cysts and eight apparently healthy cattle comprised the study and control groups, respectively. parasitological, microbiological, histopathological and immunohistochemical examinations of the liver and lungs were undertaken, and 49 of these organs were infected with cysts. in 14 of 31 (45.1%) livers and 10 of 18 (55.5%) lungs microbial growth was observed. the most frequent species occurring  in the liver were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter spp., whereas in the lungs the most common species was candida  spp., followed by streptococcus spp., mannheimia haemolytica, corynebacterium spp., micrococcus spp. and s. aureus. the concentration of serum interleukin (il-6) in infected cattle, 455.35 +/- 39.68 pg/ml, was significantly higher than  that of 83.02 +/- 17.87 pg/ml in the control group (p0.05). the highest concentrations of il-6 were detected in serum of the cattle where microbial growth had been detected, followed by cattle infected with bacteria + trichostrongylus sp. (p< 0.001). consequently, saa showed an important increase in the group infected with hydatid cysts, whereas haptoglobin level decreased. it was noticed that il-6, like saa, had a significant role in hydatid cyst infection. therefore il-6 and saa appear to be major markers in the detection of  infection of cattle with hydatid cysts.

TI  == effectiveness of inactivation of foodborne pathogens during simulated home pan frying of steak, hamburger or meat strips.
AB  == in order to evaluate the effect of simulated home pan frying of raw meat and meat preparations of different animal species on the thermal inactivation of pathogens, the heat resistance (d-value) of three strains of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes and two strains of generic e. coli was validated in bhi and adjusted bhi (i.e. ph5.6 and  1.5% nacl) at 60 degrees c. the d-values were obtained of the linear phase of the survivor curves created in ginafit, a freeware tool to fit models to experimental data. the obtained d-values corresponded to those previously published in literature and confirmed l. monocytogenes to be the most heat resistant pathogen  among them. heat treatment in adjusted bhi significantly increased heat-resistance of e. coli o157:h7 and generic e. coli. subsequently, the thermal inactivation of l. monocytogenes, salmonella spp., c. jejuni and e. coli o157:h7  was evaluated using a standardized procedure simulating commonly used home pan frying of various types of meat including steaks or filets, hamburgers and meat strips from various animal species such as pork, beef, chicken, lamb and some turkey, horse, kangaroo and crocodile meat. corresponding f70-values were calculated based upon measured core time/temperature profiles. it was noted that  a core temperature of 70 degrees c was not always achieved and, moreover, a heat  treatment equivalent to 2min at 70 degrees c was also not always obtained. this was in particular noted in hamburgers although the meat was visually judged well  done. on several occasions, residual survivors of the initial inoculated (4logcfu/g) food borne pathogens could be recovered either by enumeration (limit  of detection 1logcfu/g) or by the presence/absence testing per 25g. pan frying of hamburgers yielded the highest number of surviving pathogenic bacteria (46%), followed by well-done filets and steaks (13%) and meat strips (12%). taking only  steaks (beef, horse, kangaroo, crocodile and turkey) into account, residual detection of pathogens occurred for all levels of doneness: 18% for well-done, 71% for medium and even 90% for rare steaks. numbers of l. monocytogenes recovered after heat treatment ranged from <1logcfu/g to 2.6logcfu/g. although, the prevalence of pathogens in meat might be low, and the numbers present in case of natural contamination are probably lower than the current used inoculum of 4logcfu/g, consumers could still be exposed to surviving food borne pathogens in  case of these commonly used pan frying of raw meat and meat preparations at consumer's home.

TI  == preliminary incidence and trends of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food - foodborne diseases active surveillance network, 10 u.s. sites, 2006-2014.
AB  == foodborne illnesses represent a substantial, yet largely preventable, health burden in the united states. in 10 u.s. geographic areas, the foodborne diseases  active surveillance network* (foodnet) monitors the incidence of laboratory-confirmed infections caused by nine pathogens transmitted commonly through food. this report summarizes preliminary 2014 data and describes changes  in incidence compared with 2006-2008 and 2011-2013. in 2014, foodnet reported 19,542 infections, 4,445 hospitalizations, and 71 deaths. the incidence of shiga  toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157 and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium infections declined in 2014 compared with 2006-2008, and the incidence of infection with campylobacter, vibrio, and salmonella serotypes infantis and javiana was higher. compared with 2011-2013, the incidence of stec o157 and salmonella typhimurium infections was lower, and the incidence of stec non-o157 and salmonella serotype infantis infections was higher in 2014. despite  ongoing food safety efforts, the incidence of many infections remains high, indicating that further prevention measures are needed to make food safer and achieve national health objectives.

TI  == a review of the current status of relevant zoonotic pathogens in wild swine (sus  scrofa) populations: changes modulating the risk of transmission to humans.
AB  == many wild swine populations in different parts of the world have experienced an unprecedented demographic explosion that may result in increased exposure of humans to wild swine zoonotic pathogens. interactions between humans and wild swine leading to pathogen transmission could come from different ways, being hunters and game professionals the most exposed to acquiring infections from wild swine. however, increasing human settlements in semi-natural areas, outdoor activities, socio-economic changes and food habits may increase the rate of exposure to wild swine zoonotic pathogens and to potentially emerging pathogens from wild swine. frequent and increasing contact rate between humans and wild swine points to an increasing chance of zoonotic pathogens arising from wild swine to be transmitted to humans. whether this frequent contact could lead to new zoonotic pathogens emerging from wild swine to cause human epidemics or emerging disease outbreaks is difficult to predict, and assessment should be based on thorough epidemiologic surveillance. additionally, several gaps in knowledge on wild swine global population dynamics trends and wild swine-zoonotic pathogen interactions should be addressed to correctly assess the potential role  of wild swine in the emergence of diseases in humans. in this work, viruses such  as hepatitis e virus, japanese encephalitis virus, influenza virus and nipah virus, and bacteria such as salmonella spp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, campylobacter spp. and leptospira spp. have been identified as the most prone to be transmitted from wild swine to humans on the basis of geographic spread in wild swine populations worldwide, pathogen circulation rates in wild swine populations, wild swine population trends in endemic areas, susceptibility  of humans to infection, transmissibility from wild swine to humans and existing evidence of wild swine-human transmission events.

TI  == a comparison of fluctuations of campylobacter and escherichia coli concentrations on broiler chicken carcasses during processing in two slaughterhouses.
AB  == the causes of differences in campylobacter and escherichia coli concentrations on broiler chicken carcasses after chilling between slaughterhouses are not fully identified. therefore, it is a challenge for slaughterhouses to comply with process hygiene criteria for broiler meat. the aim of the study was to identify which processing steps contribute to increases or decreases in campylobacter and  e. coli concentrations within and between two slaughterhouses. identifying the processing steps with variable performance could explain the differences in bacterial concentrations after chilling between slaughterhouses. thermotolerant campylobacter and e. coli concentrations on carcasses during broiler processing were measured during the summer period in 21 trials after bleeding, scalding, defeathering, evisceration and chilling. in two slaughterhouses with comparable campylobacter and e. coli concentrations in the incoming batches (after bleeding), the mean log10 concentrations are found to be significantly different  after chilling. campylobacter concentrations decreased by 1.40 log10 in slaughterhouse 1 and by 1.86 log10 in slaughterhouse 2, whereas e. coli decreased by 2.19 log10 in slaughterhouse 1 and by 2.84 log10 in slaughterhouse 2. higher concentrations of campylobacter and e. coli on carcasses after chilling were observed in slaughterhouse 1 in which an increase in concentrations was observed  after evisceration. the effect of processing on campylobacter and e. coli concentrations in slaughterhouse 1 did not differ between batches. in slaughterhouse 2, the effect of processing on the concentrations of both bacteria varied over batches. changes in e. coli concentration levels during processing were similar to campylobacter except for defeathering. e. coli concentration significantly decreased after defeathering in both slaughterhouses, whereas campylobacter increased in slaughterhouse 2 and in slaughterhouse 1 no significant changes were observed. the patterns of increases and decreases in bacterial concentrations during processing are specific for each slaughterhouse.  inhomogeneous patterns potentially explain the differences in concentrations after chilling between slaughterhouses. critical processing steps should be validated in each slaughterhouse by longitudinal studies and potentially based on e. coli. e. coli has a potential to be used as an indicator of processing hygiene, because the impact of most of the studied processing steps was similar as for campylobacter.

TI  == the livestock reservoir for antimicrobial resistance: a personal view on changing patterns of risks, effects of interventions and the way forward.
AB  == the purpose of this review was to provide an updated overview on the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock, the associated problems for humans and current knowledge on the effects of reducing resistance in the livestock reservoir on both human health and animal production. there is still limiting data on both use of antimicrobial agents, occurrence and spread of resistance as well as impact on human health. however, in recent years, emerging issues related to methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, clostridium difficile, escherichia coli and horizontally transferred genes indicates that the livestock reservoir has a more significant impact on human health than was estimated 10 years ago, where the focus was mainly on resistance in campylobacter and salmonella. studies have indicated that there might only be a marginal if any benefit from the regular use of antibiotics and have shown that it is possible to substantially reduce the use of antimicrobial agents in livestock production without compromising animal welfare or health or production. in some cases, this should be done in combination with other measures such as biosecurity and use of vaccines. to enable better studies on both the global burden and the effect of interventions, there is a need for global harmonized integrated and continuous surveillance of antimicrobial usage and antimicrobial resistance, preferably associated with data on production and animal diseases to determine the positive  and negative impact of reducing antimicrobial use in livestock.

TI  == heat shock-enhanced conjugation efficiency in standard campylobacter jejuni strains.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, the leading bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the united states, displays significant strain diversity due to horizontal gene transfer. conjugation is an important horizontal gene transfer mechanism contributing to the evolution of bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. it has been observed that heat shock could increase transformation efficiency in some bacteria. in this study, the effect of heat shock on c. jejuni conjugation efficiency and the underlying mechanisms were examined. with a modified escherichia coli donor strain, different c. jejuni recipient strains displayed significant variation in conjugation efficiency ranging from 6.2 x 10(-8) to 6.0 x 10(-3) cfu per recipient cell. despite reduced viability, heat shock of standard c. jejuni nctc 11168 and 81-176 strains (e.g., 48 to 54 degrees c for 30 to 60 min) could dramatically enhance c. jejuni conjugation efficiency up to 1,000-fold. the phenotype of the heat shock-enhanced conjugation in c. jejuni recipient cells could be sustained for at least 9 h. filtered supernatant  from the heat shock-treated c. jejuni cells could not enhance conjugation efficiency, which suggests that the enhanced conjugation efficiency is independent of secreted substances. mutagenesis analysis indicated that the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system and the selected restriction-modification systems (cj0030/cj0031, cj0139/cj0140, cj0690c, and hsdr) were dispensable for heat shock-enhanced conjugation in c. jejuni. taking all results together, this study demonstrated a heat shock-enhanced conjugation efficiency in standard c. jejuni strains, leading to an optimized conjugation protocol for molecular manipulation of this organism. the findings from this study also represent a significant step toward elucidation of the molecular mechanism of conjugative gene transfer in c. jejuni.

TI  == spectrum of enteropathogens detected by the filmarray gi panel in a multicentre study of community-acquired gastroenteritis.
AB  == the european, multicentre, quarterly point-prevalence study of community-acquired diarrhoea (eucodi) analysed stool samples received at ten participating clinical  microbiology laboratories (austria, finland, france, germany, greece, ireland, italy, portugal, romania, and the uk) in 2014. on four specified days, each local laboratory submitted samples from </=20 consecutive patients to the austrian study centre for further testing with the filmarray gi panel (biofire diagnostics, salt lake city, ut, usa). of the 709 samples from as many patients received, 325 (45.8%) tested negative, 268 (37.8%) yielded only one organism, and 116 (16.4%) yielded multiple organisms. positivity rates ranged from 41% (30 of 73 samples) in france to 74% (59 of 80 samples) in romania. with the exception of entamoeba histolytica and vibrio cholerae, all of the 22 targeted pathogens were  detected at least once. enteropathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter species, toxigenic clostridium difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, norovirus and enterotoxigenic e. coli were the six most commonly detected pathogens. when tested according to local protocols, seven of 128 positive samples (5.5%) yielded multiple organisms. overall, the filmarray gi panel detected at least one organism in 54.2% (384/709) of the samples, as compared with 18.1% (128/709) when testing was performed with conventional techniques locally. this underlines the considerable potential of multiplex pcr to improve routine stool diagnostics in community-acquired diarrhoea. classic culture methods directed at the isolation of specific pathogens are increasingly becoming second-line tools, being deployed when rapid molecular tests give positive results. this optimizes the yield from stool examinations and dramatically improves the timeliness of diagnosis.

TI  == the establishment of the colombian integrated program for antimicrobial resistance surveillance (coipars): a pilot project on poultry farms, slaughterhouses and retail market.
AB  == the development of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria (amr) is currently one of the world's most pressing public health problems. the use of antimicrobial agents in humans and animals has resulted in amr which has narrowed the potential use of antibiotics for the treatment of infections in humans. to monitor amr and  to develop control measures, some countries, such as the usa, canada and denmark, have established national integrated surveillance systems (fda, , cipars, 2007, danmap,2002). the components of these programs monitor changes in susceptibility/resistance to antimicrobial agents of selected zoonotic pathogens  and commensal organisms recovered from animals, retail meats and humans. the rapid development of colombia's animal production industry has raised food safety issues including the emergence of antibiotic resistance. the colombian integrated surveillance program for antimicrobial resistance (coipars) was established as a  pilot project to monitor amr on poultry farms, slaughter houses and retail markets.

TI  == molecular survey of occurrence and quantity of legionella spp., mycobacterium spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and amoeba hosts in municipal drinking water storage tank sediments.
AB  == aims: to examine the occurrence and quantity of potential pathogens and an indicator of microbial contamination in the sediments of municipal drinking water storage tanks (mdwsts), given the absence of such data across the united states.  methods and results: sediment samples (87 mdwst) from eighteen locations across ten states of the united states were collected and assayed by qpcr for a range of potential enteric and opportunistic microbial pathogens and a sewage-associated bacteroides marker. potential opportunistic pathogens dominated, with the highest detection of occurrence (per cent positive detection; average cell equivalence (ce)) being mycobacterium spp. (88.9%; 6.7 +/- 8.5 x 104 ce g-1 ), followed by legionella spp. (66.7%; 5.2 +/- 5.9 x 103 ce g-1 ), pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.2%; 250 +/- 880 ce g-1 ) and acanthamoeba spp. (38.9%; 53 +/- 70 ce g-1 ), with no detected naegleria fowleri. most enteric pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli 0157:h7, salmonella enterica, cryptosporidium parvum and giardia duodenalis) were not detected, except for a trace signal for campylobacter spp. there was significant correlation between the qpcr signals of legionella spp. and acanthamoeba spp. (r2 = 0.61, n = 87, p = 0.0001). diverse legionella spp. including leg. pneumophila, leg. pneumophila sg1 and leg. anisa were identified,  each of which might cause legionellosis. conclusions: these results imply that potential opportunistic pathogens are common within mdwst sediments and could act as a source of microbial contamination, but need downstream growth to be of potential concern. significance and impact of the study: the results imply that opportunistic pathogen risks may need to be managed by regular tank cleaning or other management practices.

TI  == involvement of main diarrheagenic escherichia coli, with emphasis on enteroaggregative e. coli, in severe non-epidemic pediatric diarrhea in a high-income country.
AB  == background: bacterial and viral enteric pathogens are the leading cause of diarrhea in infants and children. we aimed to identify and characterize the main  human diarrheagenic e. coli (dec) in stool samples obtained from children less than 5 years of age, hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis in israel, and to examine the hypothesis that co-infection with dec and other enteropathogens is associated with the severity of symptoms. methods: stool specimens obtained from  307 patients were tested by multiplex pcr (mpcr) to identify enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec), enterohemorrhagic (ehec), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) and enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec). specimens were also examined for the presence of  rotavirus by immunochromatography, and of shigella, salmonella and campylobacter  by stool culture; clinical information was also obtained. results: fifty nine (19%) children tested positive for dec; eaec and atypical epec were most common,  each detected in 27 (46%), followed by etec (n = 3; 5%), ehec and typical epec (each in 1 child; 1.5%). most eaec isolates were resistant to cephalexin, cefixime, cephalothin and ampicillin, and genotypic characterization of eaec isolates by o-typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed possible clonal  relatedness among some. the likelihood of having > 10 loose/watery stools on the  most severe day of illness was significantly increased among patients with eaec and rotavirus co-infection compared to children who tested negative for both pathogens: adjusted odds ratio 7.0 (95% ci 1.45-33.71, p = 0.015). conclusion: dec was common in this pediatric population, in a high-income country, and mixed  eaec and rotavirus infection was characterized by especially severe diarrhea.

AB  == background: european hedgehogs (erinaceus europaeus) are hosts for ixodes hexagonus and i. ricinus ticks, which are vectors for zoonotic microorganisms. in addition, hedgehogs may carry several enteric zoonoses as well. it is unclear to  what extent a presence of pathogens in hedgehogs poses a risk to public health, as information on the presence of zoonotic agents in hedgehogs in urban areas is  relatively scarce. methods: engorged ticks and hedgehog faeces were collected from rehabilitating hedgehogs. ticks were screened individually for presence of borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato, b. miyamotoi, anaplasma phagocytophilum, and candidatus neoehrlichia mikurensis using pcr-based assays. faecal samples were screened for presence of campylobacter, salmonella, giardia, cryptosporidium, and extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant-escherichia coli (esc)-resistant e. coli, using both culture-based and pcr-based methods. results: anaplasma phagocytophilum and borrelia genospecies b. afzelii, b. spielmanii, b. garinii, and b. burgdorferi sensu stricto were detected in both i. hexagonus and i. ricinus ticks. despite their widespread distribution in the netherlands, b. miyamotoi and candidatus n. mikurensis were not detected in collected ticks. analysis of hedgehog faecal samples revealed the presence of salmonella enterica  subspecies enterica and campylobacter jejuni. in addition, esc-resistant e. coli  were observed in high prevalence in faecal samples, but no shiga-toxin producing-e.coli were detected. finally, potentially zoonotic protozoan parasites were observed in hedgehog faecal samples as well, including giardia duodenalis assemblage a, cryptosporidium parvum subtypes iiaa17g1r1 and iica5g3, and c. hominis subtype iba10g2. conclusions: european hedgehogs in (sub)urban areas harbor a number of zoonotic agents, and therefore may contribute to the spread and transmission of zoonotic diseases. the relatively high prevalence of b. burgdorferi s.l. and a. phagocytophilum in engorged ticks, suggests that hedgehogs contribute to their enzootic cycles in (sub)urban areas. to what extent can hedgehogs maintain the enteric zoonotic agents in natural cycles, and the role of (spill-back from) humans remains to be investigated.

TI  == analysis of in vitro and in vivo effects of probiotics against campylobacter spp.
AB  == campylobacter (c.) spp. are well recognised as the leading cause of bacterial food-borne diarrheal disease worldwide, with c. jejuni and c. coli as the most important species: c. coli is highly abundant in pigs and pork meat has often been implicated as a source for human infection. intestinal colonisation of c. coli in pigs plays a role in carcass contamination during slaughter. different pre-harvest intervention measures are proposed to reduce the c. coli burden in the porcine intestine. among others, the use of probiotics to prevent or reduce the colonisation of intestinal pathogens is discussed. one aim of this study was  to screen a variety of probiotics to evaluate their inhibitory activity against campylobacter spp. in vitro. therefore, cell-free culture supernatants of lactobacillus spp., bifidobacterium spp., enterococcus (e.) faecium ncimb 10415,  and escherichia coli nissle 1917 were tested against c. jejuni and c. coli by a well-diffusion agar assay. seven out of eleven lactobacillus strains showed an inhibitory activity against at least one of the three tested campylobacter strains. this antagonistic activity against campylobacter spp. was caused by the  production of organic acids that lowered the ph. application with ph neutralised  cell-free culture supernatants abolished this inhibitory effect. other tested strains with probiotic properties showed no inhibitory activity against any campylobacter spp. strain. the strain e. faecium ncimb 10415 was chosen to test its inhibitory activity against c. coli in vivo. twenty weaned piglets were allocated into two groups, a probiotic group and a control group.the diet of the  probiotic group was supplemented with e. faecium ncimb 10415 (10(9) cfu/kg feed,  cylactin) since weaning, whereas the control group received no probiotic treatment. all piglets were naturally colonised with c. coli. the excretion load  of c. coli was monitored for 28 days. the results indicate that dietary supplementation of e. faecium ncimb 10415 did not significantly affect c. coli excretion levels in pigs. in this study, e. faecium ncimb 10415 showed no antagonistic activity against c. coli in vitro and in vivo and had no impact on the growth performance of weaned piglets.

TI  == an unconventional anaerobic membrane protein production system based on wolinella succinogenes.
AB  == in cases where membrane protein production attempts in more conventional escherichia coli-based systems have failed, a solution is to resort to a system based on the nonpathogenic epsilon-proteobacterium wolinella succinogenes. this approach has been demonstrated to be successful for structural and mechanistic analyses not only for homologous production of w. succinogenes membrane proteins  but also for the heterologous production of membrane protein complexes from the human pathogens helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni. the procedure to establish a system for the production of native and variant enzymes in w. succinogenes is presented in detail for the examples of the quinol:fumarate reductase and the sdhabe complexes of w. succinogenes. subsequently, further projects using w. succinogenes as expression host are covered.

TI  == antibiotic-resistant bacteria: prevalence in food and inactivation by food-compatible compounds and plant extracts.
AB  == foodborne antibiotic-resistant pathogenic bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni,  bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica,  staphylococcus aureus, vibrio cholerae, and vibrio parahemolyticus can adversely  affect animal and human health, but a better understanding of the factors involved in their pathogenesis is needed. to help meet this need, this overview surveys and interprets much of our current knowledge of antibiotic (multidrug)-resistant bacteria in the food chain and the implications for microbial food safety and animal and human health. topics covered include the origin and prevalence of resistant bacteria in the food chain (dairy, meat, poultry, seafood, and herbal products, produce, and eggs), their inactivation by  different classes of compounds and plant extracts and by the use of chlorine and  physicochemical methods (heat, uv light, pulsed electric fields, and high pressure), the synergistic antimicrobial effects of combinations of natural antimicrobials with medicinal antibiotics, and mechanisms of antimicrobial activities and resistant effects. possible areas for future research are suggested. plant-derived and other safe natural antimicrobial compounds have the  potential to control the prevalence of both susceptible and resistant pathogens in various environments. the collated information and suggested research will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of approaches that could be used to minimize the presence of resistant pathogens in animal feed and human food, thus reducing adverse effects, improving microbial food safety, and helping to prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == microbiological diversity and prevalence of spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in commercial fermented alcoholic beverages (beer, fruit wine, refined rice wine, and yakju).
AB  == the present study examined 469 commercially available fermented alcoholic beverages (fabs), including beer (draft, microbrewed, and pasteurized), fruit wine (grape and others), refined rice wine, and yakju (raw and pasteurized). samples were screened for escherichia coli and eight foodborne pathogens (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and yersinia enterocolitica), and the aerobic plate count, lactic acid bacteria, acetic acid bacteria, fungi, and total coliforms were also enumerated. microbrewed beer contained the highest number of microorganisms (average aerobic  plate count, 3.5; lactic acid bacteria, 2.1; acetic acid bacteria, 2.0; and fungi, 3.6 log cfu/ml), followed by draft beer and yakju (p < 0.05), whereas the  other fabs contained , 25 cfu/25 ml microorganisms. unexpectedly, neither microbial diversity nor microbial count correlated with the alcohol content (4.7  to 14.1%) or ph (3.4 to 4.2) of the product. despite the harsh conditions, coliforms (detected in 23.8% of microbrewed beer samples) and b. cereus (detected in all fabs) were present in some products. b. cereus was detected most frequently in microbrewed beer (54.8% of samples) and nonpasteurized yakju (50.0%), followed by pasteurized yakju (28.8%), refined rice wine (25.0%), other  fruit wines (12.3%), grape wine (8.6%), draft beer (5.6%), and pasteurized beer (2.2%) (p < 0.05). the finding that spore-forming b. cereus and coliform bacteria can survive the harsh conditions present in alcoholic beverages should be taken into account (alongside traditional quality indicators such as the presence of lactic acid-producing bacteria, acetic acid-producing bacteria, or both) when developing manufacturing systems and methods to prolong the shelf life of high-quality fab products. new strategic quality management plans for various fabs are needed.

TI  == expert elicitation as a means to attribute 28 enteric pathogens to foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, and person-to-person transmission routes in canada.
AB  == enteric illness contributes to a significant burden of illness in canada and globally. understanding its sources is a critical step in identifying and preventing health risks. expert elicitation is a powerful tool, used previously,  to obtain information about enteric illness source attribution where information  is difficult or expensive to obtain. thirty-one experts estimated transmission of 28 pathogens via major transmission routes (foodborne, waterborne, animal contact, person-to-person, and other) at the point of consumption. the elicitation consisted of a (snowball) recruitment phase; administration of a pre-survey to collect background information, an introductory webinar, an elicitation survey, a 1-day discussion, survey readministration, and a feedback exercise, and surveys were administered online. experts were prompted to quantify changes in contamination at the point of entry into the kitchen versus point of consumption. estimates were combined via triangular probability distributions, and medians and 90% credible-interval estimates were produced. transmission was attributed primarily to food for bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp., all three vibrio spp. categories explored, and yersinia enterocolitica. multisource pathogens (e.g., transmitted commonly through both water and food) such as campylobacter spp., four escherichia coli categories, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., and staphylococcus aureus were also estimated as mostly foodborne. water was the primary pathway for giardia spp. and cryptosporidium spp., and person-to-person transmission dominated for six enteric viruses and shigella spp. consideration of the point of attribution highlighted the importance of food handling and cross-contamination in the transmission pathway. this study provides source attribution estimates of enteric illness for canada, considering all possible transmission routes. further research is necessary to improve our understanding of poorly characterized pathogens such as sapovirus and e. coli subgroups in canada.

TI  == increased efficiency of campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb by  structure-guided engineering.
AB  == conjugate vaccines belong to the most efficient preventive measures against life-threatening bacterial infections. functional expression of n-oligosaccharyltransferase (n-ost) pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enables a simplified production of glycoconjugate vaccines in prokaryotic cells. polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria can be covalently coupled to immunogenic acceptor proteins bearing engineered glycosylation sites. transfer efficiency of pglbcj is low for certain heterologous polysaccharide substrates. in this study, we increased glycosylation rates for salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium lt2 o antigen (which lacks n-acetyl sugars) and staphylococcus aureus cp5 polysaccharides by structure-guided engineering of pglb. a three-dimensional  homology model of membrane-associated pglbcj, docked to the natural c. jejuni n-glycan attached to the acceptor peptide, was used to identify potential sugar-interacting residues as targets for mutagenesis. saturation mutagenesis of  an active site residue yielded the enhancing mutation n311v, which facilitated fivefold to 11-fold increased in vivo glycosylation rates as determined by glycoprotein-specific elisa. further rounds of in vitro evolution led to a triple mutant s80r-q287p-n311v enabling a yield improvement of s. enterica lt2 glycoconjugates by a factor of 16. our results demonstrate that bacterial n-ost can be tailored to specific polysaccharide substrates by structure-guided protein engineering.

TI  == antimicrobial activity and stability of weakly acidified chlorous acid water.
AB  == the antimicrobial activity of weakly acidified chlorous acid water (wacaw) against staphylococcus aureus, non-pathogenic escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec o157:h7), candida albicans, and spore-forming bacillus and paenibacillus species was evaluated in vitro. the antiviral activity was also examined using feline calicivirus (fcv). diluted wacaw (>100 ppm) effectively reduced the number of non-spore-forming bacteria (>4 log10 cfu reductions) within 5 min. treatment with this sanitizer at 400 ppm for 30 min achieved>5 log10 cfu reductions in spore-forming bacillus and paenibacillus species while an equivalent concentration of sodium hypochlorite (naclo) resulted in only a 0.98 and 2.72 log10 cfu reduction, respectively. the effect of this sanitizer against  fcv was equivalent to that of naclo. immersion in wacaw (400 ppm) achieved >4 and 2.26 log10 cfu reductions in campylobacter jejuni and ehec, respectively, on artificially contaminated broiler carcass pieces. finally, theantimicrobial activity of this sanitizer was shown to be maintained for at least 28 d when in contact with nonwoven fabric (100% cotton). this study showed that ph control of  chlorous acid is expected to modify its antimicrobial activity and stability. wacaw is expected to have applications in various settings such as the food processing and healthcare industries.

TI  == effect of lysozyme or antibiotics on faecal zoonotic pathogens in nursery pigs.
AB  == aims: the objective of this study was to determine the effect of lysozyme and antibiotics on zoonotic pathogen shedding in faeces from nursery pigs housed without and with an indirect disease challenge. methods and results: two replicates of approximately 650 pigs each were weaned and randomly assigned to one of 24 pens in either a nursery room that had been fully disinfected or a nursery room left unclean. pigs were randomly assigned to control diet (control), control diet + antibiotics (antibiotic; chlortetracycline and tiamulin), or control diet + lysozyme (lysozyme; 100 mg kg(-1) diet). rectal swab samples were  collected on day 0 and 28 of treatment, and enriched and cultured for campylobacter spp. and shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec). enrichments from  rectal swab samples also were analysed for presence of enterohaemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) virulence genes (hlya, eae, stx1 and stx2). room hygiene had little effect on day 28 results. percentage of samples culture positive for campylobacter spp.  was lowest for lysozyme diets (p < 0.01), but similar for control and antibiotic  diets (43.2, 83.7, and 84.8 respectively). diet had little effect on the ehec virulence genes hlya or eae (p > 0.1), but there was a tendency for fewer samples positive for stx1/stx2 in antibiotic or lysozyme diet groups (p < 0.07) compared  to control diet (1.2, 2.1 and 5.8% respectively). salmonella spp. and specific stec types tested were rarely detected in the study. conclusions: in nursery swine, room hygiene had little effect on pathogen shedding. dietary chlortetracycline and tiamulin did not reduce pathogen shedding but dietary lysozyme reduced faecal shedding of campylobacter. significance and impact of the study: lysozyme can effectively replace antibiotics in the diet of nursery swine  and can be effective for pathogen control.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogens in children with diarrhea in niger: diversity and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == background: although rotavirus is the leading cause of severe diarrhea among children in sub-saharan africa, better knowledge of circulating enteric pathogenic bacteria and their antimicrobial resistance is crucial for prevention  and treatment strategies. methodology/principal findings: as a part of rotavirus  gastroenteritis surveillance in maradi, niger, we performed stool culture on a sub-population of children under 5 with moderate-to-severe diarrhea between april 2010 and march 2012. campylobacter, shigella and salmonella were sought with conventional culture and biochemical methods. shigella and salmonella were serotyped by slide agglutination. enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were screened by slide agglutination with epec o-typing antisera and confirmed by detection of virulence genes. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion. we enrolled 4020 children, including 230 with bloody diarrhea. at least one pathogenic bacterium was found in 28.0% of children with watery diarrhea and 42.2% with bloody diarrhea. mixed infections were found in 10.3% of  children. epec, salmonella and campylobacter spp. were similarly frequent in children with watery diarrhea (11.1%, 9.2% and 11.4% respectively) and shigella spp. were the most frequent among children with bloody diarrhea (22.1%). the most frequent shigella serogroup was s. flexneri (69/122, 56.5%). the most frequent salmonella serotypes were typhimurimum (71/355, 20.0%), enteritidis (56/355, 15.8%) and corvallis (46/355, 13.0%). the majority of putative epec isolates was  confirmed to be epec (90/111, 81.1%). more than half of all enterobacteriaceae were resistant to amoxicillin and co-trimoxazole. around 13% (46/360) salmonella  exhibited an extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype. conclusions: this study  provides updated information on enteric bacteria diversity and antibiotic resistance in the sahel region, where such data are scarce. whether they are or not the causative agent of diarrhea, bacterial infections and their antibiotic resistance profiles should be closely monitored in countries like niger where childhood malnutrition pre-disposes to severe and invasive infections.

TI  == bacterial enteric infections detected by culture-independent diagnostic tests--foodnet, united states, 2012-2014.
AB  == the increased availability and rapid adoption of culture-independent diagnostic tests (cidts) is moving clinical detection of bacterial enteric infections away from culture-based methods. these new tests do not yield isolates that are currently needed for further tests to distinguish among strains or subtypes of salmonella, campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, and other organisms. public health surveillance relies on this detailed characterization of isolates to monitor trends and rapidly detect outbreaks; consequently, the increased use of cidts makes prevention and control of these infections more difficult. during 2012-2013, the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet*) identified a total of 38,666 culture-confirmed cases and positive cidt reports of campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, shiga toxin-producing e. coli, vibrio, and yersinia. among the 5,614 positive cidt reports, 2,595 (46%) were not confirmed by culture. in addition, a 2014 survey of clinical laboratories serving the foodnet surveillance area indicated that use of cidts by the laboratories varied by pathogen; only cidt methods were used most often for detection of campylobacter (10%) and stec (19%). maintaining surveillance of bacterial enteric infections in this period of transition will require enhanced surveillance methods and strategies for obtaining bacterial isolates.

TI  == pcr for enteric pathogens in high-prevalence settings. what does a positive signal tell us?
AB  == background: molecular methods, in particular pcr, are increasingly used for the diagnosis of enteric pathogens in stool samples. in high-endemicity settings, however, asymptomatic carriage or residual dna from previous infections will hamper the interpretation of positive test results. we assessed the quantitative  dimension of this problem in schoolchildren in the rural highlands of madagascar. methods: stool samples were collected from 410 apparently healthy madagascan schoolchildren and analysed by multiplex real-time pcr for enteroinvasive bacteria (salmonella spp., shigella spp./enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec),  campylobacter jejuni, yersinia spp.), enteric protozoa (entamoebea histolytica, giardia duodenalis, cryptosporidium spp., cyclospora spp.), and helminths (ascaris lumbricoides, ancylostoma spp., necator americanus, strongyloides stercoralis). symptoms of gastrointestinal disease were assessed. results: among  the 410 samples, we detected giardia duodenalis in 195, campylobacter jejuni in 91, ascaris lumbricoides in 72, cyclospora cayetanenesis in 68, shigella spp./eiec in 56, and strongyloides stercoralis and cryptosporum spp. in 1 case each. salmonella spp., yersinia spp. and hookworms were not observed. relative risk assessment suggested few and incoherent associations with pathogen detections, indicating asymptomatic carriage or dna residuals. only 26.1% of the  schoolchildren were tested negative for all analysed pathogens. conclusions: the  very high risk of detecting traces of asymptomatic carriage or residual dna from  previous infections limits the value of highly sensitive pcr for the causal attribution of detected enteric pathogens from stool samples to an infectious gastrointestinal disease in the high-endemicity setting. evaluated standards for  the interpretation of such results are needed both for the diagnostic routine and for epidemiological assessments.

TI  == recombinant escherichia coli strains with inducible campylobacter jejuni single domain hemoglobin chb expression exhibited improved cell growth in bioreactor culture.
AB  == maintaining an appropriate concentration of dissolved oxygen in aqueous solution  is critical for efficient operation of a bioreactor, requiring sophisticated engineering design and a system of regulation to maximize oxygen transfer from the injected air bubbles to the cells. bacterial hemoglobins are oxygen-binding proteins that transfer oxygen from the environment to metabolic processes and allow bacteria to grow even under microaerophilic conditions. to improve the oxygen utilization efficiency of cells and overcome the oxygen shortage in bioreactors, the gene coding for the campylobacter jejuni single domain hemoglobin (chb) gene was artificially synthesized and functionally expressed under the control of inducible expression promoters pt7 and pvgh in escherichia coli. the effects of the recombinants pt7-chb and pvgh-chb on cell growth were evaluated in aerobic shake flasks, anaerobic capped bottles and a 5-l bioreactor, and a pronounced improvement in cell biomass was observed for chb-expressing cells. to determine the growth curves, chb gene expression, and chb oxygen-binding capacity of specific recombinants with different promoters, we determined the time course of chb gene expression in the two recombinants by semi-quantitative rt-pcr and co differential spectrum assays. based on the growth patterns of the two recombinants in the bioreactor, we proposed different recombinant types with optimal performance under specific culture conditions.

TI  == gastrointestinal infections and diarrheal disease in ghanaian infants and children: an outpatient case-control study.
AB  == introduction: diarrheal diseases are among the most frequent causes of morbidity  and mortality in children worldwide, especially in resource-poor areas. this case-control study assessed the associations between gastrointestinal infections  and diarrhea in children from rural ghana. methods: stool samples were collected  from 548 children with diarrhea and from 686 without gastrointestinal symptoms visiting a hospital from 2007-2008. samples were analyzed by microscopy and molecular methods. results: the organisms most frequently detected in symptomatic cases were giardia lamblia, shigella spp./ enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), and campylobacter jejuni. infections with rotavirus (adjusted odds ratio  [aor] = 8.4; 95% confidence interval [ci]: 4.3-16.6), c. parvum/hominis (aor = 2.7; 95% ci: 1.4-5.2) and norovirus (aor = 2.0; 95%ci: 1.3-3.0) showed the strongest association with diarrhea. the highest attributable fractions (af) for  diarrhea were estimated for rotavirus (af = 14.3%; 95% ci: 10.9-17.5%), shigella  spp./eiec (af = 10.5%; 95% ci: 3.5-17.1%), and norovirus (af = 8.2%; 95% ci 3.2-12.9%). co-infections occurred frequently and most infections presented themselves independently of other infections. however, infections with e. dispar, c. jejuni, and norovirus were observed more often in the presence of g. lamblia.  conclusions: diarrheal diseases in children from a rural area in sub-saharan africa are mainly due to infections with rotavirus, shigella spp./eiec, and norovirus. these associations are strongly age-dependent, which should be considered when diagnosing causes of diarrhea. the presented results are informative for both clinicians treating gastrointestinal infections as well as public health experts designing control programs against diarrheal diseases.

TI  == case-control comparison of bacterial and protozoan microorganisms associated with gastroenteritis: application of molecular detection.
AB  == the introduction of molecular detection of infectious organisms has led to increased numbers of positive findings, as observed for pathogens causing gastroenteritis (ge). however, because little is known about the prevalence of these pathogens in the healthy asymptomatic population, the clinical value of these additional findings is unclear. a case-control study was carried out in a population of patients served by general practitioners in the netherlands. a total of 2710 fecal samples from case and matched control subjects were subjected to multiplex real-time pcr for the 11 most common bacterial and four protozoal causes of ge. of 1515 case samples, 818 (54%) were positive for one or more target organisms. a total of 49% of the controls were positive. higher positivity rates in cases compared to controls were observed for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., clostridium difficile, enteroinvasive escherichia coli/shigella  spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, atypical enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), cryptosporidium parvum/hominis, and giardia lamblia. however, dientamoeba fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli were detected significantly less frequent in cases than in controls, while no difference in prevalence was found for typical epec and enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the association between the presence of microorganisms and ge was the weakest in children aged 0 to 5 years. higher relative loads in cases further support causality. this was seen for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. parvum/hominis, and for certain age categories of those infected with c. difficile, enteroaggregative e. coli, and atypical epec. for d. fragilis and shiga-like toxigenic e. coli/enterohemorrhagic e. coli, pathogen loads were lower in cases. application of molecular diagnostics in ge is rapid, sensitive and specific, but results should be interpreted with care, using clinical and additional background information.

AB  == inhibition of the binding of pathogenic adhesins to host glycans by suitable oligosaccharides forms the basis of antiadhesion therapies. experiments were carried out to study the inhibition capability of oligosaccharides on the adhesion of four microorganisms (escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, campylobacter jejuni, and salmonella typhimurium) to ht-29 cells. results showed that, in the absence of oligosaccharides, all of the four pathogens efficiently adhered to the cells. cell adhesion with different bacteria was inhibited by distinct oligosaccharides (e.g., the adhesion number relative to control of v. cholerae could be significantly decreased by pectin oligosaccharide and chitooligosaccharide to about 16.1% and 18.9%, respectively). saturation studies  showed that the extent of antiadhesive effect for most of the suitable carbohydrates was dependent on their concentration. the observations from the study suggest that various carbohydrates may have antiadhesive activity and may be useful in future therapeutic study.

TI  == pathogenesis of crohn's disease: bug or no bug.
AB  == the possibility of an infectious origin in inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) has been postulated since the first description of crohn's disease (cd). many observations implicate bacteria as a trigger for the development of cd: lesions occur in regions with higher bacterial concentrations; aphthous ulcers occur in peyer's patches; inflammation resolves when the fecal stream is diverted and is reactivated following reinfusion of bowel contents; severity of the disease is correlated with bacterial density in the mucosa; granulomas can contain bacteria; and susceptible mice raised in germ-free conditions develop inflammation when bacteria are introduced in the 1990's, several studies sought to establish a relationship with viral infections and the onset of ibd, finally concluding that  no direct link had been demonstrated. in the past fifteen years, evidence relating ibd pathogenesis to mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, salmonella, campylobacter, etc., has been found. the tendency now under discussion to regard  microbiota as the primary catalyst has led to the latest studies on microbiota as pathogens, focusing on escherichia coli, mainly in ileal cd. the present review discusses the literature available on these "bugs".

TI  == gastrointestinal symptoms in travellers.
AB  == diarrhoea is probably the single most common medical complaint in returning travellers. the most common pathogens are entero-toxigenic escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and campylobacter. viruses, toxigenic arcobacter and bacteroides fragilis, as well as parasites such as cryptosporidium sp, are increasingly recognised but are not tested for in most diagnostic laboratories. blood in stools is a sign of invasive disease and should trigger exclusion of invasive amoebic disease. the use of empiric antibiotics may shorten illness but  is complicated by the diversity of bacterial causes and emerging resistance.

TI  == an assessment of the human health impact of seven leading foodborne pathogens in  the united states using disability adjusted life years.
AB  == summary we explored the overall impact of foodborne disease caused by seven leading foodborne pathogens in the united states using the disability adjusted life year (daly). we defined health states for each pathogen (acute illness and sequelae) and estimated the average annual incidence of each health state using data from public health surveillance and previously published estimates from studies in the united states, canada and europe. these pathogens caused about 112 000 dalys annually due to foodborne illnesses acquired in the united states. non-typhoidal salmonella (32 900) and toxoplasma (32 700) caused the most dalys,  followed by campylobacter (22 500), norovirus (9900), listeria monocytogenes (8800), clostridium perfringens (4000), and escherichia coli o157 (1200). these estimates can be used to prioritize food safety interventions. future estimates of the burden of foodborne disease in dalys would be improved by addressing important data gaps and by the development and validation of us-specific disability weights for foodborne diseases.

AB  == free-flying turkey vultures (cathartes aura) were sampled in california to investigate the fecal shedding prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of salmonella enterica, campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli. nine different serotypes of salmonella enterica were detected in cloacal swabs from turkey vultures, and 6% of vultures were shedding campylobacter spp.. turkey vultures sampled at a location with range sheep were more likely to shed tetracycline-resistant e. coli, suggesting that proximity to livestock facilities could facilitate acquisition of drug-resistant bacteria in avian scavengers. these findings illustrate the importance of assessing drug-resistant pathogen transfer at the livestock-wildlife interface.

AB  == chamomile, common yarrow and immortelle ethanolic extracts were chemically analysed with respect to phenolics. twelve phenolic acids were separated and identified by hplc-dad and the presence of rosmarinic acid was additionally confirmed by lc-ms. five methods were applied for the evaluation of extracts' antioxidant properties (frap, dpph, abts, chelating activity, briggs-rauscher reaction), while the antibacterial activity was tested against some of the major  food-borne pathogens (campylobacter coli, escherichia coli, salmonella infantis,  bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus). immortelle extract was the richest in phenolics with a dominant flavonoid fraction, while the other two extracts contained higher amount of non-flavonoids. the phenolic acid profile also varied; high concentration of rosmarinic acid was found in chamomile and common yarrow, while caffeic acid was dominant in immortelle. the best antioxidant properties were obtained for chamomile extract, while good antimicrobial activity, especially against gram-positive bacterial species, was detected for immortelle. the obtained results could be used as a tool for chemotaxonomic classification of the investigated plants or for their potential application as natural antioxidants/antimicrobials.

TI  == effects of climate change on the persistence and dispersal of foodborne bacterial pathogens in the outdoor environment: a review.
AB  == abstract according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change (ipcc), warming of the climate system is unequivocal. over the coming century, warming trends such as increased duration and frequency of heat waves and hot extremes are expected in some areas, as well as increased intensity of some storm systems. climate-induced trends will impact the persistence and dispersal of foodborne pathogens in myriad ways, especially for environmentally ubiquitous and/or zoonotic microorganisms. animal hosts of foodborne pathogens are also expected to be impacted by climate change through the introduction of increased physiological stress and, in some cases, altered geographic ranges and seasonality. this review article examines the effects of climatic factors, such as temperature, rainfall,  drought and wind, on the environmental dispersal and persistence of bacterial foodborne pathogens, namely, bacillus cereus, brucella, campylobacter, clostridium, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio and yersinia enterocolitica. these relationships are then used to  predict how future climatic changes will impact the activity of these microorganisms in the outdoor environment and associated food safety issues. the  development of predictive models that quantify these complex relationships will also be discussed, as well as the potential impacts of climate change on transmission of foodborne disease from animal hosts.

TI  == in vivo production of a novel glycoconjugate vaccine against shigella flexneri 2a in recombinant escherichia coli: identification of stimulating factors for in vivo glycosylation.
AB  == background: glycoconjugated vaccines composed of polysaccharide antigens covalently linked to immunogenic carrier proteins have proved to belong to the most effective and safest vaccines for combating bacterial pathogens. the functional transfer of the n-glycosylation machinery from campylobacter jejuni to the standard prokaryotic host escherichia coli established a novel bioconjugation methodology termed bacterial glycoengineering. results: in this study, we report  on the production of a new recombinant glycoconjugate vaccine against shigella flexneri 2a representing the major serotype for global outbreaks of shigellosis.  we demonstrate that s. flexneri 2a o-polysaccharides can be transferred to a detoxified variant of pseudomonas aeruginosa carrier protein exotoxin a (epa) by  the c. jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb, resulting in glycosylated epa-2a. moreover, we optimized the in vivo production of this novel vaccine by identification and quantitative analysis of critical process parameters for glycoprotein synthesis. it was found that sequential induction of oligosaccharyltransferase pglb and carrier protein epa increased the specific productivity of epa-2a by a factor of 1.6. furthermore, by the addition of 10 g/l of the monosaccharide n-acetylglucosamine during induction, glycoconjugate vaccine yield was boosted up to 3.1-fold. the optimum concentration of mg2+ ions  for n-glycan transfer was determined to be 10 mm. finally, optimized parameters were transferred to high cell density cultures with a 46-fold increase of overall yield of glycoconjugate compared to the one in initial shake flask production. conclusion: the present study is the first attempt to identify stimulating parameters for improved productivity of s. flexneri 2a bioconjugates. optimization of glycosylation efficiency will ultimately foster the transfer of lab-scale expression to a cost-effective in vivo production process for a glycoconjugate vaccine against s. flexneri 2a in e. coli. this study is an important step towards this goal and provides a starting point for further optimization studies.

AB  == background: there are no information of the yield, chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of essential oils of berries (eob) or leaves (eol) of juniperus excelsa bieb. (cupressaceae) growing wild in r. macedonia. materials and methods: plant material was collected from two localities during two seasons. essential oil composition was analyzed by gas chromatography/flame ionization detector/mass spectrometry (gc/fid/ms) and antimicrobial screening was made by disc diffusion and broth dilution method. results and discussion: eob yield ranged from 1.6-9.4 ml/kg and from 8.9-13.9 ml/kg for eol. two chemotypes of essential oil were differentiated, alpha-pinene-type (with 70.81% alpha-pinene in eob and 33.83% in eol), also containing limonene, beta-pinene and beta-myrcene while the sabinene-type (with 58.85-62.58% sabinene in eob and 28.52-29.49% in eol), was rich in alpha-pinene, beta-myrcene, limonene, cis-thujone, terpinolene  and alpha-thujene. the most sensitive bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of eob was haemophilus influenzae (mic = 31 mul/ml). eol have showed high activity towards: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes and haemophilus influenzae (mic = 125 mul/ml). the pinene-type of essential oil showed moderate activity against streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pyogenes, corynebacterium spp. and campylobacter jejuni (mic >50%). the sabinene-type of the oil showed moderate activity to streptococcus pyogenes, haemopilus influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (mic >50%). no activity was observed toward candida albicans. conclusion: the analysis of eob and eol revealed two chemotypes (alpha-pinene and sabinene type) clearly depended on the geographical origin of the macedonian juniperus excelsa which also affected the antimicrobial activity of these oils.

TI  == antibiotic susceptibility and prevalence of foodborne pathogens in poultry meat in romania.
AB  == introduction: the occurrence of pathogenic strains in poultry meat is of growing  concern in romania. another problem found on a global level is the continuous increase of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from food. this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in poultry carcasses obtained in romania in 2012-2013 and to reveal the most prevalent patterns of antimicrobial resistance in the isolated strains. methodology: a total of 144 broiler chicken carcasses were evaluated according to classical microbiological methods. the dna was extracted from the bacterial colonies and the resistance genes were identified by pcr. results: in 2012, 47.2% of the samples revealed at  least one of the following bacteria: campylobacter jejuni (9.72%; n = 7), salmonella enterica serotype enteritidis (4.17%; n = 3), listeria monocytogenes (15.28%; n = 11), and escherichia coli (16.67%; n = 12). in 2013, the number of positive samples of pathogenic bacteria decreased, although campylobacter jejuni  was isolated in a higher percentage (20.8% vs. 9.72%). the percentage of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria was high (23%); the most prevalent pattern included resistance to tetracycline, sulfonamides, and quinolones/fluoroquinolones. all the resistant salmonella and e. coli strains were tested for the presence of characteristic resistance genes (kn, bla(tem), teta, tetb, tetg, dfria, aada1a, sul) and revealed that these isolates represent  an important reservoir in the spread of this phenomenon. conclusions: our findings suggest that romania urgently needs an integrated surveillance system within the entire chain, for drug-resistant pathogens isolated from poultry meat.

TI  == aetiology of acute paediatric gastroenteritis in bulgaria during summer months: prevalence of viral infections.
AB  == paediatric acute gastroenteritis is a global public health problem. comprehensive laboratory investigation for viral, bacterial and parasitic agents is helpful for improving management of acute gastroenteritis in health care settings and for monitoring and controlling the spread of these infections. our study aimed to investigate the role of various pathogens in infantile diarrhoea in bulgaria outside the classical winter epidemics of rotavirus and norovirus. stool samples  from 115 hospitalized children aged 0-3 years collected during summer months were tested for presence of 14 infectious agents - group a rotavirus, astrovirus, giardia, cryptosporidium and entamoeba using elisas; norovirus by real-time rt-pcr; picobirnavirus and sapovirus by rt-pcr; adenovirus using pcr, and salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli, yersinia and campylobacter using standard bacterial cultures. infectious origin was established in a total of 92 cases and  23 samples remained negative. a single pathogen was found in 67 stools, of which  rotaviruses were the most prevalent (56.7 %), followed by noroviruses (19.4 %), enteric adenoviruses (7.5 %), astroviruses (6.0 %), bacteria and parasites (4.5 % each) and sapoviruses (1.4 %). rotavirus predominant genotypes were g4p[8] (46.3  %) and g2p[4] (21.4 %); for astroviruses, type 1a was the most common, while the  gii.4/2006b variant was the most prevalent among noroviruses. bacteria were observed in five cases, with salmonella sp. as the most prevalent, while parasites were found in ten stool samples, with giardia intestinalis in five cases. the results demonstrated high morbidity associated with viral infections and that rotavirus and norovirus remain the most common pathogens associated with severe gastroenteritis during summer months in bulgaria, a country with a temperate climate, and significant molecular diversity among circulating virus strains.

TI  == bacterial flagella: twist and stick, or dodge across the kingdoms.
AB  == the flagellum organelle is an intricate multiprotein assembly best known for its  rotational propulsion of bacteria. however, recent studies have expanded our knowledge of other functions in pathogenic contexts, particularly adherence and immune modulation, e.g., for salmonella enterica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. flagella-mediated adherence is important in host colonisation for several plant and animal pathogens, but the specific interactions that promote flagella binding to such diverse host tissues  has remained elusive. recent work has shown that the organelles act like probes that find favourable surface topologies to initiate binding. an emerging theme is that more general properties, such as ionic charge of repetitive binding epitopes and rotational force, allow interactions with plasma membrane components. at the  same time, flagellin monomers are important inducers of plant and animal innate immunity: variation in their recognition impacts the course and outcome of infections in hosts from both kingdoms. bacteria have evolved different strategies to evade or even promote this specific recognition, with some important differences shown for phytopathogens. these studies have provided a wider appreciation of the functions of bacterial flagella in the context of both  plant and animal reservoirs.

TI  == multicenter evaluation of the biofire filmarray gastrointestinal panel for etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis.
AB  == the appropriate treatment and control of infectious gastroenteritis depend on the ability to rapidly detect the wide range of etiologic agents associated with the  disease. clinical laboratories currently utilize an array of different methodologies to test for bacterial, parasitic, and viral causes of gastroenteritis, a strategy that suffers from poor sensitivity, potentially long  turnaround times, and complicated ordering practices and workflows. additionally, there are limited or no testing methods routinely available for most diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains, astroviruses, and sapoviruses. this study assessed the performance of the filmarray gastrointestinal (gi) panel for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens: campylobacter spp., clostridium difficile (toxin a/b), plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, enteroaggregative e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, shiga-like toxin-producing e. coli (stx1 and stx2) (including specific detection of e. coli o157), shigella spp./enteroinvasive e. coli, cryptosporidium spp., cyclospora cayetanensis, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, adenovirus f 40/41, astrovirus, norovirus gi/gii, rotavirus a, and sapovirus. prospectively collected stool specimens (n = 1,556) were evaluated using the biofire filmarray gi panel and tested with conventional stool culture and molecular methods for comparison. the filmarray gi panel sensitivity was 100% for 12/22 targets and >/=94.5% for an additional 7/22 targets. for the remaining  three targets, sensitivity could not be calculated due to the low prevalences in  this study. the filmarray gi panel specificity was >/=97.1% for all panel targets. the filmarray gi panel provides a comprehensive, rapid, and streamlined  alternative to conventional methods for the etiologic diagnosis of infectious gastroenteritis in the laboratory setting. the potential advantages include improved performance parameters, a more extensive menu of pathogens, and a turnaround time of as short as 1 h.

TI  == rapid identification and classification of campylobacter spp. using laser optical scattering technology.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are the two important species responsible for most of the campylobacter infections in humans. reliable isolation and detection of campylobacter spp. from food samples are challenging due to the interferences from complex food substances and the fastidious growth requirements of this organism. in this study, a novel biosensor-based detection called bardot (bacterial rapid detection using optical scattering technology) was developed for high-throughput screening of campylobacter colonies grown on an agar plate without disrupting the intact colonies. image pattern characterization and principal component analysis (pca) of 6909 bacterial colonies showed that the light scatter patterns of c. jejuni and c. coli were strikingly different from those of salmonella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, and listeria monocytogenes. examination of a mixed culture of these microorganisms revealed 85% (34/40) accuracy in differentiating campylobacter from the other three major foodborne pathogens based on the similarity to the scatter patterns in an established library. the application of bardot in real food has been addressed through the analysis of campylobacter spiked ground chicken and naturally contaminated fresh  chicken pieces. combined with real-time pcr verification, bardot was able to identify campylobacter isolates from retail chicken. moreover, applying passive filtration to food samples facilitated the isolation of pure campylobacter colonies and therefore overcame the interference of the food matrix on bardot analysis.

TI  == cj1386, an atypical hemin-binding protein, mediates hemin trafficking to kata in  campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == catalase enzymes detoxify h2o2 by the dismutation of h2o2 into o2 and h2o through the use of hemin cofactors. while the structure and biochemical properties of catalase enzymes have been well characterized over many decades of research, it remained unclear how catalases acquire hemin. we have previously reported that cj1386 is essential for ensuring proper hemin content in campylobacter jejuni catalase (kata) (a. flint, y. q. sun, and a. stintzi, j bacteriol 194: 334-345, 2012). in this report, an in-depth molecular characterization of cj1386 was performed to elucidate the mechanistic details of this association. coimmunoprecipitation assays revealed that kata-cj1386 transiently interact in vivo, and uv-visible spectroscopy demonstrated that purified cj1386 protein binds hemin. furthermore, hemin titration experiments determined that hemin binds to cj1386 in a 1:1 ratio with hexacoordinate hemin binding. mutagenesis of potential hemin-coordinating residues in cj1386 showed that tyrosine 57 was essential for hemin coordination when cj1386 was overexpressed in escherichia coli. the importance of tyrosine 57 in hemin trafficking in vivo was confirmed by introducing the cj1386(y57a) allele into a c. jejuni deltacj1386 mutant background. the cj1386(y57a) mutation resulted in increased sensitivity toward h2o2 relative to the wild type, suggesting that kata was not functional in this strain. in support of this finding, kata immunoprecipitated from the deltacj1386+cj1386(y57a) mutant had significantly reduced hemin content compared  to that of the cj1386(wt) background. overall, these findings indicate that cj1386 is involved in directly trafficking hemin to kata and that tyrosine 57 plays a key role in this function.

AB  == in urban maroua, cameroon, improved drinking water sources are available to a large majority of the population, yet this water is frequently distributed through informal distribution systems and stored in home containers (canaries), leaving it vulnerable to contamination. we assessed where contamination occurs within the distribution system, determined potential sources of environmental contamination, and investigated potential pathogens. gastrointestinal health status (785 individuals) was collected via health surveys. drinking water samples were collected from drinking water sources and canaries. escherichia coli and total coliform levels were evaluated and molecular detection was performed to measure human-associated faecal marker, hf183; tetracycline-resistance gene, tetq; campylobacter spp.; and staphylococcus aureus. statistical analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between microbial contamination and gastrointestinal illness. canari samples had higher levels of contamination than  source samples. hf183 and tetq were detected in home and source samples. an inverse relationship was found between tetq and e. coli. presence of tetq with lower e. coli levels increased the odds of reported diarrhoeal illness than e. coli levels alone. further work is warranted to better assess the relationship between antimicrobial-resistant bacteria and other pathogens in micro-ecosystems  within canaries and this relationship's impact on drinking water quality.

AB  == two hundred food samples of animal origin confiscated from passengers arriving on flights from non-european countries at the international airport of bilbao (spain) were tested for the presence of four main bacterial foodborne pathogens (campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp.) during 2012 and 2013. overall, 20 samples were positive for l. monocytogenes (10%) and 11 for salmonella spp. (5.5%), whereas campylobacter spp. and e. coli o157:h7 were not detected in any sample. the positive isolates were widely clustered: 14 and 7 different pulsotypes for l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. isolates, respectively. nine sequence types (st) were detected for l. monocytogenes: st2 (45%), st9 (15% isolates), st8 and st87 (10%), and st308, st37, st155 and st378 (5%). the salmonella spp. isolates belonged to seven serovars: monophasic serovar 4,12:d:- (3; 27.3%), rauform (2; 18.2%), anatum (2;  18.2%), oranienburg, enteritidis, newport and typhimurium (1; 9.1% each). antibiotic resistance among l. monocytogenes isolates was high, especially for clindamycin and daptomycin (more than 95% of the isolates). these results indicate that food samples imported by travelers in their personal luggage may harbor the most prevalent l. monocytogenes genotypes and salmonella spp. serovars responsible for foodborne outbreaks worldwide. consequently, international travel can play an important role in the prevalence and dissemination of successful clones of foodborne pathogenic bacteria, and continuous monitoring of international movements is of importance to better understand clonal evolution and emergence and dissemination of successful lineages.

TI  == characterization of illegal food items and identification of foodborne pathogens  brought into the european union via two major german airports.
AB  == foods of animal origin brought illegally from third party countries into the european community pose a risk for the introduction of diseases. this can lead to animal disease outbreaks with significant economic and social costs and subsequent severe trade restrictions. further, disease outbreaks in humans due to illegally imported foods of animal origin have been described, yet, there are very few studies examining the potential human health impact. passenger baggage is the most likely route by which illegal products enter a country. therefore, the volume and geographic origin of foods of animal origin introduced illegally into germany via the frankfurt international airport and berlin-schonefeld airport by passenger luggage were characterized. further, the occurrence of foodborne zoonotic bacteria such as salmonella spp., listeria spp., campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) and brucella spp. and the microbial quality of the foods were analysed by total bacterial count. between 2012 and 2013, a total of 663 food items were seized from 296 passengers arriving in germany from 35 different departure countries. the majority of confiscates (51%) originated from turkey and russia. a selection of 474 samples was subjected to microbiological analyses. twenty-three food products tested positive for at least one of the pathogens analysed. the majority of the contaminated foods were meat (33%) or meat products (42%), and milk products (21%). considering that only a small fraction of arriving passengers is subjected to airport custom controls and only a small number of confiscated foods could be  analysed during this study, further investigations are needed to understand the public health risks posed by illegally introduced food items.

TI  == production of initial-stage eukaryotic n-glycan and its protein glycosylation in  escherichia coli.
AB  == n-glycosylation is a ubiquitous protein post-translational modification mechanism in eukaryotes. in this work, a synthetic pathway containing glycosyltransferases  from saccharomyces cerevisiae was introduced to escherichia coli to synthesize lipid-linked mannosyl-chitobiose (man-glcnac2) and trimannosyl-chitobiose (man3-glcnac2). transfer of man3-glcnac2 onto a model periplasmic protein occurred in the engineered e. coli cell using oligosaccharyltransferase pglb from campylobacter jejuni. mass spectrometric analysis of the fluorescently labeled n-glycan indicated a glycan signal composed of 2 hexnac and 3 hex residues. the reversed-phase hplc analysis suggested that the hex residues were alpha1,3-, alpha1,6- and beta1,4-linked mannoses. these results indicated that the constructed system synthesizes a man3-glcnac2, identical to that observed in an early eukaryotic dolichol pathway. finally, glycopeptide mass spectrometry confirmed the transfer of the assembled glycan moiety onto an engineered glycosylation motif of recombinant maltose binding protein. surprisingly, the man3-glcnac2 structure but not man-glcnac2 was transferred onto maltose binding protein. this work showed that pglb protein might be able to accommodate the transfer of the further engineered glycan with greater complexity.

TI  == concentrations of faecal coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci and campylobacter spp. in equine faeces.
AB  == aims: to determine the concentration of campylobacter spp. as well as faecal indicator bacteria; faecal coliforms, escherichia coli and enterococci in the faeces of healthy adult horses in a sample of properties in the canterbury region of new zealand. methods: the faeces of healthy adult horses (n=59), including ponies, pleasure horses and thoroughbreds, were collected from eight properties around christchurch, new zealand. the faeces were analysed for concentrations of  campylobacter spp and faecal indicator bacteria; faecal coliforms, escherichia coli and enterococci. the presence of other animals on the properties sampled as  well as the age, feed and health of the horses at the time of sampling was recorded. results: enterococci and faecal coliforms were isolated from all samples, and e. coli was isolated from 58/59 samples. mean concentrations of faecal coliforms and e. coli did not differ between properties, but there was a significant difference in mean concentration of enterococci between properties. campylobacter spp. were detected in two faecal samples with one isolate being determined by pcr analysis to be a thermotolerant campylobacter species, the other c. jejuni. conclusions: this is the first known report quantifying the concentration of campylobacter spp. present in healthy adult horses in new zealand. the presence of equine faecal material in water could elevate concentrations of faecal bacteria and therefore needs to be considered as a source of water contamination. the access of horses to waterways and coastal environments may also need to be restricted to prevent transmission of faecal indicator bacteria and potentially zoonotic agents.

TI  == organic or antibiotic-free labeling does not impact the recovery of enteric pathogens and antimicrobial-resistant escherichia coli from fresh retail chicken.
AB  == we investigated the implied health benefits of retail chicken breast labeled as "organic" or "antibiotic-free" when compared to conventional products based on frequency of contamination by salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and coliform bacteria resistant to fluoroquinolones, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, or carbapenems. we purchased 231 prepackaged chicken breasts from 99 grocery stores  representing 17 retail chains in ohio, michigan, and pennsylvania from june to september 2012. ninety-six (41.5%) packages were labeled "antibiotic free" and 40 (17.3%) were labeled "organic," with the remaining 95 (41.1%) making neither label claim. salmonella were recovered from 56 (24.2%) packages, and the recovery rate was not different between product types. five percent of packages contained  salmonella carrying the extended-spectrum cephalosporin resistance gene bla(cmy-2), representing 21.4% of salmonella isolates. campylobacter spp. were recovered from 10.8% of packages, with observed recovery rates similar for the three product types. using selective media, we recovered escherichia coli harboring bla(cmy-2) from over half (53.7%) of packages, with similar recovery rates for all product types. in addition, we recovered e. coli carrying bla(ctx-m) from 6.9% of packages, and e. coli with qrdr mutations from 8.2% of packages. fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli recovered using selective media were  more common (p<0.05) in conventional (18.9%) compared to organic (0) and antibiotic-free (2.1%) packages. our results indicate that, regardless of product type, fresh retail chicken breast is commonly contaminated with enteric pathogens associated with foodborne illness and commensal bacteria harboring genes conferring resistance to critically important antimicrobial drugs.

TI  == sediment composition influences spatial variation in the abundance of human pathogen indicator bacteria within an estuarine environment.
AB  == faecal contamination of estuarine and coastal waters can pose a risk to human health, particularly in areas used for shellfish production or recreation. routine microbiological water quality testing highlights areas of faecal indicator bacteria (fib) contamination within the water column, but fails to consider the abundance of fib in sediments, which under certain hydrodynamic conditions can become resuspended. sediments can enhance the survival of fib in estuarine environments, but the influence of sediment composition on the ecology  and abundance of fib is poorly understood. to determine the relationship between  sediment composition (grain size and organic matter) and the abundance of pathogen indicator bacteria (pib), sediments were collected from four transverse  transects of the conwy estuary, uk. the abundance of culturable escherichia coli, total coliforms, enterococci, campylobacter, salmonella and vibrio spp. in sediments was determined in relation to sediment grain size, organic matter content, salinity, depth and temperature. sediments that contained higher proportions of silt and/or clay and associated organic matter content showed significant positive correlations with the abundance of pib. furthermore, the abundance of each bacterial group was positively correlated with the presence of  all other groups enumerated. campylobacter spp. were not isolated from estuarine  sediments. comparisons of the number of culturable e. coli, total coliforms and vibrio spp. in sediments and the water column revealed that their abundance was 281, 433 and 58-fold greater in sediments (colony forming units (cfu)/100g) when  compared with the water column (cfu/100ml), respectively. these data provide important insights into sediment compositions that promote the abundance of pib in estuarine environments, with important implications for the modelling and prediction of public health risk based on sediment resuspension and transport.

TI  == estimation of cultivable bacterial diversity in the cloacae and pharynx in eurasian griffon vultures (gyps fulvus).
AB  == in this work, we describe the biodiversity of cloacal and pharynx culture-based bacteria (commensal and pathogenic), in 75 eurasian griffon vultures (gyps fulvus) from two geographic areas. we address the question of whether the cultivable microbiota of vultures is organised into assemblages occurring by chance. in addition, we assess bacterial diversity in both anatomic regions and geographic areas. bacterial diversity was represented by 26 gram-negative and 20  gram-positive genera. the most common genera were escherichia, enterococcus, staphylococcus, clostridium and lactococcus. escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis were the most common species in cloacal and pharyngeal samples. staphylococcus and erysipelothrix were isolated from the pharynx and salmonella and corynebacterium from the cloacae, and no campylobacter was isolated from the  cloacal swabs. ten cloacal swabs were positive for salmonella, of which five isolates were salmonella enterica serotype 4,(5),12:i:-, one isolate was s. enterica serotype derby, three isolates were s. enterica serotype 61:k:1,5,7 and  one isolate was s. enterica serotype infantis. the null modelling approach revealed that the commensal bacteria of vultures are not structured in assemblages. on the other hand, differences in bacterial genus and species richness between cloacal and pharyngeal samples or between geographic areas were  clear, with the pharynx in vultures from both geographic areas being richer. the  results of this study indicate also that vultures can serve as a reservoir of certain pathogenic zoonotic bacteria. the dissemination of these zoonotic pathogens in wildlife could be prevented by periodic sanitary surveys.

TI  == evaluation of essential oils in beef cattle manure slurries and applications of select compounds to beef feedlot surfaces to control zoonotic pathogens.
AB  == aims: to evaluate natural terpene compounds for antimicrobial activities and determine whether these compounds could be used to control microbial activities and pathogens in production animal facilities. methods and results: thymol, geraniol, glydox, linalool, pine oil, plinol and terpineol were tested in laboratory studies for ability to control the production of odorous volatile fatty acid compounds and reduce pathogen levels in manure slurry preparations. thymol is a terpene phenolic compound and was most effective for reducing fermentation products and pathogen levels (p < 0.05), followed by the extracts linalool, pine oil and terpineol, which are terpene alcohols. select compounds thymol, linalool and pine oil were further evaluated in two separate studies by applying the agents to feedlot surfaces in cattle pens. feedlot surface material  (fsm; manure and soil) was collected and analysed for fermentation products, levels of coliforms and total escherichia coli, and the presence of e. coli o157:h7, campylobacter, salmonella, listeria and l. monocytogenes. the reduction  in fermentation products but not pathogens was dependent on the moisture present  in the fsm. treatment with 2000 ppm thymol reduced the prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 but not listeria. in a separate study, treatment with 4000 ppm pine oil reduced e. coli o157:h7, listeria and campylobacter (p < 0.05). linalool was tested at two levels (2000 and 4000 ppm) and did not affect pathogen levels at either concentration. conclusions: natural compounds bearing terpenes can control pathogenic bacteria in treated manures and when applied to the feedlot surface in production cattle systems. pine oil is a cheaper alternative to thymol and may be a useful treatment for controlling pathogens. significance and impact of the study: the control of bacterial pathogens in animal productions systems is an important step in preharvest food safety. waste products, such as pine oil extract, from the pulp wood industry may have application for treating feedlot pens and manures to reduce the pathogen load.

TI  == effects of shigella-, campylobacter- and etec-associated diarrhea on childhood growth.
AB  == background: studies examining the etiology-specific effects of diarrheal disease  on growth are limited and variable in their analytic methods, making comparisons  difficult and priority setting based on these findings challenging. a study by black et al (black re, brown kh, becker s. effects of diarrhea associated with specific enteropathogens on the growth of children in rural bangladesh. pediatrics. 1984;33:1004-1009.) examined the association between shigella and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli-related disease and weight gain and linear growth in bangladeshi children aged 0-5 years. we estimated similar associations  in a 2002 cohort of 0- to 6-year-old children in the peruvian amazon. methods: diarrheal surveillence was conducted using household visits 3 times per week. anthropometry was collected monthly. mixed-effect models were used to estimate the association between shigella, etec and campylobacter diarrhea and weight gain in a 2-month period and linear growth over a 9-month period. diarrheal disease burdens and growth intervals were quantified so as to be as comparable as possible to the original report. results: shigella- and etec-associated diarrhea  were not associated with diminished weight gain, although the association between etec diarrhea and weight gain (-4.5 g/percent of days spent with etec, p = 0.098) was twice that of other etiologic agents, as well as similar in magnitude to the  original report. shigella-associated diarrhea was associated with decreased linear growth (0.055 cm less growth/percent days, p = 0.008), also similar to the original study. conclusions: our findings suggest that associations between enteropathogen-specific diarrheal episodes and growth, particularly shigella, are comparable across geographic and epidemiological contexts.

AB  == background: the prevalence of functional dyspepsia (fd) following infectious gastroenteritis has not been systematically reviewed. aim: to conduct a systematic review and calculate the summary odds ratio (or) for the development of fd following infectious gastroenteritis, as compared to a control population.  methods: published studies in pubmed, embase, and cochrane database and abstracts from standard sources were screened for eligible studies. data from studies meeting inclusion criteria were pooled for meta-analysis. results: nineteen studies were eligible for inclusion. the mean prevalence of fd following acute gastroenteritis (age) was 9.55% (fd, n = 909; age, n = 9517) in adult populations. the summary or for the development of post-infectious fd was 2.54 (95% ci = 1.76-3.65) at more than 6 months after age, as compared to the prevalence in controls within the same population. this is compared with the summary or (3.51; 95% ci = 2.05-6.00) for the development of post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) in the same population at more than 6 months after age. there was significant statistical heterogeneity with an i(2) of 72.8% for the summary or of post-infectious fd. several pathogens, including salmonella spp., escherichia coli o157, campylobacter jejuni, giardia lamblia and norovirus  have been shown to be associated with post-infectious fd symptoms. conclusions: infectious gastroenteritis is associated with an increased risk for subsequent dyspepsia as well as for irritable bowel syndrome. post-infectious fd and post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome may represent different aspects of the same pathophysiology. further studies will be needed to determine this.

TI  == evaluation of a real-time multiplex pcr for the simultaneous detection of campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp./eiec, and yersinia enterocolitica in fecal samples.
AB  == conventional diagnosis of infectious diarrhea caused by bacteria is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and has a suboptimal sensitivity. we have therefore developed a multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) for the simultaneous detection of campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp./enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), and yersinia enterocolitica in fecal samples. no cross reactivity between the different pathogens was observed, and the multiplex setup of the assay did not have an impact on the sensitivity of the pcr. the analytical sensitivity was 87 cfu/ml for c. jejuni, 61 cfu/ml for shigella spp./eiec, 5,528 cfu/ml for salmonella spp., and 1,306 cfu/ml for y. enterocolitica. an extensive validation of the assay was performed by testing 1,687 patient samples by both pcr and with conventional techniques. the use of pcr increased the overall clinical sensitivity from 78 to 100 % (p < 0.0001), the specificity was 99.4 % for the pcr, compared with 99.9 % for conventional culture. the novel pcr assay allows for rapid, sensitive, inexpensive, and high-throughput testing of the most common bacterial causes of gastroenteritis.

TI  == unacylated tridecaptin a(1) acts as an effective sensitiser of gram-negative bacteria to other antibiotics.
AB  == a derivative of the linear cationic lipopeptide tridecaptin a(1)missing the n-terminal lipophilic acyl group, termed h-tria(1), is devoid of antimicrobial activity but is extremely effective at sensitising gram-negative bacteria to certain antibiotics. h-tria(1)has low cytotoxicity compared with the natural peptide and in low concentrations it can substantially lower the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of some antibiotics against strains of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni and klebsiella pneumoniae. in particular, the mic of rifampicin was lowered 256-512-fold against k. pneumoniae strains using low concentrations of h-tria(1). h-tria(1)does not exert its synergistic effect through partial membrane lysis, but does bind to model bacterial membranes in a manner akin to the natural peptide. formation of this stable secondary structure  on the outer membrane may account for the observed synergistic activity.

TI  == prevalence and characterization of foodborne pathogens from australian dairy farm environments.
AB  == the ability of foodborne pathogens to gain entry into food supply systems remains an ongoing concern. in dairy products, raw milk acts as a major vehicle for this  transfer; however, the sources of pathogenic bacteria that contaminate raw milk are often not clear, and environmental sources of contamination or the animals themselves may contribute to the transfer. this survey examined the occurrence of 9 foodborne pathogens in raw milk and environments of 7 dairy farms (3 bovine, 3  caprine, and 1 ovine farm) in summer and autumn, in victoria, australia. a total  of 120 samples were taken from sampling points common to dairy farms, including pasture, soil, feed, water sources, animal feces, raw milk, and milk filters. the prevalence of the bacillus cereus group, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens,  cronobacter, shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, coagulase-positive staphylococci (cps), and yersinia enterocolitica across the farms was investigated. the 2 most prevalent bacteria, which were detected on all farms, were the b. cereus group, isolated from 41% of samples, followed by cl. perfringens, which was isolated from 38% of samples. the highest occurrence of any pathogen was the b. cereus group in soil, present in 93% of samples tested. fecal samples showed the highest diversity of pathogens, containing 7 of the 9 pathogens tested. salmonella was isolated from 1 bovine farm, although it was found in multiple samples on both visits. out of the 14 occurrences where any pathogen was detected in milk filters, only 5 (36%) of the corresponding raw milk samples collected at the same time were positive for the same pathogen. all of the cps were staphylococcus aureus, and were found in raw milk or milk filter samples from 6 of the 7 farms, but not in other sample types. pathogenic listeria species were detected on 3 of the 7 farms, and included 4 l. ivanovii-positive samples, and 1 l. monocytogenes-positive water sample. shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli were identified in fecal samples from 3 of the 7 farms and in a  single raw milk sample. cronobacter species were identified on 4 of the 7 farms,  predominantly in feed samples. no y. enterocolitica was detected. results of this study demonstrate high standards of pathogen safety across the 7 farms, with a low incidence of pathogens detected in raw milk samples. monitoring feed contamination levels may help control the spread of bacterial species such as cl. perfringens and b. cereus through the farm environment, which is a natural reservoir for these organisms.

TI  == foodborne and waterborne pathogenic bacteria in selected organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) countries.
AB  == the world ranking food safety performance reports by charlebois in 2008 and 2010  importantly stimulated international discussion and encouraged efforts to establish realistic international benchmarks for food safety performance among organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd) countries. this paper presents the international incidence of 5 common foodborne pathogens and describes the challenges of comparing international data. data were compiled from surveillance authorities in the countries, such as the natl. notifiable diseases  surveillance system of australia; the canadian notifiable diseases surveillance system; the european food safety authority, efsa; the ministry of health, labour  and welfare of japan; new zealand food safety authority; and the u.s. center for  disease control and prevention. the highest average rates in cases per 100000 people over the 12-y period from 2000 to 2011 for campylobacter spp. (237.47), salmonella spp. (67.08), yersinia spp. (12.09), verotoxigenic/shiga toxin producing escherichia coli (3.38), and listeria monocytogenes (1.06) corresponded, in order, to new zealand, belgium, finland, canada, and denmark. comparatively, annual average rates for these 5 pathogens showed an increase over the 12-y period in 28%, 17%, 14%, 50%, and 6% of the countries for which data were available. salmonella spp. showed a decrease in 56% of the countries, while  incidence of l. monocytogenes was constant in most countries (94%). variable protocols for monitoring incidence of pathogens among oecd countries remain. nevertheless, there is evidence of sufficient standardization of monitoring protocols such as the european surveillance system, which has contributed to reduce this gap.

TI  == a waterborne outbreak of campylobacteriosis in the south island of new zealand due to a failure to implement a multi-barrier approach.
AB  == outbreaks of waterborne gastroenteritis continue to occur in developed countries. darfield, a rural town in the south island of new zealand experienced an outbreak of campylobacteriosis following a transgression of escherichia coli on 16 august  2012. a descriptive outbreak investigation was performed. as a result, 29 cases had a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of campylobacteriosis and 138 were identified as probable cases. heavy rains, contamination of water with animal effluent from nearby paddocks and failures in the treatment of drinking water led to pathogens being distributed through the town's water supply. a multi-barrier approach is advocated to ensure the quality of water and many countries have legislation or programmes to address this. although legislation for water safety  plans based on a multi-barrier approach is in place in new zealand, at the time of the outbreak it was not a requirement for the darfield water supply. in addition, despite the awareness of the importance of a multi-barrier approach, competing interests, including those from the agricultural industry and financial restraints on water suppliers, can prevent it from being implemented. governments need to be more willing to enforce legislation and standards to protect the public from waterborne disease.

AB  == objectives: glycosylation or the modification of a cellular component with a carbohydrate moiety has been demonstrated in all three domains of life as a basic post-translational process important in a range of biological processes. this review will focus on the latest studies attempting to exploit bacterial n-linked  protein glycosylation for glycobiotechnological applications including glycoconjugate vaccine and humanised glycoprotein production. the challenges that remain for these approaches to reach full biotechnological maturity will be discussed. key findings: oligosaccharyltransferase-dependent n-linked glycosylation can be exploited to make glycoconjugate vaccines against bacterial  pathogens. few technical limitations remain, but it is likely that the technologies developed will soon be considered a cost-effective and flexible alternative to current chemical-based methods of vaccine production. some highlights from current glycoconjugate vaccines developed using this in-vivo production system include a vaccine against shigella dysenteriae o1 that has passed phase 1 clinical trials, a vaccine against the tier 1 pathogen francisella tularensis that has shown efficacy in mice and a vaccine against staphylococcus aureus serotypes 5 and 8. generation of humanised glycoproteins within bacteria was considered impossible due to the distinct nature of glycan modification in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. we describe the method used to overcome this conundrum to allow engineering of a eukaryotic pentasaccharide core sugar modification within escherichia coli. this core was assembled by combining the function of the initiating transferase weca, several alg genes from saccharomyces cerevisiae and the oligosaccharyltransferase function of the campylobacter jejuni pglb. further exploitation of a cytoplasmic n-linked glycosylation system found in actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae where the central enzyme is known as n-linking glycosyltransferase has overcome some of the limitations demonstrated by the oligosaccharyltransferase-dependent system. summary: characterisation of the first bacterial n-linked glycosylation system in the human enteropathogen campylobacter jejuni has led to substantial biotechnological applications. alternative methods for glycoconjugate vaccine production have been developed using this n-linked system. vaccines against both gram-negative and gram-positive organisms have been developed, and efficacy testing has thus far demonstrated that the vaccines are safe and that robust immune responses are being detected. these are likely to complement and reduce the cost of current technologies thus opening new avenues for glycoconjugate vaccines. these new markets could potentially include glycoconjugate vaccines tailored specifically for animal vaccination, which has until today thought to be non-viable due to the cost of current in-vitro chemical conjugation methods. utilisation of n-linked glycosylation to generate humanised glycoproteins is also close to becoming reality. this 'bottom up' assembly mechanism removes the heterogeneity seen in current humanised products. the majority of developments reported in this review  exploit a single n-linked glycosylation system from campylobacter jejuni; however, alternative n-linked glycosylation systems have been discovered which should help to overcome current technical limitations and perhaps more systems remain to be discovered. the likelihood is that further glycosylation systems exist and are waiting to be exploited.

TI  == susceptibility to campylobacter infection is associated with the species composition of the human fecal microbiota.
AB  == the gut microbiota is essential for human health, but very little is known about  how the composition of this ecosystem can influence and respond to bacterial infections. here we address this by prospectively studying the gut microbiota composition before, during, and after natural campylobacter infection in exposed  poultry abattoir workers. the gut microbiota composition was analyzed with 16s amplicon sequencing of fecal samples from poultry abattoir workers during the peak season of campylobacter infection in sweden. the gut microbiota compositions were compared between individuals who became culture positive for campylobacter and those who remained negative. individuals who became campylobacter positive had a significantly higher abundance of bacteroides (p = 0.007) and escherichia (p = 0.002) species than those who remained culture negative. furthermore, this group had a significantly higher abundance of phascolarctobacterium (p = 0.017) and streptococcus (p = 0.034) sequences than the campylobacter-negative group, which had an overrepresentation of clostridiales (p = 0.017), unclassified lachnospiraceae (p = 0.008), and anaerovorax (p = 0.015) sequences. intraindividual comparisons of the fecal microbiota compositions yielded small differences over time in campylobacter-negative participants, but significant long-term changes were found in the campylobacter-positive group (p < 0.005). the results suggest that the abundance of specific genera in the microbiota reduces resistance to campylobacter colonization in humans and that campylobacter infection can have long-term effects on the composition of the human fecal microbiota. importance: studies using mouse models have made important contributions to our understanding of the role of the gut microbiota in resistance to bacterial enteropathogen colonization. the relative abundances of escherichia coli and bacteroides species have been pointed out as important determinants of susceptibility to gram-negative pathogens in general and campylobacter infection in particular. in this study, we assessed the role of the human gut microbiota in resistance to campylobacter colonization by studying abattoir workers that are heavily exposed to these bacteria. individuals with a certain composition of the gut microbiota became culture positive for campylobacter. as their microbiotas were characterized by high abundances of bacteroides spp. and e. coli, well in line with the findings with mouse models, these bacterial species likely play an important role in colonization resistance  also in humans.

TI  == stool submission data to help inform population-level incidence rates of enteric  disease in a canadian community.
AB  == laboratory-based surveillance data is essential for monitoring trends in the incidence of enteric disease. current canadian human enteric surveillance systems report only confirmed cases of human enteric disease and are often unable to capture the number of negative test results. data from 9116 hospital stool specimens from the waterloo region in canada, with a mixed urban and rural population of about 500 000 were analysed to investigate the use of stool submission data and its role in reporting bias when determining the incidence of  enteric disease. the proportion of stool specimens positive for campylobacter spp. was highest in the 15-29 years age group, and in the 5-14 years age group for salmonella spp. and e. coli o157:h7. by contrast, the age-specific incidence  rates were highest for all three pathogens in the 0-4 years age group which also  had the highest stool submission rate. this suggests that variations in age-specific stool submission rates are influencing current interpretation of surveillance data.

TI  == detection of salmonella spp. by a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) method targeting bcfd gene.
AB  == in this study, we developed and validated a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay for salmonella detection targeting bcfd gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene existing in salmonella. the salmonella lamp assay  we developed successfully amplified 44 salmonella strains (14 standard strains and 30 clinical isolates), but none of 9 non-salmonella standard strains (proteus mirabilis, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, shigella flexneri, shigella sonnei, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni and vibrio parahemolyticus). the detection limit was 5 cfu of salmonella pure culture or 200 cfu of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent  to 5000 cfu g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of 25 min. our experiments show that the lamp method we developed is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for salmonella detection. the salmonella lamp assay can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries. significance and impact of the study: a loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) assay was established to detect salmonella targeting bcfd gene, a conserved fimbrial operon gene. the detection limit was 5 cfu of salmonella pure culture or 200 cfu of artificially spiked faeces per reaction system (equivalent to 5000 cfu g(-1) of faeces), and this method could directly detect salmonella in chicken faeces free of pre-enrichment in a reaction time of  25 min. the salmonella lamp assay is a rapid, sensitive, specific and practical method for salmonella detection and can potentially serve as new on-site diagnostics in the food and agricultural industries.

TI  == detection of enteric viral and bacterial pathogens associated with paediatric diarrhoea in goroka, papua new guinea.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to investigate the viral and bacterial causes of acute watery diarrhoea in hospitalized children in papua new guinea. methods: a retrospective analysis was conducted on stool samples collected from 199 children (age <5 years) admitted to the paediatric ward of goroka general hospital from august 2009 through november 2010. a large range of viral and bacterial enteric pathogens were targeted using real-time pcr/rt-pcr assays. results: young children were much more likely to be admitted with acute gastroenteritis, with 62.8% of patients aged <1 year and 88.4% aged <2 years. an  enteric pathogen was detected in 69.8% (n=138) of patients. the most commonly detected pathogens were shigella spp (26.6%), rotavirus (25.6%), adenovirus types 40/41 (11.6%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (11.1%), enteropathogenic e. coli (8.5%), norovirus g2 (6.0%), and campylobacter spp (4.0%). norovirus g1, sapovirus, and salmonella spp were also detected, but below our statistical limit of detection. vibrio cholerae and astrovirus were not detected in any patients. mixed infections were detected in 22.1% of patients, with shigella and rotavirus  most commonly detected in co-infections with other pathogens. conclusions: this study demonstrates that shigella and rotavirus are the major pathogens associated with acute paediatric gastroenteritis in this setting.

TI  == functional and bioinformatics analysis of two campylobacter jejuni homologs of the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, dsba.
AB  == background: bacterial dsb enzymes are involved in the oxidative folding of many proteins, through the formation of disulfide bonds between their cysteine residues. the dsb protein network has been well characterized in cells of the model microorganism escherichia coli. to gain insight into the functioning of the dsb system in epsilon-proteobacteria, where it plays an important role in the colonization process, we studied two homologs of the main escherichia coli dsb oxidase (ecdsba) that are present in the cells of the enteric pathogen campylobacter jejuni, the most frequently reported bacterial cause of human enteritis in the world. methods and results: phylogenetic analysis suggests the horizontal transfer of the epsilon-proteobacterial dsbas from a common ancestor to gamma-proteobacteria, which then gave rise to the dsbl lineage. phenotype and  enzymatic assays suggest that the two c. jejuni dsbas play different roles in bacterial cells and have divergent substrate spectra. cjdsba1 is essential for the motility and autoagglutination phenotypes, while cjdsba2 has no impact on those processes. cjdsba1 plays a critical role in the oxidative folding that ensures the activity of alkaline phosphatase cjphox, whereas cjdsba2 is crucial for the activity of arylsulfotransferase cjasta, encoded within the dsba2-dsbb-asta operon. conclusions: our results show that cjdsba1 is the primary thiol-oxidoreductase affecting life processes associated with bacterial spread and host colonization, as well as ensuring the oxidative folding of particular protein substrates. in contrast, cjdsba2 activity does not affect the same processes and so far its oxidative folding activity has been demonstrated for one substrate, arylsulfotransferase cjasta. the results suggest the cooperation between cjdsba2 and cjdsbb. in the case of the cjdsba1, this cooperation is not exclusive and there is probably another protein to be identified in c. jejuni cells that acts to re-oxidize cjdsba1. altogether the data presented here constitute the considerable insight to the epsilonproteobacterial dsb systems, which have been poorly understood so far.

TI  == prevalence of major foodborne pathogens in food confiscated from air passenger luggage.
AB  == the eu has issued several directives and regulations pertaining to the importation of animals and products of animal origin (poao) and veterinary controls on importation. unfortunately, little information is available concerning associated risks and no attempts have been made to collect baseline data on the actual prevalence of zoonotic agents in poao carried by travellers. to meet these challenges the eu recently introduced and financed a research project "promise". its main objectives were to assess the risks involved when foodborne pathogens are introduced to the eu via uncontrolled imports. with special permission of the austrian health authorities, spot-checks were made of the luggage of 61,355 passengers from 240 flights from non-eu countries arriving  at the vienna international airport (vie airport). over a period of eight months  (august 2012 through march 2013) 1473 poao items were confiscated. a total of 600 samples were suitable for salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., verotoxigenic escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes prevalence analysis. foodborne pathogens could be detected in 5% (30/600) of all samples. the highest prevalence was attributed to l. monocytogenes, at 2.5%, followed by vtec and salmonella spp. at 1.3% and 1.2%, respectively. campylobacter spp. was not present in any of the  600 samples. multi-locus sequence typing (mlst) of l. monocytogenes revealed that current sequence types (st) corresponded to the worldwide most present clonal complexes 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 121. generally, l. monocytogenes st9 was the predominant allelic profile, which was mainly isolated from turkish meat products.

TI  == development of microbiological field methodology for water and food-chain hygiene analysis of campylobacter spp. and yersinia spp. in burkina faso, west africa.
AB  == field-adaptable research methods for identifying campylobacter sp., yersinia sp.  and other pathogenic and indicator bacteria were designed in finland and tested in burkina faso. several bacterial groups were also validated from artificially contaminated samples. campylobacter strains were cultivated using an innovative gas generation system: the 'portable microbe enrichment unit' (pmeu) which provides microaerobic gas flow into the enrichment broth. this enhanced cultivation system produced rapid growth of several isolates of campylobacteria from water and chicken samples. the latter were obtained from local marketplace samples. no yersinias were found in the field studies, whereas they were readily  recovered from the spiked samples, as well as salmonella sp. and escherichia coli strains. the pmeu method turned out to be reliable for monitoring of water and food hygiene in remote locations.

TI  == escherichia coli as a glycoprotein production host: recent developments and challenges.
AB  == chinese hamster ovary cells are the most popular host expression system for the large-scale production of human therapeutic glycoproteins, but, the race to engineer escherichia coli to perform glycosylation is gathering pace. the successful functional transfer of an n-glycosylation pathway from campylobacter jejuni to escherichia coli in 2002 can be considered as the crucial first engineering step. here, we discuss the recent advancements in the field of n-glycosylation of recombinant therapeutic proteins in e. coli cells, from the manipulation of glycan composition, to the improvement in glycosylation efficiency, along with the challenges that remain before e. coli can be available as an industry host cell for economically viable glycoprotein production.

TI  == novel microbiological and spatial statistical methods to improve strength of epidemiological evidence in a community-wide waterborne outbreak.
AB  == failures in the drinking water distribution system cause gastrointestinal outbreaks with multiple pathogens. a water distribution pipe breakage caused a community-wide waterborne outbreak in vuorela, finland, july 2012. we investigated this outbreak with advanced epidemiological and microbiological methods. a total of 473/2931 inhabitants (16%) responded to a web-based questionnaire. water and patient samples were subjected to analysis of multiple microbial targets, molecular typing and microbial community analysis. spatial analysis on the water distribution network was done and we applied a spatial logistic regression model. the course of the illness was mild. drinking untreated tap water from the defined outbreak area was significantly associated with illness (rr 5.6, 95% ci 1.9-16.4) increasing in a dose response manner. the closer a person lived to the water distribution breakage point, the higher the risk of becoming ill. sapovirus, enterovirus, single campylobacter jejuni and ehec o157:h7 findings as well as virulence genes for epec, eaec and ehec pathogroups were detected by molecular or culture methods from the faecal samples of the patients. epec, eaec and ehec virulence genes and faecal indicator bacteria were also detected in water samples. microbial community sequencing of contaminated tap water revealed abundance of arcobacter species. the polyphasic approach improved the understanding of the source of the infections, and aided to define the extent and magnitude of this outbreak.

TI  == engineered oligosaccharyltransferases with greatly relaxed acceptor-site specificity.
AB  == the campylobacter jejuni protein glycosylation locus (pgl) encodes machinery for  asparagine-linked (n-linked) glycosylation and serves as the archetype for bacterial n-linked glycosylation. this machinery has been functionally transferred into escherichia coli, enabling convenient mechanistic dissection of  the n-linked glycosylation process in this genetically tractable host. here we sought to identify sequence determinants in the oligosaccharyltransferase pglb that restrict its specificity to only those glycan acceptor sites containing a negatively charged residue at the -2 position relative to asparagine. this involved creation of a genetic assay, glycosylation of secreted n-linked acceptor proteins (glycosnap), that facilitates high-throughput screening of glycophenotypes in e. coli. using this assay, we isolated several c. jejuni pglb  variants that could glycosylate an array of noncanonical acceptor sequences, including one in a eukaryotic n-glycoprotein. these results underscore the utility of glycosnap for shedding light on poorly understood aspects of n-linked  glycosylation and for engineering designer n-linked glycosylation biocatalysts.

TI  == quantitative effects of in-line operations on campylobacter and escherichia coli  through two australian broiler processing plants.
AB  == campylobacter is an important food borne pathogen, mainly associated with poultry. a lack of through-chain quantitative campylobacter data has been highlighted within quantitative risk assessments. the aim of this study was to quantitatively and qualitatively measure campylobacter and escherichia coli concentration on chicken carcasses through poultry slaughter. chickens (n=240) were sampled from each of four flocks along the processing chain, before scald, after scald, before chill, after chill, after packaging and from individual caeca. the overall prevalence of campylobacter after packaging was 83% with a median concentration of 0.8log10cfu/ml. the processing points of scalding and chilling had significant mean reductions of both campylobacter (1.8 and 2.9log10cfu/carcase) and e. coli (1.3 and 2.5log10cfu/carcase). the concentration of e. coli and campylobacter was significantly correlated throughout processing indicating that e. coli may be a useful indicator organism for reductions in campylobacter concentration. the carriage of species varied between flocks, with  two flocks dominated by campylobacter coli and two flocks dominated by campylobacter jejuni. current processing practices can lead to significant reductions in the concentration of campylobacter on carcasses. further understanding of the variable effect of processing on campylobacter and the survival of specific genotypes may enable more targeted interventions to reduce the concentration of this poultry associated pathogen.

TI  == relative cost-effectiveness of a norovirus vaccine in the deployed military setting compared to a vaccine against campylobacter sp., etec, and shigella sp.
AB  == norovirus (nov) has been identified as a significant cause of acute gastrointestinal illness among deployed military troops. we conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for the use of a nov vaccine in the military using a  previously developed model that evaluated vaccines for etec, campylobacter, and shigella for prevention of non-outbreak associated travelers' diarrhea. under conservative assumptions, acquisition of a nov vaccine by the department of defense is estimated to result in a cost-effectiveness ratio per duty day lost to illness (cerddl) of $1344 compared to a cerddl of $776, $800, and $1275 for etec, campylobacter sp., and shigella sp., respectively compared to current management  strategies. the absolute value of avoiding a duty day lost is likely to vary under different scenarios, and further study is needed to evaluate how improved diagnostics and prevention of outbreaks may impact the relative value of this vaccine. overall, this study demonstrates the utility of a previously established evidence-based decision tool for prioritization of vaccine acquisition in an important target population.

TI  == proportion of illness acquired by foodborne transmission for nine enteric pathogens in australia: an expert elicitation.
AB  == background: estimates of the burden of illness acquired from food inform public health policy and prioritize interventions. a key component of such estimates is  the proportion of illnesses that are acquired by foodborne transmission. in view  of the shortage of requisite data, these proportions are commonly obtained through a process known as expert elicitation. we report findings from an elicitation process used to assess the importance of the foodborne transmission route for nine pathogens in australia, circa 2010. materials and methods: eleven  experts were asked to estimate the proportion of illness acquired by five transmission routes: food, environmental, water, person, and zoonotic, together with a 90% certainty interval for foodborne transmission. foodborne estimates and intervals from each expert were combined using both modified triangular and program evaluation and review technique (pert) distributions, in @risk version 6, to generate final distributions from which median estimates and 95% credible intervals (cri) were calculated. results: shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  (stec) was the only pathogen believed to have an important zoonotic transmission  route, while norovirus, hepatitis a virus, non-stec pathogenic e. coli, and shigella spp. were all thought to be primarily spread from person to person. foodborne transmission was the main route for clostridium perfringens (98%, cri:  84-100), listeria monocytogenes (98%, cri: 86-100), nontyphoidal salmonella spp.  (72%, cri: 50-87), and campylobacter spp. (77%, cri: 60-90). foodborne estimates  using the modified triangular distribution had wider cri than these calculated using the pert distribution. conclusions: foodborne proportions for most pathogens in this study were the same or lower than those estimated circa 2000 in australia, with the greatest decline for non-stec pathogenic e. coli. inclusion of certainty intervals from experts helps to quantify the precision of foodborne  proportions. a decline in estimates of the foodborne proportion for common pathogens will influence final estimates of the burden of illness acquired from food.

AB  == infiltration and runoff from manured agricultural fields can result in livestock  pathogens reaching groundwater and surface waters. here, we measured the effectiveness of glass wool filters to simultaneously concentrate enteric viruses and bacteria of bovine origin from water. the recovery efficiencies were determined for bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2, bovine rotavirus group  a, bovine coronavirus, poliovirus sabin iii, toxigenic escherichia coli ,and campylobacter jejuni seeded into water with three different turbidity levels (0.5, 215, and 447 ntu). twenty liters of dechlorinated tap water (ph 7) were seeded with the test organisms, and then passed through a glass wool filter using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 1 liter min-1). retained organisms were eluted from the filters by passing beef extract-glycine buffer (ph 9.5) in the direction opposite of sample flow. recovered organisms were enumerated by qpcr except for c. jejuni, which was quantified by culture. mean recovery efficiencies ranged from 55 to 33 % for the bacteria and 58 to 16 % for the viruses. using bootstrapping techniques combined with analysis of variance, recovery efficiencies were found to differ among the pathogen types tested at the two lowest turbidity levels; however, for a given pathogen type turbidity did not affect recovery except for c. jejuni. glass wool filtration is a cost-effective method for concentrating several waterborne pathogens of bovine origin simultaneously, although recovery may be low for some specific taxa such as bovine viral diarrhea virus 1.

AB  == background: knowledge about causes of acute diarrhea among children in developing countries is insufficient. molecular methods might improve diagnostics of infectious gastroenteritis, but due to the high sensitivity, findings may be difficult to interpret. methods: feces samples from rwandan children 0.5-5.0 years of age, with diarrhea for <96 hours (patients, n = 544) or without diarrhea for 14 days (controls, n = 162), were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction targeting 17 pathogens. results: at least 1 agent was detected in 94% of patients and in 79% of controls, with higher rates in sick children for rotavirus (42% vs. 2%, p < 0.0001) and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec)-esta (21% vs. 9%, p = 0.0006). detection rates did not differ significantly for adenovirus  (39% vs. 36%), etec-eltb (29% vs. 30%), campylobacter (14% vs. 17%) or shigella (13% vs. 10%), but for shigella the threshold cycle (ct) values were lower (pathogen loads were higher) in sick children than in controls. by multivariate analysis, including gender and age, detection of rotavirus (p < 0.0001), etec-esta (p = 0.001), shigella (p = 0.004) and norovirus genogroup ii (p = 0.009) was associated with symptomatic infection, and a ct value below a cutoff (in the range 28-29) improved identification of etec-esta, shigella and norovirus genogroup ii. conclusion: real-time polymerase chain reaction can detect essentially all diarrheagenic agents, and provides ct values that improve identification of clinically relevant infections.

AB  == objective: hiv infection is an established risk for diarrhoeal severity, less is  known about specific enteric pathogens associated with hiv status. we determined  associations of selected enteric pathogens with hiv infection and hiv exposure among kenyan children. design: a cross-sectional study among 6 months to 15 year  olds presenting to two western kenya district hospitals with acute diarrhoea between 2011 and 2013. methods: stool was tested using standard bacterial culture and microscopy for ova and parasites. hiv status was obtained from children and mothers. enteric pathogen prevalence was compared between hiv-infected and hiv-uninfected children and between hiv-exposed uninfected (heu) and hiv-unexposed. unadjusted and adjusted prevalence ratios for selected pathogens by hiv status were estimated using relative risk (rr) regression. age, site, income, household crowding, water source/treatment, anthropometrics, cotrimoxazole use and breastfeeding history were accounted for in multivariable models. results: among 1076 children, median age was 22 months (interquartile range: 11-42 months), 56 (5.2%) were hiv-infected and 105 (11.3%) of 926 hiv-uninfected children in whom maternal hiv status was obtained were hiv-exposed. the following organisms were most frequently isolated from stool: enteroaggregative escherichia coli (13.3%), giardia species (spp.) (11.1%), campylobacter spp. (6.3%), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (6.1%) and cryptosporidium spp. (3.7%). accounting for age, hiv-infection was associated with typical epec infection (prevalence ratio 3.70, p = 0.002) while hiv-exposure was associated with cryptosporidium among hiv-uninfected children (prevalence ratio 2.81, p = 0.005). conclusion: epec and cryptosporidium infections were more common in hiv-infected and hiv-exposed children, respectively. this could explain the increased mortality attributed to these pathogens in other studies. interventions targeting epec and cryptosporidium may reduce morbidity and mortality in high hiv-prevalence settings.

TI  == inactivation of selected bacterial pathogens in dairy cattle manure by mesophilic anaerobic digestion (balloon type digester).
AB  == anaerobic digestion of animal manure in biogas digesters has shown promise as a technology in reducing the microbial load to safe and recommended levels. we sought to treat dairy manure obtained from the fort hare dairy farm by investigating the survival rates of bacterial pathogens, through a total viable plate count method, before, during and after mesophilic anaerobic digestion. different microbiological media were inoculated with different serial dilutions of manure samples that were withdrawn from the biogas digester at 3, 7 and 14 day intervals to determine the viable cells. data obtained indicated that the pathogens of public health importance were 90%-99% reduced in the order: campylobacter sp. (18 days) < escherichia coli sp. (62 days) < salmonella sp. (133 days) from a viable count of 10.1 x 103, 3.6 x 105, 7.4 x 103 to concentrations below the detection limit (dl = 102 cfu/g manure), respectively. this disparity in survival rates may be influenced by the inherent characteristics of these bacteria, available nutrients as well as the stages of the anaerobic digestion process. in addition, the highest p-value i.e., 0.957 for e. coli showed the statistical significance of its model and the strongest correlation between its reductions with days of digestion. in conclusion, the results demonstrated that the specific bacterial pathogens in manure can be considerably reduced through anaerobic digestion after 133 days.

AB  == background: childhood diarrhoea can be caused by many pathogens that are difficult to assay in the laboratory. molecular diagnostic techniques provide a uniform method to detect and quantify candidate enteropathogens. we aimed to develop and assess molecular tests for identification of enteropathogens and their association with disease. methods: we developed and assessed molecular diagnostic tests for 15 enteropathogens across three platforms-pcr-luminex, multiplex real-time pcr, and taqman array card-at five laboratories worldwide. we judged the analytical and clinical performance of these molecular techniques against comparator methods (bacterial culture, elisa, and pcr) using 867 diarrhoeal and 619 non-diarrhoeal stool specimens. we also measured molecular quantities of pathogens to predict the association with diarrhoea, by univariate  logistic regression analysis. findings: the molecular tests showed very good analytical and clinical performance at all five laboratories. comparator methods  had limited sensitivity compared with the molecular techniques (20-85% depending  on the target) but good specificity (median 97.3%, iqr 96.5-98.9; mean 95.2%, sd  9.1). positive samples by comparator methods usually had higher molecular quantities of pathogens than did negative samples, across almost all platforms and for most pathogens (p<0.05). the odds ratio for diarrhoea at a given quantity (measured by quantification cycle, cq) showed that for most pathogens associated  with diarrhoea-including campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, cryptosporidium spp, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, heat-stable enterotoxigenic e coli, rotavirus, shigella spp and enteroinvasive e coli, and vibrio cholerae-the strength of association with diarrhoea increased at higher pathogen loads. for example, shigella spp at a cq range of 15-20 had an odds ratio of 8.0 (p<0.0001), but at a cq range of 25-30 the odds ratio fell to 1.7 (p=0.043). interpretation: molecular diagnostic tests can be implemented successfully and with fidelity across laboratories around the world. in the case  of diarrhoea, these techniques can detect pathogens with high sensitivity and ascribe diarrhoeal associations based on quantification, including in mixed infections, providing rich and unprecedented measurements of infectious causes. funding: bill & melinda gates foundation next generation molecular diagnostics project.

TI  == clinical study of acute childhood diarrhoea caused by bacterial enteropathogens.
AB  == objective: there are not a large number of studies in india which can enlighten us regarding acute childhood diarrhoea and far lesser in number when it comes to  its bacterial enteropathogenesis. the present study is specially targeted to determine the prevalence of various bacterial enteropathogens causing acute childhood diarrhoea and to find out their respective pattern of clinical features. method: all children under 12 years of age enrolled between 1st june, 2012 and 31st july 2012, in the outpatient department, inpatient department of pediatrics section and casualty of hospital, who presented with acute diarrhoea.  data collected by mean of study questionnaire. stool sample were processed for bacteriological analysis. in 280 samples bacteria were isolated with the help of  microscopy, culture and biochemical reactions. the isolates obtained were tested  for antimicrobial sensitivity over mueller hinton agar by kirby bauer-disk diffusion method. results: out of 280 children frequency of diarrhoeagenic bacteria isolated from the samples showed that escherichia coli was recorded as the predominant bacteria with 44.2% of prevalence followed by shigella, salmonella, klebsiella and campylobacter with 28.2%, 13.6%, 7.8% and 6.1% respectively. patients falling in the age group of 1-3 years. were the major sufferers of diarrhoea due to all etiologies except klebsiella which mainly had impact on the patients below six months. majority of isolated bacterial agents were resistant to co-trimoxazole and shigella being highly resistant enteropathogen isolated. salmonella spp. were least resistant isolates. none of the isolates were resistant to cefotaxime, cefuroxime and azetronam. conclusion:  results of study reveal that escherichia coli is a predominant bacterial enteropathogen causing diarrhoea and salmonella is a major contributor to the diarrhoea causing severe dehydration and to the clinical features like fever, vomiting and more than 10 times of frequency of stools. shigella is among highly  resistant isolates while salmonella isolates had least resistance to majority of  antibiotics.

TI  == construction and expression of a recombinant urease gene cluster from campylobacter sputorum biovar paraureolyticus.
AB  == recombinant full-length urease gene cluster and seven 100% deletion recombinant variants of urease subunits genes, (ureg, ureh, urea, ureb, urec, uree and uref)  were constructed in vitro from the campylobacter sputorum biovar paraureolyticus  lmg17591 strain and expressed in escherichia coli jm109 cells. a urease-positive  reaction (1.885 micromol/min/mg protein) in the log-phase cultured e. coli cells  transformed with pgem-t vector carrying the recombinant full-length urease genes  cluster was detected. among the seven 100% deletion recombinant variants, each of the ureg-, ureh(d)-, urea-, ureb-, urec-, uree- and uref-deletion variants showed no change in assay of the urease reaction, and similarly as in the e. coli cell lysate with pgem-t vector only. recombinant full-length urease gene cluster and 100% deletion recombinants of the uree gene in the transformed and log-phase cultured e. coli cells from the c. sputorum showed positively accelerated urease  activities when cultured in the medium containing nicl2 (750 micromol/l), but no  activity was accelerated in the c. sputorum cultured in nicl2. in addition, thiourea (20 mmol/l) completely inhibited urease activities from all c. sputorum  examined. the putative recombinant urease subunits a and c were immunologically identified by western blot analysis with polyclonal anti-urease alpha (a) and beta (b), raised against helicobacter pylori.

TI  == it takes two to tango: two tata paralogues and two redox enzyme-specific chaperones are involved in the localization of twin-arginine translocase substrates in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the food-borne zoonotic pathogen campylobacter jejuni has complex electron transport chains required for growth in the host, many of which contain cofactored periplasmic enzymes localized by the twin-arginine translocase (tat).  we report here the identification of two paralogues of the tata translocase component in c. jejuni strain nctc 11168, encoded by cj1176c (tata1) and cj0786 (tata2). deletion mutants constructed in either or both of the tata1 and tata2 genes displayed distinct growth and enzyme activity phenotypes. for sulphite oxidase (sorab), the multi-copper oxidase (cueo) and alkaline phosphatase (phox), complete dependency on tata1 for correct periplasmic activity was observed. however, the activities of nitrate reductase (napa), formate dehydrogenase (fdha) and trimethylamine n-oxide reductase (tora) were significantly reduced in the tata2 mutant. in contrast, the specific rate of fumarate reduction catalysed by the flavoprotein subunit of the methyl menaquinone fumarate reductase (mfra) was  similar in periplasmic fractions of both the tata1 and the tata2 mutants and only the deletion of both genes abolished activity. nevertheless, unprocessed mfra accumulated in the periplasm of the tata1 (but not tata2) mutant, indicating aberrant signal peptide cleavage. surprisingly, tata2 lacks two conserved residues (gln8 and phe39) known to be essential in escherichia coli tata and we suggest it is unable to function correctly in the absence of tata1. finally, only two tat chaperones (fdhm and napd) are encoded in strain nctc 11168, which mutant studies confirmed are highly specific for formate dehydrogenase and nitrate reductase assembly, respectively. thus, other tat substrates must use general chaperones in their biogenesis.

TI  == impact of antibiotic use in the swine industry.
AB  == antibiotic resistance in bacteria associated with pigs not only affects pig production but also has an impact on human health through the transfer of resistant organisms and associated genes via the food chain. this can compromise  treatment of human infections. in the past most attention was paid to glycopeptide and streptogramin resistance in enterococci, fluoroquinolone resistance in campylobacter and multi-drug resistance in escherichia coli and salmonella. while these are still important the focus has shifted to esbl producing organisms selected by the use of ceftiofur and cefquinome in pigs. in addition livestock-associated methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)  suddenly emerged in 2007. we also need to consider multi-resistant strains of streptococcus suis. environmental contamination arising from piggery wastewater and spreading of manure slurry on pastures is also a growing problem.

TI  == pentaplex pcr assay for detection of hemorrhagic bacteria from stool samples.
AB  == diarrheal diseases cause illness and death among children younger than 10 years in developing countries. conventional testing for the detection of hemorrhagic bacteria takes 2 to 5 days to yield complete information on the organism and its  antibiotic sensitivity pattern. hence, in the present study, we developed a molecular-based diagnostic assay that identifies common hemorrhagic bacteria in stool samples. a set of specific primers were designed for the detection of salmonella spp., shigella spp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec), and campylobacter spp., suitable for use in a one-tube pcr assay. the assay in the present study simultaneously detected five genes, namely, ompc for the salmonella genus, vira for the shigella genus, eaea for ehec, 16s rrna for the campylobacter genus, and hema for an internal control. specific primer pairs were successfully  designed and simultaneously amplified the targeted genes. validation with 20 gram-negative and 17 gram-positive strains yielded 100% specificity. the limit of detection of the multiplex pcr assay was 1 x 10(3) cfu at the bacterial cell level and 100 pg at the genomic dna level. further evaluation of the multiplex pcr with 223 bacterium-spiked stool specimens revealed 100% sensitivity and specificity. we conclude that the developed multiplex pcr assay was rapid, giving results within 4 h, which is essential for the identification of hemorrhagic bacteria, and it might be useful as an additional diagnostic tool whenever time is important in the diagnosis of hemorrhagic bacteria that cause diarrhea. in addition, the presence of an internal control in the multiplex pcr assay is important for excluding false-negative cases.

TI  == antibacterial, antiviral, and antifungal properties of wines and winery byproducts in relation to their flavonoid content.
AB  == grapes produce organic compounds that may be involved in the defense of the plants against invading phytopathogens. these metabolites include numerous phenolic compounds that are also active against human pathogens. grapes are used  to produce a variety of wines, grape juices, and raisins. grape pomace, seeds, and skins, the remains of the grapes that are a byproduct of winemaking, also contain numerous bioactive compounds that differ from those found in grapes and wines. this overview surveys and interprets our present knowledge of the activities of wines and winery byproducts and some of their bioactive components  against foodborne (bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, vibrio vulnificus), medical (helicobacter pylori, klebsiella pneumoniae), and oral pathogenic bacteria, viruses (adeno, cytomegalo, hepatitis, noro, rota), fungi (candida albicans, botrytis cinerea), parasites (eimeria tenella, trichomonas vaginalis), and microbial toxins (ochratoxin a, shiga toxin) in culture, in vivo, and in/on food (beef, chicken, frankfurters, hot dogs, lettuce, oysters, peppers, pork, sausages, soup, spinach) in relation to composition and sensory properties. also covered are antimicrobial wine marinades, antioxidative and immunostimulating aspects, and adverse effects  associated with wine consumption. the collated information and suggested research needs might facilitate and guide further studies needed to optimize the use of wines and byproducts to help improve microbial food safety and prevent or treat animal and human infections.

TI  == identification and characterization of lactic acid bacteria in a commercial probiotic culture.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to describe the identification and characterization (physiological properties) of two strains of lactic acid bacteria (lab 18 and 48) present in a commercial probiotic culture, floramax((r))-b11. isolates were characterized morphologically, and identified biochemically. in addition, the midi system id, the biolog id system, and 16s rrna sequence analyses for identification of lab 18 and lab 48 strains were used  to compare the identification results. tolerance and resistance to acidic ph, high osmotic concentration of nacl, and bile salts were tested in broth medium. in vitro assessment of antimicrobial activity against enteropathogenic bacteria and susceptibility to antibiotics were also tested. the results obtained in this  study showed tolerance of lab 18 and lab 48 to ph 3.0, 6.5% nacl and a high bile  salt concentration (0.6%). both strains evaluated showed in vitro antibacterial activity against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, escherichia coli (o157:h7), and campylobacter jejuni. these are important characteristics of lactic acid bacteria that should be evaluated when selecting strains to be used as probiotics. antimicrobial activity of these effective isolates may contribute  to efficacy, possibly by direct antimicrobial activity in vivo.

TI  == the association between campylobacteriosis, agriculture and drinking water: a case-case study in a region of british columbia, canada, 2005-2009.
AB  == we studied the association between drinking water, agriculture and sporadic human campylobacteriosis in one region of british columbia (bc), canada. we compared 2992 cases of campylobacteriosis to 4816 cases of other reportable enteric diseases in 2005-2009 using multivariate regression. cases were geocoded and assigned drinking water source, rural/urban environment and socioeconomic status  (ses) according to the location of their residence using geographical information systems analysis methods. the odds of campylobacteriosis compared to enteric disease controls were higher for individuals serviced by private wells than municipal surface water systems (odds ratio 1.4, 95% confidence interval 1.1-1.8). in rural settings, the odds of campylobacteriosis were higher in november (p = 0.014). the odds of campylobacteriosis were higher in individuals aged 15 years, especially in those with higher ses. in this region of bc, campylobacteriosis risk, compared to other enteric diseases, seems to be mediated by vulnerable drinking water sources and rural factors. consideration should be given to further support well-water users and to further study the microbiological impact of agriculture on water.

TI  == role of emerging campylobacter species in inflammatory bowel diseases.
AB  == the gut microbiota is a central player in the etiology of inflammatory bowel diseases. as such, there is intense scientific interest in elucidating the specific group/s of bacteria responsible for driving barrier damage and perpetuating the chronic inflammation that results in disease. because of their ability to colonize close to the surface of the host intestinal epithelium, mucosa-associated bacteria are considered key players in the initiation and development of both crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. the leading bacterial candidates include adherent and invasive escherichia coli, helicobacter, fusobacteria, mycobacteria, and campylobacter species. of these, a member of the  campylobacter genus, campylobacter concisus, has recently emerged as a putative player in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases. current research indicates that this bacterium possesses extraordinarily diverse pathogenic capacities as well as unique genetic and functional signatures that are defined by their ability to adhere to and invade host cells, secrete toxins, and the presence of a virulence-associated restriction-modification system. these characteristics enable the potential classification of c. concisus into distinct  pathotypes, which we have named adherent and invasive c. concisus and adherent and toxinogenic c. concisus. in this review, we evaluate evidence for the role of emerging campylobacter species in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases.

TI  == baseline and storm event monitoring of bacteroidales marker concentrations and enteric pathogen presence in a rural canadian watershed.
AB  == bacteroidales 16s rrna gene markers were evaluated for their use as a microbial source tracking tool in a well characterized 750 ha agricultural watershed in nova scotia, canada. water quality monitoring was conducted following the validation of host-specific and universal bacteroidales (allbac) markers for their proficiency in this particular geographic region, which provided further evidence that these markers are geographically stable. increasing escherichia coli concentrations were positively correlated (p < 0.01) with concentrations of  the allbac marker in water samples, suggesting that this universal marker is more suited as a positive dna control rather than as an indicator of recent fecal contamination. ruminant (bacr) and bovine (cowm2) specific marker detection was associated with increased runoff due to precipitation in sub-watersheds putatively impacted by cattle farming, demonstrating that the bacr and cowm2 markers can be used to detect the recent introduction of fecal matter from cattle farming activities during rainfall events. however, the human associated marker (bach) was only detected once in spite of numerous on-site residential wastewater treatment systems in the watershed, suggesting that this assay is not sensitive enough to detect this type of human sewage source. e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella spp. dna was not detected in any of the 149 watershed samples; however, 114 (76.5%) of those samples tested positive for campylobacter spp. no significant correlation (p > 0.05) was found between campylobacter spp. presence and either e. coli or allbac marker levels. further studies should be conducted to assess the origins of campylobacter spp. in these types of watersheds, and to quantify pathogen cell numbers to allow for a human health risk assessment.

TI  == the impact of major earthquakes and subsequent sewage discharges on the microbial quality of water and sediments in an urban river.
AB  == a series of large earthquakes struck the city of christchurch, new zealand in 2010-2011. major damage sustained by the sewerage infrastructure required direct  discharge of up to 38,000 m(3)/day of raw sewage into the avon river of christchurch for approximately six months. this allowed evaluation of the relationship between concentrations of indicator microorganisms (escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens and f-rna phage) and pathogens (campylobacter, giardia and cryptosporidium) in recreational water and sediment both during and post-cessation of sewage discharges. giardia was the pathogen found most frequently in river water and sediment, although campylobacter was found at higher levels in water samples. e. coli levels in water above 550 cfu/100 ml were associated with increased likelihood of detection of campylobacter, giardia and cryptosporidium, supporting the use of e. coli as a reliable indicator for public health risk. the strength of the correlation of microbial indicators with pathogen detection in water decreased in the following order: e. coli>f-rna phage>c. perfringens. all the microorganisms assayed in this study could be recovered from sediments. c. perfringens was observed to accumulate in sediments, which may have confounded its usefulness as an indicator of fresh sewage discharge. f-rna phage, however, did not appear to accumulate in sediment and in  conjunction with e. coli, may have potential as an indicator of recent human sewage discharge in freshwater. there is evidence to support the low-level persistence of cryptosporidium and giardia, but not campylobacter, in river sediments after cessation of sewage discharges. in the event of disturbances of the sediment, it is highly probable that there could be re-mobilisation of microorganisms beyond the sediment-water exchange processes occurring under base  flow conditions. re-suspension events do, therefore, increase the potential risk  to human health for those who participate in recreational and work-related activities in the river environment.

TI  == phenotypic resistance and the dynamics of bacterial escape from phage control.
AB  == the canonical view of phage - bacterial interactions in dense, liquid cultures is that the phage will eliminate most of the sensitive cells; genetic resistance will then ascend to restore high bacterial densities. yet there are various mechanisms by which bacteria may remain sensitive to phages but still attain high densities in their presence - because bacteria enter a transient state of reduced adsorption. importantly, these mechanisms may be cryptic and inapparent prior to  the addition of phage yet result in a rapid rebound of bacterial density after phage are introduced. we describe mathematical models of these processes and suggest how different types of this 'phenotypic' resistance may be elucidated. we offer preliminary in vitro studies of a previously characterized e. coli model system and campylobacter jejuni illustrating apparent phenotypic resistance. as phenotypic resistance may be specific to the receptors used by phages, awareness  of its mechanisms may identify ways of improving the choice of phages for therapy. phenotypic resistance can also explain several enigmas in the ecology of phage-bacterial dynamics. phenotypic resistance does not preclude the evolution of genetic resistance and may often be an intermediate step to genetic resistance.

AB  == the significance of petting zoos for transmission of campylobacter to humans and  the effect of interventions were estimated. a stochastic qmra model simulating a  child or adult visiting a dutch petting zoo was built. the model describes the transmission of campylobacter in animal feces from the various animal species, fences, and the playground to ingestion by visitors through touching these so-called carriers and subsequently touching their lips. extensive field and laboratory research was done to fulfill data needs. fecal contamination on all carriers was measured by swabbing in 10 petting zoos, using escherichia coli as an indicator. carrier-hand and hand-lip touching frequencies were estimated by, in total, 13 days of observations of visitors by two observers at two petting zoos. the transmission from carrier to hand and from hand to lip by touching was  measured using preapplied cow feces to which e. coli wg5 was added as an indicator. via a beta-poisson dose-response function, the number of campylobacter cases for the whole of the netherlands (16 million population) in a year was estimated at 187 and 52 for children and adults, respectively, so 239 in total. this is significantly lower than previous qmra results on chicken fillet and drinking water consumption. scenarios of 90% reduction of the contamination (meant to mimic cleaning) of all fences and just goat fences reduces the number of cases by 82% and 75%, respectively. the model can easily be adapted for other  fecally transmitted pathogens.

TI  == food safety in raw milk production: risk factors associated to bacterial dna contamination.
AB  == while human illness from milkborne pathogens may be linked to contamination of the product after pasteurization or improper pasteurization, such diseases are usually associated with consumption of raw milk or its by-products. molecular biology tools were applied to investigate contamination by listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., some pathogenic strains of escherichia coli, and  campylobacter jejuni in 548 raw milk samples from 125 dairy farms established in  two regions from southern brazil. moreover, 15 variables were evaluated for their association with raw milk contamination levels, and the risk factors were determined by multiple regression analysis. salmonella spp. were more frequently  detected, followed by pathogenic e. coli. there was difference in contamination index between the regions, in which risk factors such as temporary cattle confinement, low milk production, low milking machine cleaning frequency, and milk storage area without tile walls were identified. the risk factors were specific to each region studied. nevertheless, the data can be used to improve milk quality of dairy farms/herds with similar management practices.

TI  == a multiplex pcr/ldr assay for simultaneous detection and identification of the niaid category b bacterial food and water-borne pathogens.
AB  == enteric pathogens that cause gastroenteritis remain a major global health concern. the goal of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr/ligation detection reaction (ldr) assay for the detection of all niaid category b bacterial food and water-borne pathogens directly from stool specimens. to validate the pcr/ldr assay, clinical isolates of campylobacter spp., vibrio spp., shigella spp., salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, and diarrheagenic escherichia coli were tested. the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were assessed using a large number of seeded culture-negative stool specimens and a smaller set of clinical specimens from haiti. the overall sensitivity ranged from 91% to 100% (median 100%) depending on the species. for the majority of organisms, the sensitivity was 100%. the overall specificity based on initial testing ranged from 98% to 100% depending on the species. after  additional testing of discordant samples, the lowest specificity was 99.4%. pcr/ldr detected additional category b agents (particularly diarrheagenic e. coli) in 11/40 specimens from haiti that were culture-positive for v. cholerae and in approximately 1% of routine culture-negative stool specimens from a hospital in new york. this study demonstrated the ability of the pcr/ldr assay to detect a large comprehensive panel of category b enteric bacterial pathogens as well as mixed infections. this type of assay has the potential to provide earlier warnings of possible public health threats and more accurate surveillance of food and water-borne pathogens.

TI  == molecular architecture of the bacterial flagellar motor in cells.
AB  == the flagellum is one of the most sophisticated self-assembling molecular machines in bacteria. powered by the proton-motive force, the flagellum rapidly rotates in either a clockwise or counterclockwise direction, which ultimately controls bacterial motility and behavior. escherichia coli and salmonella enterica have served as important model systems for extensive genetic, biochemical, and structural analysis of the flagellum, providing unparalleled insights into its structure, function, and gene regulation. despite these advances, our understanding of flagellar assembly and rotational mechanisms remains incomplete, in part because of the limited structural information available regarding the intact rotor-stator complex and secretion apparatus. cryo-electron tomography (cryo-et) has become a valuable imaging technique capable of visualizing the intact flagellar motor in cells at molecular resolution. because the resolution that can be achieved by cryo-et with large bacteria (such as e. coli and s. enterica) is limited, analysis of small-diameter bacteria (including borrelia burgdorferi and campylobacter jejuni) can provide additional insights into the in situ structure of the flagellar motor and other cellular components. this review  is focused on the application of cryo-et, in combination with genetic and biophysical approaches, to the study of flagellar structures and its potential for improving the understanding of rotor-stator interactions, the rotational switching mechanism, and the secretion and assembly of flagellar components.

TI  == estimation of infectious risks in residential populations exposed to airborne pathogens during center pivot irrigation of dairy wastewaters.
AB  == in the western united states where dairy wastewaters are commonly land applied, there are concerns over individuals being exposed to airborne pathogens. in response, a quantitative microbial risk assessment (qmra) was performed to estimate infectious risks after inhalation exposure of pathogens aerosolized during center pivot irrigation of diluted dairy wastewaters. the dispersion of pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, non-o157 e. coli, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp.) was modeled using the atmospheric dispersion model, aermod. pathogen concentrations at downwind receptors were used to calculate infectious risks during one-time (1, 8, and 24 h) and multiday (7 d  at 1 h d(-1)) exposure events using a beta-poisson dose-response model. this assessment considered risk of infection in residential populations that were 1 to 10 km from a center pivot operation. in the simulations, infectious risks were estimated to be the greatest in individuals closest to the center pivot, as a result of a higher pathogen dose. on the basis of the results from this qmra, it  is recommended that wastewaters only be applied during daylight hours when inactivation and dilution of airborne pathogens is highest. further refinement of the dispersion and dose-response models should be considered to increase the utility of this qmra.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance monitoring projects for zoonotic and indicator bacteria  of animal origin: common aspects and differences between eassa and efsa.
AB  == resistance monitoring programmes are essential to generate data for inclusion in  the scientific risk assessment of the potential for transmission of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria or their resistance determinants from food-producing animals to humans. this review compares the technical specifications on monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic salmonella,  campylobacter and indicator escherichia coli and enterococcus as performed by the european food safety authority (efsa) with veterinary pharmaceutical industry's european antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance in animals (eassa) programme.  the authors conclude that most of efsa's recent monitoring recommendations have been covered by eassa since the start of the latter programme in 1998. the major  difference between the two programmes is the classification into 'susceptible' versus 'resistant'. while efsa categorises all isolates with an mic value above the epidemiological cut-off value as 'resistant', eassa differentiates between 'percentage decreased susceptible' and 'percentage clinical resistant' strains by applying both epidemiological cut-off values and clinical breakpoints. because there is still a need to further improve harmonisation among individual eu member state activities, animal health industry welcomes efsa's initiative to further improve the quality of resistance monitoring as it is of utmost importance to apply standardised collection procedures and harmonised susceptibility testing, when monitoring antimicrobial resistance across europe.

AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the microbial hazard associated with  the consumption of mixed salads produced under standard conditions. the presence  of salmonella, campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli o157 in the dutch production chain of mixed salads was determined. microbial prevalence and concentration data from a microbiological surveillance study were used as inputs  for the quantitative microbial risk assessment. chain logistics, production figures, and consumption patterns were combined with the survey data for the risk assessment chain approach. the results of the sample analysis were used to track  events from contamination through human illness. wide 95% confidence intervals around the mean were found for estimated annual numbers of illnesses resulting from the consumption of mixed salads contaminated with salmonella typhimurium dt104 (0 to 10,300 cases), campylobacter spp. (0 to 92,000 cases), or e. coli (0  to 800 cases). the main sources of uncertainty are the lack of decontamination data (i.e., produce washing during processing) and an appropriate dose-response relationship.

AB  == recent outbreaks with vegetable or fruits as vehicles have raised interest in the characterization of the public health risk due to microbial contamination of these commodities. because qualitative and quantitative data regarding prevalence and concentration of various microbes are lacking, we conducted a survey to estimate the prevalence and contamination level of raw produce and the resulting  minimally processed packaged salads as sold in the netherlands. a dedicated sampling plan accounted for the amount of processed produce in relation to the amount of products, laboratory capacity, and seasonal influences. over 1,800 samples of produce and over 1,900 samples of ready-to-eat mixed salads were investigated for salmonella enterica serovars, campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157, and listeria monocytogenes. the overall prevalence in raw produce varied between 0.11% for e. coli o157 and l. monocytogenes and 0.38% for salmonella. prevalence point estimates for specific produce/pathogen combinations ranged for salmonella from 0.53% in iceberg lettuce to 5.1% in cucumber. for campylobacter, this ranged from 0.83% in endive to 2.7% in oak tree lettuce. these data will be used to determine the public health risk posed by the consumption of ready-to-eat mixed salads in the netherlands.

TI  == a general protein o-glycosylation system within the burkholderia cepacia complex  is involved in motility and virulence.
AB  == bacteria of the burkholderia cepacia complex (bcc) are pathogens of humans, plants, and animals. burkholderia cenocepacia is one of the most common bcc species infecting cystic fibrosis (cf) patients and its carriage is associated with poor prognosis. in this study, we characterized a general o-linked protein glycosylation system in b. cenocepacia k56-2. the pgllbc o-oligosaccharyltransferase (o-otase), encoded by the cloned gene bcal0960, was shown to be capable of transferring a heptasaccharide from the campylobacter jejuni n-glycosylation system to a neisseria meningitides-derived acceptor protein in an escherichia coli background, indicating that the enzyme has relaxed specificities for both the sugar donor and protein acceptor. in b cenocepacia k56-2, pgllbc is responsible for the glycosylation of 23 proteins involved in diverse cellular processes. mass spectrometry analysis revealed that these proteins are modified with a trisaccharide hexnac-hexnac-hex, which is unrelated  to the o-antigen biosynthetic process. the glycosylation sites that were identified existed within regions of low complexity, rich in serine, alanine, and proline. disruption of bcal0960 abolished glycosylation and resulted in reduced swimming motility and attenuated virulence towards both plant and insect model organisms. this study demonstrates the first example of post-translational modification in bcc with implications for pathogenesis.

TI  == characterization and reactivity of broiler chicken sera to selected recombinant campylobacter jejuni chemotactic proteins.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative rod bacterium, is the leading causative agent of human acute bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. consumption and handling of raw or undercooked poultry are regarded as a major source for human infection. because bacterial chemotaxis guides microorganisms to colonization and invasion in the host cells, proteins involved in chemotactic processes can be novel targets for vaccine development. in this communication, we report amplification, cloning and expression of the c. jejuni chemotactic proteins in an escherichia coli expression system. a total of 15 chemotactic protein genes were  successfully expressed. these recombinant proteins were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing, sds-page analysis and immunoblot analysis of six-his and hemagglutinin tags. twelve recombinant chemotactic proteins were further tested whether they were antigenic using sera from broiler chickens older than 4 weeks.  the immunoblot results show that each chicken serum reacted to a variety of the recombinant proteins, but all sera reacted to the cjj0473 gene product (annotated as a methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein), suggesting that anti-campylobacter antibodies may be prevalent in the poultry population. these antibody screening results provide a rationale for further evaluation of the cjj0473 protein as a potential vaccine for broilers to improve human food safety.

TI  == development of an aotus nancymaae model for shigella vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy studies.
AB  == several animal models exist to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of candidate shigella vaccines. the two most widely used nonprimate models for vaccine development include a murine pulmonary challenge model and a guinea pig keratoconjunctivitis model. nonhuman primate models exhibit clinical features and gross and microscopic colonic lesions that mimic those induced in human shigellosis. challenge models for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) and campylobacter spp. have been successfully developed with aotus nancymaae, and the addition of a shigella-aotus challenge model would facilitate the testing of  combination vaccines. a series of experiments were designed to identify the dose  of shigella flexneri 2a strain 2457t that induces an attack rate of 75% in the aotus monkey. after primary challenge, the dose required to induce an attack rate of 75% was calculated to be 1 x 10(11) cfu. shigella-specific immune responses were low after primary challenge and subsequently boosted upon rechallenge. however, preexisting immunity derived from the primary challenge was insufficient to protect against the homologous shigella serotype. a successive study in a. nancymaae evaluated the ability of multiple oral immunizations with live-attenuated shigella vaccine strain sc602 to protect against challenge. after three oral immunizations, animals were challenged with s. flexneri 2a 2457t. a 70% attack rate was demonstrated in control animals, whereas animals immunized with vaccine strain sc602 were protected from challenge (efficacy of 80%; p = 0.05). the overall study results indicate that the shigella-aotus nancymaae challenge model may be a valuable tool for evaluating vaccine efficacy and investigating immune correlates of protection.

AB  == the emergence of resistance in food animals has been associated to the consumption of antimicrobials in veterinary medicine. consequently, monitoring programs have been designed to monitor the occurrence of antimicrobial resistant  bacteria. this study analyses the amount of antimicrobial agents used in nine european countries from 2005 to 2011, and compares by univariate analysis the correlations between consumptions of each of the following antimicrobial classes; tetracycline, penicillins, cephalosporins, quinolones and macrolides. an overview of resistance in zoonotic and commensal bacteria in europe focusing on salmonella, escherichia coli, campylobacter sp. and enterococcus sp., during the  same period of time based on monitoring programs is also assessed. with the exception of cephalosporins, linear regressions showed strong positive associations between the consumption of the four different antimicrobial classes. substantial differences between countries were observed in the amount of antimicrobials used to produce 1 kg of meat. moreover, large variations in proportions of resistant bacteria were reported by the different countries, suggesting differences in veterinary practice. despite the withdrawn of a specific antimicrobial from "on farm" use, persistence over the years of bacteria resistant to this particular antimicrobial agent, was still observed. there were  also differences in trends of resistance associated to specific animal species. in order to correlate the use of antimicrobial agents to the presence of resistance, surveillance of antimicrobial consumption by animal species should be established. subsequently, intervention strategies could be designed to minimize  the occurrence of resistance.

TI  == efficient inference of recombination hot regions in bacterial genomes.
AB  == in eukaryotes, detailed surveys of recombination rates have shown variation at multiple genomic scales and the presence of "hotspots" of highly elevated recombination. in bacteria, studies of recombination rate variation are less developed, in part because there are few analysis methods that take into account  the clonal context within which bacterial evolution occurs. here, we focus in particular on identifying "hot regions" of the genome where dna is transferred frequently between isolates. we present a computationally efficient algorithm based on the recently developed "chromosome painting" algorithm, which characterizes patterns of haplotype sharing across a genome. we compare the average genome wide painting, which principally reflects clonal descent, with the painting for each site which additionally reflects the specific deviations at the site due to recombination. using simulated data, we show that hot regions have consistently higher deviations from the genome wide average than normal regions.  we applied our approach to previously analyzed escherichia coli genomes and revealed that the new method is highly correlated with the number of recombination events affecting each site inferred by clonalorigin, a method that  is only applicable to small numbers of genomes. furthermore, we analyzed recombination hot regions in campylobacter jejuni by using 200 genomes. we identified three recombination hot regions, which are enriched for genes related  to membrane proteins. our approach and its implementation, which is downloadable  from https://github.com/bioprojects/orderedpainting, will help to develop a new phase of population genomic studies of recombination in prokaryotes.

TI  == high frequency, spontaneous mota mutations in campylobacter jejuni strain 81-176.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important cause of bacterial diarrhea worldwide. the pathogenesis of c. jejuni is poorly understood and complicated by phase variation of multiple surface structures including lipooligosaccharide, capsule, and flagellum. when c. jejuni strain 81-176 was plated on blood agar for single colonies, the presence of translucent, non-motile colonial variants was noted among the majority of opaque, motile colonies. high-throughput genomic sequencing of two flagellated translucent and two opaque variants as well as the parent strain revealed multiple genetic changes compared to the published genome. however, the only mutated open reading frame common between the two translucent variants and absent from the opaque variants and the parent was mota, encoding a  flagellar motor protein. a total of 18 spontaneous mota mutations were found that mapped to four distinct sites in the gene, with only one class of mutation present in a phase variable region. this study exemplifies the mutative/adaptive  properties of c. jejuni and demonstrates additional variability in c. jejuni beyond phase variation.

TI  == small distances can keep bacteria at bay for days.
AB  == transmission of pathogens between spatially separated hosts, i.e., indirect transmission, is a commonly encountered phenomenon important for epidemic pathogen spread. the routes of indirect transmission often remain untraced, making it difficult to develop control strategies. here we used a tailor-made design to study indirect transmission experimentally, using two different zoonotic bacteria in broilers. previous experiments using a single bacterial species yielded a delay in the onset of transmission, which we hypothesized to result from the interplay between diffusive motion of infectious material and decay of infectivity in the environment. indeed, a mathematical model of diffusive pathogen transfer predicts a delay in transmission that depends both on the distance between hosts and on the magnitude of the pathogen decay rate. our experiments, carried out with two bacterial species with very different decay rates in the environment, confirm the difference in transmission delay predicted  by the model. these results imply that for control of an infectious agent, the time between the distant exposure and the infection event is important. to illustrate how this can work we analyzed data observed on the spread of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus in an intensive care unit. indeed, a delayed vancomycin-resistant enterococcus transmission component was identified in these  data, and this component disappeared in a study period in which the environment was thoroughly cleaned. therefore, we suggest that the impact of control strategies against indirect transmission can be assessed using our model by estimating the control measures' effects on the diffusion coefficient and the pathogen decay rate.

AB  == background: responsibility for food safety must be taken through the entire food-production chain, to avoid consumer cross-contamination. the antimicrobial activities of an alpinia katsumadai seed extract and epigallocatechin gallate (egcg), and their combination, were evaluated against individual food-borne pathogenic strains of listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli and campylobacter  jejuni, individually and as a cocktail, in chicken-meat juice and sterile minced  meat as food models, and in minced meat with the naturally present microflora, as an actual food sample. results: the antimicrobial combination of the a. katsumadai extract and egcg was the most efficient for c. jejuni growth inhibition, followed by inhibition of l. monocytogenes, which was reduced more efficiently in the bacterial cocktail than as an individual strain. the antimicrobial combination added to minced meat at refrigeration temperatures used in the food chain (8 degrees c) revealed inhibition of these pathogens and inhibition of the naturally present bacteria after 5 days. conclusions: the antibacterial efficiencies of the tested combinations are influenced by storage temperature. food safety can be improved by using the appropriate combination of  natural antimicrobials to reduce the microbiological risk of minced meat.

TI  == structure of an unusual s-adenosylmethionine synthetase from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == s-adenosylmethionine (adomet) participates in a wide range of methylation and other group-transfer reactions and also serves as the precursor for two groups of quorum-sensing molecules that function as regulators of the production of virulence factors in gram-negative bacteria. the synthesis of adomet is catalyzed by adomet synthetases (mats), a ubiquitous family of enzymes found in species ranging from microorganisms to mammals. the adomet synthetase from the bacterium  campylobacter jejuni (cjmat) is an outlier among this homologous enzyme family, with lower sequence identity, numerous insertions and substitutions, and higher catalytic activity compared with other bacterial mats. alterations in the structure of this enzyme provide an explanation for its unusual dimeric quaternary structure relative to the other mats. taken together with several active-site substitutions, this new structure provides insights into its improved kinetic properties with alternative substrates.

TI  == high number of diarrhoeal co-infections in travellers to benin, west africa.
AB  == background: travellers' diarrhoea (td) is the most frequent health problem among  travellers to the tropics. using routine techniques, the aetiology mostly remains unresolved, whereas modern molecular methods enable reducing the number of equivocal cases considerably. while many studies address the aetiology of td in asian, central american and north african tourist resorts, only few focus on western africa. methods: stool samples from 45 travellers travelling in benin, west africa, were analyzed by a new multiplex qpcr assay for salmonella, yersinia, campylobacter, vibrio cholerae, shigella or enteroinvasive (eiec), enterohaemorrhagic (ehec), enterotoxigenic (etec), enteroaggregative (eaec), and  enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec). results: all 18 pre-travel samples proved negative for bacterial pathogens. of the 39/45 (87%) travellers having had td, epec was detected in post-travel samples in 30 (77%) cases, eaec in 23 (59%), etec in 22 (56%), shigella or eiec in 7 (18%), ehec in two (5%), and salmonella in one (3%). in 31(79%) of the td cases two or more bacterial pathogens were identified. two (8%) samples remained negative: both patients had taken antimicrobials for td. conclusions: epec, eaec and etec were the most common findings. 79% of the cases had a co-infection. as modern diagnostics reveals in most patients a multitude of pathogens, the role of each pathogen should be re-evaluated.

TI  == the impairment of methylmenaquinol:fumarate reductase affects hydrogen peroxide susceptibility and accumulation in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the methylmenaquinol:fumarate reductase (mfr) of campylobacter jejuni is a periplasmic respiratory (redox) protein that contributes to the metabolism of fumarate and displays homology to succinate dehydrogenase (sdh). since chemically oxidized redox-enzymes, including fumarate reductase and sdh, contribute to the generation of oxidative stress in escherichia coli, we assessed the role of mfr in c. jejuni after exposure to hydrogen peroxide (h2 o2 ). our results show that  a mfr mutant (mfra) strain was less susceptible to h2 o2 as compared to the wildtype (wt). furthermore, the h2 o2 concentration in the mfra cultures was significantly higher than that of wt after exposure to the oxidant. in the presence of h2 o2 , catalase (kata) activity and kata expression were significantly lower in the mfra strain as compared to the wt. exposure to h2 o2 resulted in a significant decrease in total intracellular iron in the mfra strain as compared to wt, while the addition of iron to the growth medium mitigated h2 o2 susceptibility and accumulation in the mutant. the mfra strain was significantly more persistent in raw macrophages as compared to the wt. scanning  electron microscopy showed that infection with the mfra strain caused prolonged changes to the macrophages' morphology, mainly resulting in spherical-shaped cells replete with budding structures and craters. collectively, our results suggest a role for mfr in maintaining iron homeostasis in h2 o2 stressed c. jejuni, probably via affecting the concentrations of intracellular iron.

TI  == evaluation of the microbial safety of child food of animal origin in greece.
AB  == foodborne illness is a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially for children, even in the developed world. the aim of this study was to assess the microbial safety of food of animal origin intended for consumption by children in greece. sampling involved 8 categories of retail products and was completed with  a collection of 850 samples. these were tested by pcr and/or culture for listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157, salmonella spp., cronobacter sakazakii, brucella spp., and mycobacterium avium subsp paratuberculosis (map). the number of positive results recorded collectively for  the pathogens under investigation over the total number of samples tested was 3.52% and 0.12% by pcr and culture, respectively. the most frequently detected pathogen was enterohemorrhagic e. coli (1.29%) followed by brucella (0.82%) and listeria (0.82%). dna belonging to map was detected in 0.35% of samples, which was also the percentage of positivity recorded for campylobacter. the percentage  for salmonella was 0.12%. it can be concluded from the results that there is no indication of noncompliance for the tested food samples. however, detection of dna belonging to pathogens that are transmissible to humans through food is indicative that constant vigilance regarding food safety is an absolute necessity.

TI  == food-borne pathogens of animal origin-diagnosis, prevention, control and their zoonotic significance: a review.
AB  == the term food borne diseases or food-borne illnesses or more commonly food poisoning are used to denote gastrointestinal complications that occur following  recent consumption of a particular food or drink. millions of people suffer worldwide every year and the situation is quiet grave in developing nations creating social and economic strain. the food borne pathogens include various bacteria viz., salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus, arcobacter, clostridium perfringens, cl. botulinum and bacillus cereus and helminths viz., taenia. they also include protozoa viz., trichinella, sarcocystis, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the zoonotic potential and the ability to elaborate toxins by many of the microbes causing fatal intoxication are sufficient to understand the seriousness of the situation. the viral agents being host specific their transmission to humans through food of animal origin is not yet confirmed although these animal viruses are similar to that of viruses infecting human. food-borne bacteria; protozoa and helminthes have complex distribution pattern in the environment and inside the host system. this along with complexity of the maintenance chain and life cycle (of parasites) has made it difficult for epidemiologist and diagnostician to undertake any immediate safety measures against them. serological and molecular diagnostic tests viz. elisa, latex agglutination test, lateral flow assays, immunomagnetic separation assays, molecular assays viz. polymerase chain reaction (pcr), multiplex pcr, immuno-pcr, realtime pcr, random amplified polymorphic dna (rapd)-pcr, dna microarrays and probes are widely used. along with these lamp assays, capillary electrophoresis-single strand confirmation polymorphism (ce-sscp); flow cytometry, fish, biosensors, direct epifluorescent filter technique, nanotechnology based methods and sophisticated tools (ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging and chlonangio-pancreatography) have aided in the diagnosis greatly. most of the food-borne illnesses are self-limiting but in many instances antibiotics are recommended. with the increased drug resistance however use of chicken immunoglobulin, bacteriophage therapy, probiotics and herbs are gaining much importance these days. adoption of proper prevention and control measures (including cooking procedures; hygiene, strict adherence to haccp principles, public awareness and disease surveillance and monitoring) are the need of hour. all these have been discussed vividly in this review to help epidemiologists, diagnosticians, clinicians and above all common people so as to enable them avoid negligence regarding such serious issue.

TI  == estimating the correlation between concentrations of two species of bacteria with censored microbial testing data.
AB  == indicator organisms, such as generic escherichia coli (gec) and coliforms, can be used to measure changes in microbial contamination during the production of food  products. large and consistent reductions in the concentration of these organisms demonstrates an effective and well-controlled production process. nevertheless, it is unclear to what degree concentrations of indicator organisms are related to pathogenic organisms such as campylobacter and salmonella on a sample-by-sample basis. if a strong correlation exists between the concentrations of different organisms, then the monitoring of indicator organisms would be a cost-effective surrogate for the measurement of pathogenic organisms. calculating the correlation between the concentrations of an indicator and pathogenic organism is complicated because microbial testing datasets typically contain a large proportion of censored observations (i.e., samples where the true concentration is not observable, with nondetects and samples that are only screen-test positive being examples). this study proposes a maximum likelihood estimator that can be used to estimate the correlation between the concentrations of indicator and pathogenic organisms. an example based on broiler chicken rinse samples demonstrates modest, but significant positive correlations between the concentration of the indicator organism gec when compared to the concentration of both campylobacter and salmonella. a weak positive correlation was also observed  between concentrations of campylobacter and salmonella, but it was not statistically significant.

TI  == characterization and antigenicity of recombinant campylobacter jejuni flagellar capping protein flid.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, a flagellated, spiral-rod, gram-negative bacterium, is the  leading pathogen of human acute bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide, and chickens are regarded as a major reservoir of this micro-organism. bacterial flagella, composed of more than 35 proteins, play important roles in colonization and adhesion to the mucosal surface of chicken caeca. in this study, the flagellar capping protein, flid, encoded by the flid gene, from the campylobacter jenuni d1-39 isolate was expressed and characterized, and its antigenicity determined. the flid gene comprised 1929 nt, potentially encoding a 642 aa peptide with a calculated molecular mass of 69.6 kda. this gene was pcr amplified and overexpressed in escherichia coli. the recombinant flid protein was purified by cobalt-chelating affinity chromatography and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing of the expression plasmid, sds-page analysis, his tag detection and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry. the immunoblot data showed that the purified recombinant flid protein reacted strongly to sera from broiler chickens older than 4 weeks, indicating that anti-flid antibody may be prevalent in the poultry population. these results provide a rationale for further evaluation of the flid protein as a vaccine candidate for broiler chickens to improve food safety for poultry.

AB  == objective: our aim was to determine whether or not specific microorganisms were transported selectively to lymph nodes in crohn's disease (cd) by comparing node  and mucosal microbial communities in patients and controls. we also sought evidence of dysbiosis and bacterial translocation. design: lymph nodes, and involved and uninvolved mucosal samples were obtained from resections of 58 patients (29 cd, eight 'other inflammatory bowel disease' (ibd) and 21 non-ibd).  universal primers targeting v1-v3 regions of bacterial 16s rrna genes were used to amplify bacterial dna and amplicons sequenced using high throughput sequencing. 20 patients (eight cd (28%), two other ibd (25%) and 10 non-ibd (48%)) had pcr positive nodes. results: all samples from an individual were similar: there was no evidence of selective concentration of any microorganism in nodes. no specific microorganism was present in the nodes of all cd samples. escherichia/shigella were common in all patient groups but patients with ileal cd had a greater proportion of escherichia coli reads in their nodes than other cd patients (p=0.0475). campylobacter, helicobacter and yersinia were uncommon; mycobacterium and listeria were not detected. dysbiosis was present in all groups but shifts were specific and no common pattern emerged. conclusions: it is unlikely that a single bacterium perpetuates inflammation in late stage cd; dysbiosis was common and we found no evidence of increased bacterial translocation. we believe that future studies should focus on early disease and viable bacteria in nodes, aphthous ulcers and granulomas, as they may be more relevant in the initiation of inflammation in cd.

AB  == molecular assays might improve the identification of causes of acute diarrheal disease but might lead to more frequent detection of asymptomatic infections. in  the present study, real-time pcr targeting 14 pathogens was applied to rectal swabs from 330 children aged 2 to 59 months in zanzibar, including 165 patients with acute diarrhea and 165 asymptomatic control subjects. at least one pathogen  was detected for 94% of the patients and 84% of the controls, with higher rates among patients for norovirus genogroup ii (20% versus 2.4%; p<0.0001), rotavirus  (10% versus 1.8%; p=0.003), and cryptosporidium (30% versus 11%; p<0.0001). detection rates did not differ significantly for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec)-esta (33% versus 24%), etec-eltb (44% versus 46%), shigella (35% versus 33%), and campylobacter (35% versus 33%), but for these agents threshold cycle (ct) values were lower (pathogen loads were higher) in sick children than in controls. in a multivariate analysis, ct values for norovirus genogroup ii, rotavirus, cryptosporidium, etec-esta, and shigella were independently associated with diarrhea. we conclude that this real-time pcr allows convenient detection of essentially all diarrheagenic agents and provides ct values that may be critical  for the interpretation of results for pathogens with similar detection rates in patients and controls. the results indicate that the assessment of pathogen loads may improve the identification of agents causing gastroenteritis in children.

TI  == identification of a broad family of lipid a late acyltransferases with non-canonical substrate specificity.
AB  == most gram-negative organisms produce lipopolysaccharide (lps), a complex macromolecule anchored to the bacterial membrane by the lipid a moiety. lipid a is synthesized via the raetz pathway, a conserved nine-step enzymatic process first characterized in escherichia coli. the epsilonproteobacterium helicobacter  pylori uses the raetz pathway to synthesize lipid a; however, only eight of nine  enzymes in the pathway have been identified in this organism. here, we identify the missing acyltransferase, jhp0255, which transfers a secondary acyl chain to the 3'-linked primary acyl chain of lipid a, an activity similar to that of e. coli lpxm. this enzyme, reannotated as lpxj due to limited sequence similarity with lpxm, catalyses addition of a c12:0 or c14:0 acyl chain to the 3'-linked primary acyl chain of lipid a, complementing an e. coli lpxm mutant. enzymatic assays demonstrate that lpxj and homologues in campylobacter jejuni and wolinella succinogenes can act before the 2' secondary acyltransferase, lpxl, as well as the 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (kdo) transferase, kdta. ultimately, lpxj is one member of a large class of acyltransferases found in a diverse range of organisms that lack an e. coli lpxm homologue, suggesting that lpxj participates  in lipid a biosynthesis in place of an lpxm homologue.

TI  == a modified molecular beacons-based multiplex real-time pcr assay for simultaneous detection of eight foodborne pathogens in a single reaction and its application.
AB  == foodborne disease outbreaks are often caused by one of the major pathogens. early identification of the causal pathogen is crucial for disease control and prevention. we describe a real-time polymerase chain reaction (rtpcr) assay that  can identify, in a single reaction, up to eight common foodborne bacterial pathogens, including salmonella enterica subsp. enterica, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157, vibrio parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, and shigella spp. this multiplex rtpcr assay takes advantage of modified molecular beacons and the multicolor combinational probe coding strategy to discriminate each pathogen and the homo-tag assisted non-dimer (hand) system to prevent dimer formation. the detection limits of the assay ranged from 1.3x10(3) colony-forming units (cfu)/g stool (l. monocytogenes) to 1.6x10(4) cfu/g stool (shigella spp.). the target genes were 100% specific as  assessed on 986 reference strains covering 41 species since no cross-reactions were observed. the assay was applied to the detection of foodborne pathogens in 11,167 clinical samples and the results were compared with culture methods for further validation. the sensitivity and specificity of the rtpcr were 100% and 99%, respectively. when performed in a 96-well rtpcr system, more than 90 samples could be analyzed within 3 h. given the high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,  and short turn-around time, the established assay could be used for the rapid and reliable identification of the causative pathogens responsible for a certain foodborne disease outbreak and rapid screening of these major foodborne pathogens in laboratory-based surveillance of outpatient clinical samples or even food samples.

TI  == prevention of staphylococcus aureus infections by glycoprotein vaccines synthesized in escherichia coli.
AB  == background: staphylococcus aureus is a leading cause of superficial and invasive  human disease that is often refractory to antimicrobial therapy. vaccines have the potential to reduce the morbidity, mortality, and economic impact associated  with staphylococcal infections. however, single-component vaccines targeting s. aureus have failed to show efficacy in clinical trials. methods: a novel glycoengineering technology for creation of a multicomponent staphylococcal vaccine is described. genes encoding s. aureus capsular polysaccharide (cp) biosynthesis, pglb (a campylobacter oligosaccharyl transferase), and a protein carrier (detoxified pseudomonas aeruginosa exoprotein a or s. aureus alpha toxin  [hla]) were coexpressed in escherichia coli. recombinant proteins n-glycosylated  with s. aureus serotype 5 or 8 cps were purified from e. coli. results: rabbits and mice immunized with the glycoprotein vaccines produced antibodies that were active in vitro in functional assays. active and passive immunization strategies  targeting the cps protected mice against bacteremia, and vaccines targeting hla protected against lethal pneumonia. the cp-hla bioconjugate vaccine protected against both bacteremia and lethal pneumonia, providing broad-spectrum efficacy against staphylococcal invasive disease. conclusions: glycoengineering technology, whereby polysaccharide and protein antigens are enzymatically linked  in a simple e. coli production system, has broad applicability for use in vaccine development against encapsulated microbial pathogens.

TI  == the campylobacter jejuni cj0268c protein is required for adhesion and invasion in vitro.
AB  == adherence of campylobacter jejuni to its particular host cells is mediated by several pathogen proteins. we screened a transposon-based mutant library of c. jejuni in order to identify clones with an invasion deficient phenotype towards caco2 cells and detected a mutant with the transposon insertion in gene cj0268c.  in vitro characterization of a generated non-random mutant, the mutant complemented with an intact copy of cj0268c and parental strain nctc 11168 confirmed the relevance of cj0268c in the invasion process, in particular regarding adherence to host cells. whereas cj0268c does not impact autoagglutination or motility of c. jejuni, heterologous expression in e. coli strain dh5alpha enhanced the potential of the complemented e. coli strain to adhere to caco2 cells significantly and, thus, indicates that cj0268c does not need to interact with other c. jejuni proteins to develop its adherence-mediating phenotype. flow cytometric measurements of e. coli expressing cj0268c indicate a  localization of the protein in the periplasmic space with no access of its c-terminus to the bacterial surface. since a respective knockout mutant possesses clearly reduced resistance to triton x-100 treatment, cj0268c contributes to the  stability of the bacterial cell wall. finally, we could show that the presence of cj0268c seems to be ubiquitous in isolates of c. jejuni and does not correlate with specific clonal groups regarding pathogenicity or pathogen metabolism.

TI  == kpsc and kpss are retaining 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo) transferases involved in synthesis of bacterial capsules.
AB  == capsular polysaccharides (cpss) are high-molecular-mass cell-surface polysaccharides, that act as important virulence factors for many pathogenic bacteria. several clinically important gram-negative pathogens share similar systems for cps biosynthesis and export; examples include escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and pasteurella multocida. each cps contains a serotype-specific repeat-unit structure, but the glycans all possess a lipid moiety at their reducing termini.  in e. coli and n. meningitidis, the predominant lipid is a lysophosphatidylglycerol moiety that is attached to the repeat-unit domain of the cps via multiple residues of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo), referred  to as a poly-kdo linker. the kdo residues are beta-linked, suggesting that they are synthesized by retaining glycosyltransferases. to date, the only characterized kdo transferases are the inverting enzymes that catalyze the alpha-linkages found in lipopolysaccharide. here, we identify two conserved proteins from cps assembly systems, kpsc and kpss, as the beta-kdo-transferases and demonstrate in vitro reconstitution of poly-kdo linker assembly on a fluorescent phosphatidylglycerol acceptor. kpss adds the first kdo residue, and this reaction product is then extended by kpsc. cross-complementation experiments demonstrate that the e. coli and n. meningitidis protein homologs are functionally conserved.

TI  == specificity of a udp-galnac pyranose-furanose mutase: a potential therapeutic target for campylobacter jejuni infections.
AB  == pyranose-furanose mutases are essential enzymes in the life cycle of a number of  microorganisms, but are absent in mammalian systems, and hence represent novel targets for drug development. to date, all such mutases show preferential recognition of a single substrate (e.g., udp-gal). we report here the detailed structural characterization of the first bifunctional pyranose-furanose mutase, which recognizes both udp-gal and udp-galnac. the enzyme under investigation (cjungm) is involved in the biosynthesis of capsular polysaccharides (cpss) in campylobacter jejuni 11168. these cpss are known virulence factors that are required for adhesion and invasion of human epithelial cells. using a combination of uv/visible spectroscopy, x-ray crystallography, saturation transfer difference nmr spectroscopy, molecular dynamics and corcema-st calculations, we have characterized the binding of the enzyme to both udp-galp and udp-galpnac, and compared these interactions with those of a homologous monofunctional mutase enzyme from e. coli (ecugm). these studies reveal that two arginines in cjungm, arg59 and arg168, play critical roles in the catalytic mechanism of the enzyme and in controlling its specificity to ultimately lead to a galfnac-containing cps. in ecugm, these arginines are replaced with histidine and lysine, respectively, and this results in an enzyme that is selective for udp-gal. we propose that these changes in amino acids allow c. jejuni 11168 to produce suitable quantities of the sugar nucleotide substrate required for the assembly of a cps containing galfnac, which is essential for viability.

TI  == relationships among hygiene indicators and enteric pathogens in irrigation water, soil and lettuce and the impact of climatic conditions on contamination in the lettuce primary production.
AB  == eight belgian lettuce farms located in the west flanders were sampled to establish the relationships between levels of indicator bacteria, detection of enteric zoonotic pathogens and the temperature and precipitation during primary production. pathogenic bacteria (pcr ehec positives, salmonella spp. or campylobacter spp.) and indicator bacteria (total psychrotrophic aerobic plate count (tpac), total coliforms, escherichia coli, enterococci) were determined over a period of one and a half year from seedling leaves, peat-soil of the seedling, lettuce crops, field soil and irrigation water. neither salmonella isolates nor pcr ehec signals were detected from lettuce although one out of 92 field soil samples contained salmonella spp. and five soil samples provided pcr positives for ehec virulence factors (vt1 or vt2 and eae gene). a low prevalence  of campylobacter (8/88) was noted in lettuce. it was shown that irrigation water  is a major risk factor with regard to the bacterial contamination of the fresh produce as the water samples showed on a regular basis e. coli presence (59.2% of samples>/=1cfu/100ml) and occasionally detection of pathogens (25%, n=30/120), in particular campylobacter spp. the highest correlations between indicator bacteria, pathogens, temperature and the amount of precipitation were observed for the water samples in contrast to the soil or lettuce samples where no correlations were observed. the high correlations between e. coli, total coliforms and enterococci in the water implicated redundancy between analyses. presence of elevated levels of e. coli increased the probability for the presence of pathogens (campylobacter spp., ehec and salmonella spp.), but had a low to moderate predictive value on the actual presence of pathogens. the presence of pathogens and indicator bacteria in the water samples showed a seasonal effect as they tend to be more present during the months with higher temperature.

AB  == a multiplexed microfluidic biosensor made of poly(methylmethacrylate) (pmma) was  integrated into an array of organic blend heterojunction photodiodes (opds) for chemiluminescent detection of pathogens. waterborne escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni and adenovirus were targeted in the pmma chip, and detection of captured pathogens was conducted by poly(2,7-carbazole)/fullerene opds which showed a responsivity over 0.20 a/w at 425 nm. the limits of chemiluminescent detection were 5 x 10(5) cells/ml for e. coli, 1 x 10(5) cells/ml for c. jejuni,  and 1 x 10(-8) mg/ml for adenovirus. parallel analysis for all three analytes in  less than 35 min was demonstrated. further recovery tests illustrated the potential of the integrated biosensor for detecting bacteria in real water samples.

TI  == emerging infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: the present review will highlight recent advances in the knowledge of emerging pathogens causing infectious colitis and provide a description of the most important food-borne outbreaks. recent findings: outbreaks of enteric disease caused by salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) continue to surprise with new epidemiological findings or changing virulence characteristics. these pathogens evolve to exploit novel opportunities for spread and transmission, such as fresh  produce within the food chain, and generate new public health challenges. organic sprouts were recently considered as the source responsible for a large german disease outbreak comprising 3842 patients. the outbreak strain was identified as  an enteroaggregative stec o104:h4 (eaggc), a rare hybrid pathogen that harbours the phage encoded shiga toxin gene and antibiotic resistance in an eaggec background. clostridium difficile pcr ribotype 078 is emerging across europe, causing severe disease outside healthcare facilities as well as disease in farm animals, indicating that the species border has been crossed. although the global impact of cryptosporidiosis is less pronounced, these organisms have been responsible for large outbreaks of infectious diarrhoea, often not reported. invasive listeriosis is a serious food-borne illness and was found recently in 28 us states affecting 147 patients, associated with eating contaminated cantaloupe. outbreaks of gastroenteritis caused by listeria monocytogenes are most likely severely underestimated. centralized surveillance of food-borne enteropathogens is essential for the early detection of disease outbreaks and for the organization of an immediate and appropriate response. summary: an improved understanding of the pathogenesis, pathology and epidemiology of emerging enteropathogens causing infectious colitis will provide new approaches for disease prevention and control.

TI  == four-year monitoring of foodborne pathogens in raw milk sold by vending machines  in italy.
AB  == prevalence data were collected from official microbiological records monitoring four selected foodborne pathogens (salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7, and campylobacter jejuni) in raw milk sold by self-service vending machines in seven italian regions (60,907 samples from 1,239 vending machines) from 2008 to 2011. data from samples analyzed by both culture-based and real-time pcr methods were collected in one region. one hundred raw milk consumers in four regions were interviewed while purchasing raw milk from vending machines. one hundred seventy-eight of 60,907 samples were positive  for one of the four foodborne pathogens investigated: 18 samples were positive for salmonella, 83 for l. monocytogenes, 24 for e. coli o157:h7, and 53 for c. jejuni in the seven regions investigated. no significant differences in prevalence were found among regions, but a significant increase in c. jejuni prevalence was observed over the years of the study. a comparison of the two analysis methods revealed that real-time pcr was 2.71 to 9.40 times more sensitive than the culture-based method. data on consumer habits revealed that some behaviors may enhance the risk of infection linked to raw milk consumption:  37% of consumers did not boil milk before consumption, 93% never used an insulated bag to transport raw milk home, and raw milk was consumed by children younger than 5 years of age. these results emphasize that end-product controls alone are not sufficient to guarantee an adequate level of consumer protection. the beta distribution of positive samples in this study and the data on raw milk  consumer habits will be useful for the development of a national quantitative risk assessment of salmonella, l. monocytogenes, e. coli o157, and c. jejuni infection associated with raw milk consumption.

AB  == etiologic studies of diarrhea are limited by uneven diagnostic methods and frequent asymptomatic detection of enteropathogens. polymerase chain reaction-based stool pathogen quantification may help distinguish clinically significant infections. we performed a nested case-control study of diarrhea in infants from a community-based birth cohort in tanzania. we tested 71 diarrheal samples and pre-diarrheal matched controls with a laboratory-developed taqman array card for 19 enteropathogens. with qualitative detection, no pathogens were  significantly associated with diarrhea. when pathogen quantity was considered, rotavirus (odds ratio [or] = 2.70 per log10 increase, p < 0.001), astrovirus (or  = 1.49, p = 0.01), and shigella/enteroinvasive escherichia coli (or = 1.47, p = 0.04) were associated with diarrhea. enterotoxigenic e. coli (0.15 sd decline in  length-for-age z score after 3 months per log10 increase, p < 0.001) and campylobacter jejuni/c. coli (0.11 sd decline, p = 0.003) in pre-diarrheal stools were associated with poor linear growth. quantitative analysis can help refine the association between enteropathogens and disease in endemic settings.

TI  == the absence of zoonotic agents in invasive bullfrogs (lithobates catesbeianus) in belgium and the netherlands.
AB  == exotic invasive bullfrogs (lithobates catesbeianus) are considered to exert a considerable negative impact on native amphibian communities. this can be due to  competition and predation, but they are also a notorious source of the infectious diseases chytridiomycosis and ranavirosis, affecting amphibian populations globally. little is known regarding their carriage of other microbial agents that might be transferred to humans or other animals. in this study we determined the  occurrence of the amphibian pathogens ranavirus and batrachochytrium dendrobatidis and of the zoonotic agents coxiella burnetii, neospora caninum, leptospira sp., toxoplasma gondii, mycoplasma sp., campylobacter sp., salmonella  sp. and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli in 164 bullfrogs from three populations in belgium and the netherlands. although b. dendrobatidis was present at a high prevalence of 63%, mean infection loads were  low with an average of 10.9 genomic equivalents (sd 35.5), confirming the role of bullfrogs as b. dendrobatidis carriers, but questioning their role as primary reservoirs for b. dendrobatidis transmission to native amphibian communities. all tested samples were negative for the other infectious agents examined. these results suggest a limited role of bullfrogs as carrier of these pathogens.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of foodborne bacteria in wild boars (sus scrofa) and wild deer (cervus nippon) in japan.
AB  == this study aimed to evaluate the role of wild boars and deer as reservoirs of foodborne bacteria. we investigated the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157 and o26, and listeria monocytogenes isolated from wild boars and deer in japan, from july through december 2010. campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. were isolated from 43.8% (95% confidence interval [ci]: 35.0-52.6) and 7.4% (95% ci: 2.8-12.1) of rectal content samples of wild boars, respectively, but not from wild deer. the most common campylobacter species was c. lanienae and c. hyointestinalis. the nine salmonella serovars isolated were s. enterica subsp. enterica serovar agona (three isolates), s. narashino (two), s. enteritidis (one), s. havana (one), s. infantis (one), and s. thompson (one). five (16%) and 6 (29%) isolates of c. lanienae and c. hyointestinalis, respectively, were resistant to enrofloxacin. stec o157 and o26 and l. monocytogenes were isolated from 2.3% (95% ci: 0-5.0), 0.8% (95% ci: 0-2.3), and  6.1% (95% ci: 1.7-10.5) of the rectal content samples of wild deer, respectively, but not from wild boars. this first nationwide survey of the prevalence of foodborne bacteria in wild boars and wild deer in japan suggests that consumption of meat from these animals is associated with the risk of causing infection with  these bacteria in humans. moreover, these animals are potential vehicles for distribution of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria into their habitat. the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of such foodborne bacteria in these wild animals should be monitored periodically.

TI  == unexpected reactivity and mechanism of carboxamide activation in bacterial n-linked protein glycosylation.
AB  == the initial glycan transfer in asparagine-linked protein glycosylation is catalysed by the integral membrane enzyme oligosaccharyltransferase (ost). here we study the mechanism of the bacterial pglb protein, a single-subunit ost, using chemically synthesized acceptor peptide analogues. we find that pglb can glycosylate not only asparagine but also glutamine, homoserine and the hydroxamate asp(nhoh), although at much lower rates. in contrast, n-methylated asparagine or 2,4-diaminobutanoic acid (dab) are not glycosylated. we find that of the various peptide analogues, only asparagine- or dab-containing peptides bind tightly to pglb. glycopeptide products are unable to bind, providing the driving force of product release. we find no suitably positioned residues near the active site of pglb that can activate the acceptor asparagine by deprotonation, making a general base mechanism unlikely and leaving carboxamide twisting as the most likely mechanistic proposal for asparagine activation.

TI  == cj1411c encodes for a cytochrome p450 involved in campylobacter jejuni 81-176 pathogenicity.
AB  == cytochrome p450s are b-heme-containing enzymes that are able to introduce oxygen  atoms into a wide variety of organic substrates. they are extremely widespread in nature having diverse functions at both biochemical and physiological level. the  genome of c. jejuni 81-176 encodes a single cytochrome p450 (cj1411c) that has no close homologues. cj1411c is unusual in its genomic location within a cluster involved in the biosynthesis of outer surface structures. here we show that e. coli expressed and affinity-purified c. jejuni cytochrome p450 is lipophilic, containing one equivalent cys-ligated heme. immunoblotting confirmed the association of cytochrome p450 with membrane fractions. a cj1411c deletion mutant had significantly reduced ability to infect human cells and was less able to survive following exposure to human serum when compared to the wild type strain.  phenotypically following staining with alcian blue, we show that a cj1411c deletion mutant produces significantly less capsular polysaccharide. this study describes the first known membrane-bound bacterial cytochrome p450 and its involvement in campylobacter virulence.

TI  == using swat, bacteroidales microbial source tracking markers, and fecal indicator  bacteria to predict waterborne pathogen occurrence in an agricultural watershed.
AB  == developing the capability to predict pathogens in surface water is important for  reducing the risk that such organisms pose to human health. in this study, three  primary data source scenarios (measured stream flow and water quality, modelled stream flow and water quality, and host-associated bacteroidales) are investigated within a classification and regression tree analysis (cart) framework for classifying pathogen (escherichia coli 0157:h7, salmonella, campylobacter, cryptosporidium, and giardia) presence and absence (p/a) for a 178 km(2) agricultural watershed. to provide modelled data, a soil water assessment tool (swat) model was developed to predict stream flow, total suspended solids (tss), total n and total p, and fecal indicator bacteria loads; however, the model was only successful for flow and total n and total p simulations, and did not accurately simulate tss and indicator bacteria transport. also, the swat model was not sensitive to an observed reduction in the cattle population within  the watershed that may have resulted in significant reduction in e. coli concentrations and salmonella detections. results show that when combined with air temperature and precipitation, swat modelled stream flow and total p concentrations were useful for classifying pathogen p/a using cart methodology. from a suite of host-associated bacteroidales markers used as independent variables in cart analysis, the ruminant marker was found to be the best initial  classifier of pathogen p/a. of the measured sources of independent variables, air temperature, precipitation, stream flow, and total p were found to be the most important variables for classifying pathogen p/a. results indicate a close relationship between cattle pollution and pathogen occurrence in this watershed,  and an especially strong link between the cattle population and salmonella detections.

AB  == over 3500 individual water samples, for 131 sampling times, targeting waterborne  pathogens/fecal indicator bacteria were collected during a 7-year period from 4 sites along an intermittent stream running through a small livestock pasture system with and without cattle access-to-stream restriction measures. the study assessed the impact of cattle pasturing/riparian zone protection on: pathogen (bacterial, viral, parasite) occurrence, concentrations of fecal indicators, and  quantitative microbial risk assessments (qmra) of the risk of cryptosporidium, giardia and escherichia coli o157:h7 infection in humans. methodologies were developed to compute qmra mean risks on the basis of water samples exhibiting potentially human infectious cryptosporidium and e. coli based on genotyping crytosporidium, and e. coli o157:h7 presence/absence information paired with enumerated e. coli. all giardia spp. were considered infectious. no significant pasturing treatment effects were observed among pathogens, with the exception of  campylobacter spp. and e. coli o157:h7. campylobacter spp. prevalence significantly decreased downstream through pasture treatments and e. coli o157:h7 was observed in a few instances in the middle of the unrestricted pasture. densities of total coliform, fecal coliform, and e. coli reduced significantly downstream in the restricted pasture system, but not in the unrestricted system.  seasonal and flow conditions were associated with greater indicator bacteria densities, especially in the summer. norovirus gii was detected at rates of 7-22% of samples for all monitoring sites, and rotavirus in 0-7% of samples for all monitoring sites; pasture treatment trends were not evident, however. seasonal and stream flow variables (and their interactions) were relatively more important than pasture treatments for initially stratifying pathogen occurrence and higher  fecal indicator bacteria densities. significant positive associations among fecal indicator bacteria and campylobacter spp. detection were observed. for qmra, adjusting for the proportion of cryptosporidium spp. detected that are infectious for humans reduces downstream risk estimates by roughly one order of magnitude. using qmra in this manner provides a more refined estimate of beneficial management practice effects on pathogen exposure risks to humans.

AB  == human milk oligosaccharides help to prevent infectious diseases in breastfed infants. larger scale testing, particularly in animal models and human clinical studies, is still limited due to shortened availability of more complex oligosaccharides. the purpose of this study was to evaluate 2'-fucosyllactose (2'-fl) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-fl) synthesized by whole-cell biocatalysis for their biological activity in vitro. therefore, we have tested these oligosaccharides for their inhibitory potential of pathogen adhesion in two different human epithelial cell lines. 2'-fl could inhibit adhesion of campylobacter jejuni, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar fyris, and pseudomonas aeruginosa to the intestinal human cell line caco-2 (reduction of 26%, 18%, 12%, and 17%, respectively), as could be shown for 3-fl (enteropathogenic e coli 29%, p aeruginosa 26%). furthermore, adherence of p aeruginosa to the human respiratory epithelial cell line a549 was significantly inhibited by 2'-fl and 3-fl (reduction of 24% and 23%, respectively). these results confirm the biological and functional activity of biotechnologically synthesized human milk oligosaccharides. mass-tailored human milk oligosaccharides could be used in the future to supplement infant formula ingredients or as preventatives to reduce the impact of infectious diseases.

TI  == characterization of the biochemical properties of campylobacter jejuni rnase iii.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a foodborne bacterial pathogen, which is now considered as a leading cause of human bacterial gastroenteritis. the information regarding  ribonucleases in c. jejuni is very scarce but there are hints that they can be instrumental in virulence mechanisms. namely, pnpase (polynucleotide phosphorylase) was shown to allow survival of c. jejuni in refrigerated conditions, to facilitate bacterial swimming, cell adhesion, colonization and invasion. in several microorganisms pnpase synthesis is auto-controlled in an rnase iii (ribonuclease iii)-dependent mechanism. thereby, we have cloned, overexpressed, purified and characterized cj-rnase iii (c. jejuni rnase iii). we  have demonstrated that cj-rnase iii is able to complement an escherichia coli rnc-deficient strain in 30s rrna processing and pnpase regulation. cj-rnase iii was shown to be active in an unexpectedly large range of conditions, and mn2+ seems to be its preferred co-factor, contrarily to what was described for other rnase iii orthologues. the results lead us to speculate that cj-rnase iii may have an important role under a mn2+-rich environment. mutational analysis strengthened the function of some residues in the catalytic mechanism of action of rnase iii, which was shown to be conserved.

TI  == geographic setting influences great lakes beach microbiological water quality.
AB  == understanding of factors that influence escherichia coli (ec) and enterococci (ent) concentrations, pathogen occurrence, and microbial sources at great lakes beaches comes largely from individual beach studies. using 12 representative beaches, we tested enrichment cultures from 273 beach water and 22 tributary samples for ec, ent, and genes indicating the bacterial pathogens shiga-toxin producing e. coli (stec), shigella spp. , salmonella spp , campylobacter jejuni/coli , and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , and 108-145 samples for bacteroides human, ruminant, and gull source-marker genes. ec/ent temporal patterns, general bacteroides concentration, and pathogen types and occurrence were regionally consistent (up to 40 km), but beach catchment variables (drains/creeks, impervious surface, urban land cover) influenced exceedances of ec/ent standards and detections of salmonella and stec. pathogen detections were more numerous when the ec/ent beach action value (but not when the geometric mean and statistical threshold value) was exceeded. ec, ent, and pathogens were not necessarily influenced by the same variables. multiple bacteroides sources, varying by date, occurred at every beach. study of multiple  beaches in different geographic settings provided new insights on the contrasting influences of regional and local variables, and a broader-scale perspective, on significance of ec/ent exceedances, bacterial sources, and pathogen occurrence.

AB  == enteric illness affects millions of individuals annually in the united states and results in >50,000 hospitalizations. the rapid and accurate identification of bacterial pathogens associated with gastroenteritis can aid acute patient management decisions, including the use of antibiotic therapy and infection control. this study compared the progastro sscs multiplex real-time pcr assay (gen-probe prodesse, san diego, ca) to culture for the identification of campylobacter spp. (campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli), salmonella spp., and shigella spp. and to broth enrichment followed by an fda-cleared enzyme immunoassay (eia) for the identification of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) isolates in stool specimens. stool samples submitted in preservatives for routine culture and eia were prospectively enrolled and tested at four clinical centers. discrepancies between the progastro sscs assay and culture or eia were resolved using bidirectional sequencing. the overall prevalence of the pathogens as detected by culture was 5.6% (1.8% campylobacter, 1.8% salmonella, 1.3% shigella, and 0.8% stec). when results based on the progastro sscs assay and bidirectional sequencing were applied, the overall prevalence increased to 8.3% (2.3% campylobacter, 2.6% salmonella, 1.8% shigella, and 1.6% stec). following resolution of the discrepant results, the sensitivity of the progastro sscs assay was 100% for all pathogens, and the specificities ranged from 99.4% to 100%. the  sensitivity of culture compared to sequence-confirmed progastro sscs results ranged from 52.9% to 76.9%, with the specificities ranging from 99.9% to 100%. overall, these results suggest that the progastro sscs assay is highly sensitive  and specific in a clinical setting.

TI  == etiology of diarrhea in bangladeshi infants in the first year of life analyzed using molecular methods.
AB  == background: diarrhea causes enormous morbidity and mortality in developing countries, yet the relative importance of multiple potential enteropathogens has  been difficult to ascertain. methods: we performed a longitudinal cohort study from birth to 1 year of age in 147 infants in dhaka, bangladesh. using multiplex  polymerase chain reaction, we analyzed 420 episodes of diarrhea and 1385 monthly  surveillance stool specimens for 32 enteropathogen gene targets. for each infant  we examined enteropathogen quantities over time to ascribe each positive target as a probable or less-likely contributor to diarrhea. results: multiple enteropathogens were detected by the first month of life. diarrhea was associated with a state of overall pathogen excess (mean number of enteropathogen gene targets (+/- se), 5.6 +/- 0.1 vs 4.3 +/- 0.1 in surveillance stool specimens; p < .05). after a longitudinal, quantitative approach was applied to filter out less-likely contributors, each diarrheal episode still had an average of 3.3 probable or dominant targets. enteroaggregative escherichia coli, campylobacter,  enteropathogenic e. coli, rotavirus, and entamoeba histolytica were the most frequent probable contributors to diarrhea. rotavirus was enriched in moderate to severe diarrheal episodes. conclusions: in this community-based study diarrhea seemed to be a multipathogen event and a state of enteropathogen excess above a high carriage baseline.

TI  == phage display-derived binders able to distinguish listeria monocytogenes from other listeria species.
AB  == the objective of this study was to produce phage display-derived binders with the ability to distinguish listeria monocytogenes from other listeria spp., which may have potential utility to enhance detection of listeria monocytogenes. to obtain  binders with the desired binding specificity a series of surface and solution phage-display biopannings were performed. initially, three rounds of surface biopanning against gamma-irradiated l. monocytogenes serovar 4b cells were performed followed by an additional surface biopanning round against l. monocytogenes 4b which included prior subtraction biopanning against gamma-irradiated l. innocua cells. in an attempt to further enhance binder specificity for l. monocytogenes 4b two rounds of solution biopanning were performed, both rounds included initial subtraction solution biopanning against l. innocua. subsequent evaluations were performed on the phage clones by phage binding elisa. all phage clones tested from the second round of solution biopanning had higher specificity for l. monocytogenes 4b than for l. innocua and three other foodborne pathogens (salmonella spp., escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni). further evaluation with five other listeria spp. revealed  that one phage clone in particular, expressing peptide griadlpplkpn, was highly specific for l. monocytogenes with at least 43-fold more binding capability to l. monocytogenes 4b than to any other listeria sp. this proof-of-principle study demonstrates how a combination of surface, solution and subtractive biopanning was used to maximise binder specificity. l. monocytogenes-specific binders were obtained which could have potential application in novel detection tests for l. monocytogenes, benefiting both the food and medical industries.

TI  == role of campylobacter jejuni infection in the pathogenesis of guillain-barre syndrome: an update.
AB  == our current knowledge on campylobacter jejuni infections in humans has progressively increased over the past few decades. infection with c. jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, sometimes surpassing other infections due to salmonella, shigella, and escherichia coli. most infections are acquired due to consumption of raw or undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, and contaminated water. after developing the diagnostic methods to detect c. jejuni, the possibility to identify the association of its infection with new diseases has been increased. after the successful isolation of c. jejuni, reports have been published citing the occurrence of gbs following c. jejuni infection. thus, c. jejuni is now considered as a major triggering agent of gbs. molecular mimicry between sialylated lipooligosaccharide structures on the cell envelope of these bacteria and ganglioside epitopes on the human nerves that generates cross-reactive immune response results in autoimmune-driven nerve damage. though  c. jejuni is associated with several pathologic forms of gbs, axonal subtypes following c. jejuni infection may be more severe. ample amount of existing data covers a large spectrum of gbs; however, the studies on c. jejuni-associated gbs  are still inconclusive. therefore, this review provides an update on the c. jejuni infections engaged in the pathogenesis of gbs.

AB  == wildlife is increasingly abundant in urban environments, but little is known about the zoonotic pathogens carried by these populations. urban wild boars are of particular concern because this species is well-known as a pathogen reservoir, and thus, we studied selected zoonotic pathogens in urban wild boars in barcelona, spain (n=41). salmonella enterica was found in 5.00% (95% ci 0.61-16.91) and campylobacter coli in 4.88% (95% ci 0.6-16.53) of the animals. e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni were not found. other thermophilic campylobacter were  moderately prevalent (19.51%, 95% ci 8.82-34.87). additionally, we screened for antimicrobial resistance in indicator bacteria: resistance was most frequent in enterococcus faecium (95% of the isolates were resistant to at least one antimicrobial agent), followed by enterococcus faecalis (50%) and escherichia coli (10%). for the first time resistance to linezolid in bacteria carried by wildlife is reported. these findings pose a concern for public health, and thus,  further research is needed on wildlife in urban environments.

TI  == microbial quality and bacteria pathogens in private wells used for drinking water in northeastern ohio.
AB  == in agricultural intensive areas, drinking contaminated water from private wells is considered an important cause of acute gastroenteric illnesses (agi), particularly among high-risk populations. in the summer of 2009, the microbial water quality of 180 randomly selected private wells in two northeastern ohio counties, a region with a high concentration of dairy farms, was assessed. forty-five percent (82/180) of water samples were contaminated with total coliforms. generic escherichia coli were present in 9% (16/180) of samples. using real-time polymerase chain reaction, e. coli o157:h7 was identified in 4% (7/180) of specimens. campylobacter spp. dna could not be amplified from 70 of the samples tested for this organism. the frequency of generic e. coli contamination  varied among townships (p < 0.001). well structure (i.e. age and depth) or other  common measures of pollution potential (depth of water, hydrology, topography, net recharge soil media) was not correlated with coliforms and e. coli contamination. importantly, the presence of the pathogen e. coli o157:h7 was not  associated with the presence of fecal indicators in the water samples: only one of the seven e. coli o157-positive samples was also positive for generic e. coli. appropriate risk management and communication processes are needed to reduce the  potential waterborne disease outbreaks in agricultural intensive areas.

AB  == background: diarrhea is one of the most commonly occurring diseases. aim: this article gives a review of the current state of the treatment of acute infectious  diarrhea (part 1) and chronic infectious diarrhea (part 2) as well as of the most important pathogens. material and methods: following a presentation of the general principles of the therapy of diarrhea, the targeted antimicrobial therapy of the most important bacterial gastrointestinal infections is described. this includes salmonellosis, shigellosis and campylobacter infections, infections with pathogenic escherichia coli strains, yersiniosis and cholera. due to the increasing incidence and changes in the severity of the disease and important new aspects in the treatment of diarrhea caused by toxigenic clostridium difficile strains, these disease entities will be described in detail. results: symptomatic therapy is still the most important aspect of the treatment of infectious diarrhea. for severely ill patients with a high frequency of stools (> 8/day), immunodeficiency, advanced age or significant comorbidities, empirical antibiotic therapy should be considered. increasing resistance, in particular against fluoroquinolones must also be taken into consideration. due to the risk of excessive pathogen proliferation and concomitant intestinal toxin production with protracted or multiple complications during the disease, therapy with motility inhibitors is not recommended. with respect to the treatment of clostridium difficile infections a promising novel aspect arose in 2012. the macrocyclic antibiotic fidaxomycin can reduce the rate of recurrent disease with the same effectiveness as vancomycin. furthermore, evidence for the benefits of allogenic  stool transplantation is increasing. conclusion: the treatment of acute diarrhea  is still primarily supportive. the benefits of general empirical antibiotic therapy for acute diarrhea are not evidence-based.

TI  == landscape and seasonal factors influence salmonella and campylobacter prevalence  in a rural mixed use watershed.
AB  == salmonella and campylobacter prevalence in stream networks of the satilla river basin (srb) were monitored monthly from august 2007 to august 2009 to study relationships between these pathogens and land use, presence of poultry houses and wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) discharge. salmonella and campylobacter were detected at all 10 stream sites and the three sites at the sole wastewater treatment plant (wwtp) in the study area. in all, 43% (129/299) and 62% (96/156)  of samples were positive for salmonella and campylobacter, respectively, with detection frequency increasing in downstream sites with more poultry production and influence of wwtp discharge. both salmonella and campylobacter detection frequencies were positively associated with the number of poultry houses in the subwatersheds, but agricultural land use as a proportion of the watershed was not a significant predictor of either pathogen. fecal indicator bacterial levels were assessed and evaluated for their ability to predict the presence of pathogens. of those examined, enterococci was most predictive; of the 129 samples positive for  salmonella, 88% (113/129) were detected when enterococci were above epa single sample threshold (61 cfu 100 ml(-1)); and of the 96 samples positive for campylobacter, 90% (86/96) were detected when enterococci levels exceeded this level. comparatively, escherichia coli concentrations were above epa single sample thresholds in 38% (49/129) of the positive salmonella samples. detection of the pathogens throughout the watershed indicated that there was potential for  waterborne transmission especially in downstream areas that were more likely to have recreational users.

TI  == community-acquired infectious diarrhoea in children under 5 years of age in dakar, senegal.
AB  == background: in sub-saharan africa, infectious diarrhoea is a major cause of childhood morbidity and mortality. a cross-sectional study was undertaken to document the pathogens potentially involved in community-acquired childhood diarrhoea in dakar, the capital of senegal. methods: between september 2007 and march 2008, 176 children aged 1 month to 5 years were recruited consecutively from a primary health care institution in an urban area. clinical data were recorded and stool samples were collected. bacterial pathogens were identified using conventional methods and/or pcr assays. rotaviruses and adenoviruses were detected by a rapid immunochromatographic test. intestinal parasites were diagnosed by microscopy. results: rotavirus was the most common enteric pathogen, detected in 27% of patients, followed by shigella (12%), diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli (8%), enteric adenovirus (8%), salmonella (4%), campylobacter jejuni (3%) and plesiomonas shigelloides (2%). mixed bacterial/viral infections were detected in 6% of cases. parasites, mostly protozoa, were detected in 14% of children. using ipah pcr, 30% of samples were positive for shigella/entero-invasive e. coli. detection of rotavirus was more frequently associated with younger age groups (<24 months), whereas bacterial diarrhoea was  isolated more often in children over 1 year of age. detection of bacterial pathogens was significantly associated with malnutrition. antibiotics were prescribed for 77% of children who attended for consultation. no pathogen was found in 36% of them, whereas a virus was detected without any other associated bacterial or parasitic pathogen in 23% of patients. conclusion: in developing countries, there is a need to develop reliable, easy-to-use, inexpensive rapid diagnostic tests to guide the management of diarrhoea in infants and children and thereby prevent over-use of antimicrobial agents.

TI  == development of a magnetic nanoparticles microarray for simultaneous and simple detection of foodborne pathogens.
AB  == foodborne diseases are a widespread and growing public health problem affecting both developed and developing countries, microbiologically contaminated food and  water are the major causes of diarrhoeal diseases. methods based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and microarrays are rapid and sensitive enough to detect very small quantities of microorganisms, however, the requirement for expensive equipments limits their application. in the present paper, we describe a method based on multiplex pcr and magnetic nanoparticles labelling for simultaneous detection of four major foodborne pathogens, including escherichia coli o157:h7,  salmonella enterica, vibrio cholera and campylobacter jejuni. the process utilizes an oligonucleotide array onto which 5' biotinylated single strand pcr products were hybridized and visualized with streptavidin-coated magnetic nanoparticles (sa-mnps), the signal from which could be detected by the naked eye, microscope or ccd camera. by employing sa-mnps as visible labels, the microarray unambiguously distinguished all 4 pathogens with detection sensitivity up to 316 cfu/ml. due to its high sensitivity, specificity and simple detection procedure, the magnetic bead assay provides a powerful tool for the detection and identification of foodborne pathogens in a modestly equipped laboratory.

AB  == the intussusception (iia) is an invagination of the immediate part of the intestine. she is responsible for a syndrome with an occlusive venous compression and swelling that can rapidly progress to intestinal necrosis. most cases occur in children aged 6 to 18 months and occur more frequently in boys than girls. there are two types of iia: the iia idiopathic representing 90-95% of invaginations of the child and the iia secondary to local injury of the gastrointestinal tract or occurring in a particular context whose frequency are between 5 and 10%. the pathogenesis of the iia remains uncertain, but the infectious origin is criminalized in most idiopathic invaginations. this component is dominated by viral agents including adenovirus, rotavirus, enterovirus, human herpesvirus 6 and 7, cytomegalovirus and epstein-barrvirus. bacterial agents are rather found and include yersinia enterocolitica, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o157, h7, salmonella and campylobacter. in a small proportion parasitic agents may be reported in the iia, the most frequently found are entamoeba histolytica, trichuris trichuira, ascaris lumbricoides, ankylostoma and giardia.

AB  == reducing escherichia coli o157:h7 in livestock manures before application to cropland is critical for reducing the risk of foodborne illness associated with produce. our objective was to determine the fate of naturally occurring e. coli o157:h7 and other pathogens during minimally managed on-farm bovine manure composting processes. feedlot pen samples were screened to identify e. coli o157:h7-positive manure. using this manure, four piles of each of three different composting formats were constructed in each of two replicate trials. composting formats were (i) turned piles of manure plus hay and straw, (ii) static stockpiles of manure, and (iii) static piles of covered manure plus hay and straw. temperatures in the tops, toes, and centers of the conical piles (ca. 6.0  m(3) each) were monitored. compost piles that were turned every 2 weeks achieved  higher temperatures for longer periods in the tops and centers than did piles that were left static. e. coli o157:h7 was not recovered from top samples of turned piles of manure plus hay and straw at day 28 and beyond, but top samples from static piles were positive for the pathogen up to day 42 (static manure stockpiles) and day 56 (static covered piles of manure plus hay and straw). salmonella, campylobacter spp., and listeria monocytogenes were not found in top  or toe samples at the end of the composting period, but e. coli o157:h7 and listeria spp. were recovered from toe samples at day 84. our findings indicate that some minimally managed composting processes can reduce e. coli o157:h7 and other pathogens in bovine manure but may be affected by season and/or initial levels of indigenous thermophilic bacteria. our results also highlight the importance of adequate c:n formulation of initial mixtures for the production of  high temperatures and rapid composting, and the need for periodic turning of the  piles to increase the likelihood that all parts of the mass are subjected to high temperatures.

TI  == engineered genetic selection links in vivo protein folding and stability with asparagine-linked glycosylation.
AB  == predicting the structural consequences of site-specific glycosylation remains a major challenge due in part to the lack of convenient experimental tools for rapidly determining how glycosylation influences protein folding. to address this shortcoming, we developed a genetic selection that directly links the in vivo folding of asparagine-linked (n-linked) glycoproteins with antibiotic resistance. using this assay, we identified three known or putative glycoproteins from campylobacter jejuni (peb3, cjaa, and cj0610c) whose folding was significantly affected by n-glycosylation. we also used the genetic selection to isolate a glycoengineered variant of the escherichia coli colicin e7 immunity protein (im7) whose intracellular folding and stability were enhanced as a result of n-glycosylation. in addition to monitoring the effect of glycan attachment on protein folding in living cells, this strategy could easily be extended for optimizing protein folding in vivo and engineering glycosylation enzymes, pathways, and hosts for optimal performance.

TI  == impact of 6 different intestinal bacteria on broiler breeder sperm motility in vitro.
AB  == male fertility is often evaluated by measuring sperm parameters, including concentration, viability, and motility. this is important because after copulation occurs, sperm must overcome many barriers in the female reproductive tract to fertilize the ovum. in mammalian species, sperm have been shown to have  reduced motility when bacteria are present. in male broiler breeders, bacteria have been associated with spermatozoa, but their effect on motility has not been  investigated. the sperm quality index is a modern rapid method of evaluating avian sperm motility. therefore, the objective of this study was to use the sperm quality index to determine if broiler breeder sperm motility is reduced when semen is exposed to various bacteria. in this experiment, semen was collected from 20 broiler breeders to obtain a pooled neat semen sample. six different intestinal bacteria, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium bifermentans, lactobacillus acidophilus, and bifidobacterium animalis were cultured overnight. for each bacterium, 50 microl of semen was diluted in 450 microl of saline, sterile broth, or the overnight culture, creating 3 treatments. the experiment was repeated twice. in each treatment, 3 replicates were evaluated at 0 and 10 min postinoculation, creating a completely randomized  design with a split plot over time. also, the ph was measured for each treatment  at 0 and 10 min. the results indicated that all broths containing bacteria immediately reduced broiler breeder sperm motility when compared with the controls (p < 0.0001), but broths containing bifidobacterium or lactobacillus virtually made sperm immotile. although broth containing salmonella, campylobacter, and bifidobacterium immediately reduced sperm motility, the reduction did not change over time. broths containing e. coli, clostridium, and lactobacillus reduced sperm motility immediately, but over time motility continued to decrease. however, ph was increased when semen was exposed to the e. coli and campylobacter treatment, but when semen was exposed to bifidobacterium and lactobacillus treatments, ph was reduced. in conclusion, the results indicate that bacteria can reduce broiler breeder sperm motility upon exposure.

AB  == chromosome dimers, which form during the bacterial life cycle, represent a problem that must be solved by the bacterial cell machinery so that chromosome segregation can occur effectively. the xer/dif site-specific recombination system, utilized by most bacteria, resolves chromosome dimers into monomers using two tyrosine recombinases, xerc and xerd, to perform the recombination reaction at the dif site which consists of 28-30 bp. however, single xer recombinase systems have been recently discovered in several bacterial species. in streptococci and lactococci a single recombinase, xers, is capable of completing  the monomerisation reaction by acting at an atypical dif site called dif sl (31 bp). it was recently shown that a subgroup of epsilon-proteobacteria including campylobacter spp. and helicobacter spp. had a phylogenetically distinct xer/dif  recombination system with only one recombinase (xerh) and an atypical dif motif (difh). in order to biochemically characterize this system in greater detail, campylobacter jejuni xerh was purified and its dna-binding activity was characterized. the protein showed specific binding to the complete difh site and  to both halves separately. it was also shown to form covalent complexes with difh suicide substrates. in addition, xerh was able to catalyse recombination between  two difh sites located on a plasmid in escherichia coli in vivo. this indicates that this xerh protein performs a similar function as the related xers protein, but shows significantly different binding characteristics.

TI  == evaluation of luminex xtag gastrointestinal pathogen analyte-specific reagents for high-throughput, simultaneous detection of bacteria, viruses, and parasites of clinical and public health importance.
AB  == acute diarrheal disease (add) can be caused by a range of pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, and parasites. conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, microscopy, biochemical assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (elisa), are laborious and time-consuming and lack sensitivity. combined, the array of tests performed on a single specimen can increase the turnaround time (tat) significantly. we validated a 19plex laboratory-developed gastrointestinal  pathogen panel (gpp) using luminex xtag analyte-specific reagents (asrs) to simultaneously screen directly in fecal specimens for diarrhea-causing pathogens, including bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., shigella spp., enterotoxigenic escherichia coli [etec], shiga toxin-producing e. coli [stec], e. coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, and toxigenic clostridium difficile), parasites (giardia lamblia, cryptosporidium spp., and entamoeba histolytica), and viruses (norovirus gi and gii, adenovirus 40/41, and rotavirus  a). performance characteristics of gpp asrs were determined using 48 reference isolates and 254 clinical specimens. stool specimens from individuals with diarrhea were tested for pathogens using conventional and molecular methods. using the predictive methods as standards, the sensitivities of the gpp asrs were 100% for adenovirus 40/41, norovirus, rotavirus a, vibrio cholerae, yersinia enterocolitica, entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidium spp., and e. coli o157:h7; 95% for giardia lamblia; 94% for etec and stec; 93% for shigella spp.; 92% for salmonella spp.; 91% for c. difficile a/b toxins; and 90% for campylobacter jejuni. the overall comparative performance of the gpp asrs with conventional methods in clinical samples was 94.5% (range, 90% to 97%), with 99% (99.0% to 99.9%) specificity. implementation of the gpp asrs enables our public health laboratory to offer highly sensitive and specific screening and identification of the major add-causing pathogens.

TI  == dynamics of the cag-type iv secretion system of helicobacter pylori as studied by bacterial co-infections.
AB  == many pathogenic gram-negative bacteria possess type iv secretion systems (t4ss) to inject effector proteins directly into host cells to modulate cellular processes to their benefit. the human bacterial pathogen helicobacter pylori, a major aetiological agent in the development of chronic gastritis, duodenal ulcer  and gastric carcinoma, harbours the cag-t4ss to inject the cytotoxin associated antigen (caga) into gastric epithelial cells. this results in deregulation of major signalling cascades, actin-cytoskeletal rearrangements and eventually gastric cancer. we show here that a pre-infection with live h. pylori has a dose-dependent negative effect on the caga translocation efficiency of a later infecting strain. this effect of the 'first' strain was independent of any of its t4ss, the vacuolating cytotoxin (vaca) or flagella. other bacterial pathogens, e.g. pathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, or commensal bacteria, such as lactobacilli, were unable to interfere with h. pylori's caga translocation capacity in the same way. this interference was independent of the beta1 integrin receptor availability for h. pylori, but certain h. pylori outer membrane proteins, such as hopi, hopq or alpab, were essential for the effect. we suggest that the specific interference mechanism induced by h. pylori represents a cellular response to restrict and control caga  translocation into a host cell to control the cellular damage.

TI  == occurrence of waterborne pathogens and escherichia coli at offshore drinking water intakes in lake ontario.
AB  == the occurrence of waterborne pathogens was investigated at three drinking water intakes located about 2 km offshore in lake ontario. water sampling was conducted over 3 years for campylobacter spp., cryptosporidium spp., giardia spp., cultivable enteric viruses, and water quality parameters. all pathogens were detected in the offshore source water for each water treatment plant (wtp1 to wtp3), although at relatively low frequencies and concentrations. giardia was the most common pathogen, occurring in 36% of water samples from the influent of wtp1 (n = 46), and with a maximum concentration of 0.70 cysts/liter in this influent.  cryptosporidium occurred as frequently as 15% in the wtp2 influent (n = 35), with a maximum concentration of 0.40 oocysts/liter in the wtp1 influent. the human bacteroidales hf183 dna marker was most common in the wtp1 influent (19%), and this was the only wtp where the cryptosporidium hominis genotype was detected. no water quality parameter was predictive of pathogen occurrence across all three wtp influents. escherichia coli was often below detection when pathogens were detected, and spikes in e. coli concentrations often did not coincide with pathogen occurrence. after summer rain events, river plumes had e. coli concentrations as high as 222 cfu/100 ml in surface waters 2 km offshore, without impacting drinking water intakes below the thermocline on the lake bottom. at times, prechlorination to control mussels at offshore intake cribs compromised the use of e. coli for "raw" water quality assessment, particularly for chlorine-resistant cryptosporidium. e. coli measured by standard methods did not  reliably predict pathogen occurrence at drinking water intakes in offshore ecosystems.

TI  == escherichia coli contamination of lettuce grown in soils amended with animal slurry.
AB  == a pilot study was conducted to assess the transfer of escherichia coli from animal slurry fertilizer to lettuce, with e. coli serving as an indicator of fecal contamination and as an indicator for potential bacterial enteric pathogens. animal slurry was applied as fertilizer to three danish agricultural fields prior to the planting of lettuce seedlings. at harvest, leaves (25 g) of 10 lettuce heads were pooled into one sample unit (n = 147). soil samples (100 g) were collected from one field before slurry application and four times during the growth period (n = 75). e. coli was enumerated in slurry, soil, and lettuce on 3m petrifilm select e. coli count plates containing 16 mg/liter streptomycin, 16 mg/liter ampicillin, or no antimicrobial agent. selected e. coli isolates (n = 83) originating from the slurry, soil, and lettuce were genotyped by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) to determine the similarity of isolates. the slurry applied to the fields contained 3.0 to 4.5 log cfu/g e. coli. e. coli was found in 36 to 54% of the lettuce samples, streptomycin-resistant e. coli was found in  10.0 to 18.0% of the lettuce samples, and ampicillin-resistant e. coli in 0 to 2.0% of the lettuce samples (the detection limit was 1 log cfu/g). the concentration of e. coli exceeded 2 log cfu/g in 19.0% of the lettuce samples. no e. coli was detected in the soil before the slurry was applied, but after, e. coli was present until the last sampling day (harvest), when 10 of 15 soil samples contained e. coli. a relatively higher frequency of e. coli in lettuce compared with the soil samples at harvest suggests environmental sources of fecal contamination, e.g., wildlife. the higher frequency was supported by the finding  of 21 different pfge types among the e. coli isolates, with only a few common pfge types between slurry, soil, and lettuce. the frequent finding of fecal-contaminated lettuce indicates that human pathogens such as salmonella and  campylobacter can be present and represent food safety hazards.

TI  == short communication: survey of animal-borne pathogens in the farm environment of  13 dairy operations.
AB  == a survey was conducted on 13 dairies to determine the occurrence of 5 animal-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, and cryptosporidium parvum) and their distributions across farm elements (feces, bedding, milk filters, stored manure, field soil, and stream water). presence of  c. parvum was measured only in feces and stored manure. all but one farm were positive for at least one pathogen species, and 5 farms were positive for 3 species. escherichia coli o157:h7 was detected on 6 farms and in all farm elements, including milk filters. mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was detected on 10 of 13 farms and in all farm elements except for milk filters. salmonella enterica and c. jejuni were detected at lower frequencies and were not identified in soil, stream water, or milk filters on any of the 13 farms. cryptosporidium parvum was detected in feces but not in stored manure. stored manure had the highest occurrence of pathogens (73%), followed by feces (50%), milk filters, bedding, soil, and water (range from 23 to 31%). association of pathogen presence with farm management factors was examined by t-test; however, the small number of study farms and samples may limit the scope of inference of the associations. pathogens had a higher prevalence in maternity pen bedding than in calf bedding, but total pathogen occurrence did not differ in calf compared with lactating cow feces or in soils with or without manure incorporation. herd size and animal density did not appear to have a consistent effect on pathogen occurrence. the extent of pathogen prevalence and distribution on the farms indicates considerable public health risks associated with not only milk and meat consumption and direct animal contact, but also potential dissemination of the pathogens into the agroecosystem.

TI  == the complex microbiota of raw milk.
AB  == here, we review what is known about the microorganisms present in raw milk, including milk from cows, sheep, goats and humans. milk, due to its high nutritional content, can support a rich microbiota. these microorganisms enter milk from a variety of sources and, once in milk, can play a number of roles, such as facilitating dairy fermentations (e.g. lactococcus, lactobacillus, streptococcus, propionibacterium and fungal populations), causing spoilage (e.g.  pseudomonas, clostridium, bacillus and other spore-forming or thermoduric microorganisms), promoting health (e.g. lactobacilli and bifidobacteria) or causing disease (e.g. listeria, salmonella, escherichia coli, campylobacter and mycotoxin-producing fungi). there is also concern that the presence of antibiotic residues in milk leads to the development of resistance, particularly among pathogenic bacteria. here, we comprehensively review these topics, while comparing the approaches, both culture-dependent and culture-independent, which can be taken to investigate the microbial composition of milk.

TI  == potential of a commercially available water acidification product for reducing campylobacter in broilers prior to slaughter.
AB  == 1. this study investigated the potential of a commercially available acidified water treatment (pwt) for reducing the number of campylobacter in vitro and other bacteria in the gut of live broilers. 2. in vitro tests indicated that pwt was highly effective for reducing campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli at the  recommended concentration in water, reducing populations by greater than 7 log10  cfu/ml after 24 h exposure. the decrease in the number of salmonella serovar enteritidis and escherichia coli was not significant. 3. addition of pwt to the broiler drinking water for the first 7 d, 2 d before and 2 d after each feed change and at feed withdrawal prior to slaughter or only after feed withdrawal had no effect on the number of campylobacter in caecal samples on farm before thinning and depopulation compared to untreated controls. 4. although pwt was effective for reducing campylobacter in water, the results suggest that it does not reduce the number of campylobacter in the caeca of broilers prior to slaughter under the conditions used in the study.

TI  == nitric oxide reactivities of the two globins of the foodborne pathogen campylobacter jejuni: roles in protection from nitrosative stress and analysis of potential reductants.
AB  == background: during infection and pathogenesis, campylobacter, the leading cause of gastroenteritis, encounters no and reactive nitrogen species (rns) derived from the host. to combat these species, campylobacter jejuni expresses two haemoglobins: the single domain haemoglobin (cgb) detoxifies no but the role of the truncated globin (ctb) is unclear. confirmation of cgb activity and more extensive exploration of ctb function(s) in vivo are restricted due to difficulties in expressing proteins in campylobacter and our lack of understanding of how the globin haems are re-reduced after ligand reactions. methods: the cgb and ctb genes were cloned under the control of arabinose-inducible promoters and the globins expressed in an escherichia coli mutant lacking the main no detoxification mechanisms (hmp and the nor system comprising the transcription regulator norr, the flavorubredoxin and its reductase (norvw)); cellular responses under oxidative and nitrosative stress conditions were assessed. spectroscopic changes of the cgb and ctb haems in soluble fractions after oxidation by no were evaluated. construction of e. coli nor mutants and a ubiquinone-defective strain allowed the exploration of the flavorubredoxin reductase and the aerobic respiratory chain as candidates for cgb electron donors in e. coli mutants. results: cgb, but not ctb, complements the no- and rns-sensitive phenotype of an e. coli hmp mutant in aerobic conditions; however, cgb fails to protect an hmp norr mutant in the absence of oxygen. reduction of cgb and ctb in e. coli and c. jejuni soluble extracts and turnover after no oxidation is demonstrated. finally, we report a minor role for norw as a cgb reductase partner in e. coli but no role for respiratory electron flux in globin redox cycling. conclusions: the no detoxification capacity of cgb is confirmed by heterologous expression in e. coli. the reducibility of cgb and ctb  in e. coli and c. jejuni extracts and the lack of dependence of reduction upon flavorubredoxin reductase and the respiratory chain in e. coli argue in favor of  a non-specific reductase system. general significance: we present the most persuasive evidence to date that cgb, but not ctb, confers tolerance to no and rns by reaction with no. since certain hypotheses for the mechanism of haem re-reduction in e. coli following the reaction with no are not proven, the mechanisms of reduction in c. jejuni now require challenging experimental evaluation.

TI  == improved detection of bacterial pathogens in patients presenting with gastroenteritis by use of the entericbio real-time gastro panel i assay.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the use of entericbio real-time gastro panel i (serosep, limerick, ireland) for routine use in a clinical microbiology laboratory for simultaneous detection of campylobacter jejuni, coli, and lari, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), salmonella spp., and shigella spp. in feces. this system differs from its predecessor (the entericbio panel ii system, serosep) in that it allows real-time detection of pathogens directly from feces, without pre-enrichment. it also specifically detects campylobacter jejuni, coli, and lari rather than all campylobacter species, as is the case with the previous system. a total of 528 samples from patients presenting with acute gastroenteritis were screened prospectively with this assay, and results were compared with those of the current method, which combines screening the samples with a molecular assay (the entericbio panel ii assay) and retrospective culture  of the specimens in which the target was detected. discrepancy analysis was conducted using culture and molecular methods. the real-time assay produced 84 positive results, specifically, campylobacter spp. (n=44); stx1 and/or stx2 (n=35); shigella spp. (n=3); and salmonella spp. (n=6). of these, 4 samples represented coinfections with campylobacter spp. and stec. the real-time assay showed an increased detection rate for pathogens, apart from salmonella spp. four campylobacter-positive and 6 stx-positive results remained unconfirmed by any other method used. the isolation rates for pcr-positive samples were as follows:  campylobacter spp., 80%; stec, 45.7%; salmonella spp., 100%; and shigella spp., 66.7%. the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and efficiency were 100%, 97.8%, 88.1%, 100%, and 98.1%, respectively.

TI  == production and evaluation of chicken egg-yolk-derived antibodies against campylobacter jejuni colonization-associated proteins.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is one of the most important causes of foodborne gastroenteritis. chickens are considered a reservoir host of c. jejuni, and epidemiological studies have shown that contaminated chicken meat is a primary source of human infection. the objective of this study was to produce chicken egg-yolk-derived antibody (igy) against the five c. jejuni colonization-associated proteins or caps (cadf, flaa, momp, flpa, and cmec). recombinant c. jejuni caps were expressed in escherichia coli and were purified by affinity chromatography. specific-pathogen-free laying hens were hyperimmunized with each recombinant cap to induce production of alpha-cap-specific igy. egg yolks were collected from immunized and nonimmunized  hens and were lyophilized to obtain egg-yolk powder (eyp) with or without alpha-c. jejuni cap-specific igy. igy was purified from eyp, and the antibody response in serum and egg yolk was tested by indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the alpha-c. jejuni cap-specific igy levels were significantly (p<0.05) higher in both serum and eyp obtained from immunized hens as compared with the nonimmunized hens. each alpha-c. jejuni cap-specific igy reacted with the c. jejuni cells and recombinant caps as detected by immunofluorescence microscopy and western blot assays, respectively. we also show that alpha-cadf, alpha-momp,  and alpha-cmec igy significantly reduced adherence of c. jejuni to the chicken hepatocellular carcinoma (lmh) cells, suggesting that these alpha-c. jejuni cap-specific igy may be useful as a passive immunotherapeutic to reduce c. jejuni colonization in chickens.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni carbon starvation protein a (csta) is involved in peptide utilization, motility and agglutination, and has a role in stimulation of dendritic cells.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the most frequent cause of severe gastroenteritis in the  developed world. the major symptom of campylobacteriosis is inflammatory diarrhoea. the molecular mechanisms of this infection are poorly understood compared to those of less frequent disease-causing pathogens. in a previous study, we identified c. jejuni proteins that antibodies in human campylobacteriosis patients reacted with. one of the immunogenic proteins identified (cj0917) displays homology to carbon starvation protein a (csta) from  escherichia coli, where this protein is involved in the starvation response and peptide uptake. in contrast to many bacteria, c. jejuni relies on amino acids and organic acids for energy, but in vivo it is highly likely that peptides are also  utilized, although their mechanisms of uptake are unknown. in this study, biolog  phenotype microarrays have been used to show that a deltacsta mutant has a reduced ability to utilize a number of di- and tri-peptides as nitrogen sources.  this phenotype was restored through genetic complementation, suggesting csta is a peptide uptake system in c. jejuni. furthermore, the deltacsta mutant also displayed reduced motility and reduced agglutination compared to wt bacteria; these phenotypes were also restored through complementation. murine dendritic cells exposed to uv-killed bacteria showed a reduced il-12 production, but the same il-10 response when encountering c. jejuni deltacsta compared to the wt strain. the greater th1 stimulation elicited by the wt as compared to deltacsta mutant cells indicates an altered antigenic presentation on the surface, and thus an altered recognition of the mutant. thus, we conclude that c. jejuni csta is important not only for peptide utilization, but also it may influence host-pathogen interactions.

AB  == background: diarrhoeal diseases cause illness and death among children younger than 5 years in low-income countries. we designed the global enteric multicenter  study (gems) to identify the aetiology and population-based burden of paediatric  diarrhoeal disease in sub-saharan africa and south asia. methods: the gems is a 3-year, prospective, age-stratified, matched case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea in children aged 0-59 months residing in censused populations at four sites in africa and three in asia. we recruited children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea seeking care at health centres along with one to three randomly selected matched community control children without diarrhoea. from patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and controls, we obtained clinical and epidemiological data, anthropometric measurements, and a faecal sample to identify enteropathogens at enrolment; one follow-up home visit was made about 60 days later to ascertain vital status, clinical outcome, and interval growth. findings: we enrolled 9439 children with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and 13,129 control children without diarrhoea. by analysing adjusted population attributable fractions, most attributable cases of moderate-to-severe  diarrhoea were due to four pathogens: rotavirus, cryptosporidium, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli producing heat-stable toxin (st-etec; with or without co-expression of heat-labile enterotoxin), and shigella. other pathogens were important in selected sites (eg, aeromonas, vibrio cholerae o1, campylobacter jejuni). odds of dying during follow-up were 8.5-fold higher in patients with moderate-to-severe diarrhoea than in controls (odd ratio 8.5, 95% ci 5.8-12.5, p<0.0001); most deaths (167 [87.9%]) occurred during the first 2 years of life. pathogens associated with increased risk of case death were st-etec (hazard ratio [hr] 1.9; 0.99-3.5) and typical enteropathogenic e coli (hr 2.6; 1.6-4.1) in infants aged 0-11 months, and cryptosporidium (hr 2.3; 1.3-4.3) in toddlers aged  12-23 months. interpretation: interventions targeting five pathogens (rotavirus,  shigella, st-etec, cryptosporidium, typical enteropathogenic e coli) can substantially reduce the burden of moderate-to-severe diarrhoea. new methods and  accelerated implementation of existing interventions (rotavirus vaccine and zinc) are needed to prevent disease and improve outcomes. funding: the bill & melinda gates foundation.

TI  == immunity to bacterial infection in the chicken.
AB  == bacterial infections remain important to the poultry industry both in terms of animal and public health, the latter due to the importance of poultry as a source of foodborne bacterial zoonoses such as salmonella and campylobacter. as such, much focus of research to the immune response to bacterial infection has been to  salmonella. in this review we will focus on how research on avian salmonellosis has developed our understanding of immunity to bacteria in the chicken from understanding the role of tlrs in recognition of bacterial pathogens, through the role of heterophils, macrophages and gammadelta lymphocytes in innate immunity and activation of adaptive responses to the role of cellular and humoral immunity in immune clearance and protection. what is known of the immune response to other bacterial infections and in particular infections that have emerged recently as major problems in poultry production including campylobacter jejuni, avian pathogenic escherichia coli, ornithobacterium rhinotracheale and clostridium perfringens are discussed.

TI  == a quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay for rapid detection of 9 pathogens directly from stools of travelers with diarrhea.
AB  == background & aims: every year, 80 million tourists traveling to tropical and subtropical areas contract traveler's diarrhea (td). forty percent to 80% of cases are caused by bacteria, yet clinical diagnostic tests are available to identify only a few of the strains that cause td. we aimed to develop a quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) assay to identify all major pathogens in stool samples. methods: we developed a low-cost, high-throughput, multiplex qpcr assay for simultaneous detection of 9 bacterial pathogens in stool samples: salmonella, yersinia, campylobacter, and vibrio cholerae, as well as shigella or enteroinvasive escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic e coli, enterotoxigenic e coli (etec), enteroaggregative e coli (eaec), and enteropathogenic e coli (epec). the assay was validated using positive (n = 245)  and negative (n = 243) control strains, as well as preselected positive and negative stool samples. in addition, stool samples were collected from 96 returning travelers with td. the findings were compared with those from routine diagnostic tests. results: the assay detected the bacterial strains with 100% sensitivity and specificity, compared with results from the reference tests. of all stool samples collected from travelers with td, epec was found in 47%, eaec in 46%, etec in 22%, enterohemorrhagic e coli in 7%, campylobacter in 6%, shigella or enteroinvasive e coli in 2%, and salmonella in 2%. multiple pathogens were found in 37% of all samples. conclusions: we developed a low-cost, high-throughput qpcr assay for use in routine diagnostic analysis and research. it detects the pathogenic bacteria most commonly associated with td in stool samples with 100% sensitivity and specificity, compared with reference methods. the assay requires 4 hours, whereas current detection methods require 1 to 7 days. at least 1 td pathogen was identified in stool samples from 76% of returning travelers, whereas conventional methods found a pathogen in only 17%. the most commonly detected bacteria were epec, eaec, and etec.

TI  == using campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli data and bayesian microbial risk assessment to examine public health risks in agricultural watersheds under tile drainage management.
AB  == human campylobacteriosis is the leading bacterial gastrointestinal illness in canada; environmental transmission has been implicated in addition to transmission via consumption of contaminated food. information about campylobacter spp. occurrence at the watershed scale will enhance our understanding of the associated public health risks and the efficacy of source water protection strategies. the overriding purpose of this study is to provide a quantitative framework to assess and compare the relative public health significance of watershed microbial water quality associated with agricultural bmps. a microbial monitoring program was expanded from fecal indicator analyses and campylobacter spp. presence/absence tests to the development of a novel, 11-tube most probable number (mpn) method that targeted campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter lari. these three types of data were used to make inferences about theoretical risks in a watershed in which controlled tile drainage is widely practiced, an adjacent watershed with conventional (uncontrolled) tile drainage, and reference sites elsewhere in the same river basin. e. coli concentrations (mpn and plate count) in the controlled tile drainage watershed were statistically higher (2008-11), relative to the uncontrolled tile drainage watershed, but yearly variation was high as well. escherichia coli loading for years 2008-11 combined were statistically higher in  the controlled watershed, relative to the uncontrolled tile drainage watershed, but campylobacter spp. loads for 2010-11 were generally higher for the uncontrolled tile drainage watershed (but not statistically significant). using mpn data and a bayesian modelling approach, higher mean campylobacter spp. concentrations were found in the controlled tile drainage watershed relative to the uncontrolled tile drainage watershed (2010, 2011). a second-order quantitative microbial risk assessment (qmra) was used, in a relative way, to identify differences in mean campylobacter spp. infection risks among monitoring  sites for a hypothetical exposure scenario. greater relative mean risks were obtained for sites in the controlled tile drainage watershed than in the uncontrolled tile drainage watershed in each year of monitoring with pair-wise posterior probabilities exceeding 0.699, and the lowest relative mean risks were  found at a downstream drinking water intake reference site. the second-order modelling approach was used to partition sources of uncertainty, which revealed that an adequate representation of the temporal variation in campylobacter spp. concentrations for risk assessment was achieved with as few as 10 mpn data per site. this study demonstrates for the first time how qmra can be implemented to evaluate, in a relative sense, the public health implications of controlled tile  drainage on watershed-scale water quality.

TI  == construction, expression and characterisation of recombinant molecules of the urease gene operon from a urease-positive thermophilic campylobacter (uptc) isolate.
AB  == a recombinant molecule of the full-length urease gene operon was constructed in vitro from the japanese urease-positive thermophilic campylobacter (uptc) cf89-12 isolate and expressed in escherichia coli cells. several large deletion recombinant variants of urease subunit genes were also constructed and expressed  in e. coli cells. a positive urease reaction with the log-phase cultured e. coli  jm109 cells in the nicl2-containing medium transformed with pgem-t vector carrying the recombinant molecule of the full-length operon was detected with isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactoside. among the several deletion recombinant variants, each urea-, ureb-, uree-, uref-, ureg- and ureh-large deficient, only uree-large deletion variant (63% deficient) showed a positive urease reaction (approximately 15-fold). in addition, a uree-complete deletion recombinant variant (100% deficient) constructed also showed a positive reaction of urease (approximately 18-fold). recombinant urease subunits a and b were immunologically identified by western blot analysis with anti-urease alpha (a) and beta (b) raised against helicobacter pylori.

TI  == systematic application of multiplex pcr enhances the detection of bacteria, parasites, and viruses in stool samples.
AB  == objectives: to determine whether systematic testing of faecal samples with a broad range multiplex pcr increases the diagnostic yield in patients with diarrhoea compared with conventional methods and a clinician initiated testing strategy. methods: 1758 faecal samples from 1516 patients with diarrhoea submitted to two diagnostic laboratories were tested for viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens by fast-track diagnostics multiplex real-time pcr kits and conventional diagnostic tests. results: multiplex pcr detected pathogens in 530 samples (30%): adenovirus (51, 3%), astrovirus (95, 5%), norovirus (172, 10%), rotavirus (3, 0.2%), campylobacter jejuni/coli (85, 5%), salmonella spp. (22, 1%), clostridium difficile (72, 4%), entero-haemorrhagic escherichia coli (21, 1%), cryptosporidium spp. (3, 0.2%), entamoeba histolytica (1, 0.1%), and giardia lamblia (59, 3%). in contrast, conventional testing detected a pathogen in 324 (18%) samples. conclusions: using a systematic approach to the diagnosis of gastroenteritis improved diagnostic yield. this enhanced detection with pcr was achieved by a combination of improved detection of individual pathogens and detection of pathogens not requested or unable to be tested by conventional tests. this approach also allowed earlier identification for most pathogens and created a workflow which is likely to adapt well for many diagnostic laboratories.

TI  == incidence and trends of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food - foodborne diseases active surveillance network, 10 u.s. sites, 1996-2012.
AB  == foodborne diseases are an important public health problem in the united states. the foodborne diseases active surveillance network* (foodnet) conducts surveillance in 10 u.s. sites for all laboratory-confirmed infections caused by selected pathogens transmitted commonly through food to quantify them and monitor their incidence. this report summarizes 2012 preliminary surveillance data and describes trends since 1996. a total of 19,531 infections, 4,563 hospitalizations, and 68 deaths associated with foodborne diseases were reported  in 2012. for most infections, incidence was highest among children aged <5 years; the percentage of persons hospitalized and the percentage who died were highest among persons aged >/=65 years. in 2012, compared with the 2006-2008 period, the  overall incidence of infectiondagger was unchanged, and the estimated incidence of infections caused by campylobacter and vibrio increased. these findings highlight the need for targeted action to address food safety gaps.

TI  == molecular detection of campylobacter spp. and fecal indicator bacteria during the northern migration of sandhill cranes (grus canadensis) at the central platte river.
AB  == the risk to human health of the annual sandhill crane (grus canadensis) migration through nebraska, which is thought to be a major source of fecal pollution of the central platte river, is unknown. to better understand potential risks, the presence of campylobacter species and three fecal indicator bacterial groups (enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, and bacteroidetes) was assayed by pcr from  crane excreta and water samples collected during their stopover at the platte river, nebraska, in 2010. genus-specific pcr assays and sequence analyses identified campylobacter jejuni as the predominant campylobacter species in sandhill crane excreta. campylobacter spp. were detected in 48% of crane excreta, 24% of water samples, and 11% of sediment samples. the estimated densities of enterococcus spp. were highest in excreta samples (mean, 4.6 x 10(8) cell equivalents [ce]/g), while water samples contained higher levels of bacteroidetes (mean, 5.1 x 10(5) ce/100 ml). enterococcus spp., e. coli, and campylobacter spp. were significantly increased in river water and sediments during the crane migration period, with enterococcus sp. densities (~3.3 x 10(5) ce/g) 2 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of bacteroidetes (4.9 x 10(3) ce/g), e. coli (2.2 x 10(3) ce/g), and campylobacter spp. (37 ce/g). sequencing data for the 16s rrna gene and campylobacter species-specific pcr assays indicated that c. jejuni was the major campylobacter species present in water, sediments, and crane excreta. overall, migration appeared to result in a significant, but temporary, change in water quality in spring, when there may be a c. jejuni health hazard associated with water and crops visited by the migrating birds.

TI  == optimized protocol for expression and purification of membrane-bound pglb, a bacterial oligosaccharyl transferase.
AB  == asparagine-linked glycosylation (nlg) plays a significant role in a diverse range of cellular processes, including protein signaling and trafficking, the immunologic response, and immune system evasion by pathogens. a major impediment  to nlg-related research is an incomplete understanding of the central enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway, the oligosaccharyl transferase (otase). characterization of the otase is critical for developing ways to inhibit, engineer, and otherwise manipulate the enzyme for research and therapeutic purposes. the minimal understanding of this enzyme can be attributed to its complex, transmembrane structure, and the resulting instability and resistance to overexpression and purification. the following article describes an optimized procedure for recombinant expression and purification of pglb, a bacterial otase, in a stably active form. the conditions screened at each step, the order of screening, and the method of comparing conditions are described. ultimately, the  following approach increased expression levels from tens of micrograms to several milligrams of active protein per liter of escherichia coli culture, and increased stability from several hours to greater than six months post-purification. this represents the first detailed procedure for attaining a pure, active, and stable  otase in milligram quantities. in addition to presenting an optimized protocol for expression and purification of pglb, these results present a general guide for the systematic optimization of the expression, purification, and stability of a large, transmembrane protein.

TI  == lateral transfer, vertical translocation, and survival of inoculated bacteria during moisture enhancement of pork.
AB  == lateral transfer, vertical translocation, and survival of bacteria during moisture enhancement of pork were investigated under laboratory conditions. in the first experiment, a pork loin was surface inoculated with escherichia coli biotype i and moisture enhanced with brine to 10%. after the inoculated loin had  been injected, four uninoculated loins were processed in the same manner, without cleaning or sanitizing the injector equipment. samples were collected from both the surface and the interior tissues of the pork loins. e. coli biotype i was transferred from the inoculated loins to both the exterior and interior of the uninoculated loins in this process. in the second experiment, pork loins were surface inoculated with e. coli biotype i and injected to 10, 20, and 30% of initial weight. after injection, e. coli biotype i was recovered from both the surface and the interior tissues in the pork loins, although there were no significant differences between injection levels. the third experiment was performed to examine the survival of salmonella enterica typhimurium and campylobacter jejuni in recirculating brines. the brine used for injecting pork loins was inoculated with salmonella typhimurium or c. jejuni and then recirculated for 48 h at 4 or 10 degrees c. samples were collected at specific time intervals, and the surviving populations of the organisms were determined. the populations of both bacteria declined by <1 log over 48 h, and there was no significant difference in populations between temperatures. the present study indicates the potential for cross-contamination of pork during moisture enhancement.

TI  == a culture-independent sequence-based metagenomics approach to the investigation of an outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli o104:h4.
AB  == importance: identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. however, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain. objective: to explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of dna extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture. design, setting, and patients: in a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were  selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of shiga-toxigenic escherichia coli (stec) o104:h4 in germany. samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (august-september 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (november 2012-february 2013). in phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. in phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. in phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak  strain. main outcomes and measures: the recovery of genome sequence data for the  purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other  pathogens from fecal samples. results: during phase 1, a draft genome of the stec outbreak strain was obtained. during phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. sequences from the shiga-toxin genes were detected  in 27 of 40 stec-positive samples (67%). in phase 3, sequences from clostridium difficile, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter concisus, and salmonella enterica  were recovered. conclusions and relevance: these results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

TI  == inverse metabolic engineering to improve escherichia coli as an n-glycosylation host.
AB  == an inverse metabolic engineering strategy was used to select for escherichia coli cells with an increased capability to n-glycosylate a specific target protein. we developed a screen for e. coli cells containing extra-chromosomal dna fragments for improved ability to add precise sugar groups onto the acra protein using the  glycosylation system from campylobacter jejuni. four different sized (1, 2, 4, and 8 kb) genomic dna libraries were screened, and the sequences that conferred a yield advantage were determined. these advantageous genomic fragments were mapped onto the e. coli w3110 chromosome. five candidate genes (identified across two or more libraries) were subsequently selected for forward engineering verification in e. coli clm24 cells, utilizing a combination of internal standards for absolute quantitation and pseudo-selective reaction monitoring (psrm) and western blotting validation. an increase in glycosylated protein was quantified in cells  overexpressing 4-alpha-glucantransferase and a phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase system, amounting to a 3.8-fold (engineered cells total  = 5.3 mg l(-1) ) and 6.7-fold (engineered cells total = 9.4 mg l(-1) ) improvement compared to control cells, respectively. furthermore, increased glycosylation efficiency was observed in cells overexpressing enzymes involved with glycosylation precursor synthesis, enzymes 1-deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate synthase (1.3-fold) and udp-n-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (1.6-fold). to  evaluate the wider implications of the engineering, we tested a modified fc fragment of an igg antibody as the target glycoprotein with two of our engineered cells, and achieved a ca. 75% improved glycosylation efficiency.

TI  == microbiological diagnosis of severe diarrhea in kidney transplant recipients by use of multiplex pcr assays.
AB  == diarrhea is a frequent complication after kidney transplantation, ascribed to adverse effects of the immunosuppressive therapy in case of negative microbiological examination of the stools. the aim of this study was to improve the microbiological diagnosis by implementing molecular tests. fifty-four severe  diarrhea events that occurred in 49 adult kidney transplant recipients from september 2010 to november 2011 were investigated. one or several enteric pathogens were detected in 13 (23%) stool samples using classical microbiological methods versus 39 (72%) for the seven commercially available multiplex pcr assays used retrospectively (p = 0.006). interestingly, molecular diagnosis identified 15 multiple infections compared to none using classical techniques. the primary pathogens detected were enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) (n = 15; 38%), campylobacter spp. (n = 15; 38%), and norovirus (n = 14; 36%). specificities for  campylobacter and norovirus infection diagnosis were 75 and 100%, respectively, by comparison to reference methods. based on molecular findings, a cyclosporine-mycophenolate mofetil combination was identified as a risk factor for developing norovirus-induced diarrhea. norovirus infections were also responsible for higher weight loss than all the other causes of diarrhea. in samples from asymptomatic immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients, epec but not norovirus and campylobacter infections were detected at a frequency similar to that observed in symptomatic kidney transplant recipients. in conclusion, molecular tools significantly improved the detection of single and multiple enteric infections by comparison to classical techniques and could quickly become the key element in the management of severe acute diarrhea in transplant recipients.

TI  == increased detection of invasive enteropathogenic bacteria in pre-incubated blood  culture materials by real-time pcr in comparison with automated incubation in sub-saharan africa.
AB  == background: invasive enteropathogenic bacteria can cause systemic infections. data from studies with pcr detection suggest, at least for salmonella enterica, that blood culture may lead to underestimation in the tropics. corresponding data are lacking for other invasive enteropathogenic bacteria. we compared classical blood culture and molecular methods for the diagnosis of blood infections. methods: a real-time multiplex pcr for salmonella spp., shigella spp./entero- invasive escherichia coli (eiec), yersinia spp., and campylobacter jejuni was applied to 2321 retained blood culture samples from ghanaian patients, after enrichment by automated culture. results: pcr detected salmonella dna in 56 out of 58 pre-incubated ghanaian blood cultures with growth of s. enterica. in 2 samples molecular diagnosis was only possible after 1:10 dilution. twenty-two samples negative by blood culture and 1 positive with micrococcus spp. were pcr-positive for salmonella spp. in addition, 3 shigella spp./eiec, 2 yersinia spp., and 1 c. jejuni were detected by pcr but not by culture growth. conclusions: real-time pcr was more sensitive in identifying invasive enteropathogenic bacteria than automated blood culture, which is hampered by a lack of evidence-based standardization of pre-analytic conditions in the tropics. primary agar culture and gram-staining prior to automated blood culture is advisable in cases where transportation times are long.

AB  == a series of stn-muc1 and st-muc1 glycopeptides containing naturally occurring and non-natural sialic acids have been chemoenzymatically synthesized from tn-muc1 glycopeptide using one-pot multienzyme (opme) approaches. in situ generation of the sialyltransferase donor cytidine 5'-monophosphate-sialic acid (cmp-sia) using a cmp-sialic acid synthetase in the presence of an extra amount of cytidine 5'-triphosphate (ctp) and removal of cmp from the reaction mixture by flash c18 cartridge purification allow the complete consumption of tn-muc1 glycopeptide for quantitative synthesis of stn-muc1. a campylobacter jejuni beta1-3galt (cjcgtbdelta30-his6) mutant has been found to catalyze the transfer of one or more galactose residues to tn-muc1 for the synthesis of t-muc1 and galactosylated t-muc1. sialylation of t-muc1 using pasteurella multocida alpha2-3-sialyltransferase 3 (pmst3) with neisseria meningitidis cmp-sialic acid  synthetase (nmcss) and escherichia coli sialic acid aldolase in one pot produced  st-muc1 efficiently. these glycopeptides are potential cancer vaccine candidates.

AB  == in the minds of many, large scale open air festivals have become associated with  spring and summer, attracting many people, and in the case of music festivals, thousands of music fans. these festivals share the usual health risks associated  with large mass gatherings, including transmission of communicable diseases and risk of outbreaks. large scale open air festivals have however specific characteristics, including outdoor settings, on-site housing and food supply and  the generally young age of the participants. outbreaks at large scale open air festivals have been caused by cryptosporium parvum, campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, staphylococcus aureus, hepatitis a virus, influenza virus, measles virus, mumps virus and norovirus. faecal-oral and respiratory transmissions of pathogens result from non-compliance with hygiene rules, inadequate sanitation and insufficient vaccination coverage.  sexual transmission of infectious diseases may also occur and is likely to be underestimated and underreported. enhanced surveillance during and after festivals is essential. preventive measures such as immunisations of participants and advice on-site and via social networks should be considered to reduce outbreaks at these large scale open air festivals.

AB  == over a seven-year period (2004-2010) 1095 water samples were obtained from the south nation river basin at multiple watershed monitoring sites (ontario, canada). real-time pcr using bacteroidales specific markers was used to identify  the origin (human (10% prevalence), ruminant (22%), pig (~2%), canada goose (4%)  and muskrat (7%)) of fecal pollution. in parallel, the distribution of fecal indicator bacteria and waterborne pathogens (cryptosporidium oocysts, giardia cysts, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica and campylobacter spp.) was  evaluated. associations between the detection of specific bacteroidales markers and the presence of fecal indicator bacteria, pathogens, and distinct land use or environmental variables were evaluated. linear correlations between bacteroidales markers and fecal indicator bacteria were weak. however, mean marker densities, and the presence and absence of markers could be discriminated on the basis of threshold fecal indicator densities. the ruminant-specific bacteroidales marker was the most frequently detected marker in water, consistent with the large number of dairy farms in the study area. detection of the human or the ruminant markers were associated with a slightly higher risk of detecting s. enterica. detection of the muskrat marker was related to more frequent campylobacter spp. detections. important positive associations between markers and pathogens were found among: i) total bacteroidales and cryptosporidium and giardia, ii) ruminant marker and s. enterica, and iii) muskrat and campylobacter spp.

TI  == high-mass matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry of integral membrane proteins and their complexes.
AB  == analyzing purified membrane proteins and membrane protein complexes by mass spectrometry has been notoriously challenging and required highly specialized buffer conditions, sample preparation methods, and apparatus. here we show that a standard matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (maldi) protocol, if used in combination with a high-mass detector, allows straightforward mass spectrometric  measurements of integral membrane proteins and their complexes, directly following purification in detergent solution. molecular weights can be determined precisely (mass error </= 0.1%) such that high-mass maldi-ms was able to identify the site for n-linked glycosylation of the eukaryotic multidrug abc transporter cdr1p without special purification steps, which is impossible by any other current approach. after chemical cross-linking with glutaraldehyde in the presence of detergent micelles, the subunit stoichiometries of a series of integral membrane protein complexes, including the homomeric pglk and the heteromeric btucd as well as btucdf, were unambiguously resolved. this thus adds  a valuable tool for biophysical characterization of integral membrane proteins.

TI  == the effects of yeast feed supplementation on turkey performance and pathogen colonization in a transport stress/escherichia coli challenge.
AB  == a commercial yeast culture feed supplement (yc; celmanax scp, vi-cor, mason city, ia) was provided to turkeys throughout a 16-wk grow-out to determine if it would  prevent the effects of stress on production and pathogen colonization. the yc was provided either continuously at 100 g/t (yc-cs) or intermittently during times of stress at 200 g/t (yc-is). birds were stressed with an environmental challenge of escherichia coli and by transporting them in a vehicle for 3 h after which they were penned in new social groups, without feed or water, for an additional 9 h. turkeys were transported and challenged at 6, 12, and 16 wk of age to model the movement of birds within a 3-stage housing system. the yc-is was provided only for the first week after hatch and for a 1-wk period encompassing each challenge. at wk 7 and 9, a decrease in bw of challenged birds was prevented by yc-is but not yc-cs. there were no significant differences in bw due to either challenge or yc during wk 11 and 13. at wk 16, the challenge decreased bw, but there was no improvement in either of the yc treatments. overall feed conversion ratio (fcr) was increased by transport/e. coli (p < 0.0001). the yc-cs improved fcr of challenged birds by 21 points, whereas yc-is improved fcr by 36 points and this effect was significant (p = 0.013). the yc-cs tended to decrease both salmonella  and campylobacter isolation from the ceca of stressed birds (p > 0.05). the yc-is also tended to decrease salmonella isolation (p > 0.05) with no effect on campylobacter isolation. these data suggest that the practice of transporting turkeys decreases performance and that yc-is may be more effective than yc-cs for alleviating the effects of this stressor on feed efficiency.

TI  == response of restraint stress-selected lines of japanese quail to heat stress and  escherichia coli challenge.
AB  == japanese quail selected for divergent corticosterone response to restraint stress were evaluated for their susceptibility to heat stress and challenge with escherichia coli. these quail lines are designated as high stress (hs), low stress (ls), and the random-bred control (cs) lines. heat stress (35 degrees c, 8 h/d) began at 24 d until the end of the study at 39 d. birds were challenged with an aerosol spray containing 2 x 10(9) cfu of e. coli at 25 and 32 d. at 38 d, the surviving birds were necropsied and the intestinal tract was screened for both salmonella and campylobacter. body weights of the cs birds were higher than both  hs and ls at 17, 25, and 32 d. at 32 d, there was no difference in mortality between males and females and the cs line had higher mortality compared with the  ls line with the hs line being intermediate. at 38 d, females of the cs line that were both heat stressed and challenged had a mortality incidence of 25%, which was significantly higher than male birds of the same line and treatment (5.3%). there was an increased incidence in salmonella enterica serotype agona isolation  after heat stress, with the ls birds having less isolation than the hs birds. mean corticosterone levels of male birds were not significantly affected by line, heat stress, or e. coli challenge; however, the ls line subjected to heat stress  had one-third the level of the hs line, a difference identical to that seen in the original selection for response to restraint stress.

TI  == occurrence of thermotolerant campylobacter spp. and adenoviruses in finnish bathing waters and purified sewage effluents.
AB  == a total of 50 finnish bathing water samples and 34 sewage effluent samples originating from 17 locations were studied in the summers of 2006 and 2007. campylobacter were present in 58% and adenoviruses in 12% of all bathing water samples; 53% of all sewage effluent samples were positive for campylobacter spp.  and 59% for adenoviruses. c. jejuni was the most common campylobacter species found and human adenovirus serotype 41 was the most common identified adenovirus  type. bathing water temperature displayed a significant negative relationship with the occurrence of campylobacter. one location had identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns of c. coli isolates in the bathing water and in sewage effluent, suggesting that sewage effluent was the source of c. coli at this bathing site. the counts of faecal indicator bacteria were not able to predict the presence of campylobacter spp. or adenoviruses in the bathing waters. thus the observed common presence of these pathogens in finnish sewage effluents and bathing waters may represent a public health risk. the low water temperature in finland may enhance the prevalence of campylobacter in bathing waters. more attention needs to be paid to minimizing the concentrations of intestinal pathogens in bathing waters.

TI  == evaluation of bovine feces-associated microbial source tracking markers and their correlations with fecal indicators and zoonotic pathogens in a brisbane, australia, reservoir.
AB  == this study was aimed at evaluating the host specificity and host sensitivity of two bovine feces-associated bacterial (baccow-ucd and cowm3) and one viral [bovine adenovirus (b-avs)] microbial source tracking (mst) markers by screening  130 fecal and wastewater samples from 10 target and nontarget host groups in southeast queensland, australia. in addition, 36 water samples were collected from a reservoir and tested for the occurrence of all three bovine feces-associated markers along with fecal indicator bacteria (fib), campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157, and salmonella spp. the overall host specificity values of the baccow-ucd, cowm3, and b-avs markers to differentiate between bovine and other nontarget host groups were 0.66, 0.88, and 1.00, respectively (maximum value of 1.00). the overall host sensitivity values of these markers, however, in composite bovine wastewater and individual bovine fecal dna samples were 0.93, 0.90, and 0.60, respectively (maximum value of 1.00). among the 36 water samples tested, 56%, 22%, and 6% samples were pcr positive for the baccow-ucd, cowm3, and b-avs markers, respectively. among the 36 samples tested,  50% and 14% samples were pcr positive for the campylobacter 16s rrna and e. coli  o157 rfbe genes, respectively. based on the results, we recommend that multiple bovine feces-associated markers be used if possible for bovine fecal pollution tracking. nonetheless, the presence of the multiple bovine feces-associated markers along with the presence of potential zoonotic pathogens indicates bovine  fecal pollution in the reservoir water samples. further research is required to understand the decay rates of these markers in relation to fib and zoonotic pathogens.

TI  == application of quantitative microbial risk assessment to analyze the public health risk from poor drinking water quality in a low income area in accra, ghana.
AB  == in accra, ghana, a majority of inhabitants lives in over-crowded areas with limited access to piped water supply, which is often also intermittent. this study assessed in a densely populated area the risk from microbial contamination  of various sources of drinking water, by conducting a quantitative microbiological risk assessment (qmra) to estimate the risk to human health from  microorganism exposure and dose-response relationships. furthermore the cost-effectiveness in reducing the disease burden through targeted interventions  was evaluated. five risk pathways for drinking water were identified through a survey (110 families), namely household storage, private yard taps, communal taps, communal wells and water sachets. samples from each source were analyzed for escherichia coli and ascaris contamination. published ratios between e. coli  and other pathogens were used for the qmra and disease burden calculations. the major part of the burden of disease originated from e. coli o157:h7 (78%) and the least important contributor was cryptosporidium (0.01%). other pathogens contributed 16% (campylobacter), 5% (rotavirus) and 0.3% (ascaris). the sum of the disease burden of these pathogens was 0.5 dalys per person per year, which is much higher than the who reference level. the major contamination pathway was found to be household storage. disinfection of water at household level was the most cost-effective intervention (<5 usd/daly-averted) together with hygiene education. water supply network improvements were significantly less cost-effective.

TI  == risk of infectious gastroenteritis in young children living in quebec rural areas with intensive animal farming: results of a case-control study (2004-2007).
AB  == this study was designed to evaluate the epidemiology of severe gastroenteritis in children living in quebec rural areas with intensive livestock activities. from september 2005 through june 2007, 165 cases of gastroenteritis in children aged from 6 months to 5 years, hospitalized or notified to the public health department were enrolled, and 326 eligible controls participated. the parents of  cases and controls were asked questions about different gastroenteritis risk factors. the quality of the drinking water used by the participants was investigated for microbial indicators as well as for four zoonotic bacterial pathogens (campylobacter spp, escherichia coli, salmonella spp and yersinia spp)  and two enteric parasites (cryptosporidium spp and giardia spp). from 134 stool specimen analysed, viruses were detected in 82 cases (61%), while 28 (21%) were found with at least one of the bacteria investigated, and five cases were infected by parasites. campylobacteriosis was the main bacterial infection (n = 15), followed by salmonella sp (n = 7) and e. coli o157:h7 (n = 5) among cases with bacterial gastroenteritis. no significant difference was found between cases and controls regarding the quality of water consumed; the frequency of faecal contamination of private wells was also similar between cases and controls. considering the total cases (including those with a virus), no link was found between severe gastroenteritis and either being in contact with animals or living in a municipality with the highest animal density (4th quartile). however, when considering only cases with a bacterial or parasite infection (n = 32), there was a weak association with pig density that was not statistically significant after  adjusting for potential confounders. contact with domestic, zoo or farm animals were the only environmental factor associated with the disease.

TI  == prevalence of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. in large game animals intended for consumption: relationship with management practices and livestock influence.
AB  == although wild ruminants have been identified as reservoirs of shiga-toxin producing escherichia coli (stec), little information is available concerning the role of salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. in large game species. we evaluated the presence of these pathogens in faeces (n=574) and carcasses (n=585) sampled from red deer (n=295), wild boar (n=333) and other ungulates (fallow deer, mouflon) (n=9). animal sampling was done in situ from 33 hunting estates during two hunting seasons. salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. strains associated with human campylobacteriosis were infrequently detected indicating that both pathogens had a limited zoonotic risk in our study area. the overall stec prevalence in animals was 21% (134/637), being significantly higher in faeces from red deer (90 out of 264). a total of 58 isolates were serotyped. serotypes o146:h- and o27:h30 were the most frequent in red deer and the majority of isolates from red deer and wild boar were from serotypes previously found in stec strains associated with human infection, including the serotype o157:h7. the stec prevalence in red deer faeces was significantly higher with the presence of  livestock (p<0, 01) where high densities of red deer (p<0.001) were present. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting the occurrence of salmonella spp. and stec in carcasses of large game animals. furthermore, this study confirmed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) that cross contamination of stec during carcass dressing occurred, implying the likelihood of these pathogens entering into the food chain.

TI  == basolateral invasion and trafficking of campylobacter jejuni in polarized epithelial cells.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major cause of bacterial diarrheal disease. most enteropathogenic bacteria including c. jejuni can invade cultured eukaryotic cells via an actin- and/or microtubule-dependent and an energy-consuming uptake process. recently, we identified a novel highly efficient c. jejuni invasion pathway that involves bacterial migration into the subcellular space of non-polarized epithelial cells (termed subvasion) followed by invasion from the cell basis. here we report cellular requirements of this entry mechanism and the  subsequent intracellular trafficking route of c. jejuni in polarized islands of caco-2 intestinal epithelial cells. advanced microscopy on infected cells revealed that c. jejuni invades the polarized intestinal cells via the subcellular invasion pathway. remarkably, invasion was not blocked by the inhibitors of microtubule dynamics colchicine or paclitaxel, and was even enhanced after disruption of host cell actin filaments by cytochalasin d. invasion also continued after dinitrophenol-induced cellular depletion of atp, whereas this compound effectively inhibited the uptake of invasive escherichia coli. confocal microscopy demonstrated that intracellular c. jejuni resided in membrane-bound cd63-positive cellular compartments for up to 24 h. establishment  of a novel luciferase reporter-based bacterial viability assay, developed to overcome the limitations of the classical bacterial recovery assay, demonstrated  that a subset of c. jejuni survived intracellularly for up to 48 h. taken together, our results indicate that c. jejuni is able to actively invade polarized intestinal epithelial cells via a novel actin- and microtubule-independent mechanism and remains metabolically active in the intracellular niche for up to 48 hours.

TI  == pathogenic bacteria in finnish bulk tank milk.
AB  == while the quality of raw cow milk in finland is known for its high hygienic standard, with the national average total bacterial count being below 10(4) cfu/ml annually, the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in finnish raw milk is underreported. the aim of this study was to determine the occurrence of listeria  monocytogenes, thermophilic campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., stx-positive escherichia coli (stec), coagulase-positive staphylococci, yersinia spp., and bacillus cereus group in raw cow milk samples collected from bulk tanks at 183 finnish farms. additionally, the hygienic quality of the milk was studied by determining the total bacterial and e. coli counts. l. monocytogenes was detected in 5.5% of the milk samples, with concentrations varying from <1 to 30 cfu/ml. thermophilic campylobacter spp. or salmonella spp. were not detected in any of the samples. stec with shiga toxin-encoding stx2 was detected in 2.7% of the samples. yersinia enterocolitica was detected in 7.7% of the samples; however, all isolates were negative for ail, suggesting that they were non-pathogenic. coagulase-positive staphylococci were detected in 34.4% of the samples, with an average concentration of 25 cfu/ml in the positive samples. members of the b. cereus group were detected in 20.8% of the samples, with an average concentration of 1 cfu/ml in the positive samples. no relationship was detected between e. coli or the total bacterial count and the presence of pathogenic bacteria, which suggests that pathogens can be present also in farms with excellent production hygiene. although the concentration of pathogenic bacteria in fresh raw milk was  mainly relatively low, it should be borne in mind that some of the pathogenic bacteria can survive and multiply at refrigeration temperatures and may cause a disease with a very low infectious dose. thus, consumption of raw milk and related products poses a potential risk for food poisoning.

TI  == in vitro characterization of aggregation and adhesion properties of viable and heat-killed forms of two probiotic lactobacillus strains and interaction with foodborne zoonotic bacteria, especially campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == bacterial aggregation and/or adhesion are key factors for colonization of the digestive ecosystem and the ability of probiotic strains to exclude pathogens. in the present study, two probiotic strains, lactobacillus rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lactobacillus farciminis cncm-i-3699, were evaluated as viable or heat-killed forms and compared with probiotic reference lactobacillus strains (lb. rhamnosus  gg and lb. farciminis cip 103136). the autoaggregation potential of both forms was higher than that of reference strains and twice that of pathogenic strains. the coaggregation potential of these two beneficial micro-organisms was evaluated against several pathogenic agents that threaten the global safety of the feed/food chain: escherichia coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes. the strongest coaggregative interactions were demonstrated with campylobacter spp. by a coaggregation test, confirmed by electron microscopic examination for the two forms. viable forms were investigated for the nature of the bacterial cell-surface molecules involved, by  sugar reversal tests and chemical and enzymic pretreatments. the results suggest  that the coaggregation between both probiotic strains and c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) is mediated by a carbohydrate-lectin interaction. the autoaggregation potential of the two probiotics decreased upon exposure to proteinase, sds or licl, showing that proteinaceous components on the surface of the two lactobacilli play an important role in this interaction. adhesion abilities of both lactobacillus strains were also demonstrated at significant levels on caco-2 cells, mucin and extracellular matrix material. both viable and heat-killed forms of the two probiotic lactobacilli inhibited the attachment of c. jejuni cip 70.2(t) to mucin. in conclusion, in vitro assays showed that lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, as viable or heat-killed forms, are adherent to different intestinal matrix models and are highly aggregative in vitro with pathogens, especially campylobacter spp., the most commonly reported zoonotic agent in the european union. this study supports the need for further in vivo investigations to demonstrate the potential food safety benefits of lb. rhamnosus cncm-i-3698 and lb. farciminis cncm-i-3699, live or heat-killed, in the global feed/food chain.

TI  == estimates of illnesses, hospitalizations and deaths caused by major bacterial enteric pathogens in young children in the united states.
AB  == background: many enteric pathogens disproportionately affect young children. however, higher incidences of laboratory-confirmed illness may be explained, at least in part, by higher rates of medical care-seeking and stool sample submission in this age group. we estimated the overall number of bacterial enteric illnesses among children <5 years old in the united states caused by campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, nontyphoidal salmonella, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica. materials and methods: we used a statistical model that  scaled counts of laboratory-confirmed illnesses from the foodborne diseases active surveillance network up to an estimated number of illnesses in the united  states, adjusting for the surveillance steps needed for an illness to be laboratory diagnosed (medical care sought, stool sample submitted, bacterial culture performed, laboratory tested for pathogen, laboratory test sensitivity).  results: we estimated that 5 bacterial enteric pathogens caused 291,162 illnesses each year among children <5 years old, resulting in 102,746 physician visits, 7830 hospitalizations and 64 deaths. nontyphoidal salmonella caused most illnesses (42%), followed by campylobacter (28%), shigella (21%), y. enterocolitica (5%) and e. coli o157 (3%). the estimated annual number of physician visits ranged from 3763 for e. coli o157 to 44,369 for nontyphoidal salmonella. nontyphoidal salmonella was estimated to cause most hospitalizations  (4670) and deaths (38). conclusions: bacterial enteric infections cause many illnesses in us children. compared with the general population, enteric illnesses among children <5 years old are more likely to be diagnosed. however, overall rates of illness remain higher in children after adjusting for underdiagnosis in  both groups.

TI  == comparison of cumulative drip sampling with whole carcass rinses for estimation of campylobacter species and quality indicator organisms associated with processed broiler chickens.
AB  == the whole carcass rinse (wcr) procedure is routinely used as a sampling method for determining the presence and number of quality-indicator organisms or pathogens associated with broiler chicken carcasses in processing facilities. collection of a cumulative drip sample by placing collection vessels under the processing line could potentially capture a more representative sample of bacterial populations associated with an entire flock with less labor than individual bird rinses. the purpose of this study was to evaluate a cumulative drip sampling method for recovery of campylobacter spp. and 3 types of quality indicator organisms from broiler carcasses. cumulative drip and wcr samples were  collected on 14 d from a commercial broiler processing facility over a 3-mo period. no statistically significant difference was demonstrated between the wcr  and cumulative drip sampling methods in recovery of campylobacter spp., total aerobes, enterobacteriaceae, or escherichia coli associated with the postevisceration samples (p > 0.01). analysis of the pyrosequencing census data demonstrated high interbird variability and indicates cumulative sampling may be  required to obtain fully representative sampling of a flock. for most bacterial taxa, the relative abundance in individual wcr was correlated with cumulative drip samples, but some taxa were undercounted or missed entirely by individual wcr. consequently, individual carcass rinses may not be representative of the flock microbial community. the cumulative drip sampling technique may save labor  and provide a more representative summary of process control in poultry processing facilities.

AB  == background: acute diarrhea remains a major public health problem in east african  nations such as kenya. surveillance for a broad range of enteric pathogens is necessary to accurately predict the frequency of pathogens and potential changes  in antibiotic resistance patterns. method: stool samples were collected from september 2009 to september 2011; 193 and 239 samples, from age-matched cases and asymptomatic controls, were collected, respectively, from kericho and kisumu district hospitals in western kenya. bacterial pathogens were identified by conventional microbiological methods; antibiotic susceptibility of bacterial isolates was ascertained using the microscan walkaway 40 plus. an enzyme immunoassay kit was used to detect rotavirus, and ova and parasite examination was conducted by microscopy and an enzyme immunoassay. results: rotavirus (10.2%  and 10.5%) and shigella (11% and 8%) were isolated significantly more often in the cases than the controls from kericho and kisumu district hospitals respectively. the diarrheagenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni and salmonella were found most often in the cases while giardia lamblia and entamoeba histolytica/e. dispar were found more often in the controls. most pathogens were  isolated from children under 5 years old. more than 50% of the shigella, salmonella and diarrheagenic e. coli isolates were multidrug resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with several enteroaggregative and enterotoxigenic e. coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. conclusion: accurate epidemiologic information on acute diarrheal illness in kenya will be critical for augmenting existing diarrhea management policies in terms of treatment and to strengthen future community awareness and health promotion programs.

TI  == covalent and oriented immobilization of scfv antibody fragments via an engineered glycan moiety.
AB  == antibody-derived fragments have enormous potential application in solid-phase assays such as biomarker detection and protein purification. controlled orientation of the immobilized antibody molecules is a critical requirement for the sensitivity and efficacy of such assays. we present an approach for covalent, correctly oriented attachment of scfv antibody fragments on solid supports. glycosylated scfvs were expressed in escherichia coli and the c-terminal, binding pocket-distal glycan tag was oxidized for covalent attachment to amine-functionalized beads. the glycosylated scfvs could be immobilized at salt concentrations that precluded nonspecific adsorption of unglycosylated molecules  and the covalently attached antibody fragments exhibited 4-fold higher functional activity than ionically adsorbed scfvs. the glyco-tethered scfvs were stable in nacl concentrations that removed greater than 90% of adsorbed scfvs and they exhibited improved stability of antigen binding over both adsorbed scfvs and soluble, nonimmobilized scfvs in accelerated degradation tests. the simple expression and immobilization approach reported is likely to find broad application in in vitro antibody tests.

TI  == prevalence of the main food-borne pathogens in retail food under the national food surveillance system in japan.
AB  == the national food surveillance system in japan was formed in 1998 to monitor the  contamination of retail foods with bacterial pathogens. approximately 2000-3000 samples were tested annually, and the data from food categories that had more than 400 samples collected during 1998-2008 were analysed. with regard to meat, the frequency of positive samples for salmonella in chicken for raw consumption and ground chicken was 12.7% and 33.5%, respectively. moreover, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157 was found in ground meat, organ meat and processed meat, although at a low frequency (0.1%). the prevalence of campylobacter jejuni/coli was 13.3% and 20.9% in chicken for raw consumption and  ground chicken, respectively. in vegetables and fruit, salmonella was detected in cucumber, lettuce, sprout and tomato samples at a frequency of around 0.1-0.2%. with regard to seafood, salmonella was found in 0.5% of oysters for raw consumption. seafood was not contaminated with stec o157 or shigella. serotype infantis was the most frequently detected serotype of salmonella in seafood, followed by the serotypes typhimurium, schwarzengrund and manhattan. in ground chicken, 72.2% of the strains were identified as the serotype infantis. e. coli,  as an indicator of food hygiene, was detected in all food categories. the results show the prevalence of the above-mentioned pathogens in the retail food supplied  in japan; further, they indicate that consumption of raw food carries the risk of contracting food-borne infections.

TI  == campylobacter bacteremia in hemodialysis patients by eating raw meat - the importance of sanitary education.
AB  == in 2011, simultaneous, widespread outbreaks of food poisoning by contaminated enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli in beef, which killed four and hospitalized more than 30 people, occurred in japan. while the press was widely reporting this disaster, two maintenance hemodialysis patients were suffering from campylobacter bacteremia by eating undercooked meat. one patient was infected with c. upsaliensis and the other with c. fetus. although these patients could be successfully treated, they led us to consider the characteristics of c. upsaliensis and c. fetus as opportunistic pathogens, as well as changes in dietary behaviors and food markets. moreover, they emphasized the need for hemodialysis patients to be not only educated in that they should restrict potassium, phosphate and water intake, but also that they should take care of food sanitation.

TI  == eptc of campylobacter jejuni mediates phenotypes involved in host interactions and virulence.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a natural commensal of the avian intestinal tract. however, the bacterium is also the leading cause of acute bacterial diarrhea worldwide and is implicated in development of guillain-barre syndrome. like many  bacterial pathogens, c. jejuni assembles complex surface structures that interface with the surrounding environment and are involved in pathogenesis. recent work in c. jejuni identified a gene encoding a novel phosphoethanolamine (petn) transferase, eptc (cj0256), that plays a promiscuous role in modifying the flagellar rod protein, flgg; the lipid a domain of lipooligosaccharide (los); and several n-linked glycans. in this work, we report that eptc catalyzes the addition of petn to the first heptose sugar of the inner core oligosaccharide of  los, a fourth enzymatic target. we also examine the role petn modification plays  in circumventing detection and/or killing by host defenses. specifically, we show that modification of c. jejuni lipid a with petn results in increased recognition by the human toll-like receptor 4-myeloid differentiation factor 2 (htlr4-md2) complex, along with providing resistance to relevant mammalian and avian antimicrobial peptides (i.e., defensins). we also confirm the inability of aberrant forms of los to activate toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2). most exciting, we  demonstrate that strains lacking eptc show decreased commensal colonization of chick ceca and reduced colonization of balb/cbyj mice compared to wild-type strains. our results indicate that modification of surface structures with petn by eptc is key to its ability to promote commensalism in an avian host and to survive in the mammalian gastrointestinal environment.

TI  == factors that explain excretion of enteric pathogens by persons without diarrhea.
AB  == excretion of enteropathogens by subjects without diarrhea influences our appreciation of the role of these pathogens as etiologic agents. characteristics  of the pathogens and host and environmental factors help explain asymptomatic excretion of diarrheal pathogens by persons without diarrhea. after causing acute diarrhea followed by clinical recovery, some enteropathogens are excreted asymptomatically for many weeks. thus, in a prevalence survey of persons without  diarrhea, some may be excreting pathogens from diarrheal episodes experienced many weeks earlier. volunteer challenges with vibrio cholerae o1, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteropathogenic e. coli, campylobacter jejuni, and giardia lamblia document heterogeneity among enteropathogen strains, with some inexplicably not eliciting diarrhea. the immune host may not manifest diarrhea following ingestion of a pathogen but may nevertheless asymptomatically excrete.  some human genotypes render them less susceptible to symptomatic or severe diarrheal infection with certain pathogens such as vibrio cholerae o1 and norovirus. pathogens in stools of individuals without diarrhea may reflect recent ingestion of inocula too small to cause disease in otherwise susceptible hosts or of animal pathogens (eg, bovine or porcine etec) that do not cause human illness.

TI  == a laboratory-developed taqman array card for simultaneous detection of 19 enteropathogens.
AB  == the taqman array card (tac) system is a 384-well singleplex real-time pcr format  that has been used to detect multiple infection targets. here we developed an enteric taqman array card to detect 19 enteropathogens, including viruses (adenovirus, astrovirus, norovirus gii, rotavirus, and sapovirus), bacteria (campylobacter jejuni/c. coli, clostridium difficile, salmonella, vibrio cholerae, diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains including enteroaggregative e. coli [eaec], enterotoxigenic e. coli [etec], enteropathogenic e. coli [epec], and shiga-toxigenic e. coli [stec]), shigella/enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec), protozoa (cryptosporidium, giardia lamblia, and entamoeba histolytica), and helminths (ascaris lumbricoides and trichuris trichiura), as well as two extrinsic controls to monitor extraction and amplification efficiency (the bacteriophage ms2 and phocine herpesvirus). primers and probes were newly designed or adapted from published sources and spotted onto microfluidic cards. fecal samples were spiked  with extrinsic controls, and dna and rna were extracted using the qiaamp stool dna minikit and the quickgene rna tissue kit, respectively, and then mixed with ag-path-id one step real-time reverse transcription-pcr (rt-pcr) reagents and loaded into cards. pcr efficiencies were between 90% and 105%, with linearities of 0.988 to 1. the limit of detection of the assays in the tac was within a 10-fold difference from the cognate assays performed on plates. precision testing demonstrated a coefficient of variation of below 5% within a run and 14% between  runs. accuracy was evaluated for 109 selected clinical specimens and revealed an  average sensitivity and specificity of 85% and 77%, respectively, compared with conventional methods (including microscopy, culture, and immunoassay) and 98% and 96%, respectively, compared with our laboratory-developed pcr-luminex assays. this tac allows fast, accurate, and quantitative detection of a broad spectrum of enteropathogens and is well suited for surveillance or clinical purposes.

TI  == research considerations for more effective groundwater monitoring.
AB  == since numerous pathogens occur in feces, water is monitored for fecal contamination using indicator organisms rather than individual pathogens. although this approach is supported by health effects data in recreational waters, it is questionable when used for drinking water. most outbreaks in groundwater occur in systems that have not violated the us epa's maximum contaminant limit (mcl) for total coliforms within 12 months before the outbreak. additionally, environmentally stable viruses and parasites are often detected in  drinking water samples with no detectable indicators. recent detections of escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni in groundwaters in the apparent absence of indicators also cast some doubt on the worth of indicators for fecal bacterial pathogens. individual pathogen monitoring is now technically achievable but currently unreasonable due to the number of possible pathogens and the costs  involved. several alternatives to pathogen monitoring could significantly reduce  the frequency at which pathogens occur in waters testing negative for indicators: (i) increasing sample volumes for indicators, (ii) increasing monitoring frequency, (iii) using a suite of indicators, (iv) using a more conservative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method, (v) sampling when fecal contamination is  most likely present or (vi) any combination of these options.

TI  == application of ozonated dry ice (aligal blue ice) for packaging and transport in  the food industry.
AB  == dry ice is used by meat and poultry processors for temperature reduction during processing and for temperature maintenance during transportation. aligal blue ice (abi), which combines the antimicrobial effect of ozone (o(3)) along with the high cooling capacity of dry ice, was investigated for its effect on bacterial reduction in air, in liquid, and on food and glass surfaces. through proprietary  means, o(3) was introduced to produce dry ice pellets to a concentration of 20 parts per million (ppm) by total weight. the abi sublimation rate was similar to  that of dry ice pellets under identical conditions, and abi was able to hold the  o(3) concentration throughout the normal shelf life of the product. challenge studies were performed using different microorganisms, including e. coli, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella, and listeria, that are critical to food safety. abi showed significant (p < 0.05) microbial reduction during bioaerosol contamination (up to 5-log reduction of e. coli and listeria), on chicken breast  (approximately 1.3-log reduction of c. jejuni), on contact surfaces (approximately 3.9 log reduction of c. jejuni), and in liquid (2-log reduction of c. jejuni). considering the stability of o(3), ease of use, and antimicrobial efficacy against foodborne pathogens, our results suggest that abi is a better alternative, especially for meat and poultry processors, as compared to dry ice.  further, abi can potentially serve as an additional processing hurdle to guard against pathogens during processing, transportation, distribution, and/or storage.

TI  == effects of antimicrobials fed as dietary growth promoters on faecal shedding of campylobacter, salmonella and shiga-toxin producing escherichia coli in swine.
AB  == aims: to determine whether antimicrobials commonly used in swine diets affect zoonotic pathogen shedding in faeces. methods and results: barrows (n = 160) were sorted into two treatments at 10 weeks of age (week 0 of the study), and fed growing, grow finishing and finishing diets in 4-week feeding periods. for each feeding phase, diets were prepared without (a-) and with (a+) dietary antimicrobials (chlortetracycline, 0-8 week; bacitracin, 9-12 week) typical of the united states. at week 0, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 12 of the study, faecal swabs or grabs were collected for analyses. campylobacter spp. was absent at week 0, but prevalence increased over time with most isolates being identified as campylobacter coli. when chlortetracycline was used in a+ diets (week 4 and 8), prevalence for campylobacter spp., pathogenic escherichia coli o26 and stx genes  was lower in faeces. on week 12 after the shift to bacitracin, campylobacter spp. and stx genes were higher in faeces from piglets fed a+ diet. pathogenic e. coli  serogroups o103 and o145 were isolated throughout the study and their prevalence  did not differ due to diet. pathogenic e. coli serogroups o111 and o121 were never found in the piglets, and salmonella spp. prevalence was low. conclusions:  in production swine, growing diets with chlortetracycline may have reduced pathogen shedding compared with the a-growing diets, whereas finishing diets with bacitracin may have increased pathogen shedding compared with the a-finishing diet. significance and impact of the study: inclusion of antimicrobials in the diet can affect zoonotic pathogen shedding in faeces of swine.

TI  == novel aminoglycoside 2''-phosphotransferase identified in a gram-negative pathogen.
AB  == aminoglycoside 2''-phosphotransferases are the major aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes in clinical isolates of enterococci and staphylococci. we describe a novel aminoglycoside 2''-phosphotransferase from the gram-negative pathogen campylobacter jejuni, which shares 78% amino acid sequence identity with the aph(2'')-ia domain of the bifunctional aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme aminoglycoside (6') acetyltransferase-ie/aminoglycoside 2''-phosphotransferase-ia or aac(6')-ie/aph(2'')-ia from gram-positive cocci, which we called aph(2'')-if.  this enzyme confers resistance to the 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides kanamycin, tobramycin, dibekacin, gentamicin, and sisomicin, but not to arbekacin, amikacin, isepamicin, or netilmicin, but not to any of the 4,5-disubstituted antibiotics tested. steady-state kinetic studies demonstrated that gtp, and not atp, is the preferred cosubstrate for aph(2'')-if. the enzyme phosphorylates the majority of 4,6-disubstituted aminoglycosides with high catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/k(m) = 10(5) to 10(7) m(-1) s(-1)), while the catalytic efficiencies against the 4,6-disubstituted antibiotics amikacin and isepamicin are 1 to 2 orders of magnitude lower, due mainly to the low apparent affinities of these substrates for the enzyme. both 4,5-disubstituted antibiotics and the atypical aminoglycoside neamine are not substrates of aph(2'')-if, but are inhibitors. the antibiotic susceptibility and substrate profiles of aph(2'')-if are very similar to those of the aph(2'')-ia phosphotransferase domain of the bifunctional aac(6')-ie/aph(2'')-ia enzyme.

TI  == quantitative risk assessment of verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157 and campylobacter jejuni related to consumption of raw milk in a province in northern italy.
AB  == a quantitative risk assessment was developed to describe the risk of campylobacteriosis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) linked to consumption of raw milk sold in vending machines in northern italy. exposure assessment considered the microbiological status of dairy farms, expected milk contamination, storage conditions from bulk tank to home storage, microbial growth during storage, destruction experiments, consumption frequency of raw milk, age of consumers, serving size, and consumption preference. the differential risk between milk handled under regulation conditions (4 degrees c throughout all phases) and the worst field handling conditions was considered. the probability of campylobacter jejuni infection was modeled with a single-hit dose-response beta-poisson model, whereas for hus an exponential dose-response model was chosen and two probabilities were used to model the higher susceptibility of children younger than 5 years old. for every 10,000 to 20,000 consumers each year, the models predicted for the best and worst storage conditions, respectively, 2.12 and 1.14 campylobacteriosis cases and 0.02 and 0.09 hus cases in the 0- to 5-year age group and 0.1 and 0.5 hus cases in the >5-year age group. the expected pediatric hus cases do not differ considerably from those reported in italy by the minister of health. the model developed may be a useful tool for extending the assessment of the risk of campylobacteriosis and hus due to raw milk consumption at the national level in italy. considering the epidemiological implications of this study, the risk of illness linked to raw milk consumption should not be ignored and could be reduced by the use of simple  measures. boiling milk before consumption and strict control of temperatures by farmers during raw milk distribution have significant effects on campylobacteriosis and hus and are essential measures for risk management.

TI  == spatiotemporal analysis of cryptosporidium species/genotypes and relationships with other zoonotic pathogens in surface water from mixed-use watersheds.
AB  == nearly 690 raw surface water samples were collected during a 6-year period from multiple watersheds in the south nation river basin, ontario, canada. cryptosporidium oocysts in water samples were enumerated, sequenced, and genotyped by detailed phylogenetic analysis. the resulting species and genotypes  were assigned to broad, known host and human infection risk classes. wildlife/unknown, livestock, avian, and human host classes occurred in 21, 13, 3, and <1% of sampled surface waters, respectively. cryptosporidium andersoni was the most commonly detected livestock species, while muskrat i and ii genotypes were the most dominant wildlife genotypes. the presence of giardia spp., salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli o157:h7 was evaluated in all water samples. the greatest significant odds ratios (odds of pathogen presence when host class is present/odds of pathogen presence when host class is  absent) for giardia spp., campylobacter spp., and salmonella spp. in water were associated, respectively, with livestock (odds ratio of 3.1), avian (4.3), and livestock (9.3) host classes. classification and regression tree analyses (cart)  were used to group generalized host and human infection risk classes on the basis of a broad range of environmental and land use variables while tracking cooccurrence of zoonotic pathogens in these groupings. the occurrence of livestock-associated cryptosporidium was most strongly related to agricultural water pollution in the fall (conditions also associated with elevated odds ratios of other zoonotic pathogens occurring in water in relation to all sampling conditions), whereas wildlife/unknown sources of cryptosporidium were geospatially associated with smaller watercourses where urban/rural development was relatively lower. conditions that support wildlife may not necessarily increase overall human infection risks associated with cryptosporidium since most cryptosporidium genotypes classed as wildlife in this study (e.g., muskrat i and  ii genotype) do not pose significant infection risks to humans. consequently, from a human health perspective, land use practices in agricultural watersheds that create opportunities for wildlife to flourish should not be rejected solely  on the basis of their potential to increase relative proportions of wildlife fecal contamination in surface water. the present study suggests that mitigating  livestock fecal pollution in surface water in this region would likely reduce human infection risks associated with cryptosporidium and other zoonotic pathogens.

AB  == the effect of the main gangliosides (gm(1), gm(3), gd(3)) and free sialic acid (neu5ac) upon the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria implicated in infant diarrhoea  is assessed in vitro using the caco-2 cell line. concentrations of the bioactive  compounds found in the bioaccessible (soluble) fraction of infant formula and human milk are employed. bacterial adhesion behaviour included enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteropathogenic e.coli (epec), listeria monocytogenes,  salmonella entericaserovartyphi, shigella sonnei, campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter pylori. three different approaches were assayed: pre-incubation of bacteria and compounds before addition to cells (competition); pre-incubation of  the cells with compounds (exclusion); and pre-incubation of cells with bacteria (displacement). furthermore, the spatial localization of the most abundant gangliosides, gm(3) and gd(3), in caco-2 cells has been determined using confocal microscopy. results show that gm(3), gd(3), gm(1) and neu5ac at the assayed concentrations are able to interfere with the adhesion of several pathogenic bacteria involved in neonatal diseases-the greatest effect corresponding to neu5ac, followed by gd(3), gm(1) and gm(3). gangliosides gm(3) and gd(3) are located in the apical and basolateral membranes of the caco-2 cells.

TI  == the crystal structures of the alpha-subunit of the alpha(2)beta (2) tetrameric glycyl-trna synthetase.
AB  == aminoacyl-trna synthetases (aarss) are ligases (ec.6.1.1.-) that catalyze the acylation of amino acids to their cognate trnas in the process of translating genetic information from mrna to protein. their amino acid and trna specificity are crucial for correctly translating the genetic code. glycine is the smallest amino acid and the glycyl-trna synthetase (glyrs) belongs to class ii aarss. the  enzyme is unusual because it can assume different quaternary structures. in eukaryotes, archaebacteria and some bacteria, it forms an alpha(2) homodimer. in  some bacteria, glyrs is an alpha(2)beta(2) heterotetramer and shows a distant similarity to alpha(2) glyrss. the human pathogen eubacterium campylobacter jejuni glyrs (cjglyrs) is an alpha(2)beta(2) heterotetramer and is similar to escherichia coli glyrs; both are members of class iic aarss. the two-step aminoacylation reaction of tetrameric glyrss requires the involvement of both alpha- and beta-subunits. at present, the structure of the glyrs alpha(2)beta(2)  class and the details of the enzymatic mechanism of this enzyme remain unknown. here we report the crystal structures of the catalytic alpha-subunit of cjglyrs and its complexes with atp, and atp and glycine. these structures provide detailed information on substrate binding and show evidence for a proposed mechanism for amino acid activation and the formation of the glycyl-adenylate intermediate for class ii aarss.

TI  == engineering, conjugation, and immunogenicity assessment of escherichia coli o121  o antigen for its potential use as a typhoid vaccine component.
AB  == state-of-the-art production technologies for conjugate vaccines are complex, multi-step processes. an alternative approach to produce glycoconjugates is based on the bacterial n-linked protein glycosylation system first described in campylobacter jejuni. the c. jejuni n-glycosylation system has been successfully  transferred into escherichia coli, enabling in vivo production of customized recombinant glycoproteins. however, some antigenic bacterial cell surface polysaccharides, like the vi antigen of salmonella enterica serovar typhi, have not been reported to be accessible to the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase pglb, hence hamper development of novel conjugate vaccines against typhoid fever. in this report, vi-like polysaccharide structures that can be transferred by pglb were evaluated as typhoid vaccine components. a polysaccharide fulfilling these requirements was found in escherichia coli serovar o121. inactivation of the e. coli o121 o antigen cluster encoded gene wbqg resulted in expression of o polysaccharides reactive with antibodies raised against the vi antigen. the structure of the recombinantly expressed mutant o polysaccharide was elucidated using a novel hplc and mass spectrometry based method for purified undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (und-pp) linked glycans, and the presence of epitopes also found in the vi antigen was confirmed. the mutant o antigen structure was transferred to acceptor proteins using the bacterial n-glycosylation system, and immunogenicity  of the resulting conjugates was evaluated in mice. the conjugate-induced antibodies reacted in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with e. coli o121 lps. one animal developed a significant rise in serum immunoglobulin anti-vi titer upon immunization.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni csra complements an escherichia coli csra mutation for the regulation of biofilm formation, motility and cellular morphology but not glycogen accumulation.
AB  == background: although campylobacter jejuni is consistently ranked as one of the leading causes of bacterial diarrhea worldwide, the mechanisms by which c. jejuni causes disease and how they are regulated have yet to be clearly defined. the global regulator, csra, has been well characterized in several bacterial genera and is known to regulate a number of independent pathways via a post transcriptional mechanism, but remains relatively uncharacterized in the genus campylobacter. previously, we reported data illustrating the requirement for csra in several virulence related phenotypes of c. jejuni strain 81-176, indicating that the csr pathway is important for campylobacter pathogenesis. results: we compared the escherichia coli and c. jejuni orthologs of csra and characterized the ability of the c. jejuni csra protein to functionally complement an e. coli csra mutant. phylogenetic comparison of e. coli csra to orthologs from several pathogenic bacteria demonstrated variability in c. jejuni csra relative to the known rna binding domains of e. coli csra and in several amino acids reported to  be involved in e. coli csra-mediated gene regulation. when expressed in an e. coli csra mutant, c. jejuni csra succeeded in recovering defects in motility, biofilm formation, and cellular morphology; however, it failed to return excess glycogen accumulation to wild type levels. conclusions: these findings suggest that c. jejuni csra is capable of efficiently binding some e. coli csra binding sites, but not others, and provide insight into the biochemistry of c. jejuni csra.

TI  == the natural antimicrobial carvacrol inhibits campylobacter jejuni motility and infection of epithelial cells.
AB  == background: natural compounds with anti-microbial properties are attractive reagents to reduce the use of conventional antibiotics. carvacrol, the main constituent of oregano oil, inhibits the growth of a variety of bacterial foodborne pathogens. as concentrations of carvacrol may vary in vivo or when used in animal feed, we here investigated the effect of subinhibitory concentrations of the compound on major virulence traits of the principal bacterial foodborne pathogen campylobacter jejuni. methods/principal findings: motility assays revealed that subinhibitory concentrations of carvacrol inhibited the motility of c. jejuni without affecting bacterial growth. immunoblotting and electron microscopy showed that carvacrol-treated c. jejuni still expressed flagella. the  loss of motility was not caused by reduced intracellular atp levels. in vitro infection assays demonstrated that subinhibitory concentrations of carvacrol also abolished c. jejuni invasion of human epithelial cells. bacterial uptake of invasive escherichia coli was not blocked by carvacrol. exposure of c. jejuni to  carvacrol prior to infection also inhibited cellular infection, indicating that the inhibition of invasion was likely caused by an effect on the bacteria rather  than inhibition of epithelial cell function. conclusions/significance: bacterial  motility and invasion of eukaryotic cells are considered key steps in c. jejuni infection. our results indicate that subinhibitory concentrations of carvacrol effectively block these virulence traits by interfering with flagella function without disturbing intracellular atp levels. these results broaden the spectrum of anti-microbial activity of carvacrol and support the potential of the compound for use in novel infection prevention strategies.

TI  == an australian national survey of the microbiological quality of frozen boneless beef and beef primal cuts.
AB  == the fourth national baseline microbiological survey of australian beef was conducted in 2011, including frozen boneless beef and, for the first time, samples from selected beef primal cuts. cartons of frozen boneless beef (n = 1,165) sampled at 29 boning (fabrication) plants were found to have a mean total  viable count of 2.2 log cfu/g, and the mean count for the 2.1% of samples with detectable escherichia coli was 1.3 log cfu/g. the mean total viable counts for striploins (longissimus dorsi, n = 572) and outsides (biceps femoris, n = 572) were 1.3 and 1.5 log cfu/cm(2) respectively. e. coli isolates were obtained from  10.7 and 25.2% of striploins and outsides, respectively, with mean counts of -0.5 and -0.3 log cfu/cm(2) on positive samples. e. coli o157:h7, salmonella, and campylobacter were not isolated from any primal cut samples, and salmonella was not isolated from any of the boneless product (e. coli o157:h7 and campylobacter  were not tested for). listeria spp. were not detected in any of the boneless product, and one listeria isolate was obtained on 1 (0.2%) of 572 striploin samples. coagulase-positive staphylococci were isolated from 3.4% of boneless beef samples, 7.7% of beef striploins, and 8.4% of beef outsides, with positive samples having mean log counts of 1.9 cfu/g, 0.2 cfu/cm(2), and 0.2 cfu/cm(2), respectively.

TI  == structural insights from random mutagenesis of campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb.
AB  == background: protein glycosylation is of fundamental importance in many biological systems. the discovery of n-glycosylation in bacteria and the functional expression of the n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli enabled the production of engineered glycoproteins and the study of the underlying molecular mechanisms. a particularly promising application for  protein glycosylation in recombinant bacteria is the production of potent conjugate vaccines where polysaccharide antigens of pathogenic bacteria are covalently bound to immunogenic carrier proteins. results: in this study capsular polysaccharides of the clinically relevant pathogen staphylococcus aureus serotype 5 (cp5) were expressed in escherichia coli and linked in vivo to a detoxified version of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin (epa). we investigated which amino acids of the periplasmic domain of pglb are crucial for the glycosylation reaction using a newly established 96-well screening system enabling the relative quantification of glycoproteins by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. a random mutant library was generated by error-prone pcr and screened for inactivating amino acid substitutions. in addition to 15 inactive variants with amino acid changes within the previously known, strictly conserved  wwdyg motif of n-oligosaccharyltransferases, 8 inactivating mutations mapped to a flexible loop in close vicinity of the amide nitrogen atom of the acceptor asparagine as revealed in the crystal structure of the homologous enzyme c. lari  pglb. the importance of the conserved loop residue h479 for glycosylation was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis, while a change to alanine of the adjacent, non-conserved l480 had no effect. in addition, we investigated functional requirements in the so-called miv motif of bacterial n-oligosaccharyltransferases. amino acid residues i571 and v575, which had been postulated to interact with the acceptor peptide, were subjected to cassette saturation mutagenesis. with the exception of i571c only hydrophobic residues were found in active variants. variant i571v performed equally well as the wild type, cysteine at the same position reduced glycoprotein yield slightly, while a  change to phenylalanine reduced activity by a factor of three. conclusions: this  study provides novel structure-function relationships for the periplasmic domain  of the campylobacter jejuni n-oligosaccharyltransferase pglb and describes procedures for generating and screening oligosaccharyltransferase mutant libraries in an engineered e. coli system.

TI  == [zoonotic potential of raw cow's milk in the czech republic].
AB  == background: to assess current microbiological risks of raw cow's milk. the presented work reports the prevalence of selected bacteria on czech dairy farms in 2010 and compares the results with a similar study in 2002. material and methods: the prevalence of bacteria was studied by culture methods using milk filters made from non-woven fabric collected from dairy farms throughout the year 2010. together 260 filters from 65 dairy farms were tested. the prevalence of campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli o 157 and salmonella spp. in filters was tested. in staphylococci, genes encoding enterotoxin-production were studied. in campylobacter spp., resistance to antibiotics was ascertained. results: in 2010, the prevalence rates of selected bacteria on farms were as follows: campylobacter spp. 3%, escherichia coli o 157 0.4%, salmonella spp. 0.8%, listeria monocytogenes 10% and staphylococcus aureus 31%. in 12% of the tested filters, s. aureus with the genetic make-up for enterotoxin production was isolated. antibiotic resistance in campylobacter spp. isolated from dairy farms is different from that in human or poultry isolates. conclusion: raw cow's milk contains bacteria capable of causing human alimentary tract diseases. the above microbiological risks for consumers are eliminated by proper storage conditions (below 10 degrees c) and heat treatment (boiling) of raw milk.

TI  == quantification of bacterial indicators and zoonotic pathogens in dairy wastewater ponds.
AB  == zoonotic pathogens in land-applied dairy wastewaters are a potential health risk. the occurrence and abundance of 10 pathogens and 3 fecal indicators were determined by quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr) in samples from 30 dairy wastewaters from southern idaho. samples tested positive for campylobacter jejuni, stx(1)- and eaea-positive escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, and salmonella enterica, with mean recoveries of genomic dna corresponding to 10(2) to 10(4) cells ml(-1) wastewater. the most predominant organisms were c. jejuni and m. avium, being detected in samples from up to 21 and 29 of 30 wastewater ponds, respectively. the qpcr detection limits for the putative pathogens in the wastewaters ranged from 16 cells ml(-1) for m. avium to 1,689 oocysts ml(-1) for cryptosporidium. cryptosporidium and giardia spp., yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and pathogenic leptospira spp. were not detected by qpcr.

TI  == ranking the disease burden of 14 pathogens in food sources in the united states using attribution data from outbreak investigations and expert elicitation.
AB  == understanding the relative public health impact of major microbiological hazards  across the food supply is critical for a risk-based national food safety system.  this study was conducted to estimate the u.s. health burden of 14 major pathogens in 12 broad categories of food and to then rank the resulting 168 pathogen-food combinations. these pathogens examined were campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, norovirus, salmonella enterica, toxoplasma gondii, and all other foodnet pathogens. the health burden associated with each pathogen was measured using new estimates of the cost of illness and loss of quality-adjusted life years (qalys) from acute and chronic illness and mortality. a new method for attributing illness to foods  was developed that relies on both outbreak data and expert elicitation. this method assumes that empirical data are generally preferable to expert judgment; thus, outbreak data were used for attribution except where evidence suggests that these data are considered not representative of food attribution. based on evaluation of outbreak data, expert elicitation, and published scientific literature, outbreak-based attribution estimates for campylobacter, toxoplasma, cryptosporidium, and yersinia were determined not representative; therefore, expert-based attribution were included for these four pathogens. sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the effect of attribution data assumptions on rankings. disease burden was concentrated among a relatively small number of pathogen-food combinations. the top 10 pairs were responsible for losses of over  $8 billion and 36,000 qalys, or more than 50 % of the total across all pairs. across all 14 pathogens, poultry, pork, produce, and complex foods were responsible for nearly 60 % of the total cost of illness and loss of qalys.

TI  == foodborne pathogens in in-line milk filters and associated on-farm risk factors in dairy farms authorized to produce and sell raw milk in northern italy.
AB  == all dairy farms authorized to produce and sell raw milk in a province of northern italy were investigated to determine the presence of campylobacter spp., verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec), listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella spp. in in-line milk filters and to assess their association with suspected risk factors on farms. a logistic regression model was used to analyze  data collected describing the characteristics and management practices of 27 farms and the microbiological status of 378 in-line milk filters by both culture-based and molecular methods. thermotolerant campylobacter, vtec, and l. monocytogenes were detected in 24 (6.45%), 32 (8.4%), and 2 (0.5%) samples, respectively. no salmonella spp. were detected. for risk analysis, data of l. monocytogenes and salmonella spp. were not included in the model because of the low prevalence or absence of these organisms. the univariate analysis disclosed that the presence of vtec and/or campylobacter spp. in milk filters was associated with lack of cleanliness of bedding, water trough, and feed trough; nonevaluation of water hardness; lack of cleanliness of milk tank; and nonapplication of forestripping. after multivariate analysis, an association was  observed with inadequate cleanliness of bedding and milk tank and the nonapplication of forestripping. pcr analysis of milk filters was a rapid and sensitive method for the microbiological evaluation of herd contamination status  and should be included among the registration requirements for the authorization  to produce and sell raw milk. specific control actions must be incorporated into  the farmer's daily practices to ensure the low-risk production of raw milk.

AB  == freshly excreted canada goose faeces pose a public health risk as they contain pathogenic microorganisms. accordingly, a study was carried out on the growth and survival of resident indicator bacteria (enterococci and escherichia coli) and inoculated campylobacter jejuni in freshly excreted faeces over summer and winter. canada goose faeces were collected, mixed thoroughly and inoculated with  10(8) g(-)(1) c. jejuni. the faeces were mixed again before making the canada goose dropping. the simulated goose droppings (n = 70) were placed on pasture, and the concentrations of e. coli, enterococci and the pathogen, c. jejuni, were  monitored. in summer only, the molecular marker of e. coli lacz and the avian-associated bacteria e2 was also monitored. results of the survival study indicated that significant growth of enterococci and e. coli occurred in summer,  before concentrations decreased to less than 15% of the original concentration (day 77) for enterococci and 0.01% for e. coli. lacz followed a similar pattern to e. coli, while the e2 marker dropped to below 0.1% of the original concentration within 4 days. in winter, enterococci grew slightly, while no growth of e. coli occurred. in both summer and winter, c. jejuni was rapidly inactivated. this research highlights the ability of bacterial indicators to replicate and survive in the environment when harboured by avian faeces, and the  limited risk aged canada goose faeces pose as an environmental source of campylobacter spp.

TI  == are organic foods safer or healthier than conventional alternatives?: a systematic review.
AB  == background: the health benefits of organic foods are unclear. purpose: to review  evidence comparing the health effects of organic and conventional foods. data sources: medline (january 1966 to may 2011), embase, cab direct, agricola, toxnet, cochrane library (january 1966 to may 2009), and bibliographies of retrieved articles. study selection: english-language reports of comparisons of organically and conventionally grown food or of populations consuming these foods. data extraction: 2 independent investigators extracted data on methods, health outcomes, and nutrient and contaminant levels. data synthesis: 17 studies  in humans and 223 studies of nutrient and contaminant levels in foods met inclusion criteria. only 3 of the human studies examined clinical outcomes, finding no significant differences between populations by food type for allergic  outcomes (eczema, wheeze, atopic sensitization) or symptomatic campylobacter infection. two studies reported significantly lower urinary pesticide levels among children consuming organic versus conventional diets, but studies of biomarker and nutrient levels in serum, urine, breast milk, and semen in adults did not identify clinically meaningful differences. all estimates of differences  in nutrient and contaminant levels in foods were highly heterogeneous except for  the estimate for phosphorus; phosphorus levels were significantly higher than in  conventional produce, although this difference is not clinically significant. the risk for contamination with detectable pesticide residues was lower among organic than conventional produce (risk difference, 30% [ci, -37% to -23%]), but differences in risk for exceeding maximum allowed limits were small. escherichia  coli contamination risk did not differ between organic and conventional produce.  bacterial contamination of retail chicken and pork was common but unrelated to farming method. however, the risk for isolating bacteria resistant to 3 or more antibiotics was higher in conventional than in organic chicken and pork (risk difference, 33% [ci, 21% to 45%]). limitation: studies were heterogeneous and limited in number, and publication bias may be present. conclusion: the published literature lacks strong evidence that organic foods are significantly more nutritious than conventional foods. consumption of organic foods may reduce exposure to pesticide residues and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. primary funding source: none.

TI  == identification of cj1051c as a major determinant for the restriction barrier of campylobacter jejuni strain nctc11168.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of human diarrheal illness in the world,  and research on it has benefitted greatly by the completion of several genome sequences and the development of molecular biology tools. however, many hurdles remain for a full understanding of this unique bacterial pathogen. one of the most commonly used strains for genetic work with c. jejuni is nctc11168. while this strain is readily transformable with dna for genomic recombination, transformation with plasmids is problematic. in this study, we have identified a  determinant of this to be cj1051c, predicted to encode a restriction-modification type iig enzyme. knockout mutagenesis of this gene resulted in a strain with a 1,000-fold-enhanced transformation efficiency with a plasmid purified from a c. jejuni host. additionally, this mutation conferred the ability to be transformed  by plasmids isolated from an escherichia coli host. sequence analysis suggested a high level of variability of the specificity domain between strains and that this gene may be subject to phase variation. we provide evidence that cj1051c is active in nctc11168 and behaves as expected for a type iig enzyme. the identification of this determinant provides a greater understanding of the molecular biology of c. jejuni as well as a tool for plasmid work with strain nctc11168.

TI  == polynucleotide phosphorylase has an impact on cell biology of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == polynucleotide phosphorylase (pnpase), encoded by the pnp gene, is known to degrade mrna, mediating post-transcriptional regulation and may affect cellular functions. the role of pnpase is pleiotropic. as orthologs of the two major ribonucleases (rnase e and rnase ii) of escherichia coli are missing in the campylobacter jejuni genome, in the current study the focus has been on the c. jejuni ortholog of pnpase. the effect of pnpase mutation on c. jejuni phenotypes  and proteome was investigated. the inactivation of the pnp gene reduced significantly the ability of c. jejuni to adhere and to invade ht-29 cells. moreover, the pnp mutant strain exhibited a decrease in c. jejuni swimming ability and chick colonization. to explain effects of pnpase on c. jejuni 81-176  phenotype, the proteome of the pnp mutant and parental strains were compared. overall, little variation in protein production was observed. despite the predicted role of pnpase in mrna regulation, the pnp mutation did not induce profound proteomic changes suggesting that other ribonucleases in c. jejuni might ensure this biological function in the absence of pnpase. nevertheless, synthesis of proteins which are involved in virulence (luxs, peb3), motility (n-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase), stress-response (kata, dnak, hsp90), and translation system (ef-tu, ef-g) were modified in the pnp mutant strain suggesting a more specific role of pnpase in c. jejuni. in conclusion, pnpase deficiency induces limited but important consequences on c. jejuni biology that could explain swimming limitation, chick colonization delay, and the decrease of  cell adhesion/invasion ability.

TI  == garlic derivative propyl propane thiosulfonate is effective against broiler enteropathogens in vivo.
AB  == two experiments were carried out to study the effects of dietary supplementation  with the garlic (allium sativum)-derived product propyl propane thiosulfonate (pts-o) on the intestinal log(10) number of copies of enteropathogens in broiler  chickens, together with their intestinal morphology and growth performance. the additive had no significant effect on feed intake at any dose assayed. in experiment 1 (1 to 21 d of age), the bw of chickens fed on 45 mg of pts-o/kg of diet was higher (p < 0.01) than that of controls. birds fed on diets containing 45 and 90 mg of pts-o/kg of diet had improved (p < 0.01) feed:gain ratios compared with the controls at 21 d of age. ileal villus height, width and surface area, mucosal thickness, and muscular layer thickness were considerably greater (p < 0.01) than control values in chickens fed 90 mg of pts-o/kg of diet. the clostridium perfringens log(10) number of counts was not significantly affected at any dose assayed. the inclusion of pts-o at both concentrations (45 and 90 mg/kg of diet) resulted in lower (p < 0.01) log(10) number of copies of ileal salmonella spp. and crop enterobacteria and escherichia coli. the inclusion of 90 mg of pts-o/kg of diet also resulted in lower (p < 0.01) enterobacteria and e. coli log(10) numbers of copies in the ileal and cecal contents, respectively. the number of copies of campylobacter jejuni was not significantly affected. in experiment 2 (15 to 28 d of age), lower (p < 0.01) log(10) number of copies of salmonella spp. and c. jejuni were determined in the ileal contents of chickens fed on diets containing 135 mg of pts-o/kg of diet. the addition of 90 mg of pts-o/kg of diet lowered (p < 0.01) only the number of copies of ileal salmonella spp. this investigation confirmed previous in vitro data and showed that pts-o lowered the intestinal numbers of enteropathogens and improved the ileal histological structure and productive parameters of broilers.

TI  == chemical properties and antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of slovenian propolis.
AB  == the chemical composition as well as the antioxidant and antimicrobial activities  of two etoh extracts of propolis (pees) from slovenia were determined. etoh was used as extracting solvent at 70 and 96%, providing the extracts pee70 and pee96, respectively. the extraction with 70% etoh was more efficient than that with 96%  etoh, as the pee70 was richer in total phenolic compounds than the pee96. the slovenian propolis was characterized by different phenolic acids and flavonoids.  the pee96 was slightly richer in three specific compounds, i.e., caffeic acid, ferulic acid, and luteolin, while all other substances detected showed higher contents in the pee70. the pee70 showed a stronger reducing power and ability to  scavenge free radicals and metal ions than the pee96. both pees were in the main  more effective against gram-positive bacteria than against fungi and gram-negative bacteria like salmonella and escherichia coli, with the exception of campylobacter. the pee96 decreased the intracellular oxidation in saccharomyces cerevisiae in a dose-dependent manner. the antimicrobial activities and antioxidant properties were related to the total phenolic contents. the two pees have the potential for use as natural antimicrobial and antioxidant additives in foods.

TI  == influence of asellus aquaticus on escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni and naturally occurring heterotrophic bacteria in drinking water.
AB  == water lice, asellus aquaticus (isopoda), frequently occur in drinking water distribution systems where they are a nuisance to consumers and water utilities.  whether they are solely an aesthetic problem or also affect the microbial water quality is a matter of interest. we studied the influence of a. aquaticus on microbial water quality in non-chlorinated drinking water in controlled laboratory experiments. pure cultures of the indicator organisms escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae and the pathogen campylobacter jejuni as well as naturally occurring heterotrophic drinking water bacteria (measured as heterotrophic plate counts, hpc) were investigated in microcosms at 7 degrees c,  containing non-sterilised drinking water, drinking water sediment and a. aquaticus collected from a non-chlorinated ground water based drinking water supply system. concentrations of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and c. jejuni decreased over time, following a first order decay with half lives of 5.3, 18.4 and 1.3 days, respectively. a. aquaticus did not affect survival of indicators and pathogens substantially whereas hpc were influenced by presence of dead a. aquaticus. growth rates increased with an average of 48% for bacteria grown on r-2a agar and an average of 83% for bacteria grown on yeast extract agar when dead a. aquaticus were present compared to no and living a. aquaticus present. a. aquaticus associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae and c. jejuni were measured (up to 25 per living and 500 per dead a. aquaticus) and so were a. aquaticus associated heterotrophic bacteria (>1.8*10(4) cfu per living and >6*10(4) cfu per dead a. aquaticus). a. aquaticus did not serve as an optimised habitat that increased survival of indicators and pathogens, since a. aquaticus associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae and c. jejuni were only measured as long as the bacteria were also present in the water and sediment.

TI  == prevalence of staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) in food samples associated with foodborne illness in alberta, canada from 2007 to 2010.
AB  == consumption of foods containing staphylococcus aureus can cause severe gastro-intestinal illness. given the fact that over the past decade, canada has seen increasing rates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) carriage and infection, the objective of this study was to investigate the impact of methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) and mrsa on foodborne illness in alberta, canada. between january 2007 and december 2010, there were 693 food samples associated with foodborne investigations submitted to the alberta provincial laboratory for public health (provlab). these foods were screened for: bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, s. aureus, aeromonas spp., campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, shigella spp., and yersinia spp. s. aureus was identified in 10.5% (73/693) of samples, and of these, 59% (43/73) were co-contaminated with at least one other organism on the screening panel. the s. aureus positive samples included 29 meat, 20 prepared foods containing meat, 11 prepared foods not containing meat, 10 dairy, and three produce. methicillin-resistance was not detected in any isolates tested. these findings indicate that the presence of s. aureus in food associated with foodborne investigations is a cause for concern, and although mrsa was not found, the potential for outbreaks exists, and ongoing surveillance should be sustained.

TI  == temporal flux and spatial dynamics of nutrients, fecal indicators, and zoonotic pathogens in anaerobic swine manure lagoon water.
AB  == confined animal feeding operations (cafos) often use anaerobic lagoons for manure treatment. in the usa, swine cafo lagoon water is used for crop irrigation that is regulated by farm-specific nutrient management plans (nmps). implementation of stricter us environmental regulations in 2013 will set soil p limits; impacting land applications of manure and requiring revision of nmps. precise knowledge of  lagoon water quality is needed for formulating nmps, for understanding losses of  n and c in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions, and for understanding risks of environmental contamination by fecal bacteria, including zoonotic pathogens. in this study we determined year-round levels of nutrients and bacteria from swine cafo lagoon water. statistical analysis of data for ph, electrical conductivity (ec), inorganic and organic c, total n, water-soluble and total minerals (ca, cu, fe, k, mg, mn, p, and zn) and bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococci, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter spp., listeria spp., salmonella spp., and  staphylococci) showed that all differed significantly by dates of collection. during the irrigation season, levels of total n decreased by half and the n:p ratio changed from 9.7 to 2.8. some seasonal differences were correlated with temperature. total n and inorganic c increased below 19 degrees c, and decreased  above 19 degrees c, consistent with summer increases in ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions. water-soluble cu, fe, and zn increased with higher summer temperatures while enterococci and zoonotic pathogens (campylobacter, listeria, and salmonella) decreased. although their populations changed seasonally, the zoonotic pathogens were present year-round. increasing levels of e. coli were statistically correlated with increasing ph. differences between depths were also found. organic c, total nutrients (c, ca, cu, fe, mg, mn, n, p, and zn) and c. perfringens were higher in deeper samples, indicating stratification of these parameters. no statistical interactions were found between collection dates and depths.

TI  == do globins in microaerophilic campylobacter jejuni confer nitrosative stress tolerance under oxygen limitation?
AB  == the microaerophilic pathogen campylobacter jejuni possesses inducible systems for resisting no. two globins--cgb (a single-domain globin) and ctb (a truncated globin)--are up-regulated in response to no via the positively acting transcription factor nssr. our aims were to determine whether these oxygen-binding globins also function in severely oxygen-limited environments, as  in the host. at growth-limiting oxygen transfer rates, bacteria were more s-nitrosoglutathione (gsno) sensitive, irrespective of the presence of cgb, ctb,  or nssr. pregrowth of cells with gsno enhanced gsno resistance, even in nssr and  cgb mutants, but transcriptomic profiling of oxygen-limited, no-exposed cells failed to reveal the nssr regulon. nevertheless, globin expression in an escherichia coli mutant lacking the no-detoxifying flavohemoglobin hmp showed that cgb and ctb consume no aerobically or anoxically and offer some protection to respiratory inhibition by no. the constitutively expressed nitrite reductase nrfa does not provide resistance under oxygen-limited conditions. we, therefore,  hypothesize that, although cgb and nrfa can detoxify no, even anoxically, they are neither up-regulated nor functional under physiologically relevant oxygen-limited conditions and, second, responses to no do not stem from trancriptional regulation.

TI  == salmonella identification from foods in eight hours: a prototype study with salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == background and objectives: the significant rise in food borne infections is mainly caused by campylobacter spp., salmonella serovars and verotoxigenic escherichia coli. as the emerging food borne pathogens cause disease, more studies have been conducted for rapid detection of these pathogens. the combination of immunomagnetic separation and polymerase chain reaction (ims-pcr)  is the most accurate and rapid test preferred by almost every researcher. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir) is preferred for being a new, user friendly and rapid technique in microbiological analyses. the main aim of this study is to detect application of ims-ftir for salmonella identification from foods in a short time with a higher sensitivity. materials and methods: conventional culture technique (cc), ims-cc, ims-pcr and ims-ftir techniques were compared with each other for rapid detection in artificially contaminated minced  beef with salmonella typhimurium, as of the 2(nd), 4(th) and 8(th) hours of contamination. the method was evaluated in different food matrices and sensitivity, specifity and overall recovery was calculated. results: the results  indicate that ims-ftir can detect s. typhimurium as of the 8(th) hour with sensitivity of 95.6667, accuracy of 91.69329, false positive ratio of 0.04333 and overall recovery of 95.66%. conclusion: it can be suggested that the ims-ftir method is capable of detecting s.typhimurium in a short time with lower cost.

TI  == cloning, expression, and antigenicity of 14 proteins from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == fourteen campylobacter jejuni genes--pora, cadf, omp18, dnak, flac, peb1, peb2, peb3, peb4, ahpc, groel, tuf, hipo, and cj0069--were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli bl21. the recombinant proteins were purified on histidine (his)  and glutathione s-transferase (gst) trap columns using the akta explorer 100 system. recombinant proteins were visualized using sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and identified using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. the antigenicities  of these recombinant proteins were assessed by western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays with anti-c. jejuni immune rabbit sera. four recombinant proteins, including rgst-pora, rhis-cadf, rgst-groel, and rgst-tuf, demonstrated  reactions with both anti-serum and preimmune serum, while rhis-dnak, rgst-flac, rgst-peb2, rgst-peb3, rgst-peb4, and rgst-hipo showed variable antigenicity characteristics to the anti-sera derived from different c. jejuni strains. rhis-omp18, rhis-peb1, and rgst-ahpc demonstrated universal and specific antigenities with the entire anti-sera panel tested in this present study, while  recombinant rgst-cj0069 and rhis-dnak did not react with any of the anti-c. jejuni sera tested. in conclusion, rgst-ahpc may be useful as a potential serodiagnostic antigen for c. jejuni infection.

TI  == modification of the campylobacter jejuni n-linked glycan by eptc protein-mediated addition of phosphoethanolamine.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the major worldwide cause of bacterial gastroenteritis. c. jejuni possesses an extensive repertoire of carbohydrate structures that decorate both protein and non-protein surface-exposed structures. an n-linked glycosylation system encoded by the pgl gene cluster mediates the synthesis of a  rigidly conserved heptasaccharide that is attached to protein substrates or released as free oligosaccharide in the periplasm. removal of n-glycosylation results in reduced virulence and impeded host cell attachment. since the n-glycan is conserved, the n-glycosylation system is also an attractive option for glycoengineering recombinant vaccines in escherichia coli. to determine whether non-canonical n-glycans are present in c. jejuni, we utilized high throughput glycoproteomics to characterize c. jejuni jhh1 and identified 93 glycosylation sites, including 34 not previously reported. interrogation of these data allowed  the identification of a phosphoethanolamine (petn)-modified variant of the n-glycan that was attached to multiple proteins. the petn moiety was attached to  the terminal galnac of the canonical n-glycan. deletion of the petn transferase eptc removed all evidence of the petn-glycan but did not globally influence protein reactivity to patient sera, whereas deletion of the pglb oligosaccharyltransferase significantly reduced reactivity. transfer of eptc and  the pgl gene cluster to e. coli confirmed the addition of the petn-glycan to a target c. jejuni protein. significantly reduced, yet above background levels of petn-glycan were also observed in e. coli not expressing eptc, suggesting that endogenous e. coli petn transferases can mediate the addition of petn to n-glycans. the addition of petn must be considered in the context of glycoengineering and may alter c. jejuni glycan-mediated structure-function interactions.

TI  == ready-to-eat vegetables production with low-level water chlorination. an evaluation of water quality, and of its impact on end products.
AB  == introduction: we evaluated the microbiological impact of low-level chlorination (1 ppm free chlorine) on the production of ready-to-eat (rte) vegetables by monitoring the microbiological quality of irrigation and processing water in two  production plants over a 4-season period, as well as the microbiological quality  of unprocessed vegetables and rte product. water samples were also characterized  in terms of some chemical and physico-chemical parameters of relevance in chlorination management. materials and methods: both producers use water with maximum 1 ppm free chlorine for vegetables rinsing, while the two processes differ by the number of washing cycles. results and conclusions: salmonella spp and campylobacter spp were detected once in two different irrigation water samples out of nine from one producer. no pathogens were found in the vegetable samples. as expected, the procedure encompassing more washing cycles performed slightly better in terms of total mesophilic count (tmc) when comparing unprocessed and rte vegetables of the same batch. however, data suggest that low-level chlorination may be insufficient in preventing microbial build-up in the washing equipment and/or batch-to batch cross-contamination.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a pediatric emergency department: a case control study.
AB  == background: the etiology of childhood diarrhea is frequently unknown. methods: we sought aeromonas, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157:h7, pleisiomonas shigelloides, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, and yersinia (by culture), adenoviruses, astroviruses, noroviruses, rotavirus, and shiga toxin-producing e.  coli (stec; by enzyme immunoassay), clostridium difficile (by cytotoxicity), parasites (by microscopy), and enteroaggregative e. coli (eaec; by polymerase chain reaction [pcr] analysis) in the stools of 254 children with diarrhea presenting to a pediatric emergency facility. age- and geographic-matched community controls without diarrhea (n = 452) were similarly studied, except bacterial cultures of the stool were limited only to cases. results: twenty-nine  (11.4%) case stools contained 13 salmonella, 10 stec (6 o157:h7 and 4 non-o157:h7 serotypes), 5 campylobacter, and 2 shigella. pcr-defined eaec were present more often in case (3.2%) specimens than in control (0.9%) specimens (adjusted odds ratio [or], 3.9; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.1-13.7), and their adherence phenotypes were variable. rotavirus, astrovirus, and adenovirus were more common  among cases than controls, but both groups contained noroviruses and c. difficile at similar rates. pcr evidence of hypervirulent c. difficile was found in case and control stools; parasites were much more common in control specimens. conclusions: eaec are associated with childhood diarrhea in seattle, but the optimal way to identify these agents warrants determination. children without diarrhea harbor diarrheagenic pathogens, including hypervirulent c. difficile. our data support the importance of taking into account host susceptibility, microbial density, and organism virulence traits in future case-control studies,  not merely categorizing candidate pathogens as being present or absent.

TI  == microbiology of raw milk in new zealand.
AB  == the results of this study demonstrate the occurrence of the non-spore-forming pathogens, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli (total count and o157:h7), listeria, campylobacter and salmonella, in new zealand's raw milk supply. samples of raw milk were collected monthly within five major dairying regions over one year. each month, samples from five randomly selected farm vats in each region were collected for analysis (297 samples in total). methods based on plate count  techniques were used to enumerate s. aureus and e. coli. enrichment methods in combination with a modified most probable number detection method were used to monitor samples for the presence of e. coli o157:h7, listeria, campylobacter and  salmonella. salmonella was not detected in this study, and campylobacter was isolated once (0.34%). e. coli was present at <100 cfu/ml in 99% of samples and exceeded 10(3)cfu/ml in 0.7% of samples. e. coli o157:h7 was not detected whereas non-pathogenic e. coli o157 strains (i.e. lacking genes for stx1, stx2, eae and hly a) were detected in 1% of samples. s. aureus was not detected (<1 cfu/ml) in  21% of samples; levels were >1 but <100 cfu/ml in 60% of samples and on one occasion (0.34%) s. aureus exceeded 10(4)cfu/ml. l. monocytogenes was isolated from 0.68% of samples and l. innocua was present in 4% of samples. the results demonstrate that raw milk sampled from farm vats in new zealand, as in other countries, inevitably contains recognised pathogens and, hence, control by pasteurisation or an equivalent treatment of raw milk remains paramount. even so, the prevalence of most of these pathogens was lower than those reported in many of the studies performed in other countries.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of emerging foodborne pathogens: status quo and global trends.
AB  == emerging foodborne pathogens are challenging subjects of food microbiology with their antibiotic resistance and their impact on public health. campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp. and verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) are significant emerging food pathogens, globally. the decrease in supply and increase in demand  lead developed countries to produce animal products with a higher efficiency. the massive production has caused the increase of the significant foodborne diseases. the strict control of food starting from farm to fork has been held by different  regulations. official measures have been applied to combat these pathogens. in 2005 eu declared that, an eu-wide ban on the use of antibiotics as growth promoters in animal feed would be applied on 1 january 2006. the ban is the final step in the phasing out of antibiotics used for non-medical purposes. it is a part of the commission's strategy to tackle the emergence of bacteria and other microbes resistant to antibiotics, due to their overexploitation or misuse. as the awareness raises more countries banned application of antibiotics as growth promoter, but the resistance of the emerging foodborne pathogens do not represent decrease. currently, the main concern of food safety is counter measures against  resistant bugs.

TI  == electrochemical immunosensor for multiplexed detection of food-borne pathogens using nanocrystal bioconjugates and mwcnt screen-printed electrode.
AB  == bacterial food poisoning is an ever-present threat that can be prevented with proper care and handling of food products. a disposable electrochemical immunosensor for the simultaneous measurements of common food pathogenic bacteria namely escherichia coli o157:h7 (e. coli), campylobacter and salmonella were developed. the immunosensor was fabricated by immobilizing the mixture of anti-e. coli, anti-campylobacter and anti-salmonella antibodies with a ratio of 1:1:1 on  the surface of the multiwall carbon nanotube-polyallylamine modified screen printed electrode (mwcnt-pah/spe). bacteria suspension became attached to the immobilized antibodies when the immunosensor was incubated in liquid samples. the sandwich immunoassay was performed with three antibodies conjugated with specific nanocrystal (alpha-e. coli-cds, alpha-campylobacter-pbs and alpha-salmonella-cus) which has releasable metal ions for electrochemical measurements. the square wave anodic stripping voltammetry (swasv) was employed to measure released metal ions  from bound antibody nanocrystal conjugates. the calibration curves for three selected bacteria were found in the range of 1x10(3)-5x10(5) cells ml(-1) with the limit of detection (lod) 400 cells ml(-1) for salmonella, 400 cells ml(-1) for campylobacter and 800 cells ml(-1) for e. coli. the precision and sensitivity of this method show the feasibility of multiplexed determination of bacteria in milk samples.

TI  == barriers to horizontal gene transfer in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is among the most frequent agent of foodborne gastroenteritis in the world, but its physiology and pathogenesis is less well understood than other bacterial enteric pathogens. this is due in part to the incompatibility of the molecular tools that have enabled advances in the characterization of other bacterial species. most notably, the dearth of plasmid-based complementation, reporter assays, and plasmid-based unmarked mutagenesis procedures in many of the type strains has hindered research progress. the techniques themselves are not inadequate in campylobacter species,  but rather the barrier to genetic transfer of these genetic constructs from non-campylobacter cloning stains such as escherichia coli. here, we review the modes of genetic transfer in c. jejuni and review the current state of research into the mechanism of each. also reviewed are two systems (crispr-cas and restriction modification) that are common to many strains of c. jejuni and are at least partly responsible for these barriers.

TI  == intestinal microbiota shifts towards elevated commensal escherichia coli loads abrogate colonization resistance against campylobacter jejuni in mice.
AB  == background: the zoonotic pathogen campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of bacterial foodborne enterocolitis in humans worldwide. the understanding of immunopathology underlying human campylobacteriosis is hampered by the fact that  mice display strong colonization resistance against the pathogen due to their host specific gut microbiota composition. methodology/principal findings: since the microbiota composition changes significantly during intestinal inflammation we dissected factors contributing to colonization resistance against c. jejuni in murine ileitis, colitis and in infant mice. in contrast to healthy animals c. jejuni could stably colonize mice suffering from intestinal inflammation. strikingly, in mice with toxoplasma gondii-induced acute ileitis, c. jejuni disseminated to mesenteric lymphnodes, spleen, liver, kidney, and blood. in infant mice c. jejuni infection induced enterocolitis. mice suffering from intestinal inflammation and c. jejuni susceptible infant mice displayed characteristical microbiota shifts dominated by increased numbers of commensal escherichia coli. to further dissect the pivotal role of those distinct microbiota shifts in abrogating colonization resistance, we investigated c. jejuni infection in healthy adult mice in which the microbiota was artificially modified by feeding live commensal e. coli. strikingly, in animals harboring supra-physiological intestinal e. coli loads, colonization resistance was significantly diminished and c. jejuni infection induced enterocolitis mimicking  key features of human campylobacteriosis. conclusion/significance: murine colonization resistance against c. jejuni is abrogated by changes in the microbiota composition towards elevated e. coli loads during intestinal inflammation as well as in infant mice. intestinal inflammation and microbiota shifts thus represent potential risk factors for c. jejuni infection. corresponding interplays between c. jejuni and microbiota might occur in human campylobacteriosis. murine models introduced here mimick key features of human campylobacteriosis and allow for further analysis of immunological and molecular  mechanisms of c. jejuni-host interactions.

TI  == seasonality in human zoonotic enteric diseases: a systematic review.
AB  == background: although seasonality is a defining characteristic of many infectious  diseases, few studies have described and compared seasonal patterns across diseases globally, impeding our understanding of putative mechanisms. here, we review seasonal patterns across five enteric zoonotic diseases: campylobacteriosis, salmonellosis, vero-cytotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec), cryptosporidiosis and giardiasis in the context of two primary drivers of seasonality: (i) environmental effects on pathogen occurrence and pathogen-host associations and (ii) population characteristics/behaviour. methodology/principal findings: we systematically reviewed published literature from 1960-2010, resulting in the review of 86 studies across the five diseases. the gini coefficient compared temporal variations in incidence across diseases and the monthly seasonality index characterised timing of seasonal peaks. consistent seasonal patterns across transnational boundaries, albeit with regional variations was observed. the bacterial diseases all had a distinct summer peak, with identical gini values for campylobacteriosis and salmonellosis (0.22) and a  higher index for vtec (gini 0.36). cryptosporidiosis displayed a bi-modal peak with spring and summer highs and the most marked temporal variation (gini = 0.39). giardiasis showed a relatively small summer increase and was the least variable (gini = 0.18). conclusions/significance: seasonal variation in enteric zoonotic diseases is ubiquitous, with regional variations highlighting complex environment-pathogen-host interactions. results suggest that proximal environmental influences and host population dynamics, together with distal, longer-term climatic variability could have important direct and indirect consequences for future enteric disease risk. additional understanding of the concerted influence of these factors on disease patterns may improve assessment and prediction of enteric disease burden in temperate, developed countries.

TI  == microbiological baseline study of beef and pork carcasses from provincially inspected abattoirs in alberta, canada.
AB  == in 2006 and 2007 beef and pork carcass swabs from provincially inspected abattoirs in alberta, canada were tested to determine the levels of total aerobic bacteria, coliform bacteria, and generic escherichia coli, and the prevalence of  salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and shiga toxin-producing e. coli (stec). swabs from beef and pork carcasses from 48 and 34 facilities, respectively, were  analyzed. all samples tested were positive for aerobic bacteria with 99.8% of beef and 96.0% of pork samples, having total counts of </= 100 000 cfu/cm(2). coliform bacteria were isolated from 22.4% and 42.0% of beef and pork carcass samples, respectively. generic e. coli were recovered from 14.6% of beef and 33.7% of pork carcass samples. for beef carcasses, positive tests were obtained for 0.1% of 1036 samples tested for salmonella spp., 1.5% of 1022 samples tested  for campylobacter spp. and 5.4% of 1018 samples tested for stec. for pork carcasses, positive tests were obtained for 1.6 % of 1076 samples tested for salmonella spp., 8.8% of 1070 samples tested for campylobacter spp. and 4.8% of 1067 samples tested for stec.

TI  == persistence of host-associated bacteroidales gene markers and their quantitative  detection in an urban and agricultural mixed prairie watershed.
AB  == microbial source tracking is an emerging tool developed to protect water sources  from faecal pollution. in this study, we evaluated the suitability of real time-quantitative pcr (qpcr) taqman assays developed for detection of host-associated bacteroidales markers in a prairie watershed. the qpcr primers and probes used in this study exhibited high accuracy (88-96% sensitivity and >/= 99% host specificity) in detecting bacteroidales spp. that are associated with faeces from humans, ruminants, bovines, and horses. the ruminant- and human-associated markers were also found in high concentrations within individual faecal samples, ranging from 3.4 to 7.3 log(10) marker copy numberg(-1) of individual host faeces. following validation of host sensitivity and specificity, the host-associated bacteroidales markers were detected in the qu'appelle valley  watershed of saskatchewan, canada which experiences a diversity of anthropogenic  inputs. concentrations of the ruminant marker were well-correlated with proximity to cattle operations and there was a correlation between the marker and escherichia coli concentrations at these sites. low concentrations of the human faecal marker were measured throughout the sampling sites, and may indicate a consistent influx of human faecal pollution into the watershed area. persistence  of each of the bacteroidales host-associated marker was also studied in situ. the results indicated that the markers persist for shorter periods of time (99% decay in <8 days) compared with the conventional e. coli marker (99% decay in >15 days), suggesting they are effective at detecting recent faecal contamination events. the levels of bacteroidales markers and e. coli counts did not correlate  with the presence of the pathogenic bacteria, salmonella spp. or campylobacter spp. detected in the qu'appelle valley. collectively, the results obtained in this study demonstrated that the qpcr approach for detecting host-associated bacteroidales spp. markers can be a useful tool in helping to determine host-specific impacts of faecal pollution into a prairie watershed.

TI  == zoonotic agents in small ruminants kept on city farms in southern germany.
AB  == sheep and goats are popular examples of livestock kept on city farms. in these settings, close contacts between humans and animals frequently occur. although it is widely accepted that small ruminants can carry numerous zoonotic agents, it is unknown which of these agents actually occur in sheep and goats on city farms in  germany. we sampled feces and nasal liquid of 48 animals (28 goats, 20 sheep) distributed in 7 city farms and on one activity playground in southern germany. we found that 100% of the sampled sheep and 89.3% of the goats carried shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec). the presence of staphylococcus spp. in 75% of both sheep and goats could be demonstrated. campylobacter spp. were detected in 25% and 14.3% of the sheep and goats, respectively. neither salmonella spp. nor coxiella burnetii was found. on the basis of these data, we propose a reasonable hygiene scheme to prevent transmission of zoonotic agents during city farm visits.

TI  == an engineered eukaryotic protein glycosylation pathway in escherichia coli.
AB  == we performed bottom-up engineering of a synthetic pathway in escherichia coli for the production of eukaryotic trimannosyl chitobiose glycans and the transfer of these glycans to specific asparagine residues in target proteins. the glycan biosynthesis was enabled by four eukaryotic glycosyltransferases, including the yeast uridine diphosphate-n-acetylglucosamine transferases alg13 and alg14 and the mannosyltransferases alg1 and alg2. by including the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase pglb from campylobacter jejuni, we successfully transferred glycans to eukaryotic proteins.

TI  == identification of antigenic epitopes of the sapa protein of campylobacter fetus using a phage display peptide library.
AB  == in this study, we immunized mice with prokaryotically expressed recombinant surface layer protein, sapa, of campylobacter fetus, generated hybridomas secreting mouse monoclonal antibodies (mab) targeting sapa, and purified the mab  a2d5 from mouse ascites using saturated ammonium sulfate solution. the mab a2d5,  coated onto elisa plates, was used to screen the phage random 12-peptide library  through three rounds of panning. following panning, 15 phage clones were randomly chosen and tested for reactivity with mab a2d5 by indirect elisa. single-stranded dna from positive clones was sequenced and compared with the sequence of sapa to  predict the key epitope. elisa and/or western blot analyses further validated that synthetic peptides and recombinant peptide mimotopes all interact with mab a2d5. nine of ten positive phage clones identified by screening were sequenced successfully. seven clones shared the same sequence hydrhnyhwwht; one had the sequence lsknlpltalgn; and the final one had the sequence sgmkepelrsys. these three sequences shared high homology with sapa j05577 in the region gnekdfvtkiysialgntsdvdginyw, in which the underlined amino acids may serve as key residues in the epitope. elisa and/or western blot analyses showed that mab a2d5  not only interacted with the four synthetic peptide mimotopes, but also with 14 prokaryotically expressed recombinant peptide mimotopes. the mimotopes identified in this study will aid future studies into the pathological processes and immune  mechanisms of the sapa protein of c. fetus.

TI  == high pressure inactivation of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, and spoilage microbiota on poultry meat.
AB  == this study evaluated the high pressure inactivation of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and poultry meat spoilage organisms. all treatments were performed in aseptically prepared minced poultry meat. treatment of 19 strains of c. jejuni at 300 mpa and 30 degrees c revealed a large variation of pressure resistance. the recovery of pressure-induced sublethally injured c. jejuni depended on the availability of iron. the addition of iron content to enumeration media was required for resuscitation of sublethally injured cells. survival of c. jejuni during storage of refrigerated poultry meat was analyzed in fresh and pressuretreated poultry meat, and in the presence or absence of spoilage microbiota. the presence of spoilage microbiota did not significantly influence the survival of c. jejuni. pressure treatment at 400 mpa and 40 degrees c reduced cell counts of brochothrix thermosphacta, carnobacterium divergens, c. jejuni, and pseudomonas fluorescens to levels below the detection limit. cell counts of e. coli aw1.7, however, were reduced by only 3.5 log (cfu/g) and remained stable  during subsequent refrigerated storage. the resistance to treatment at 600 mpa and 40 degrees c of e. coli aw1.7 was compared with salmonella enterica, shiga toxin-producing e. coli and nonpathogenic e. coli strains, and staphylococcus spp. cell counts of all organisms except e. coli aw 1.7 were reduced by more than 6 log cfu/g. cell counts of e. coli aw1.7 were reduced by 4.5 log cfu/g only. moreover, the ability of e. coli aw1.7 to resist pressure was comparable to the pressure-resistant mutant e. coli lmm1030. our results indicate that preservation of fresh meat requires a combination of high pressure with high temperature (40 to 60 degrees c) or other antimicrobial hurdles.

TI  == isolation of campylobacter from feral swine (sus scrofa) on the ranch associated  with the 2006 escherichia coli o157:h7 spinach outbreak investigation in california.
AB  == we report the isolation of campylobacter species from the same population of feral swine that was investigated in san benito county, california, during the 2006 spinach-related escherichia coli o157:h7 outbreak. this is the first survey  of campylobacter in a free-ranging feral swine population in the united states. campylobacter species were cultured from buccal and rectal-anal swabs, colonic faeces and tonsils using a combination of selective enrichment and antibiotic-free membrane filtration methods. matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (maldi-tof-ms, bruker daltonics, inc., billerica, ma, usa) was used to identify species followed by confirmatory multiplex pcr or 16s rrna sequencing. genetic relatedness of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli strains was determined by multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and pora allele sequencing. altogether, 12 (40%) of 30 feral swine gastrointestinal and oral cavity specimens were positive, and six species were isolated: campylobacter coli, campylobacter fetus, campylobacter hyointestinalsis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lanienae and campylobacter  sputorum. campylobacter jejuni subtypes were closely related to mlst sequence type 21 (st-21) and had identical pora sequences. campylobacter coli subtypes were unrelated to isolates in the pubmlst/pora database. this feral swine population lived in close association with a 'grassfed' beef cattle herd adjacent to spinach and other leafy green row crop fields. the findings underscore the importance of protecting raw vegetable crops from faecal contamination by wild or feral animals. the study also illustrates a potential risk of campylobacter exposure for hunters during handling and processing of wild swine meat.

TI  == hydrogenase activity in the foodborne pathogen campylobacter jejuni depends upon  a novel abc-type nickel transporter (nikzyxwv) and is slyd-independent.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a human pathogen of worldwide significance. it is commensal in the gut of many birds and mammals, where hydrogen is a readily available electron donor. the bacterium possesses a single membrane-bound, periplasmic-facing nife uptake hydrogenase that depends on the acquisition of environmental nickel for activity. the periplasmic binding protein cj1584 (nikz)  of the atp binding cassette (abc) transporter encoded by the cj1584c-cj1580c (nikzyxwv) operon in c. jejuni strain nctc 11168 was found to be nickel-repressed and to bind free nickel ions with a submicromolar k(d) value, as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. unlike the escherichia coli nika protein, nikz did not bind edta-chelated nickel and lacks key conserved residues implicated in metallophore interaction. a c. jejuni cj1584c null mutant strain showed an approximately 22-fold decrease in intracellular nickel content compared with the  wild-type strain and a decreased rate of uptake of (63)nicl(2). the inhibition of residual nickel uptake at higher nickel concentrations in this mutant by hexa-ammine cobalt (iii) chloride or magnesium ions suggests that low-affinity uptake occurs partly through the cora magnesium transporter. hydrogenase activity was completely abolished in the cj1584c mutant after growth in unsupplemented media, but was fully restored after growth with 0.5 mm nickel chloride. mutation  of the putative metallochaperone gene slyd (cj0115) had no effect on either intracellular nickel accumulation or hydrogenase activity. our data reveal a strict dependence of hydrogenase activity in c. jejuni on high-affinity nickel uptake through an abc transporter that has distinct properties compared with the  e. coli nik system.

TI  == extreme heat resistance of food borne pathogens campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and salmonella typhimurium on chicken breast fillet during cooking.
AB  == the aim of this research was to determine the decimal reduction times of bacteria present on chicken fillet in boiling water. the experiments were conducted with campylobacter jejuni, salmonella, and escherichia coli. whole chicken breast fillets were inoculated with the pathogens, stored overnight (4 degrees c), and subsequently cooked. the surface temperature reached 70 degrees c within 30 sec and 85 degrees c within one minute. extremely high decimal reduction times of 1.90, 1.97, and 2.20 min were obtained for c. jejuni, e. coli, and s. typhimurium, respectively. chicken meat and refrigerated storage before cooking enlarged the heat resistance of the food borne pathogens. additionally, a high challenge temperature or fast heating rate contributed to the level of heat resistance. the data were used to assess the probability of illness (campylobacteriosis) due to consumption of chicken fillet as a function of cooking time. the data revealed that cooking time may be far more critical than previously assumed.

TI  == a waterborne outbreak with a single clone of campylobacter jejuni in the danish town of koge in may 2010.
AB  == background: in denmark, large-scale waterborne outbreaks are rare. this report describes the investigation of an outbreak that occurred in the town of koge in may 2010. methods: the epidemiological investigation consisted of hypothesis generating telephone interviews, followed by a cohort study among approximately 20,000 residents using an online questionnaire. odds ratios were calculated for exposures including the number of glasses of tap water consumed. geographical spreading was assessed using a geographical information system. the microbiological investigation included cultures of stool samples and flagellin-typing. in the environmental investigation, water samples were tested for escherichia coli and coliform counts and for dna of campylobacter, enterococcus, and bacteroides. during the outbreak investigation a water boiling  order was enforced, as tap water was considered a potential source. results: of 45 patients with laboratory confirmed campylobacter infection in the municipality of koge in may, 43 lived in the area covered by the central water supply. of 61 patients with laboratory confirmed campylobacter jejuni by 8 june, 50 shared a common flagellin gene type--flaa type 36 (82%). the epidemic curve from the cohort study showed a wave of diarrhoea onset from 14 to 20 may (n = 176). among  these patients, the development of diarrhoea was associated with drinking tap water with a dose-response pattern (linear increase by 2 glasses: odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.16-1.70). no bacterial dna was found in water samples. conclusions: these findings indicated a point source contamination of tap water with a single clone of c. jejuni which likely occurred on 12-13 may. the water boiling order was lifted on 18 june.

TI  == nonculture diagnostic tests for enteric diseases.
AB  == the diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis (age) has traditionally been based on culture results of feces from patients with diarrhea. virtually everything we know about disease and the epidemiology of enteric pathogens, such as salmonella  spp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), e.g., o157, and campylobacter spp., has been generated from the study of patients with culture-confirmed infections. however, this pattern may be changing because age diagnostics are moving away from culture toward rapid nonculture methods. these infections are mainly foodborne and therefore preventable, and it is of paramount importance that public health surveillance for these infections is consistent and reliable.

TI  == sale of raw milk in northern italy: food safety implications and comparison of different analytical methodologies for detection of foodborne pathogens.
AB  == the safety of raw milk sold in northern italy was investigated in relation to hygiene quality parameters and presence of salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, thermotolerant campylobacter, and verocytotoxin producing escherichia coli o157:h7. the performance of different analytical methods used-official culture method (iso), modified bacteriological analytical manual cultural method (mbam), and polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-was evaluated. the presence of mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (map) was investigated only by pcr. all samples met regulations for alkaline phosphatase and inhibitory  substance, while 18% and 44.8% of samples collected from vending machines had, respectively, somatic cell count (scc) >300,000/ml and total bacterial count (tbc) >50,000 cfu/ml. the correlation between hygienic quality parameters in samples collected from bulk tank and vending machines showed a significant increase of tbc in vending machines meaning that raw milk was mishandled during distribution and sale. all pathogens investigated were detected in raw milk sold  at vending machines; a total of five samples (5%) had at least one pathogen, of which two were detected by pcr and three by mbam. none of the samples was positive by cultural iso methods. even if the comparison of analytical methods showed that none performs significantly better than the others, testing a higher  volume of milk (25 versus 210 ml) affects significantly the detection rate of pathogens. three samples (3%) were positive for map, suggesting that raw milk is  a significant source of map exposure for consumers. the observed tbc increase and the detection of several pathogenic bacteria pose questions on the safety of raw  milk; the use of iso seems inefficient in detecting a low contamination level of  pathogens in milk and consequently not appropriate as official method for testing. in order to ensure consumer's safety, a new approach for the raw milk chain is required.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni infection of infant mice: acute enterocolitis is followed by asymptomatic intestinal and extra-intestinal immune responses.
AB  == campylobacter (c.) jejuni is among the leading bacterial agents causing enterocolitis worldwide. despite the high prevalence of c. jejuni infections and  its significant medical and economical consequences, intestinal pathogenesis is poorly understood. this is mainly due to the lack of appropriate animal models. in the age of 3 months, adult mice display strong colonization resistance (cr) against c. jejuni. previous studies underlined the substantial role of the murine intestinal microbiota in maintaining cr. due to the fact that the host-specific gut flora establishes after weaning, we investigated cr against c. jejuni in 3-week-old mice and studied intestinal and extra-intestinal immunopathogenesis as well as age dependent differences of the murine colon microbiota. in infant animals infected orally immediately after weaning c. jejuni strain b2 could stably colonize the gastrointestinal tract for more than 100 days. within six days following infection, infant mice developed acute enterocolitis as indicated  by bloody diarrhea, colonic shortening, and increased apoptotic cell numbers in the colon mucosa. similar to human campylobacteriosis clinical disease manifestations were self-limited and disappeared within two weeks. interestingly, long-term c. jejuni infection was accompanied by distinct intestinal immune and inflammatory responses as indicated by increased numbers of t- and b-lymphocytes, regulatory t-cells, neutrophils, as well as apoptotic cells in the colon mucosa.  strikingly, c. jejuni infection also induced a pronounced influx of immune cells  into extra-intestinal sites such as liver, lung, and kidney. furthermore, c. jejuni susceptible weaned mice harbored a different microbiota as compared to resistant adult animals. these results support the essential role of the microflora composition in cr against c. jejuni and demonstrate that infant mouse  models resemble c. jejuni mediated immunopathogenesis including the characteristic self-limited enterocolitis in human campylobacteriosis. furthermore, potential clinical and immunological sequelae of chronic c. jejuni carriers in humans can be further elucidated by investigation of long-term infected infant mice. the observed extraintestinal disease manifestations might help to unravel the mechanisms causing complications such as reactive arthritis or guillain-barre syndrome.

TI  == ibd-what role do proteobacteria play?
AB  == the gastrointestinal microbiota has come to the fore in the search for the causes of ibd. this shift has largely been driven by the finding of genetic polymorphisms involved in gastrointestinal innate immunity (particularly polymorphisms in nod2 and genes involved in autophagy) and alterations in the composition of the microbiota that might result in inflammation (so-called dysbiosis). microbial diversity studies have continually demonstrated an expansion of the proteobacteria phylum in patients with ibd. individual proteobacteria, in particular (adherent-invasive) escherichia coli, campylobacter concisus and enterohepatic helicobacter, have all been associated with the pathogenesis of ibd. in this review, we comprehensively describe the various associations of proteobacteria and ibd. we also examine the importance of pattern recognition in the extracellular innate immune response of the host with particular reference to proteobacteria, and postulate that proteobacteria with adherent and invasive properties might exploit host defenses, drive proinflammatory change, alter the intestinal microbiota in favor of dysbiosis and ultimately lead to the development of ibd.

TI  == distinct roles of secreted htra proteases from gram-negative pathogens in cleaving the junctional protein and tumor suppressor e-cadherin.
AB  == the periplasmic chaperone and serine protease htra is important for bacterial stress responses and protein quality control. recently, we discovered that htra from helicobacter pylori is secreted and cleaves e-cadherin to disrupt the epithelial barrier, but it remained unknown whether this maybe a general virulence mechanism. here, we show that important other pathogens including enteropathogenic escherichia coli, shigella flexneri, and campylobacter jejuni, but not neisseria gonorrhoeae, cleaved e-cadherin on host cells. htra deletion in c. jejuni led to severe defects in e-cadherin cleavage, loss of cell adherence, paracellular transmigration, and basolateral invasion. computational modeling of  htras revealed a conserved pocket in the active center exhibiting pronounced proteolytic activity. differential e-cadherin cleavage was determined by an alanine-to-glutamine exchange in the active center of neisserial htra. these data suggest that htra-mediated e-cadherin cleavage is a prevalent pathogenic mechanism of multiple gram-negative bacteria representing an attractive novel target for therapeutic intervention to combat bacterial infections.

TI  == public health burden due to infections by verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) and campylobacter spp. as estimated by cost of illness and different  approaches to model disability-adjusted life years.
AB  == aims: to estimate disability-adjusted life years (daly) and cost of illness (coi) associated with the gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens campylobacter and verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) in sweden and to investigate the  impact of variability in health outcomes, data availability, and different assumptions about underreporting on daly. methods: data from the swedish notification system, public databases, and the literature were used to estimate coi and daly. daly was modelled using a deterministic and a stochastic approach,  the latter describing variation in health outcomes between individuals. effects of different assumptions about underreporting of gastroenteritis were evaluated in separate scenarios. results: coi and daly were greater for campylobacter than  for vtec. years of life lost due to haemolytic uraemic syndrome and years lived with gastroenteritis constituted most of daly for vtec and campylobacter, respectively. productivity losses due to gastroenteritis constituted the main cost associated with both pathogens. degree of underreporting had a greater impact on daly for campylobacter, due to higher estimated incidence of gastroenteritis associated with campylobacteriosis. conclusions: pathogen-specific health outcomes and data quality may influence the preferred modelling approach. there was a fair agreement between modelling approaches, but  the stochastic model reflected the contribution of some rare health outcomes not  captured in the deterministic model. health outcomes excluded due to lack of data lead to an underestimation of the total burden associated with the pathogens. increased knowledge, especially on the degree of underreporting and the contribution of the pathogens to sequelae, is needed to further improve public health burden estimates for these pathogens in sweden.

AB  == this report documents the presence of fecal indicators and bacterial pathogens in sand at 53 california marine beaches using both culture-dependent and -independent (pcr and quantitative pcr [qpcr]) methods. fecal indicator bacteria  were widespread in california beach sand, with escherichia coli and enterococci detected at 68% and 94% of the beaches surveyed, respectively. somatic coliphages and a bacteroidales human-specific fecal marker were detected at 43% and 13% of the beaches, respectively. dry sand samples from almost 30% of the beaches contained at least one of the following pathogens: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., staphylococcus aureus, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), which were detected at 15%, 13%, 14%, and 3% of tested beaches, respectively. fecal indicators and pathogens were poorly correlated to one another and to land cover. sands were dry at the time of collection, and those with relatively high moisture tended to have higher concentrations or a more frequent occurrence of both indicators and pathogens. using culture-dependent assays, fecal indicators decayed faster than pathogens in microcosm experiments using unaltered beach sand seeded with sewage and assessed by culture-dependent assays. the following order of persistence was observed (listed from most to least persistent): campylobacter > salmonella > somatic coliphages > enterococci  > e. coli > f(+) phages. in contrast, pathogens decayed faster than fecal indicators in culture-independent assays: enterococci > bacteroidales human-specific marker > salmonella > campylobacter. microcosm experiments demonstrated that both indicators and pathogens were mobilized by wetting with seawater. decay rates measured by qpcr were lower than those measured with culture-dependent methods. enterococcal persistence and possible growth were observed for wetted microcosms relative to unwetted controls.

TI  == analysis of risk factors associated with antibiotic-resistant escherichia coli.
AB  == antimicrobial-resistant bacteria represent a major threat to human and animal health. we compared equine fecal samples (n=264) from 138 horses from hospital and nonhospital (livery stable and riding school) premises in north west england  to determine the prevalence of escherichia coli, salmonella, and campylobacter and rates of antimicrobial-resistant e. coli strains. campylobacter jejuni was detected only in hospitalized horses (1.1%), and no salmonella was identified. data analysis of the horses' management and veterinary treatments (tx) identified risk factors associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant e. coli. the hospital was the major source of resistant and multi-drug-resistant (mdr) e. coli. moreover, shedding of antimicrobial-resistant e. coli was associated significantly with hospitalization for a gastrointestinal problem (odds ratio [or]:+/-95% confidence intervals=8.50:1.79-40.32), receipt of oral antimicrobial  tx (or=3.52:1.11-11.10), multiple antimicrobial tx in hospital (or/tx=1.05:1.01-1.09), or geldings (or=4.62:1.23-17.46). interestingly, intravenous antimicrobial tx was negatively associated with shedding of antimicrobial-resistant e. coli (or=0.18:0.04-0.76). mdr e. coli was associated with hospitalization, antimicrobial tx in hospital (or/tx=3.65:1.54-8.68), and increased age (or/year=1.11:1.03-1.19). thus, equine hospitals in this geographic location appear to be an important source of antimicrobial-resistant and mdr e. coli strains, but unlikely reservoirs of salmonella or campylobacter. thus, it is important to moderate antimicrobial tx given to hospitalized horses to lessen exposure and fecal shedding of resistant pathogens.

TI  == campylobacter, salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, verotoxigenic escherichia coli, and escherichia coli prevalence, enumeration, and subtypes on retail chicken breasts with and without skin.
AB  == this study examined the prevalence, counts, and subtypes of campylobacter, salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec), and e. coli on raw retail chicken breast with the skin on versus the skin off. from january to december 2007, 187 raw skin-on chicken breasts and 131 skin-off chicken breasts were collected from randomly selected retail grocery stores in the region of waterloo, ontario, canada. campylobacter isolates were recovered from a higher proportion of the skin-off chicken breasts, 55 (42%) of 131, than of the skin-on chicken breasts tested, 55 (29%) of 187 (p = 0.023). there was no  difference in the proportion of salmonella isolates recovered from the two meat types (p = 0.715): 40 (31%) of 131 skin-off chicken breasts versus 61 (33%) of 187 skin-on chicken breasts. l. monocytogenes isolates were recovered from a statistically lower proportion of the skin-off chicken breasts, 15 (15%) of 99, than of the skin-on chicken breasts, 64 (34%) of 187 (p = 0.001). there was no difference in the proportion of e. coli isolates recovered from the skin-off chicken breasts, 33 (33%) of 99, than from the skin-on chicken breasts, 77 (41%)  of 187 (p = 0.204). vtec was detected on a single skin-off chicken breast. campylobacter jejuni was the most frequent species isolated on both types of chicken meat: skin-on, 48 (87%) of 55, and skin-off, 51 (94%) of 54. salmonella serotypes kentucky and heidelberg and l. monocytogenes serotype 1/2a were the most frequently detected serotypes from both skin-off and skin-on chicken breasts. although there appeared to be a trend toward higher enumeration values of these pathogens and e. coli on the skin-on chicken, the differences did not exceed 1 log. this study suggested that skin-off chicken breast may represent a higher risk of consumer exposure to campylobacter, a similar risk for salmonella, vtec, and e. coli, and a lower risk for l. monocytogenes than skin-on chicken breast.

TI  == investigation of chemical rinses suitable for very small meat plants to reduce pathogens on beef surfaces.
AB  == numerous antimicrobial interventions are capable of reducing the prevalence of harmful bacteria on raw meat products. there is a need to identify effective and  inexpensive antimicrobial interventions that could, in practice, be used in very  small meat plants because of limited financial, space, and labor resources. eight antimicrobial compounds (acetic acid, citric acid, lactic acid, peroxyacetic acid, acidified sodium chlorite, chlorine dioxide, sodium hypochlorite, and aqueous ozone) were applied at various concentrations with small, hand-held spraying equipment, and bactericidal effectiveness was examined. beef plate pieces were inoculated with fecal slurry containing a pathogen cocktail (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter jejuni) and natural populations of aerobic plate counts, coliforms, and e. coli. antimicrobial solutions were applied to beef surfaces via a portable, pressurized hand-held spray tank, and treated surfaces were subjected to appropriate methods for the enumeration and isolation of pathogens and hygiene indicators. relative antimicrobial effectiveness was determined (from greatest to least): (i) organic acids, (ii) peroxyacetic acid, (iii) chlorinated compounds, and (iv) aqueous ozone. using the equipment described, a 2% lactic acid rinse provided 3.5- to 6.4-log cfu/cm(2) reductions across all bacterial populations studied. conversely, aqueous ozone yielded 0.02- to 2.9-log cfu/cm(2) reductions  in pathogens and hygiene indicators, and did not differ significantly from a control tap water rinse (p = 0.055 to 0.731). this 2% lactic acid rinse will be subsequently combined with a previously described water wash to create a multistep antimicrobial intervention that will be examined under laboratory conditions and validated in very small meat plants.

TI  == spatial and temporal drivers of zoonotic pathogen contamination of an agricultural watershed.
AB  == in regions where animal agriculture is prominent, such as southern alberta, higher rates of gastrointestinal illness have been reported when compared with nonagricultural regions. this difference in the rate of illness is thought to be  a result of increased zoonotic pathogen exposure through environmental sources such as water. in this study, temporal and spatial factors associated with bacterial pathogen contamination of the oldman river, which transverses this region, were analyzed using classification and regression tree analysis. significantly higher levels of fecal indicators; more frequent isolations of campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, and salmonella enterica spp.; and higher rates of detection of pig-specific bacteroides markers occurred at downstream sites than at upstream sites, suggesting additive stream inputs. fecal indicator densities were also significantly higher when any one of these three bacterial pathogens was present and where there were higher total animal manure units; however, occasionally pathogens were present when fecal indicator levels were low or undetectable. overall, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and e. coli o157:h7 presence was associated with season, animal manure units, and total  rainfall on the day of sampling and 3 d in advance of sampling. several of the environmental variables analyzed in this study appear to influence pathogen prevalence and therefore may be useful in predicting water quality and safety and in the improvement of watershed management practices in this and other agricultural regions.

TI  == investigation of an escherichia coli environmental benchmark for waterborne pathogens in agricultural watersheds in canada.
AB  == canada's national agri-environmental standards initiative sought to develop an environmental benchmark for low-level waterborne pathogen occurrence in agricultural watersheds. a field study collected 902 water samples from 27 sites  in four intensive agricultural watersheds across canada from 2005 to 2007. four of the sites were selected as reference sites away from livestock and human fecal pollution sources in each watershed. water samples were analyzed for campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, cryptosporidium spp., giardia spp., and the water quality indicator e. coli. the annual mean number of pathogen species was higher at agricultural sites (1.54 +/- 0.07 species per water sample) than at reference sites (0.75 +/- 0.14 species per water sample). the annual mean concentration of e. coli was also higher at agricultural sites (491 +/- 96 colony-forming units [cfu] 100 ml(-1)) than at reference sites (53 +/- 18 cfu 100 ml(-1)). the feasibility of adopting existing  e. coli water quality guideline values as an environmental benchmark was assessed, but waterborne pathogens were detected at agricultural sites in 80% of  water samples with low e. coli concentrations (<100 cfu 100 ml(-1)). instead, an  approach was developed based on using the natural background occurrence of pathogens at reference sites in agricultural watersheds to derive provisional environmental benchmarks for pathogens at agricultural sites. the environmental benchmarks that were derived were found to represent e. coli values lower than geometric mean values typically found in recreational water quality guidelines. additional research is needed to investigate environmental benchmarks for waterborne pathogens within the context of the "one world, one health" perspective for protecting human, domestic animal, and wildlife health.

TI  == pan-european monitoring of susceptibility to human-use antimicrobial agents in enteric bacteria isolated from healthy food-producing animals.
AB  == objectives: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility of escherichia coli, salmonella, campylobacter and enterococcus from cattle, pigs and chickens across  the european union (eu) using uniform methodology. methods: intestinal samples (1624) were taken at slaughter across five eu countries. bacteria were isolated in national laboratories, whilst mics were determined in a central laboratory for key antimicrobials used in human medicine. clinical resistance was based on clsi  breakpoints and decreased susceptibility based on european food safety authority  (efsa)/eucast epidemiological cut-off values. results: isolation rates were high  for e. coli (n=1540), low for salmonella (n=201) and intermediate for campylobacter (n=940) and enterococcus (n=786). for e. coli and salmonella, clinical resistance to newer compounds (cefepime, cefotaxime and ciprofloxacin) was absent or low, but decreased susceptibility was apparent, particularly in chicken strains. resistance to older compounds (except gentamicin) was variable and higher. colistin resistance was absent for e. coli, but apparent for salmonella. for campylobacter jejuni, ciprofloxacin resistance was markedly prevalent for chickens, whereas clinical resistance and decreased susceptibility  to erythromycin was absent or very low. for campylobacter coli, resistance was notably higher. none of the enterococcus faecium strains was resistant to linezolid, but some were resistant to ampicillin or vancomycin. resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin was frequent. conclusions: resistance patterns varied widely depending on bacterial species, antibiotics, hosts and region. resistance  varied among countries, particularly for older antimicrobials, but clinical resistance to newer antibiotics used to treat foodborne disease in humans was generally very low. in the absence of resistance to newer compounds in e. coli and salmonella, the apparent decreased susceptibility should be monitored.

TI  == long-term trends in the epidemiology and resistance of childhood bacterial enteropathogens in crete.
AB  == in this study, we investigated the long-term trends in the epidemiology and susceptibility of bacterial enteropathogens among children in a well-defined area of adequate health standards. the study included all children younger than 14 years of age treated for enteritis at heraklion university general hospital on the island of crete during the 18-year period from january 1993 to december 2010. stool specimens were tested for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), yersinia, and aeromonas species. of the 33,032 stool samples from patients of any age, 2,912 (8.82%) were positive for bacterial enteropathogens. the 1,597 isolates from children were identified as s. enterica (42.3%), campylobacter spp. (33.6%), epec (17.4%), y. enterocolitica (5.82%), a. hydrophila (0.44%), and shigella spp. (0.38%). a decline in prevalence was observed for all bacterial enteropathogens. taken as a total, enteropathogens were susceptible to gentamicin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, and amoxicillin in 98.8%, 88.0%, 83.0%, 67.1%, and 59.6%, respectively. during the study period, the susceptibility rates decreased for co-trimoxazole (p<0.0001) and ciprofloxacin (p<0.001), and increased for amoxicillin (p<0.0001). our findings suggest declining long-term trends in the prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens and changes in susceptibility rates to first-line antibacterial agents. these changing trends in the long-term morbidity and susceptibility call for ongoing surveillance and tailored management.

TI  == cellular response of campylobacter jejuni to trisodium phosphate.
AB  == the highly alkaline compound trisodium phosphate (tsp) is used as an intervention to reduce the load of campylobacter on poultry meat in u.s. poultry slaughter plants. the aim of the present study was to investigate the cellular responses of campylobacter jejuni nctc11168 when exposed to sublethal concentrations of tsp. preexposure of c. jejuni to tsp resulted in a significant increase in heat sensitivity, suggesting that a combined heat and tsp treatment may increase reduction of c. jejuni. a microarray analysis identified a limited number of genes that were differently expressed after sublethal tsp exposure; however, the  response was mainly associated with ion transport processes. c. jejuni nctc11168  nhaa1 (cj1655c) and nhaa2 (cj1654c), which encode orthologues to the escherichia  coli nhaa cation/proton antiporter, were able to partially restore tsp, alkaline, and sodium resistance phenotypes to an e. coli cation/proton antiporter mutant. in addition, inhibition of resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd) multidrug efflux pumps by the inhibitor pabetan (phe-arg beta-naphthylamide dihydrochloride) decreased tolerance to sublethal tsp. therefore, we propose that nhaa1/nhaa2 cation/proton antiporters and rnd multidrug efflux pumps function in  tolerance to sublethal tsp exposure in c. jejuni.

TI  == potentially pathogenic bacteria and antimicrobial resistance in bioaerosols from  cage-housed and floor-housed poultry operations.
AB  == background: antibiotics are used in animal confinement buildings, such as cage-housed (ch) and floor-housed (fh) poultry operations, to lower the likeliness of disease transmission. in fh facilities, antibiotics may also be used at sub-therapeutic levels for growth promotion. low levels of antibiotic create a selective pressure toward antimicrobial resistance (amr) in chicken fecal bacteria. objective: the objective of this study was to compare bacteria and amr genes in bioaerosols from ch and fh poultry facilities. methods: bioaerosols were collected from 15 ch and 15 fh poultry operations, using stationary area samplers as well as personal sampling devices. bacteria concentrations were determined by genus- or species-specific quantitative polymerase chain reaction (pcr) and amr genes were detected using endpoint pcr. results: enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, and staphylococcus spp. were significantly higher in bioaerosols of fh poultry operations than ch bioaerosols  (p < 0.001) while clostridium perfringens was significantly higher in area bioaerosols of ch operations than fh area bioaerosols (p < 0.05). campylobacter spp. were detected only in bioaerosols of fh facilities. zinc bacitracin resistance gene, bcrr, erythromycin resistance gene, erma, and tetracycline resistance gene, teta/c, were more prevalent in bioaerosols of fh facilities than ch bioaerosols (p < 0.01, p < 0.01, and p < 0.05, respectively). conclusions: most bacteria are more concentrated and most amr genes are more prevalent in bioaerosols of fh poultry operations, where growth-promoting antibiotics may be used.

TI  == identification of immunogenic and virulence-associated campylobacter jejuni proteins.
AB  == with the aim of identifying proteins important for host interaction and virulence, we have screened an expression library of nctc 11168 campylobacter jejuni genes for highly immunogenic proteins. a commercial c. jejuni open reading frame (orf) library consisting of more than 1,600 genes was transformed into the  escherichia coli expression strain bl21(de3), resulting in 2,304 clones. this library was subsequently screened for immunogenic proteins using antibodies raised in rabbit against a clinical isolate of c. jejuni; this resulted in 52 highly reactive clones representing 25 different genes after sequencing. selected candidate genes were inactivated in c. jejuni nctc 11168, and the virulence was examined using int 407 epithelial cell line and motility, biofilm, autoagglutination, and serum resistance assays. these investigations revealed c.  jejuni antigen 0034c (cj0034c) to be a novel virulence factor and support the usefulness of the method. further, several antigens were tested as vaccine candidates in two mouse models, in which cj0034c, cj0404, and cj0525c resulted in a reduction of invasion in spleen and liver after challenge.

TI  == molecular techniques in ecohealth research toolkit: facilitating estimation of aggregate gastroenteritis burden in an irrigated periurban landscape.
AB  == assessment of microbial hazards associated with certain environmental matrices, livelihood strategies, and food handling practices are constrained by time-consuming conventional microbiological techniques that lead to health risk assessments of narrow geographic or time scope, often targeting very few pathogens. health risk assessment based on one or few indicator organisms underestimates true disease burden due a number of coexisting causative pathogens. here, we employed molecular techniques in a survey of cryptosporidium  parvum, giardia lamblia, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., shigella spp., vibrio cholera, and rotavirus a densities in canal water with respect to seasonality and spatial distribution of  point-nonpoint pollution sources. three irrigational canals stretching across nearly a 150-km(2) periurban landscape, traditionally used for agricultural irrigation but function as vital part of municipal wastewater stabilization in recent years, were investigated. compiled stochastic data (pathogen concentration, susceptible populations) and literature-obtained deterministic data (pathogen dose-response model parameter values) were used in estimating waterborne gastroenteritis burden. exposure scenarios include swimming or fishing, consuming canal water-irrigated vegetables, and ingesting or inhaling water aerosols while working in canal water-irrigated fields. estimated annual gastroenteritis burden due individual pathogens among the sampling points was -10.6log(10) to -2.2log(10) dalys. aggregated annual gastroenteritis burden due all the target pathogens per sampling point was -3.1log(10) to -1.9log(10) dalys, far exceeding who acceptable limit of -6.0log(10) dalys. the present approach will facilitate the comprehensive collection of surface water microbiological baseline data and setting of benchmarks for interventions aimed at reducing microbial hazards in similar landscapes worldwide.

AB  == laboratory-based surveillance for diarrheal and respiratory illness was conducted at the 2009 republic of the philippines-united states balikatan exercise to determine the presence of specific pathogens endemic in the locations where the military exercises were conducted. ten stool and 6 respiratory specimens were obtained from individuals meeting case definitions for diarrhea or respiratory illness. stool specimens were frozen in dry ice and remotely tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for rotavirus, astrovirus, adenovirus, entamoeba histolytica, giardia, and cryptosporidium and polymerase chain reaction for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, campylobacter, shigella, vibrio, salmonella, and norovirus. eight (4 for campylobacter jejuni, 2 for campylobacter coli, 1 for norovirus genogroup ii, and 1 for both campylobacter coli and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli) of 10 samples were positive for at least 1 enteric pathogen. masstag polymerase chain reaction for influenza a and b, respiratory syncytial virus groups a and b, human coronavirus-229e and human coronavirus-oc43, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, human parainfluenza viruses 2,3, and 4a, human adenovirus, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, legionella pneumonia, and mycoplasma pneumonia was done on respiratory specimens. out of 6 samples, 3 tested positive for h. influenzae;  1 tested positive for both h. influenzae and human parainfluenza virus 3; and 2 tested negative. laboratory-based surveillance can be useful in determining etiologies of diarrheal and respiratory illness of deployed military personnel.

TI  == fate of pathogens in a simulated bioreduction system for livestock carcasses.
AB  == the eu animal by-products regulations generated the need for novel methods of storage and disposal of dead livestock. bioreduction prior to rendering or incineration has been proposed as a practical and potentially cost-effective method; however, its biosecurity characteristics need to be elucidated. to address this, salmonella enterica (serovars senftenberg and poona), enterococcus  faecalis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli and a lux-marked strain of escherichia coli o157 were inoculated into laboratory-scale bioreduction vessels  containing sheep carcass constituents. numbers of all pathogens and the metabolic activity of e. coli o157 decreased significantly within the liquor waste over time, and only e. faecalis remained detectable after 3months. only very low numbers of salmonella spp. and e. faecalis were detected in bioaerosols, and only at initial stages of the trial. these results further indicate that bioreduction  represents a suitable method of storing and reducing the volume of livestock carcasses prior to ultimate disposal.

AB  == bacteriologic cultures from oral, rectal, and lesion samples from free-ranging steller sea lion (ssl, eumetopias jubatus) pups and juveniles in alaska (2001-2005) were examined to determine frequency of infection by a specific subset of common and pathogenic aerobic bacteria. associations between isolated bacteria and age, sex, body condition, location, and sampling season were investigated. salmonella spp. isolates were further evaluated to determine spatial clustering (n=48) and to identify serovars (n=13) and antimicrobial susceptibility patterns (n=11). we sampled 356 ssl pups (n=272) and juveniles (n=84), and identified 988 isolates of 13 bacterial genera of specific interest.  pasteurella spp. (43.8%), beta-hemolytic streptococcus spp. (30.6%), and mannheimia spp. (18.2%) were the most commonly isolated oral bacteria (n=499 isolates), whereas escherichia coli (47.6%), beta-hemolytic e. coli (32.4%), salmonella spp. (10.4%), and campylobacter spp. (7.8%) were the most frequently isolated rectal bacteria (n=460 isolates). salmonella was most commonly found in  pups from western stocks and in samples collected during fall/winter seasons. a significant salmonella cluster was detected at the perry island haulout. five serovars were isolated: enteritidis, infantis, newport, reading, and stanley. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis provided evidence that salmonella isolates were  most likely being maintained within the ssl population in alaska.

TI  == enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats: diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control.
AB  == this report offers a consensus opinion on the diagnosis, epidemiology, treatment, and control of the primary enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats, with an emphasis on clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and escherichia coli associated with granulomatous colitis in boxers. veterinarians are challenged when attempting to diagnose animals with suspected bacterial-associated diarrhea because well-scrutinized practice guidelines that provide objective recommendations for implementing fecal testing  are lacking. this problem is compounded by similar isolation rates for putative bacterial enteropathogens in animals with and without diarrhea, and by the lack of consensus among veterinary diagnostic laboratories as to which diagnostic assays should be utilized. most bacterial enteropathogens are associated with self-limiting diarrhea, and injudicious administration of antimicrobials could be more harmful than beneficial. salmonella and campylobacter are well-documented zoonoses, but antimicrobial administration is not routinely advocated in uncomplicated cases and supportive therapy is recommended. basic practices of isolation, use of appropriate protective equipment, and proper cleaning and disinfection are the mainstays of control. handwashing with soap and water is preferred over use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers because spores of c. difficile and c. perfringens are alcohol-resistant, but susceptible to bleach (1:10 to 1:20 dilution of regular household bleach) and accelerated hydrogen peroxide. the implementation of practice guidelines in combination with the integration of validated molecular-based testing and conventional testing is pivotal if we are to optimize the identification and management of enteropathogenic bacteria in dogs and cats.

TI  == genetic markers for rapid pcr-based identification of gull, canada goose, duck, and chicken fecal contamination in water.
AB  == avian feces contaminate waterways but contribute fewer human pathogens than human sources. rapid identification and quantification of avian contamination would therefore be useful to prevent overestimation of human health risk. we used subtractive hybridization of pcr-amplified gull fecal 16s rna genes to identify avian-specific fecal rrna gene sequences. the subtracters were rrna genes amplified from human, dog, cat, cow, and pig feces. recovered sequences were related to enterobacteriaceae (47%), helicobacter (26%), catellicoccus (11%), fusobacterium (11%), and campylobacter (5%). three pcr assays, designated gfb, gfc, and gfd, were based on recovered sequence fragments. quantitative pcr assays for gfc and gfd were developed using sybr green. gfc detected down to 0.1 mg gull feces/100 ml (corresponding to 2 gull enterococci most probable number [mpn]/100  ml). gfd detected down to 0.1 mg chicken feces/100 ml (corresponding to 13 escherichia coli mpn/100 ml). gfb and gfc were 97% and 94% specific to gulls, respectively. gfc cross-reacted with 35% of sheep samples but occurred at about 100,000 times lower concentrations in sheep. gfd was 100% avian specific and occurred in gulls, geese, chickens, and ducks. in the united states, canada, and  new zealand, the three markers differed in their geographic distributions but were found across the range tested. these assays detected four important bird groups contributing to fecal contamination of waterways: gulls, geese, ducks, and chickens. marker distributions across north america and in new zealand suggest that they will have broad applicability in other parts of the world as well.

TI  == approach to the patient with infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: to provide current recommendations for evaluation and treatment of patients with infectious colitis. infectious colitis is diagnosed in someone with diarrhea and one or more of the following: fever and/or dysentery, stools containing inflammatory markers such as leukocytes, lactoferrin, or calprotectin, or positive stool culture for an invasive or inflammatory bacterial enteropathogen including shigella, salmonella, campylobacter, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) or clostridium difficile, or colonic inflammation by endoscopy. recent findings: standard stool culture should be performed in patients with infectious colitis. epidemiologic findings including prior international travel, shellfish-associated diarrhea, living in parasite-endemic regions may suggest the need for specialized studies of etiology. when stec is suspected as a pathogen because only low grade or no fever is seen in a patient with acute dysentery, a competent laboratory should look for e. coli o157:h7 and shiga toxin directly in stool. summary: once laboratory diagnosis is made, pathogen-specific antimicrobial therapy should be initiated for all forms of infectious colitis other than stec. for empiric treatment of febrile dysenteric diarrhea invasive bacterial enteropathogens (shigella, salmonella, and campylobacter) should be suspected and adults may be treated empirically with 1000mg azithromycin in a single dose.

TI  == gastrointestinal infection as a trigger for inflammatory bowel disease.
AB  == purpose of review: there is accumulating evidence on the importance of microbes in the development and maintenance of both the intestinal and immune systems. this review focuses on the current findings on the role of gastrointestinal pathogens in the cause of chronic inflammatory bowel disease. recent findings: a  number of intestinal pathogens including mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent-invasive escherichia coli, and campylobacter species are associated at fairly high prevalence with crohn's disease, while two recent studies found a low prevalence for cytomegalovirus. in a prospective study, m. avium subspecies paratuberculosis detection in early crohn's disease was low and  comparable to controls, while much higher in an established inflammatory bowel disease cohort. in the pediatric setting, a high prevalence of clostridium difficile was seen in both active and inactive crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis patients. some studies have speculated that salmonella or campylobacter infection may increase the risk of inflammatory bowel disease on long-term follow-up, but detection bias was found to obscure the risk. recent studies in mouse models have demonstrated that a combination of factors, including viral pathogens, genetic susceptibility, and commensal microflora, can lead to intestinal pathology. summary: no evidence for causation of inflammatory bowel disease by a single agent has been found, whereas a number of microbes have been  strongly associated with the presence of disease. the majority of recent studies  support a role for the ability of intestinal pathogens to promote chronic inflammation in individuals with genetic susceptibility and/or other environmental factors which remain to be identified. these factors may include subsets of commensal microflora.

AB  == diarrhea can be caused by a range of pathogens, including several bacteria. conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, biochemical tests, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), are laborious. we developed a 7-plex pcr-luminex assay to simultaneously screen for several of the major diarrhea-causing bacteria directly in fecal specimens, including pathogenic aeromonas, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, salmonella, shigella, enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), vibrio, and yersinia. we included an extrinsic control to verify extraction and amplification. the assay was first validated with reference strains or isolates and exhibited a limit of detection of 10(3) to 10(5) cfu/g of stool for each pathogen as well as quantitative detection up to 10(9) cfu/g. a total of 205 clinical fecal specimens from individuals with diarrhea, previously cultured for enteric pathogens and tested for campylobacter by elisa, were evaluated. using these predicate methods as standards, sensitivities and specificities of the pcr-luminex assay were 89% and  94% for aeromonas, 89% and 93% for campylobacter, 96% and 95% for salmonella, 94% and 94% for shigella, 92% and 97% for vibrio, and 100% and 100% for yersinia, respectively. all discrepant results were further examined by singleplex real-time pcr assays targeting different gene regions, which revealed 89% (55/62  results) concordance with the pcr-luminex assay. the fluorescent signals obtained with this approach exhibited a statistically significant correlation with the cycle threshold (c(t)) values from the cognate real-time pcr assays (p < 0.05). this multiplex pcr-luminex assay enables sensitive, specific, and quantitative detection of the major bacterial causes of gastroenteritis.

TI  == diversity and impact of prokaryotic toxins on aquatic environments: a review.
AB  == microorganisms are ubiquitous in all habitats and are recognized by their metabolic versatility and ability to produce many bioactive compounds, including  toxins. some of the most common toxins present in water are produced by several cyanobacterial species. as a result, their blooms create major threats to animal  and human health, tourism, recreation and aquaculture. quite a few cyanobacterial toxins have been described, including hepatotoxins, neurotoxins, cytotoxins and dermatotoxins. these toxins are secondary metabolites, presenting a vast diversity of structures and variants. most of cyanobacterial secondary metabolites are peptides or have peptidic substructures and are assumed to be synthesized by non-ribosomal peptide synthesis (nrps), involving peptide synthetases, or nrps/pks, involving peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases  hybrid pathways. besides cyanobacteria, other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are recognized as significant toxin producers, representing important issues in food safety, public health, and human and animal well being.  vibrio species are one of the most representative groups of aquatic toxin producers, commonly associated with seafood-born infections. some enterotoxins and hemolysins have been identified as fundamental for v. cholerae and v. vulnificus pathogenesis, but there is evidence for the existence of other potential toxins. campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli are also water contaminants and are able to produce important toxins after infecting their hosts. other bacteria associated with aquatic environments are emerging as toxin  producers, namely legionella pneumophila and aeromonas hydrophila, described as responsible for the synthesis of several exotoxins, enterotoxins and cytotoxins.  furthermore, several clostridium species can produce potent neurotoxins. although not considered aquatic microorganisms, they are ubiquitous in the environment and can easily contaminate drinking and irrigation water. clostridium members are also spore-forming bacteria and can persist in hostile environmental conditions for long periods of time, contributing to their hazard grade. similarly, pseudomonas species are widespread in the environment. since p. aeruginosa is an  emergent opportunistic pathogen, its toxins may represent new hazards for humans  and animals. this review presents an overview of the diversity of toxins produced by prokaryotic microorganisms associated with aquatic habitats and their impact on environment, life and health of humans and other animals. moreover, important  issues like the availability of these toxins in the environment, contamination sources and pathways, genes involved in their biosynthesis and molecular mechanisms of some representative toxins are also discussed.

TI  == thermofluor-based optimization strategy for the stabilization and crystallization of campylobacter jejuni desulforubrerythrin.
AB  == desulforubrerythrin from campylobacter jejuni has recently been biochemical and spectroscopically characterized. it is a member of the rubrerythrin family, and it is composed of three structural domains: the n-terminal desulforedoxin domain  with a non-heme iron center, followed by a four-helix bundle domain harboring a binuclear iron center and finally a c-terminal rubredoxin domain. to date, this is the first example of a protein presenting this kind of structural domain organization, and therefore the determination of its crystal structure may unveil unexpected structural features. several attempts were made in order to obtain protein crystals, but always without success. as part of our strategy the thermofluor method was used to increase protein stability and its propensity to crystallize. this approach has been recently used to optimize protein buffer formulation, thus yielding more stable and homogenous protein samples. thermofluor has also been used to identify cofactors/ligands or small molecules that may help stabilize native protein states. a successful thermofluor approach  was used to select a ph buffer condition that allowed the crystallization of campylobacter jejuni desulforubrerythrin, by screening both buffer ph and salt concentration. a buffer formulation was obtained which increased the protein melting temperature by 7 degrees c relatively to the initial purification buffer. desulforubrerythrin was seen to be stabilized by lower ph and high salt concentration, and was dialyzed into the new selected buffer, 100mm mes ph 6.2, 500mm nacl. this stability study was complemented with a second thermofluor assay in which different additives were screened. a crystallization screening was carried out and protein crystals were rapidly obtained in one condition. protein  crystal optimization was done using the same additive screening. interestingly, a correlation between the stability studies and crystallization experiments using the additive screening could be established. the work presented here shows an elegant example where thermofluor was shown to be a key biophysical method that allowed the identification of an improved buffer formulation and the applicability of this technique to increase the propensity of a protein to crystallize is discussed.

TI  == fecal indicators and zoonotic pathogens in household drinking water taps fed from rainwater tanks in southeast queensland, australia.
AB  == in this study, the microbiological quality of household tap water samples fed from rainwater tanks was assessed by monitoring the numbers of escherichia coli bacteria and enterococci from 24 households in southeast queensland (seq), australia. quantitative pcr (qpcr) was also used for the quantitative detection of zoonotic pathogens in water samples from rainwater tanks and connected household taps. the numbers of zoonotic pathogens were also estimated in fecal samples from possums and various species of birds by using qpcr, as possums and birds are considered to be the potential sources of fecal contamination in roof-harvested rainwater (rhrw). among the 24 households, 63% of rainwater tank and 58% of connected household tap water (chtw) samples contained e. coli and exceeded australian drinking water guidelines of <1 cfu e. coli per 100 ml water. similarly, 92% of rainwater tanks and 83% of chtw samples also contained enterococci. in all, 21%, 4%, and 13% of rainwater tank samples contained campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and giardia lamblia, respectively. similarly, 21% of rainwater tank and 13% of chtw samples contained campylobacter  spp. and g. lamblia, respectively. the number of e. coli (p = 0.78), enterococcus (p = 0.64), campylobacter (p = 0.44), and g. lamblia (p = 0.50) cells in rainwater tanks did not differ significantly from the numbers observed in the chtw samples. among the 40 possum fecal samples tested, campylobacter spp., cryptosporidium parvum, and g. lamblia were detected in 60%, 13%, and 30% of samples, respectively. among the 38 bird fecal samples tested, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., c. parvum, and g. lamblia were detected in 24%, 11%, 5%, and 13% of the samples, respectively. household tap water samples fed from rainwater tanks tested in the study appeared to be highly variable. regular cleaning of roofs and gutters, along with pruning of overhanging tree branches, might also prove effective in reducing animal fecal contamination of rainwater tanks.

TI  == toxic megacolon.
AB  == toxic megacolon represents a dreaded complication of mainly inflammatory or infectious conditions of the colon. it is most commonly associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ibd), i.e., ulcerative colitis or ileocolonic crohn's disease. lately, the epidemiology has shifted toward infectious causes, specifically due to an increase of clostridium difficile-associated colitis possibly due to the extensive (ab)use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. other important infectious etiologies include salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, cytomegalovirus (cmv), rotavirus, aspergillus, and entameba. less frequently, toxic megacolon has been attributed to ischemic colitis, collagenous colitis, or  obstructive colorectal cancer. toxic colonic dilatation may also occur in hemolytic-uremic syndrome (hus) caused by enterohemorrhagic or enteroaggregative  escherichia coli o157 (ehec, eaec, or eahec). the pathophysiological mechanisms leading to toxic colonic dilatation are incompletely understood. the main characteristics of toxic megacolon are signs of systemic toxicity and severe colonic distension. diagnosis is made by clinical evaluation for systemic toxicity and imaging studies depicting colonic dilatation. plain abdominal imaging is still the most established radiological instrument. however, computed  tomography scanning and transabdominal intestinal ultrasound are promising alternatives that add additional information. management of toxic megacolon is an interdisciplinary task that requires close interaction of gastroenterologists and surgeons from the very beginning. the optimal timing of surgery for toxic megacolon can be challenging. here we review the latest data on the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, laboratory, and imaging modalities and provide algorithms  for an evidence-based diagnostic and therapeutic approach.

TI  == systematic review: the use of proton pump inhibitors and increased susceptibility to enteric infection.
AB  == background: the use of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) is increasing worldwide. suppression of gastric acid alters the susceptibility to enteric bacterial pathogens. aim this systematic review was undertaken to examine the relationship  between ppi use and susceptibility to enteric infections by a specific pathogen based on published literature and to discuss the potential mechanisms of ppi enhanced pathogenesis of enteric infections. methods pubmed, ovid medline databases were searched. search terms included proton pump inhibitors and mechanisms of, actions of, gastric acid, enteric infections, diarrhoea, clostridium difficile, salmonella, shigella and campylobacter. results the use of ppis increases gastric ph, encourages growth of the gut microflora, increases bacterial translocation and alters various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects. enteric pathogens show variable gastric acid ph susceptibility and acid  tolerance levels. by multiple mechanisms, ppis appear to increase susceptibility  to the following bacterial enteropathogens: salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, invasive strains of escherichia coli, vegetative cells of clostridium difficile,  vibrio cholerae and listeria. we describe the available evidence for enhanced susceptibility to enteric infection caused by salmonella, campylobacter and c. difficile by ppi use, with adjusted relative risk ranges of 4.2-8.3 (two studies); 3.5-11.7 (four studies); and 1.2-5.0 (17 of 27 studies) for the three respective organisms. conclusions severe hypochlorhydria generated by ppi use leads to bacterial colonisation and increased susceptibility to enteric bacterial infection. the clinical implication of chronic ppi use among hospitalized patients placed on antibiotics and travellers departing for areas with high incidence of diarrhoea should be considered by their physicians.

TI  == a preliminary study of salmonella, verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli/escherichia coli o157 and campylobacter on four mixed farms.
AB  == the aims of this study were to investigate the incidence of salmonella, verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec)/escherichia coli o157 and campylobacter on four mixed farms and to characterize the isolates in terms of a range of virulence factors. eighty-nine composite (five different samples from the same animal species combined) faecal [cattle (24), pigs (14), sheep (4), poultry (4),  horses (7), deer (4), dogs (9), rodents (2) and wild birds (20)] samples, 16 composite soil samples plus 35 individual water samples were screened using culture-based, immunomagnetic separation and molecular methods. salmonella was detected in bovine faeces, cattle and poultry house water. salmonella serotypes/phage types included dublin, kiel and typhimurium dt193, and most isolates were spvc, inva and rck positive. the pefa and rck genes were found exclusively in the non-typhimurium strains, while salmonella dublin and salmonella kiel strains carried salmonella genomic island i marker(s). vtec/e. coli o157 were found in deer and dog faeces only. the e. coli o157 isolate was an enteroinvasive e. coli, while the vtec isolate was untypable but carried the vt1, eaea, hlya, tir and eptd genes. this article reports the first confirmed carriage of e. coli o157 in irish deer. campylobacter species were not detected over the course of this study. it was concluded that [1] salmonella, vtec and campylobacter have low (<5%) prevalence or are absent on the farms in this study; [2] water was an important source of bacterial pathogens; [3] both dogs and deer  may act as a source of pathogenic e. coli and [4] key virulence and resistance determinants are widespread in farm salmonella strains. this study highlights the need to control water as a source of pathogens and suggests that the domestic pets and deer should be considered in any farm risk assessment.

TI  == analysis of the liv system of campylobacter jejuni reveals alternative roles for  livj and livk in commensalism beyond branched-chain amino acid transport.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of diarrheal disease in humans and an intestinal commensal in poultry and other agriculturally important animals. these zoonotic infections result in significant amounts of c. jejuni present in the food supply to contribute to disease in humans. we previously found that a transposon insertion in cjj81176_1038, encoding a homolog of the escherichia coli livj periplasmic binding protein of the leucine, isoleucine, and valine (liv) branched-chain amino acid transport system, reduced the commensal colonization capacity of c. jejuni 81-176 in chicks. cjj81176_1038 is the first gene of a six-gene locus that encodes homologous components of the e. coli liv system. by analyzing mutants with in-frame deletions of individual genes or pairs of genes,  we found that this system constitutes a liv transport system in c. jejuni responsible for a high level of leucine acquisition and, to a lesser extent, isoleucine and valine acquisition. despite each liv protein being required for branched-chain amino acid transport, only the livj and livk periplasmic binding proteins were required for wild-type levels of commensal colonization of chicks.  all liv permease and atpase components were dispensable for in vivo growth. these results suggest that the biological functions of livj and livk for colonization are more complex than previously hypothesized and extend beyond a role for binding and acquiring branched-chain amino acids during commensalism. in contrast to other studies indicating a requirement and utilization of other specific amino acids for colonization, acquisition of branched-chain amino acids does not appear to be a determinant for c. jejuni during commensalism.

TI  == [investigation of verotoxigenic escherichia coli o157:h7 incidence in gastroenteritis patients].
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7 is the most common serotype among verotoxigenic e.coli (vtec) strains that cause haemolytic uremic syndrome. although sporadic vtec cases originating from turkey and small outbreaks have been reported from our country, vtec has not been routinely investigated in most of the diagnostic microbiology laboratories in turkey and studies related to this topic are limited. in this study, the incidence of e.coli o157:h7 in patients who were admitted to alanya research and application hospital of baskent university with the complaints of acute gastroenteritis between september 2005 and september 2008, was investigated. stool samples collected from 1815 diarrheal patients (of  them 50.5% were male; 49.3% were ? 5 years old; 10.2% were tourists) were evaluated initially by direct microscopy and then inoculated to hectoen enteric agar, emb agar, skirrow agar and cefixime tellurite sorbitol macconkey (ct-smc) agar media for cultivation. the sorbitol-negative colonies which were compatible  with e.coli according to the conventional methods were tested with e.coli polyvalent and 0157 and h7 monovalent antisera and agglutination positive strains were also investigated for verotoxin production in vero cell cultures. vtec rpla  toxin detection kit (oxoid, uk) was used for further identification of toxin type of verotoxin positive strains. fecal leukocytes were detected in 41.3% of the samples in direct microscopy, while 27% (173/639) of the samples were also found  positive for amoeba antigen, 6% (24/396) for rotavirus antigen, 1.2% (22/1815) for salmonella spp., 0.6% (11/1815) for shigella spp., 0.2% (4/1815) for giardia  trophozoites and 0.06% (1/1815) for campylobacter jejuni. the isolation rate of sorbitol-negative e.coli strains was %0.8 (14/1815), and two of them were identified as e.coli o157:h7 by monovalent antisera, and both of them were determined as verotoxin-producers in cell culture. verotoxin types of those isolates were found as verotoxin 1 in one strain and verotoxin 1 + verotoxin 2 in the other. the two patients infected with verotoxigenic e.coli o157:h7 were both  tourists (one was 7 and the other was 35 years old) and admitted to the emergency room of hospital with complaints of bloody diarrhea. no further investigation directed towards the origin of the pathogen could be performed in the hotels of these patients. these data indicated that vtec o157:h7 incidence was low (2/1815; 0.1%) in our area during the study period. thus, routine testing of stool samples for e.coli o157:h7 does not seem to be cost-effective. however, e.coli o157:h7 should necessarily be investigated at least in bloody diarrhea cases since this pathogen has serious morbidity, mortality and complications like haemolytic uremic syndrome, hemorrhagic colitis and also due to its epidemiological significance.

AB  == carcass chilling during broiler processing is a critical step in preventing growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. the objective of this study was to compare the microbiological quality of air- and water-chilled broiler carcasses processed at the same commercial facility. for each of four replications, 15 broilers were collected from the same commercial processing line after evisceration, after spraying with cetylpyridinium chloride (a cationic disinfectant), and after air chilling or water immersion chilling (wic). all carcasses were quantitatively examined for mesophilic aerobic bacteria, escherichia coli, coliforms, and campylobacter as well as for the presence of salmonella and campylobacter. no significant differences (p > 0.05) were seen between air and water chilling for e. coli or coliforms or for the incidence of salmonella and campylobacter. lower numbers of campylobacter were recovered from  wic than from air-chilled carcasses (p < 0.05), but the incidence of campylobacter on wic carcasses was similar, suggesting that some campylobacter organisms were injured rather than killed during wic. in-line spraying with the disinfectant effectively decreased the incidence of salmonella and campylobacter  on prechilled carcasses; however, cells presumably injured by the sanitizer recovered during chilling. therefore, on-farm intervention strategies remain critically important in minimizing the spread of microbial contaminants during processing.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibility of major foodborne pathogens in imported seafood.
AB  == seafood is a leading commodity implicated in foodborne disease outbreaks in the united states. seafood importation rose dramatically in the past 3 decades and now contributes to more than 80% of the total u.s. seafood supply. however, limited data are available on the microbiological safety of imported seafood. in  this study, we obtained a total of 171 salmon, shrimp, and tilapia samples imported from 12 countries in three retail stores in baton rouge, la. the total microbial population and the prevalence and antimicrobial susceptibilities of six major foodborne-pathogen genera (campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria, salmonella, shigella, and vibrio) were determined. the aerobic plate counts (apc) for the 171 samples averaged 4.96 log cfu/g, with samples from chile carrying the highest mean apc of 6.53 log cfu/g and fresh samples having a significantly higher mean apc than frozen ones (p < 0.0001). there were 27 samples (15.8%) with unacceptable microbiological quality (apc > 7 log cfu/g). by culture, no sample tested positive for campylobacter coli, shigella, or vibrio vulnificus. campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium were each recovered once from farm-raised tilapia from china. by pcr, 17.5 and 32.2% of the samples were positive for salmonella and shigella, respectively. the overall prevalence rates of other target bacteria were low, ranging from 4.1% for listeria monocytogenes to 9.4% for e. coli. all of the vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates recovered were from shrimp, and 63.3% showed intermediate resistance to  ampicillin. both c. jejuni isolates possessed a rare resistance to gentamicin, while 75% of l. monocytogenes isolates were resistant to nitrofurantoin. taken together, these findings suggest potential food safety hazards associated with imported seafood and warrant further large-scale studies.

TI  == associations among pathogenic bacteria, parasites, and environmental and land use factors in multiple mixed-use watersheds.
AB  == over a five year period (2004-08), 1171 surface water samples were collected from up to 24 sampling locations representing a wide range of stream orders, in a river basin in eastern ontario, canada. water was analyzed for cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cyst densities, the presence of salmonella enterica subspecies enterica, campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and escherichia  coli o157:h7. the study objective was to explore associations among pathogen densities/occurrence and objectively defined land use, weather, hydrologic, and water quality variables using cart (classification and regression tree) and binary logistical regression techniques. e. coli o157:h7 detections were infrequent, but detections were related to upstream livestock pasture density; 20% of the detections were located where cattle have access to the watercourses.  the ratio of detections:non-detections for campylobacter spp. was relatively higher (>1) when mean air temperatures were 6% below mean study period temperature values (relatively cooler periods). cooler water temperatures, which  can promote bacteria survival and represent times when land applications of manure typically occur (spring and fall), may have promoted increased frequency of campylobacter spp. fifty-nine percent of all salmonella spp. detections occurred when river discharge on a branch of the river system of shreve stream order = 9550 was >83 percentile. hydrological events that promote off farm/off field/in stream transport must manifest themselves in order for detection of salmonella spp. to occur in surface water in this region. fifty seven percent of  l. monocytogenes detections occurred in spring, relative to other seasons. it was speculated that a combination of winter livestock housing, silage feeding during  winter, and spring application of manure that accrued during winter, contributed  to elevated occurrences of this pathogen in spring. cryptosporidium and giardia oocyst and cyst densities were, overall, positively associated with surface water discharge, and negatively associated with air/water temperature during spring-summer-fall. yet, some of the highest cryptosporidium oocyst densities were associated with low discharge conditions on smaller order streams, suggesting wildlife as a contributing fecal source. fifty six percent of all detections of >/= 2 bacteria pathogens (including campylobacter spp., salmonella  spp., and e. coli o157:h7) in water was associated with lower water temperatures  (< approximately 14 degrees c; primarily spring and fall) and when total rainfall the week prior to sampling was > approximately 27 mm (62 percentile). during higher water temperatures (> approximately 14 degrees c), a higher amount of weekly rainfall was necessary to promote detection of >/= 2 pathogens (primarily  summer; weekly rainfall approximately >42 mm (>77 percentile); 15% of all >/= 2 detections). less rainfall may have been necessary to mobilize pathogens from adjacent land, and/or in stream sediments, during cooler water conditions; as these are times when manures are applied to fields in the area, and soil water contents and water table depths are relatively higher. season, stream order, turbidity, mean daily temperature, surface water discharge, cropland coverage, and nearest upstream distance to a barn and pasture were variables that were relatively strong and recurrent with regard to discriminating pathogen presence and absence, and parasite densities in surface water in the region.

AB  == glycoproteins constitute a class of compounds of increasing importance for pharmaceutical applications. the manipulation of bacterial protein glycosylation  systems from gram-negative bacteria for the synthesis of recombinant glycoproteins is a promising alternative to the current production methods. proteins carrying lewis antigens have been shown to have potential applications for the treatment of diverse autoimmune diseases. in this work, we developed a mixed approach consisting of in vivo and in vitro steps for the synthesis of glycoproteins containing the lewis x antigen. using glycosyltransferases from haemophilus influenzae, we engineered escherichia coli to assemble a tetrasaccharide on the lipid carrier undecaprenylphosphate. this glycan was transferred in vivo from the lipid to a carrier protein by the campylobacter jejuni oligosaccharyltransferase pglb. the glycoprotein was then fucosylated in vitro by a truncated fucosyltransferase from helicobacter pylori. diverse mass spectrometry techniques were used to confirm the structure of the glycan. the strategy presented here could be adapted in the future for the synthesis of diverse glycoproteins. our experiments demonstrate that bacterial enzymes can be  exploited for the production of glycoproteins carrying glycans present in human cells for potential therapeutic applications.

TI  == what you eat is what you get: novel campylobacter models in the quadrangle relationship between nutrition, obesity, microbiota and susceptibility to infection.
AB  == enterocolitis caused by campylobacter jejuni-infections represents an important socioeconomic burden worldwide. recent results from novel murine infection models reveal that the intestinal microbiota is essential for maintaining colonization resistance against c. jejuni. we extended these studies to investigate the role of nutrition and obesity in susceptibility to c. jejuni-infection. gnotobiotic (gb) mice generated by antibiotic treatment, which were fed with a human cafeteria diet (caf), as well as obese (ob/ob) mice with a conventional microbiota harbored higher escherichia coli loads in their colon as compared to respective controls. following oral infection, c. jejuni 43431 atcc readily colonized the intestines of caf and ob/ob mice, whereas gb mice fed with a standard chow (mud) eradicated the pathogen within days. furthermore, live c. jejuni translocated into mesenteric lymph nodes of caf, but not mud mice. strikingly, stably infected animals developed enterocolitis as indicated by increased numbers of immune and apoptotic cells in the colon in situ. we conclude that a specific human diet and obesity render mice susceptible to c. jejuni infection. the corresponding murine models are excellently suited for the study of c. jejuni pathogenesis and will help to get further insights into interplays between c. jejuni, microbiota, diet, obesity and immunity.

AB  == diarrheal diseases due to notifiable bacterial infections require rapid diagnosis of the causative pathogens. to facilitate detection, a real-time multiplex pcr was developed that identifies common diarrhea-causing bacteria in fecal samples.  on the basis of published sequence data, sets of primers and probes were designed that were specific for campylobacter jejuni, salmonella, shigella/enteroinvasive  escherichia coli eiec, and yersinia species, suitable for use in a one-tube pcr assay. the assay was assessed using a list of 137 well-defined intestinal bacterial strains or isolates. furthermore, 393 routine clinical stool samples were analyzed, and the results of real-time multiplex pcr were compared with those obtained by established microbiological methods. the pcr yielded results within 3h including dna purification. no false-positive signals or cross-reactions were observed. the analytical sensitivity was 10(3)cfuml(-1) for  campylobacter jejuni, 10(4)cfuml(-1) for salmonella, and 10(5)cfuml(-1) for shigella/eiec and yersinia, respectively. compared with culture, pcr detected 79  out of 81 campylobacter jejuni (97.5%), 71 out of 74 salmonella (96%), 8 out of 8 shigella (100%), and 10 out of 10 yersinia-positive (100%) clinical samples. in culture-negative samples (n=192), pcr additionally detected 2 shigella, 1 salmonella, and 5 campylobacter jejuni infections. thus, the new real-time multiplex pcr provides reliable results within a short time and might be useful as an additional diagnostic tool whenever time is important in the diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == [infectious enteritis].
AB  == infectious diarrhea belongs to the most frequent infections worldwide and can be  elicited by a wide array of microbial pathogens. in developed countries transmission occurs much more frequently from contaminated food as compared to direct person-to-person contact, except for enteric viruses which can also be transmitted by aerosol formation after vomiting. in germany, more than 90% of cases are caused by the four pathogens norovirus, rotavirus, campylobacter and salmonella. therapy of infectious diarrhea is mainly supportive. in cases with a  severe or prolonged course, signs of inflammation, bloody stool, immunosuppression, comorbidity and in suspected outbreaks, fecal microbial analysis should be performed and a specific therapy should be considered if indicated.

TI  == prevalence of foodborne pathogens in grilled chicken from street vendors and retail outlets in reynosa, tamaulipas, mexico.
AB  == we analyzed a total of 70 grilled chicken samples bought randomly from street vendors and retail outlets in the city of reynosa, mexico, to determine the prevalence of escherichia coli (shiga toxin producing and enterotoxin producing), salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and campylobacter spp. using microbiological methods and pcr detection of bacterial sequences. of the 70 samples, 27 (38.5%) were from retail outlets and 43 (61.4%) from street vendors.  all specimens were negative by both microbiological and molecular methods for listeria monocytogenes, shiga toxin 2 of shiga toxin-producing e. coli, lt of enterotoxin-producing e. coli, and st enterotoxin, and all were negative for salmonella spp. and campylobacter jejuni by pcr. of the samples studied, 49 (70%) had undetectable levels of the foodborne pathogens studied with the methods used. in the remaining 21 (30%) specimens, at least one pathogen was isolated or detected, with e. coli being the pathogen most frequently isolated and with two samples bearing the hlya gene. we found no statistical difference in bacterial prevalence between retail and street vendor samples. the presence of pathogens in grilled chicken is an important public health risk because of the great demand for and daily consumption of this product in this region.

TI  == physical, chemical and microbiological quality of ice used to cool drinks and foods in greece and its public health implications.
AB  == ice used for direct human consumption or to preserve foods and cool down drinks can be contaminated with pathogenic microorganisms and may potentially become a vehicle for consumer's infection. to evaluate physical, chemical and microbiological quality of commercial ice and ice used for fish and seafood, 100  ice samples collected at 10 different retail points in the region of epirus were  studied. the following microbiological parameters were determined: total coliforms, fecal coliforms, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia spp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa and clostridium perfringens. e. coli was detected in 22% and coliforms were detected in 31% of samples. samples in which coliforms were detected fail to meet the microbiological criteria specified by the drinking water legislation. aeromonas spp., shigella spp., campylobacter sp. and v. cholerae were not detected. spore forms of c. perfringens were prevalent at 35% and the psychotropic bacterium's p. aeruginosa and yersinia spp. were found only at three samples each. the presence of large numbers of coliforms as well as of other pathogenic strains suggested that commercial ice and ice used to make cool drinks or in preservation of fish and seafood may represent a potential hazard to the consumer. in view of the results reported herein, it is highly recommended that national regulatory guidelines should be established for the production of ice as long as regular inspections.

TI  == leaching of human pathogens in repacked soil lysimeters and contamination of potato tubers under subsurface drip irrigation in denmark.
AB  == the risk for contamination of potatoes and groundwater through subsurface drip irrigation with low quality water was explored in 30 large-scale lysimeters containing repacked coarse sand and sandy loam soils. the human pathogens, salmonella senftenberg, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157:h7, and the virus indicator salmonella typhimurium bacteriophage 28b, were added weekly through irrigation tubes for one month with low irrigation rates (8 mm per week). in the following six months lysimeters were irrigated with groundwater free of pathogens. two weeks after irrigation was started, phage 28b was detected in low  concentrations (2 pfu ml(-1)) in leachate from both sandy loam soil and coarse sand lysimeters. after 27 days, phage 28b continued to be present in similar concentrations in leachate from lysimeters containing coarse sand, while no phage were found in lysimeters with sandy loam soil. the added bacterial pathogens were not found in any leachate samples during the entire study period of 212 days. under the study conditions with repacked soil, limited macropores and low water velocity, bacterial pathogens seemed to be retained in the soil matrix and died-off before leaching to groundwater. however, viruses may leach to groundwater and represent a health risk as for some viruses only few virus particles are needed to cause human disease. the bacterial pathogens and the phage 28b were found on the potato samples harvested just after the application of microbial tracers was terminated. the findings of bacterial pathogens and phage 28 on all potato samples suggest that the main risk associated with subsurface drip irrigation with low quality water is faecal contamination of root crops, in particular those consumed raw.

TI  == bacteria as trigger for chronic gastrointestinal disorders.
AB  == apart from acute infections, microorganisms may also induce or perpetuate chronic inflammatory diseases and reversible or irreversible proliferation of various cells in the gastrointestinal tract (the extreme being adenocarcinoma and lymphoma). helicobacter pylori is not only involved in the pathogenesis of lymphoma and gastric adenocarcinoma. the steps and mechanisms of the carcinogenic process involve host predisposition, environmental factors, and strain virulence. the steps of lymphoma genesis include chronic inflammation, acquisition of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue in the stomach, proliferation of the b lymphocytes in an inflammatory context, acquisition of genetic anomalies and dysregulation of the nf-kappab pathway. the role of campylobacter jejuni in immunoproliferative small bowel disease has also been shown and eradication of this bacterium can cure the lymphoma at its early stage. the evidence for the role of some bacteria in colon cancer development is discussed. opportunistic pathogens are detected in the stools or mucosa of a proportion of subjects with crohn's disease. they include mycobacterium avium paratuberculosis, adherent invasive escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. a dysbiosis has been repeatedly observed in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. instability of the dominant microbiota and decreased biodiversity (especially in the firmicutes  phylum) are major characteristics. the decrease of faecalibacterium prausnitzii seems to have a prognostic value to predict relapse of crohn's disease after surgery. finally, important perspectives are opened by new tools such as metagenomics and metabolomics of the gastrointestinal ecosystems. major tracks concern irritable bowel syndrome, colon cancer and obesity.

TI  == hygienic quality and antibiotic resistance profile of sliced butchery.
AB  == in order to investigate the microbiological quality of different meat products on the greek market, 200 samples were collected from the following preparations: boiled turkey (n=50), boiled pork ham (n=50), smoked turkey (n=50) and smoked pork ham (n=50). in all cold meat preparations clostridium perfringens vegetative and spore forms, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli and other clostridium sp lec(-), as well as lactobacillus, bacillus sp. and salmonella sp. were recovered. for instance bacillus cereus was present in 6% of the samples. l. monocytogenes,  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were rarely present (1-4%) while yersinia enterocolitica and campylobacter lari were absent. differences in the occurrence of s. aureus, salmonella sp., e. coli and spore forms of c. perfringens in boiled and smoked samples, reflects either the differences in the  processing of the foods or could be associated to the extensive handling by the personnel during the purchasing (storage, slicing, wrapping). antibiotic resistance on specific antibiotics for each pathogen was also studied. a multiresistance antibiotic profile was effective for most bacterial strains, and  pronounced resistance profiles were observed for the commonly used antibiotics as ampicillin, penicillin, cephalothin, streptomycin followed by ceftriaxone and gentamycin. albeit this high observed resistance profile, the tested strains generally conserved their susceptibility to amikacin, aztreonam, chloramphenicol  and tylosin conserved an almost absent resistance. antibiotics commonly used for  therapeutic purposes, as well as antibiotics added to feed stuff of animals for increasing animal flesh production should contribute to the extensive spreading of antibiotic resistance in food and the environment. systematically monitoring of the microbiological quality of cold butchery preparations must be done, in order to preserve food quality, optimizing the processing and elaboration methods of the product and safeguard the public health.

TI  == microbial challenges of poultry meat production.
AB  == food safety and shelf-life are both important microbial concerns in relation to broiler meat production. focus is mainly placed on the absence or control of potentially pathogenic microbes such as salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. but, from the commercial point of view, other spoilage bacteria also play a role  as potential threats. regarding food safety, the primary target should be the production of pathogen-free live animals, thus allowing slaughter plants to keep  the processing line free of those microorganisms. consumers believe that quality  of foods from organic production is superior to foods from conventional production. the aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the bacterial quality of chicken meat from organic and conventional production on the basis of traditional meat quality criteria. fresh free grazing broiler carcasses  were purchased directly from rural households (n = 80) and fresh retail chicken parts from conventional broiler carcasses from the local supermarkets in the region of epirus (poultry producers association. arta) (n = 200). the samples were microbiologically tested for the presence of bacteria such as: salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., and c. perfringens. total count of aerobic  mesophilic bacteria was also determined. bacteriological tests were performed by  means of standard methods of isolation and identification of individual species of bacteria according to iso requirements. api-tests (biomerieux) and vitek 2 identification system (biomerieux) were used for biochemical determination. high  levels of microbial contamination and occurrence of pathogenic bacteria at then fresh free grazing broiler carcasses reflect the poor hygienic quality of the slaughter conditions in the rural households.

TI  == biofilms in drinking water and their role as reservoir for pathogens.
AB  == most microorganisms on earth live in various aggregates which are generally termed "biofilms". they are ubiquitous and represent the most successful form of  life. they are the active agent in biofiltration and the carriers of the self-cleaning potential in soils, sediments and water. they are also common on surfaces in technical systems where they sometimes cause biofouling. in recent years it has become evident that biofilms in drinking water distribution networks can become transient or long-term habitats for hygienically relevant microorganisms. important categories of these organisms include faecal indicator  bacteria (e.g., escherichia coli), obligate bacterial pathogens of faecal origin  (e.g., campylobacter spp.) opportunistic bacteria of environmental origin (e.g.,  legionella spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa), enteric viruses (e.g., adenoviruses, rotaviruses, noroviruses) and parasitic protozoa (e.g., cryptosporidium parvum).  these organisms can attach to preexisting biofilms, where they become integrated  and survive for days to weeks or even longer, depending on the biology and ecology of the organism and the environmental conditions. there are indications that at least a part of the biofilm populations of pathogenic bacteria persists in a viable but non-culturable (vbnc) state and remains unnoticed by the methods  appointed to their detection. thus, biofilms in drinking water systems can serve  as an environmental reservoir for pathogenic microorganisms and represent a potential source of water contamination, resulting in a potential health risk for humans if left unnoticed.

AB  == background: foodborne diseases are typically mild and self-limiting but can cause severe illness and death. we describe the epidemiology of deaths associated with  bacterial pathogens using data from the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) in the united states. methods: we analyzed foodnet data from 1996-2005 to determine the numbers and rates of deaths occurring within 7-days of laboratory-confirmation. results: during 1996-2005, foodnet ascertained 121,536 cases of laboratory-confirmed bacterial infections, including 552 (.5%) deaths, of which 215 (39%) and 168 (30%) were among persons infected with salmonella and  listeria, respectively. the highest age-specific average annual population mortality rates were in older adults (>/=65 years) for all pathogens except shigella, for which the highest age-specific average annual population mortality  rate was in children <5 years (.2/1 million population). overall, most deaths (58%; 318) occurred in persons >/=65 years old. listeria had the highest case fatality rate overall (16.9%), followed by vibrio (5.8%), shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157 (0.8%), salmonella (0.5%), campylobacter (0.1%), and shigella (0.1%). conclusions: salmonella and listeria remain the leading causes of death in the united states due to bacterial pathogens transmitted commonly through food. most such deaths occurred in persons >/=65 years old, indicating that this age group could benefit from effective food safety interventions.

TI  == food-specific attribution of selected gastrointestinal illnesses: estimates from  a canadian expert elicitation survey.
AB  == the study used a structured expert elicitation survey to derive estimates of food-specific attribution for nine illnesses caused by enteric pathogens in canada. it was based on a similar survey conducted in the united states and focused on campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes,  nontyphoidal salmonella enterica, shigella spp., vibrio spp., yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium parvum, and norwalk-like virus. a snowball approach was used to identify food safety experts within canada. survey respondents provided background information as well as self-assessments of their  expertise for each pathogen and the 12 food categories. depending on the pathogen, food source attribution estimates were based on responses from between  10 and 35 experts. for each pathogen, experts divided their estimates of total foodborne illness across 12 food categories and they provided a best estimate for each category as well as 5th and 95th percentile limits for foods considered to be vehicles. their responses were treated as triangular probability distributions, and linear aggregation was used to combine the opinions of each group of experts for each pathogen-food source group. across the 108 pathogen-food groups, a majority of experts agreed on 30 sources and 48 nonsources for illness. the number of food groups considered to be pathogen sources by a majority of experts varied by pathogen from a low of one food source for vibrio spp. (seafood) and c. parvum (produce) to a high of seven food sources for salmonella spp. beta distributions were fitted to the aggregated opinions and were reasonable representations for most of the pathogen-food group attributions. these results will be used to quantitatively assess the burden of foodborne illness in canada as well as to analyze the uncertainty in our estimates.

TI  == effects of feed-supplementation and hide-spray application of two sources of tannins on enteric and hide bacteria of feedlot cattle.
AB  == pathogenic bacteria attached to the hide or shed in the feces of cattle at slaughter can contaminate carcasses intended to be processed for human consumption. therefore, new pre-harvest interventions are needed to prevent the carriage and excretion of foodborne pathogens in cattle presented to the processing plant. the objectives of this study were to examine the antimicrobial  effects of hydrolysable tannin-rich chestnut and condensed tannin-rich mimosa extracts on bacterial indicators of foodborne pathogens when applied as a hide-intervention and as a feed additive to feedlot cattle. water (control) or solutions (3 % wt/vol) of chestnut- and mimosa-extract treatments were sprayed (25 ml) at the left costal side of each animal to a 1000 cm(2) area, divided in four equal quadrants. hide-swabs samples obtained at pre-, 2-min, 8-h, and 24-h post-spray application were cultured to enumerate escherichia coli/total coliforms and total aerobic plate counts. in a second experiment, diets supplemented without (controls) or with (1.5 % of diet dry matter) chestnut- or mimosa-extracts were fed during a 42-day experimental feeding period. weekly fecal samples starting on day 0, and rumen fluid obtained on days 0, 7, 21 or 42  were cultured to enumerate e.coli/total coliforms and campylobacter. tannin spray application showed no effect of treatment or post-application-time (p > 0.05) on  measured bacterial populations, averaging 1.7/1.8, 1.5/1.6 and 1.5/1.7 (log(1)(0)cfu/cm(2)) for e. coli/total coliforms, and 4.0, 3.4 and 4.2 (log(1)(0)cfu/cm(2)) in total aerobes for control, chestnut and mimosa treatments, respectively. mean (+/- sem) ruminal e. coli and total coliform concentrations (log(10) cfu/ml) were reduced (p < 0.01) in steers fed chestnut-tannins (3.6 and 3.8 +/- 0.1) in comparison with the controls (4.1 and 4.2 +/- 0.1). fecal e. coli concentrations were affected by treatment (p< 0.01),  showing the highest values (log(1)(0) cfu/g) in fecal contents from mimosa-fed steers compared to controls (5.9 versus 5.6 +/- 0.1 sem, respectively). total coliforms (log cfu/g) showed the highest values (p < 0.01) in feces from chestnut- and mimosa-fed steers (6.0 and 6.1 +/- 0.1 respectively) in comparison  with controls (5.7 +/- 0.1). fecal campylobacter concentrations (log(1)(0)cfu/g)  were affected by treatment (p < 0.05), day (p < 0.001) and their interaction (p < 0.01) with the controls having lower concentrations than chestnut- and mimosa-fed steers (0.4, 1.0, and 0.8 +/- 0.3, respectively). it was concluded that under our research conditions, tannins were not effective in decreasing measured bacterial  populations on beef cattle hides. additionally, chestnut tannin reduced e. coli and total coliforms within the rumen but the antimicrobial effect was not maintained in the lower gastrointestinal tract. further research is necessary to  elucidate the possible antimicrobial effects of tannins at site-specific locations of the gastrointestinal tract in beef cattle fed high-grain and high-forage diets.

TI  == frequency of detection of escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and campylobacter spp. in the faeces of wild rats (rattus spp.) in trinidad and tobago.
AB  == the study was conducted to determine the frequency of isolation of salmonella, campylobacter and e. coli o157 in the faecal samples of rats trapped across the regional corporations in trinidad and to assess their resistance to antimicrobial agents. a total of 204 rats were trapped for the detection of selected bacteria.  standard methods were used to isolate salmonella, campylobacter and e. coli o157. characterization of e. coli was done on sorbitol macconkey agar to determine non-sorbitol fermentation, blood agar to determine haemolytic and mucoid colonies and by using e. coli o157 antiserum to determine o157 strain. the disc diffusion  method was used to determine resistance to nine antimicrobial agents. of the 204  rats, 4 (2.0%), 7 (3.4%) and 171 (83.8%) were positive for salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and e. coli, respectively. of the 171 isolates of e. coli tested 0 (0.0%), 25 (14.6%) and 19 (11.1%) were haemolytic, mucoid and non-sorbitol fermenters, respectively. all isolates were negative for the o157 strain. the frequency of resistance to the 9 antimicrobial agents tested was 75%  (3 of 4) for salmonella, 85.7% (6 of 7) of campylobacter spp. and 36.3% (62 of 171) for e. coli (p < .05; chi(2)).

TI  == isolation of campylobacter sp in surface waters of taiwan.
AB  == background: campylobacter sp is one of the main causes of human acute enteritis and diarrhea. it is commonly found in bird intestinal canal and pollutes water bodies through bird droppings. clinically, detection of campylobacter sp is by culture method and most are fecal samples. the objective of this study is to investigate the distribution of campylobacter sp in river water of taiwan. methods: the detection of campylobacters in water by the united kingdom health protection agency was adopted and simplified. water samples (1l) were enriched through membrane filters and selective enrichment bolton broth. the mccda medium  was used for culturing campylobacter sp. in addition to using the selective media, dna sequencing for species' identification was also included in this study. results: campylobacter sp was detected in only 2 of 75 water samples, and  72 suspected strains were isolated from the selective mccda medium, in which several pathogenic bacteria included escherichia coli o157. conclusions: not only there was pollution of campylobacter sp in water environment but also other antibiotics-resistant pathogenic bacteria, which may cause public health risk.

TI  == the virulence factor peb4 (cj0596) and the periplasmic protein cj1289 are two structurally related sura-like chaperones in the human pathogen campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the peb4 protein is an antigenic virulence factor implicated in host cell adhesion, invasion, and colonization in the food-borne pathogen campylobacter jejuni. peb4 mutants have defects in outer membrane protein assembly and peb4 is  thought to act as a periplasmic chaperone. the crystallographic structure of peb4 at 2.2-a resolution reveals a dimer with distinct sura-like chaperone and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (ppiase) domains encasing a large central cavity. unlike sura, the chaperone domain is formed by interlocking helices from  each monomer, creating a domain-swapped architecture. peb4 stimulated the rate of proline isomerization limited refolding of denatured rnase t(1) in a juglone-sensitive manner, consistent with parvulin-like ppiase domains. refolding and aggregation of denatured rhodanese was significantly retarded in the presence of peb4 or of an engineered variant specifically lacking the ppiase domain, suggesting the chaperone domain possesses a holdase activity. using bioinformatics approaches, we identified two other sura-like proteins (cj1289 and cj0694) in c. jejuni. the 2.3-a structure of cj1289 does not have the domain-swapped architecture of peb4 and thus more resembles sura. purified cj1289 also enhanced rnase t(1) refolding, although poorly compared with peb4, but did not retard the refolding of denatured rhodanese. structurally, cj1289 is the most similar protein to sura in c. jejuni, whereas peb4 has most structural similarity to the par27 protein of bordetella pertussis. our analysis predicts that cj0694 is equivalent to the membrane-anchored chaperone ppid. these results provide the  first structural insights into the periplasmic assembly of outer membrane proteins in c. jejuni.

TI  == evaluation of low-copy genetic targets for waterborne bacterial pathogen detection via qpcr.
AB  == recent developments in water quality research have highlighted difficulties in accurately predicting the incidence of pathogens within freshwater based on the viability, culturability and metabolic activity of indicator organisms. qpcr-driven assays are candidates to replace standard culture-based methods, however, protocols suitable for routine use have yet to be sufficiently validated. the objective of this study was to evaluate five oligonucleotide primers sets (etir, sinv, exot, vs1 and ipah2) for their potential applicability  in qpcr assays to detect contamination from five waterborne bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and shigella flexneri). an enrichment-free qpcr protocol  was also tested using s. typhimurium-seeded source water, combining membrane filtration and mechanical, chemical and enzymatic lysis techniques to recover the bacterial cells. all five primer sets were found to have high specificity and sensitivity for the tested organisms. four of the primers were able to detect pathogen loads as low as 10 cells/ml while 200 cells/ml of c. jejuni were detectable in pure culture. although sensitivity decreased in an artificially contaminated environmental matrix, it was still possible to detect as few as 10 s. typhimurium cells without enrichment. the primers and protocols evaluated in this study have demonstrated potential for further validation for possible application alongside traditional indicator techniques.

TI  == bacterial pathogens in hawaiian coastal streams--associations with fecal indicators, land cover, and water quality.
AB  == this work aimed to understand the distribution of five bacterial pathogens in o'ahu coastal streams and relate their presence to microbial indicator concentrations, land cover of the surrounding watersheds, and physical-chemical measures of stream water quality. twenty-two streams were sampled four times (in  december and march, before sunrise and at high noon) to capture seasonal and time of day variation. salmonella, campylobacter, staphylococcus aureus, vibrio vulnificus, and v. parahaemolyticus were widespread -12 of 22 o'ahu streams had all five pathogens. all stream waters also had detectable concentrations of four  fecal indicators and total vibrio with log mean +/- standard deviation densities  of 2.2 +/- 0.8 enterococci, 2.7 +/- 0.7 escherichia coli, 1.1 +/- 0.7 clostridium perfringens, 1.2 +/- 0.8 f(+) coliphages, and 3.6 +/- 0.7 total vibrio per 100 ml. bivariate associations between pathogens and indicators showed enterococci positively associated with the greatest number of bacterial pathogens. higher concentrations of enterococci and higher incidence of campylobacter were found in stream waters collected before sunrise, suggesting these organisms are sensitive  to sunlight. multivariate regression models of microbes as a function of land cover and physical-chemical water quality showed positive associations between salmonella and agricultural and forested land covers, and between s. aureus and urban and agricultural land covers; these results suggested that sources specific to those land covers may contribute these pathogens to streams. further, significant associations between some microbial targets and physical-chemical stream water quality (i.e., temperature, nutrients, turbidity) suggested that organism persistence may be affected by stream characteristics. results implicate streams as a source of pathogens to coastal waters. future work is recommended to determine infectious risks of recreational waterborne illness related to o'ahu stream exposures and to mitigate these risks through control of land-based runoff sources.

TI  == 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase is implicated in playing a key role in a modified futalosine pathway for menaquinone biosynthesis in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == menaquinone (vitamin k(2)) serves as an electron carrier in the electron transport chain required for respiration in many pathogenic bacteria. most bacteria utilize a common menaquinone biosynthetic pathway as exemplified by escherichia coli. recently, a novel biosynthetic pathway, the futalosine pathway, was discovered in streptomyces. bioinformatic analysis strongly suggests that this pathway is also operative in the human pathogens campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter pylori. here, we provide compelling evidence that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in c. jejuni and that it utilizes 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine instead of futalosine. a key step in the streptomyces pathway involves a nucleosidase called futalosine hydrolase. the closest homolog  in c. jejuni has been annotated as a 5'-methylthioadenosine nucleosidase (mtan).  we have shown that this c. jejuni enzyme has mtan activity but negligible futalosine hydrolase activity. however, the c. jejuni mtan is able to hydrolyze 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine at a rate comparable with that of its known substrates. this suggests that the adenine-containing version of futalosine is the true biosynthetic intermediate in this organism. to demonstrate this in vivo, we constructed a c. jejuni mutant strain deleted for mqna2, which is predicted to encode for the enzyme required to synthesize 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine. growth of this mutant was readily rescued by the addition of 6-amino-6-deoxyfutalosine, but not futalosine. this provides the first direct evidence that a modified futalosine pathway is operative in c. jejuni. it also highlights the tremendous versatility of the c. jejuni mtan, which plays key roles in s-adenosylmethionine  recycling, the biosynthesis of autoinducer molecules, and the biosynthesis of menaquinone.

TI  == restoring the selectivity of bolton broth during enrichment for campylobacter spp. from raw chicken.
AB  == aims: when isolating campylobacter spp. from retail raw chicken using bs en iso 10272-1:2006, contaminants frequently cause overgrowth on mccda plates. therefore, these organisms proliferate in the enrichment medium, bolton broth, indicating a lack of selectivity in this medium. this study sought to characterize the contaminant flora and to devise a modified bolton broth to inhibit their growth. methods and results: contaminants (n=30) from separate samples were identified and antibiotic resistances determined. most (93%) were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli, able to hydrolyse the cefoperazone present in bolton broth and mccda. to inhibit these organisms, original formulation bolton broth was supplemented with potassium clavulanate, at three concentrations, and recoveries of campylobacters from raw chicken were determined. using standard bolton broth, only 49% of samples (n=104) yielded campylobacters, but supplementation with 2 mg l(-1) potassium clavulanate increased this significantly (p<0.05), with 91% of samples positive. conclusions: potassium clavulanate can restore the selectivity of bolton broth when isolating  campylobacter spp. from raw chicken. significance and impact of the study: raw chicken is often contaminated with the pathogen campylobacter, but the iso methodology for its detection is becoming compromised by the increasing presence  of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. a simple modification ensures effective detection of this pathogen.

TI  == efficacy of uv light treatment for the microbiological decontamination of chicken, associated packaging, and contact surfaces.
AB  == uv light was investigated for the decontamination of raw chicken, associated packaging, and contact surfaces. the uv susceptibilities of a number of campylobacter isolates (seven campylobacter jejuni isolates and three campylobacter coli isolates), escherichia coli atcc 25922, and salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis atcc 10376 in liquid media were also investigated. from an initial level of 7 log cfu/ml, no viable campylobacter cells were detected following exposure to the most intense uv dose (0.192 j/cm(2)) in liquid media (skim milk subjected to ultrahigh-temperature treatment and diluted 1:4 with maximum recovery diluent). maximum reductions of 4.8 and 6.2 log cfu/ml were achieved for e. coli and serovar enteritidis, respectively, in liquid media. considerable differences in susceptibilities were found between the campylobacter isolates examined, with variations of up to 4 log cfu/ml being observed. uv treatment of raw chicken fillet (0.192 j/cm(2)) reduced c. jejuni, e. coli, serovar enteritidis, total viable counts, and enterobacteriaceae by 0.76, 0.98, 1.34, 1.76, and 1.29 log cfu/g, respectively. following uv treatment of packaging and surface materials, reductions of up to 3.97, 4.50, and 4.20 log cfu/cm(2) were obtained for c. jejuni, e. coli, and serovar enteritidis, respectively (p <  0.05). overall, the color of uv-treated chicken was not significantly affected (p >/= 0.05). the findings of this study indicate that campylobacter is susceptible  to uv technology and that differences in sensitivities exist between investigated isolates. overall, uv could be used for improving the microbiological quality of  raw chicken and for decontaminating associated packaging and surface materials.

TI  == new developments in traveler's diarrhea.
AB  == traveler's diarrhea (td) is a crucial area for research, as it affects millions of tourists each year and creates a large economic burden. more than 60% of td cases are caused by a variety of bacterial enteropathogens: diarrhea-producing escherichia coli, shigella, campylobacter, salmonella, aeromonas, plesiomonas, and noncholera vibrios. noroviruses are also an important cause of morbidity among travelers. recent studies have identified host genetic risk factors associated with susceptibility to pathogen-specific td. prevention strategies should be emphasized, as all individuals with td experience approximately 24 hours of disability and 5-10% experience chronic functional bowel disease. poorly absorbed rifaximin provides protection for trips lasting 2 weeks or less. td vaccines are also currently in development. all individuals planning trips to developing regions should be armed with 1 of the 3 agents that have shown efficacy for self-treatment of td: ciprofloxacin (or levofloxacin), rifaximin, or azithromycin, depending upon the location of the trip. although global epidemiologic changes in etiologic agents as well as antibiotic resistance patterns have been better understood recently, changes should be expected during  the next decade due to new prevention and treatment approaches.

TI  == inactivation of indicators and pathogens in cattle feedlot manures and compost as determined by molecular and culture assays.
AB  == accurate and conservative information about pathogen inactivation rates is needed as the basis for safe manure management on beef cattle feedlots. the survival of  indicators and pathogens in faecal pen manure, stockpiled manure and manure compost was measured with autochthonous indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, enterococci, total coliforms) and pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni) using culture and/or real-time quantitative  pcr (qpcr) methods. additionally, the manures were incubated at 20, 37, 50 and 60 degrees c in microcosms to quantify the persistence of autochthonous microorganisms and selected process performance surrogates (clostridium sporogenes, green fluorescent protein-labelled e. coli and l. monocytogenes). estimated qpcr cell counts indicated that up to four orders of magnitude more target cells were present compared with the culturable counts. corresponding t(90) estimates were up to sixfold higher. this study demonstrates the benefits of nucleic acid-based quantification of pathogen inactivation in cattle manures and concludes that the concurrent analysis of microorganisms by molecular and culture methods provides complementary value.

TI  == sensitive quantification of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica , and campylobacter jejuni by combining stopped polymerase chain reaction with chemiluminescence flow-through dna microarray analysis.
AB  == rapid analysis of pathogenic bacteria is essential for food and water control to  preserve the public health. therefore, we report on a chemiluminescence (cl) flow-through dna microarray assay for the rapid and sensitive quantification of the pathogenic bacteria escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica , and campylobacter jejuni in water. using the stopped polymerase chain reaction (pcr)  strategy, the amount of amplified target dna was strongly dependent on the applied cell concentration. the amplification was stopped at the logarithmic phase of the pcr to quantify the dna products on the dna microarray chip. the generation of single-stranded dna sequences is essential for dna hybridization assays on microarrays. therefore, the dna strands of the pcr products were separated by streptavidin-conjugated magnetic nanoparticles. this was achieved by introducing a reverse primer labeled with biotin together with a digoxigenin labeled forward primer for cl microarray imaging. a conjugate of an antidigoxigenin antibody and horseradish peroxidase recognized the digoxigenin-labeled antistrands bound to the probes on the microarray surface and catalyzed the reaction of luminol and hydrogen peroxide. the generated light emission was recorded by a sensitive charge-coupled device (ccd) camera. the quantification was conducted by a flow-through cl microarray readout system. the  dna microarrays were based on an nhs-activated poly(ethylene glycol)-modified glass substrate. the dna probes which have the same dna sequence as the reverse primer were immobilized on this surface. the full assay was characterized by spiking experiments with heat-inactivated bacteria in water. the total assay time was 3.5 h, and the detection limits determined on cl microarrays were for e. coli o157:h7, s. enterica , and c. jejuni 136, 500, and 1 cell/ml, respectively. the results of the dna microarray assay were comparable to the sybr green-based assays analyzed with a real-time pcr device. the advantage of the new microarray  analysis method is seen in the ability of a high multiplex degree on dna microarrays, the high specificity of dna hybridization on dna microarrays, and the possibility to get quantitative results on an automated cl flow-through microarray analysis system.

TI  == etiology of diarrhea in young children and patterns of antibiotic resistance in cambodia.
AB  == background: little is known about diarrhea etiology and antibiotic resistance in  developing countries where diarrhea is a major public health problem. methods: to describe diarrhea etiology and antibiotic resistance patterns in cambodia, 600 children aged 3 months to 5 years with acute diarrhea (cases) and 578 children without diarrhea (controls) were enrolled from a hospital in phnom penh. stool samples were collected, and pathogens and antibiotic resistance patterns were described. results: the most frequently isolated pathogens in these cases were enteroaggregative escherichia coli (20%) and rotavirus (26%). enterotoxigenic e.  coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, shigella, aeromonas, rotavirus, and adenovirus were statistically significantly associated with diarrhea. among cases, vomiting  was associated with viral infections, whereas bloody stool was associated with shigella. enterotoxigenic e. coli isolates were highly resistant to ampicillin, sulfonamides, and tetracycline. approximately 50% of campylobacter coli and 30% of campylobacter jejuni isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin. over 33% of salmonella isolates were resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline, and almost 100% of shigella isolates were resistant to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. conclusions: these data on the etiology of diarrhea and antibiotic resistance patterns in cambodia will have significant effect on local public health policies and on local resource prioritization practices.

TI  == campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli on broiler carcasses subjected to a high ph scald and low ph postpick chlorine dip.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the individual and combined effects  of a high ph scald and a postpick chlorine dip on bacteria present on broiler carcasses. in each of 3 replications, a flock was sampled at several sites within a commercial broiler processing plant. carcasses were sampled by whole carcass rinse before and after treated scalding at mean ph 9.89 or control scalding at mean ph 6.88. other carcasses from the same flock run on both the treated and control scald lines were collected and sampled before and after a chlorine dip tank operated at mean total chlorine level of 83.3 mg/kg and ph 6.04. rinses were cultured for numbers of campylobacter and escherichia coli and presence or absence of salmonella. high ph scald was more effective than standard scald to lessen the prevalence and numbers of campylobacter on broiler carcasses; a lower  prevalence was maintained through the postpick chlorine dip tank. the ph of the scald tank made no difference in numbers of e. coli recovered from broiler carcasses at any tested point on the processing line. high ph scald was not more  effective than standard scald to lessen salmonella prevalence. furthermore, it is unclear why the postpick chlorine dip effectively lessened salmonella prevalence  on only the control scald line. although no evidence exists that these treatments have an additive effect when used in series, each treatment shows some promise individually. further optimization may result in more effective decontamination of broiler carcasses.

TI  == improving n-glycosylation efficiency in escherichia coli using shotgun proteomics, metabolic network analysis, and selective reaction monitoring.
AB  == recently, the prospect of using escherichia coli as a host for human glycoprotein production has increased due to detailed characterization of the prokaryotic n-glycosylation process and the ability to transfer the system into this bacterium. although functionality of the native campylobacter jejuni n-glycosylation system in e. coli has been demonstrated, the efficiency of the process using the well-characterized c. jejuni glycoprotein acra, was found to be low at 13.4+/-0.9% of total extracted protein. a combined approach using isobaric labeling of peptides and probability-based network analysis of metabolic changes  was applied to forward engineer e. coli to improve glycosylation efficiency of acra. enhancing flux through the glyoxylate cycle was identified as a potential metabolic manipulation to improve modification efficiency and was achieved by increasing the expression of isocitrate lyase. while the overall recombinant protein titre did not change significantly, the amount of glycosylated protein increased by approximately 300%.

TI  == related antimicrobial resistance genes detected in different bacterial species co-isolated from swine fecal samples.
AB  == a potential factor leading to the spread of antimicrobial resistance (ar) in bacteria is the horizontal transfer of resistance genes between bacteria in animals or their environment. to investigate this, swine fecal samples were collected on-farm and cultured for escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, campylobacter spp., and enterococcus spp. which are all commonly found in swine.  forty-nine of the samples from which all four bacteria were recovered were selected yielding a total of 196 isolates for analysis. isolates were tested for  antimicrobial susceptibility followed by hybridization to a dna microarray designed to detect 775 ar-related genes. e. coli and salmonella isolated from the same fecal sample had the most ar genes in common among the four bacteria. genes  detected encoded resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(3), aada1, aadb, and strab),  beta-lactams (ampc, ampr, and bla(tem)), chloramphenicols (cat and flor), sulfanillic acid (sul1/suli), tetracyclines (tet(a), tet(d), tet(c), tet(g), and  tet(r)), and trimethoprim (dfra1 and dfh). campylobacter coli and enterococcus isolated from the same sample frequently had tet(o) and apha-3 genes detected in  common. almost half (47%) of e. coli and salmonella isolated from the same fecal  sample shared resistance genes at a significant level (chi(2), p < 0.0000001). these data suggest that there may have been horizontal exchange of ar genes between these bacteria or there may be a common source of ar genes in the swine environment for e. coli and salmonella.

TI  == change is good: variations in common biological mechanisms in the epsilonproteobacterial genera campylobacter and helicobacter.
AB  == microbial evolution and subsequent species diversification enable bacterial organisms to perform common biological processes by a variety of means. the epsilonproteobacteria are a diverse class of prokaryotes that thrive in diverse habitats. many of these environmental niches are labeled as extreme, whereas other niches include various sites within human, animal, and insect hosts. some epsilonproteobacteria, such as campylobacter jejuni and helicobacter pylori, are  common pathogens of humans that inhabit specific regions of the gastrointestinal  tract. as such, the biological processes of pathogenic campylobacter and helicobacter spp. are often modeled after those of common enteric pathogens such  as salmonella spp. and escherichia coli. while many exquisite biological mechanisms involving biochemical processes, genetic regulatory pathways, and pathogenesis of disease have been elucidated from studies of salmonella spp. and  e. coli, these paradigms often do not apply to the same processes in the epsilonproteobacteria. instead, these bacteria often display extensive variation  in common biological mechanisms relative to those of other prototypical bacteria. in this review, five biological processes of commonly studied model bacterial species are compared to those of the epsilonproteobacteria c. jejuni and h. pylori. distinct differences in the processes of flagellar biosynthesis, dna uptake and recombination, iron homeostasis, interaction with epithelial cells, and protein glycosylation are highlighted. collectively, these studies support a  broader view of the vast repertoire of biological mechanisms employed by bacteria and suggest that future studies of the epsilonproteobacteria will continue to provide novel and interesting information regarding prokaryotic cellular biology.

TI  == travelers' diarrhea in nepal: an update on the pathogens and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == background: diarrhea is the most common illness among travelers and expatriates in nepal. published data on the etiology of travelers' diarrhea (td) in nepal are over 13 years old and no prior data exist on antibiotic susceptibility for currently used drugs. we investigated the etiology of diarrhea and antimicrobial  susceptibility pattern of bacterial pathogens and compared the results to previous work from the same clinical setting. methods: a total of 381 cases and 176 controls were enrolled between march 2001 and 2003 in a case-control study. enrollees were over age 18 years from high socioeconomic countries visiting or living in nepal. stool samples were assessed by microbiologic, molecular identification, and enzyme immunoassay (eia) methods, and antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by disk diffusion. risk factors were assessed by questionnaires. results: at least one enteropathogen was identified in 263 of 381 (69%) cases and 47 of 176 (27%) controls (p </= 0.001). pathogens significantly detected among cases were campylobacter (17%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) (15%), shigella (13%), and giardia (11%). cyclospora was detected only in  cases (8%) mainly during monsoon season. although 71% of campylobacter isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, 80% of bacterial isolates overall were sensitive to either ciprofloxacin or azithromycin while 20% were intermediately sensitive or resistant. no bacterial isolates were resistant to both drugs. conclusions: the most common pathogens causing td in nepal were campylobacter, etec, and shigella. because resistance to fluoroquinolone or azithromycin was similar, one  of these drugs could be used as empiric therapy for td with the other reserved for treatment failures.

AB  == in this study, 5 different commercial dna extraction systems were tested on a stool sample collection containing 81 clinical stool specimens that were culture-positive for diarrheagenic escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, or clostridium difficile. the purified dnas were analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) directed toward the relevant organisms. the results showed that conventional pcr combined with the extraction systems biorobot ez1 (qiagen, hilden, germany), bugs'n beads (genpoint, oslo, norway), chargeswitch (invitrogen, paisley, uk), qiaamp stool mini kit (qiagen), and 2 protocols (generic and specific a) for easymag (biomerieux, marcy i'etoile, france) were able to identify 89%, 62%, 85%, 88%, 85%, and 91%, respectively, of  the pathogens originally identified by conventional culture-based methods. when taqman pcr was combined with the easymag specific a protocol, 99% of the samples  were correctly identified. the results demonstrate that the extraction efficiencies can vary significantly among different extraction systems, careful optimization may have a significant positive effect, and the use of sensitive and specific detection methods like taqman pcr is an ideal choice for this type of analysis.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute gastroenteritis in infants in north-west  italy.
AB  == enteropathogenic escherichia coli may cause diarrhoea in infancy, but it is not routinely detected and regarded as a major causative agent. the aim of the present study was to estimate the incidence of enteropathogenic e. coli infection and to investigate its epidemiology and pathogenesis from faecal specimens in infants hospitalized for acute gastroenteritis. between march 2008 and june 2009, faecal samples were collected and examined to recognize diarrhoeal aetiology, especially for e. coli, by cultural identification and multiplex-pcr. e. coli were isolated in 75 of 160 collected samples (46,88%); 10 samples of which (6,3%) had been positively recognised for pathogenic genes. data showed that the presence of diarrheagenic e. coli infection was 6.3%, but it becomes 5% considering e. coli as a unique agent responsible for diarrhoea. the datum is not statistically meaningful because of the small sample (p>0,05). bacterial pathogens were also isolated in 60 samples (37,5% of the total collected samples): 15 salmonella spp., 8 klebsiella pneumoniae, 9 klebsiella oxytoca, 11 citrobacter freundii, 5 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 2 serratia spp., 7 enterobacter cloacae, 1 shigella spp., 2 campylobacter spp. rotavirus was the predominant pathogenic single etiologic agent identified. it was found in 35 samples (21.88%  of the overall collected samples), while adenovirus, serotypes 40 or 41, was isolated in 2 samples (1.3%). rotavirus infection was found predominantly in winter with respect to autumn. data provide an interesting epidemiologic survey of enteropathogenic e. coli, which is not usually detected, although it may have  potential clinical implications. abbreviations: cdec, detaching e. coli; daec, diffusely adherent e. coli; eaggec, enteroaggregative e. coli; ehec, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli; eiec, enteroinvasive e. coli; epec, enteropathogenic  e. coli; etec, enterotoxigenic e. coli.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni in bottled purified drinking water under different storage conditions.
AB  == survival of escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni that were separately inoculated into bottled purified drinking water was investigated during storage at 22, 4, and -18 degrees c for 5, 7, and 2 days, respectively. two inoculation levels were used, 1 and 10 cfu/ml (10(2) and 10(3) cfu/100 ml). in samples inoculated with 10(2) cfu/100 ml, c. jejuni was not detectable (>2-log reduction) after storage under the conditions specified above. e. coli o157:h7 was detected on nonselective and selective media at log reductions of 1.08 to 1.25 after storage at 22 degrees c, 1.19 to 1.56 after storage at 4 degrees c, and 1.54 to 1.98 after storage at -18 degrees c. when the higher inoculation level of 10(3) cfu/100 ml was used, c. jejuni was able to survive at 22 and 4 degrees c, with 2.25- and 2.17-log reductions, respectively, observed on nonselective media. at these higher inoculation levels, e. coli o157:h7 was detectable at 22, 4, and -18 degrees c, with log reductions of 0.76, 0.97, and 1.21, respectively, achieved on nonselective media. additionally, e. coli o157:h7 showed significant differences in culturability (p<0.05) on the nonselective and  selective culture media under the different storage conditions, with storage at -18 degrees c for 2 days being the treatment most inhibiting. the percentage of sublethal injury of e. coli o157:h7 ranged from approximately 33 to 75%, indicating that microbial examination of bottled water must be done carefully, otherwise false-negative results or underestimation of bacterial numbers could pose a health risk when low levels of pathogens are present.

TI  == a charcoal- and blood-free enrichment broth for isolation and pcr detection of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli in chicken.
AB  == the microaerophilic nature of campylobacter and its requirement of approximately  5% o(2) for growth have complicated its recovery from foods. the addition to the  enrichment media of oxygen quenchers such as charcoal or blood could interfere with pcr for its detection. in this study, a two-step simple aerobic method for campylobacter detection is proposed. a modification of the tran blood-free enrichment broth (bfeb), in which charcoal was excluded from the medium (m-bfeb), was compared with the original formulation and other enrichment broths. campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were screened by pcr directly from the enrichment media. various levels of pure cultures of c. jejuni and c. coli combined with escherichia coli were inoculated into preston, bolton, bfeb, and the modified bfeb (m-bfeb). in addition, campylobacter was inoculated onto retail purchased chicken skin and recovery was quantified. rates of recovery after 24 to 48 h of enrichment at 42 degrees c under aerobic incubation for bfeb and m-bfeb and microaerobic incubations for preston and bolton broths were determined. overall, our results indicated that the most sensitive medium was bolton's, followed by either bfeb or m-bfeb; the least sensitive was preston's. m-bfeb was  directly coupled to a pcr assay to detect campylobacter, avoiding intermediate plating. campylobacter was detected in the presence of up to 10(8) e. coli cells  per ml. m-bfeb facilitated detection of both c. jejuni and c. coli artificially inoculated onto chicken skin samples. m-bfeb coupled to pcr is a rapid and attractive alternative for isolation and identification of c. coli and c. jejuni  from poultry.

TI  == explaining differential sources of zoonotic pathogens in intensively-farmed catchments using kinematic waves.
AB  == surveys in streams draining intensively farmed catchments can, during flood events, indicate differential time-concentration patterns between a bacterial health-risk indicator (e. coli) and a major zoonotic pathogen that it seeks to indicate-campylobacter. the indicator's peak concentration at a monitoring station can arrive ahead of the flood peak (the pollutograph leads the hydrograph), whereas the peak pathogen concentration arrives with the flood peak  (the pollutograph and hydrograph peaks coincide). in other cases the e. coli pollutograph can lag the hydrograph. these observations have generated the hypothesis that such behaviour reflects three different possible (predominant) sources of pathogens in the floodwater: (i) by sediment entrainment, (ii) via local land runoff, or (iii) from upstream releases (e.g., from dams, inflows, or  upstream floods). a general theory for contaminants in idealized stream floods has been developed, considering all three sources, based on kinematic wave theory. it can explain the observed differential time-concentration patterns. the calculation procedures and associated results are intended to inform public policy, by identifying predominant pathogen sources and therefore helping to focus attention on the important delivery mechanisms. this will better inform quantitative health risk assessments for downstream water users (recreational uses, water supplies, food production and processing industries).

AB  == introduction: assessment of specific mrnas in human samples is useful in characterizing disease. however, mrna in human stool has been understudied. results: compared to controls, infected stools showed increased transcripts of il-1beta, il-8 and calprotectin. mrna and protein concentrations correlated for il-8, but not for calprotectin. discussion: stool mrna quantification offers a potentially useful, noninvasive way to assess inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract, and may be more sensitive than eia. methods: we purified  fecal rna from 46 children infected with campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp. or shigella sonnei and 26 controls and compared the proportions of il-1beta, il-8, osteoprotegerin and calprotectin mrna between groups using qrt-pcr. we determined the concentrations of calprotectin, il-8 and  osteoprotegerin by enzyme immunoassays in cognate specimens.

TI  == n-linked glycosylation of antibody fragments in escherichia coli.
AB  == glycosylation is the predominant protein modification to diversify the functionality of proteins. in particular, n-linked protein glycosylation can increase the biophysical and pharmacokinetic properties of therapeutic proteins.  however, the major challenges in studying the consequences of protein glycosylation on a molecular level are caused by glycan heterogeneities of currently used eukaryotic expression systems, but the discovery of the n-linked protein glycosylation system in the epsilon-proteobacterium campylobacter jejuni  and its functional transfer to escherichia coli opened up the possibility to produce glycoproteins in bacteria. toward this goal, we elucidated whether antibody fragments, a potential class of therapeutic proteins, are amenable to bacterial n-linked glycosylation, thereby improving their biophysical properties. we describe a new strategy for glycoengineering and production of quantitative amounts of glycosylated scfv 3d5 at high purity. the analysis revealed the presence of a homogeneous n-glycan that significantly increased the stability and the solubility of the 3d5 antibody fragment. the process of bacterial n-linked glycosylation offers the possibility to specifically address and alter the biophysical properties of proteins.

TI  == inhibitory spectra and modes of antimicrobial action of gallotannins from mango kernels (mangifera indica l.).
AB  == this study investigated the antimicrobial activities and modes of action of penta-, hexa-, hepta-, octa-, nona-, and deca-o-galloylglucose (gallotannins) isolated from mango kernels. the mics and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) against food-borne bacteria and fungi were determined using a critical dilution assay. gram-positive bacteria were generally more susceptible to gallotannins than were gram-negative bacteria. the mics of gallotannins against bacillus subtilis, bacillus cereus, clostridium botulinum, campylobacter jejuni,  listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus were 0.2 g liter(-1) or less; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and salmonella enterica were inhibited by 0.5 to 1 g liter(-1), and lactic acid bacteria were resistant. the use of lipopolysaccharide mutants of s. enterica indicated that the outer membrane confers resistance toward gallotannins. supplementation of lb medium with iron eliminated the inhibitory activity of gallotannins against staphylococcus aureus, and siderophore-deficient mutants of s. enterica were less resistant toward gallotannins than was the wild-type strain. hepta-o-galloylglucose sensitized lactobacillus plantarum tmw1.460 to hop extract, indicating inactivation of hop resistance mechanisms, e.g., the multidrug resistance (mdr) transporter hora. carbohydrate metabolism of lactococcus lactis mg1363, a conditionally respiring organism, was influenced by hepta-o-galloylglucose when grown under aerobic conditions and in the presence of heme but not under anaerobic conditions, indicating that gallotannins influence the respiratory chain. in conclusion, the  inhibitory activities of gallotannins are attributable to their strong affinity for iron and likely additionally relate to the inactivation of membrane-bound proteins.

TI  == the role of bacteria and pattern-recognition receptors in crohn's disease.
AB  == crohn's disease is widely regarded as a multifactorial disease, and evidence from human and animal studies suggests that bacteria have an instrumental role in its  pathogenesis. comparison of the intestinal microbiota of patients with crohn's disease to that of healthy controls has revealed compositional changes. in most studies these changes are characterized by an increase in the abundance of bacteroidetes and proteobacteria and a decrease in that of firmicutes. in addition, a number of specific mucosa-associated bacteria have been postulated to have a role in crohn's disease, including mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis, adherent and invasive escherichia coli, campylobacter and helicobacter species. the association between mutations in pattern-recognition receptors (toll-like receptors and nod-like receptors) and autophagy proteins and crohn's disease provides further evidence to suggest that defective sensing and killing of bacteria may drive the onset of disease. in this review, we present recent advances in understanding the role of bacteria and the contribution of pattern-recognition receptors and autophagy in the pathogenesis of crohn's disease.

TI  == differential behaviour of escherichia coli and campylobacter spp. in a stream draining dairy pasture.
AB  == the faecal indicator bacterium escherichia coli and thermotolerant campylobacter  spp., which are potentially pathogenic, were investigated in the toenepi stream draining a pastoral catchment dominated by dairying. bacteria concentrations were monitored routinely at fortnightly intervals over 12 months and intensively during storm events to compare the transport dynamics of bacterial indicator and  pathogen under varying hydro-meteorological conditions. routine monitoring indicated median concentrations of 345 e. coli mpn 100 ml(-1) and relatively low  concentrations of 2.3 campylobacter mpn 100 ml(-1). the bacterial flux was three  orders of magnitude greater under elevated stream flow compared with base-flow. e. coli peak concentrations occurred very close to the turbidity peak and consistently ahead of the campylobacter spp. peak (which was close to the hydrograph peak). we postulate that, under flood conditions, the e. coli peak reflects the entrainment and mobilisation of in-stream stores on the flood wave front. in contrast, campylobacter spp. are derived from wash-in from land stores  upstream and have travelled at the mean water velocity which is slower than the speed of the flood wave. our findings of different dynamics for e. coli and campylobacter spp. suggest that mitigation to reduce faecal microbial impacts from farms will need to take account of these differences.

TI  == antibacterial activity and mechanism of action of zinc oxide nanoparticles against campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the antibacterial effect of zinc oxide (zno) nanoparticles on campylobacter jejuni was investigated for inhibition and inactivation of cell growth. the results showed that c. jejuni was extremely sensitive to treatment with zno nanoparticles. the mic of zno nanoparticles for c. jejuni was determined to be 0.05 to 0.025 mg/ml, which is 8- to 16-fold lower than that for salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7 (0.4 mg/ml). the action of zno nanoparticles against c. jejuni was determined to be bactericidal, not bacteriostatic. scanning electron microscopy examination revealed that the majority of the cells transformed from spiral shapes into coccoid forms after exposure to 0.5 mg/ml of zno nanoparticles for 16 h, which is consistent with the morphological changes of c. jejuni under other stress conditions. these coccoid cells were found by ethidium monoazide-quantitative pcr (ema-qpcr) to have a certain level of membrane leakage. to address the molecular basis of zno nanoparticle action, a large set of genes involved in cell stress response, motility, pathogenesis, and toxin production were selected for a gene expression  study. reverse transcription-quantitative pcr (rt-qpcr) showed that in response to treatment with zno nanoparticles, the expression levels of two oxidative stress genes (kata and ahpc) and a general stress response gene (dnak) were increased 52-, 7-, and 17-fold, respectively. these results suggest that the antibacterial mechanism of zno nanoparticles is most likely due to disruption of  the cell membrane and oxidative stress in campylobacter.

TI  == advances in campylobacter biology and implications for biotechnological applications.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major foodborne pathogen of animal origin and a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in humans. during the past decade, especially  since the publication of the first c. jejuni genome sequence, major advances have been made in understanding the pathobiology and physiology of this organism. it is apparent that c. jejuni utilizes sophisticated mechanisms for effective colonization of the intestinal tracts in various animal species. although campylobacter is fragile in the environment and requires fastidious growth conditions, it exhibits great flexibility in the adaptation to various habitats including the gastrointestinal tract. this high adaptability is attributable to its genetically, metabolically and phenotypically diverse population structure and its ability to change in response to various challenges. unlike other enteric pathogens, such as escherichia coli and salmonella, campylobacter is unable to utilize exogenous glucose and mainly depends on the catabolism of amino acids as  a carbon source. campylobacter proves highly mutable in response to antibiotic treatments and possesses eukaryote-like dual protein glycosylation systems, which modify flagella and other surface proteins with specific sugar structures. in this review we will summarize the distinct biological traits of campylobacter and discuss the potential biotechnological approaches that can be developed to control this enteric pathogen.

AB  == in this study, an environmental sampling campaign was conducted to detect internalized e. coli and c. jejuni bacteria in zooplankton and amoebae samples collected at various stages of three water treatment plants in amsterdam, the netherlands. eight sampling locations were selected and sampling was performed twice, at a two-week interval, at each location. chlorination was used to inactivate free (external) bacteria in the concentrated zooplankton samples and sonication was used to disrupt zooplankton organisms in order to release and recover internalized bacteria. zooplankton enumeration was performed by microscopy. no internalized e. coli or c. jejuni bacteria were recovered from all of the samples analyzed. the occurrence of internalized e. coli or c. jejuni bacteria in drinking water was estimated to be lower than one internalized bacteria in 10(5) zooplankton organisms, as derived from the detection limit of the sampling campaign. by using the qmra approach and the beta-poisson model, a risk of infection of less than 9.2e-6 and 5.9e-5 was estimated for internalized e. coli and c. jejuni in drinking water, respectively. this study remains preliminary due to the limited number of samples taken at each location.

AB  == the survival of enteric bacteria in 10 freshly collected sheep fecal samples on pastures was measured in each of four seasons. ten freshly collected feces were placed on pasture, and concentrations of escherichia coli, enterococci, and campylobacter spp. were monitored until exhaustion of the fecal samples. in all four seasons, there was an increase in enterococcal concentrations by up to 3 orders of magnitude, with peak concentrations recorded between 11 and 28 days after deposition. e. coli concentrations increased in three out of four seasons by up to 1.5 orders of magnitude, with peak concentrations recorded between 8 and 14 days after deposition. the apparent growth of e. coli and enterococci was strongly influenced by the initial water content of the feces and the moisture gained during periods of rehydration following rainfalls. conversely, the results suggested that dehydration promoted inactivation. campylobacter spp. did not grow and were rapidly inactivated at a rate that tended to be faster at higher temperatures. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) of a selection of campylobacter spp. suggested that these survival data are applicable to a range of campylobacter spp., including the most frequently isolated pfge genotype from  sheep in new zealand, and to genotypes previously observed to cause disease in humans. the results of this study are currently being incorporated into a fecal microbe reservoir model that is designed to assist water managers' abilities to estimate microbial loads on pastures grazed by sheep, including the influence of  factors such as rainfall and temperature.

AB  == three pathogens, campylobacter, salmonella, and shiga-toxin-producing escherichia coli, are leading causes of bacterial gastroenteritis in the united states and worldwide. although these three bacteria are typically considered food-borne pathogens, outbreaks have been reported due to contaminated drinking water and irrigation water. the aim of this research was to develop two types of pcr assays that could detect and quantify three pathogens, campylobacter spp., e. coli o157:h7, and salmonella spp., in watershed samples. in conventional pcr, three target strains were detected by multiplex pcr (m-pcr) using each specific primer  pair simultaneously. under optimized m-pcr conditions, the assay produced a 90-bp product for campylobacter jejuni, a 150-bp product for e. coli o157:h7, and a 262-bp product for salmonella typhimurium, and the limitation of detection was approximately 700 copies for all three bacteria. in addition, real-time pcr was performed to quantify the three pathogens using sybr green fluorescence. the assay was designed so that each target had a different melting temperature [c. jejuni (80.1 degrees c), e. coli o157:h7 (83.3 degrees c), and s. typhimurium (85.9 degrees c)]. therefore, this system could quantify and distinguish three pathogens simultaneously in a single reaction.

AB  == a novel multidomain metalloprotein from campylobacter jejuni was overexpressed in escherichia coli, purified, and extensively characterized. this protein is isolated as a homotetramer of 24-kda monomers. according to the amino acid sequence, each monomer was predicted to contain three structural domains: an n-terminal desulforedoxin-like domain, followed by a four-helix bundle domain harboring a non-sulfur mu-oxo diiron center, and a rubredoxin-like domain at the  c-terminus. the three predicted iron sites were shown to be present and were studied by a combination of uv-vis, epr, and resonance raman spectroscopies, which allowed the determination of the electronic and redox properties of each site. the protein contains two fecys(4) centers with reduction potentials of +240 mv (desulforedoxin-like center) and +185 mv (rubredoxin-like center). these centers are in the high-spin configuration in the as-isolated ferric form. the protein further accommodates a mu-oxo-bridged diiron site with reduction potentials of +270 and +235 mv for the two sequential redox transitions. the protein is rapidly reoxidized by hydrogen peroxide and has a significant nadh-linked hydrogen peroxide reductase activity of 1.8 mumol h(2)o(2) min(-1) mg(-1). owing to its building blocks and its homology to the rubrerythrin family, the protein is named desulforubrerythrin. it represents a novel example of the large diversity of the organization of domains exhibited by this enzyme family.

TI  == structures of bacterial biosynthetic arginine decarboxylases.
AB  == biosynthetic arginine decarboxylase (adc; also known as spea) plays an important  role in the biosynthesis of polyamines from arginine in bacteria and plants. spea is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (plp)-dependent enzyme and shares weak sequence homology with several other plp-dependent decarboxylases. here, the crystal structure of plp-bound spea from campylobacter jejuni is reported at 3.0 a resolution and that of escherichia coli spea in complex with a sulfate ion is reported at 3.1 a resolution. the structure of the spea monomer contains two large domains, an n-terminal tim-barrel domain followed by a beta-sandwich domain, as well as two smaller helical domains. the tim-barrel and beta-sandwich  domains share structural homology with several other plp-dependent decarboxylases, even though the sequence conservation among these enzymes is less than 25%. a similar tetramer is observed for both c. jejuni and e. coli spea, composed of two dimers of tightly associated monomers. the active site of spea is located at the interface of this dimer and is formed by residues from the tim-barrel domain of one monomer and a highly conserved loop in the beta-sandwich domain of the other monomer. the plp cofactor is recognized by hydrogen-bonding,  pi-stacking and van der waals interactions.

TI  == production of secretory and extracellular n-linked glycoproteins in escherichia coli.
AB  == the campylobacter jejuni pgl gene cluster encodes a complete n-linked protein glycosylation pathway that can be functionally transferred into escherichia coli. in this system, we analyzed the interplay between n-linked glycosylation, membrane translocation and folding of acceptor proteins in bacteria. we developed a recombinant n-glycan acceptor peptide tag that permits n-linked glycosylation of diverse recombinant proteins expressed in the periplasm of glycosylation-competent e. coli cells. with this "glycosylation tag," a clear difference was observed in the glycosylation patterns found on periplasmic proteins depending on their mode of inner membrane translocation (i.e., sec, signal recognition particle [srp], or twin-arginine translocation [tat] export),  indicating that the mode of protein export can influence n-glycosylation efficiency. we also established that engineered substrate proteins targeted to environments beyond the periplasm, such as the outer membrane, the membrane vesicles, and the extracellular medium, could serve as substrates for n-linked glycosylation. taken together, our results demonstrate that the c. jejuni n-glycosylation machinery is compatible with distinct secretory mechanisms in e.  coli, effectively expanding the n-linked glycome of recombinant e. coli. moreover, this simple glycosylation tag strategy expands the glycoengineering toolbox and opens the door to bacterial synthesis of a wide array of recombinant  glycoprotein conjugates.

TI  == simultaneous recovery of bacteria and viruses from contaminated water and spinach by a filtration method.
AB  == water and leafy vegetables eaten fresh are increasingly reported as being involved in food-borne illness cases. the pathogenic agents responsible for these infections are mainly bacteria and viruses and are present in very small quantities on the contaminated food matrices. laboratory techniques used to isolate or detect the contaminating agent differ enormously according to the type of microorganisms, generating time and economical losses. the purpose of this study was to optimize a single method which allows at the same time the recovery  and concentration of these two main types of pathogenic organisms. water and spinach samples were artificially contaminated with the feline calicivirus (fcv), rotavirus, hepatitis a virus (hav), escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni and salmonella typhimurium. the principle behind the recovery technique is based on the use of a positively charged membrane which adsorbs both viruses and bacteria present in the water or in the rinse from the vegetables. using conventional microbiology, pcr and rt-pcr, this filtration technique allowed a detection level superior to 10(2) cfu/g for s. typhimurium, e. coli, l. monocytogenes and c. jejuni and to 10(1) pfu/g for fcv, hav and rotavirus. this combined method can also be applied to other bacterial and viral  species for the identification of the responsible agent for food-borne illnesses.

AB  == background: escherichia coli is frequently the first-choice host organism in expression of heterologous recombinant proteins in basic research as well as in production of commercial, therapeutic polypeptides. especially the secretion of proteins into the culture medium of e. coli is advantageous compared to intracellular production due to the ease in recovery of the recombinant protein.  since e. coli naturally is a poor secretor of proteins, a few strategies for optimization of extracellular secretion have been described. we have previously reported efficient secretion of the diagnostically interesting model protein peb1 of campylobacter jejuni into the growth medium of escherichia coli strain mks12 (deltaflicflid). to generate a more detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind this interesting heterologous secretion system with biotechnological implications, we here analyzed further the transport of peb1 in  the e. coli host. results: when mature peb1 was expressed without its seca-yeg-dependent signal sequence and without the putative signal peptidase ii recognition sequence in e. coli mks111deltahbb lacking the flagellar secretion complex, the protein was found in the periplasm and growth medium which indicated a flagellum-independent translocation. we assessed the peb1 secretion proficiency by an exhaustive search for transport-affecting regions using a transposition-based scanning mutagenesis strategy. strikingly, insertion mutagenesis of only two segments, called tar1 (residues 42 and 43) and tar2 (residues 173 to 180), prevented peb1 secretion individually. we confirmed the importance of tar regions by subsequent site-specific mutagenesis and verified that the secretion deficiency of peb1 mutants was not due to insolubility or aggregation of the proteins in the cytoplasm. we found by cell fractionation that the mutant proteins were present in the periplasm as well as in the cytoplasm of  mks12. hence, mutagenesis of tar regions did not affect export of peb1 across the cytoplasmic membrane, whereas its export over the outer membrane was markedly impaired. conclusions: we propose that the localization of the model protein peb1 in the growth medium of e. coli is due to active secretion by a still unknown pathway of e. coli. the secretion apparently is a two-step process involving a periplasmic step and the tar regions.

TI  == interbacterial macromolecular transfer by the campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis type iv secretion system.
AB  == we report here the first demonstration of intra- and interspecies conjugative plasmid dna transfer for campylobacter fetus. gene regions carried by a campylobacter coli plasmid were identified that are sufficient for conjugative mobilization to escherichia coli and c. fetus recipients. a broader functional range is predicted. efficient dna transfer involves the virb9 and vird4 genes of  the type iv bacterial secretion system encoded by a pathogenicity island of c. fetus subsp. venerealis. complementation of these phenotypes from expression constructions based on the promoter of the c. fetus surface antigen protein (sap) locus was temperature dependent, and a temperature regulation of the sap promoter was subsequently confirmed under laboratory conditions. gene transfer was sensitive to surface or entry exclusion functions in potential recipient cells carrying incpalpha plasmid rp4 implying functional relatedness to c. fetus proteins. the virb/vird4 locus is also known to be involved in bacterial invasion and killing of cultured human cells in vitro. whether specifically secreted effector proteins contribute to host colonization and infection activities is currently unknown. two putative effector proteins carrying an fic domain conserved in a few bacterial type iii and type iv secreted proteins of pathogens  were analyzed for secretion by the c. fetus or heterologous conjugative systems.  no evidence for interbacterial translocation of the fic proteins was found.

TI  == establishing a milkborne disease outbreak profile: potential food defense implications.
AB  == objectives: the main objectives of this study were to establish baseline characteristics for milkborne outbreaks, establish an expected milkborne outbreak profile, and identify potential indicators of food terrorism. materials: this study used 1990-2006 data from the centers for disease control and prevention annual listings of disease outbreaks and the foodborne outbreak database (food) to establish epidemiologic baseline characteristics for disease outbreaks associated with fluid milk. food data from 2007 were used to qualitatively validate the potential of the baseline characteristics and the expected outbreak  profile. results: eighty-three fluid milkborne outbreaks were reported between 1990 and 2006, resulting in 3621 illnesses. the mean number of illnesses per outbreak was 43.6 (illness range: 2-1644). consumption of unpasteurized milk was  associated with 55.4% of reported outbreaks. campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, and salmonella spp. caused 51.2%, 10.8%, and 9.6% of reported outbreaks, respectively. private homes accounted for 41.0% of outbreak locations. number ill, outbreak location, and etiology were the primary characteristics which could signal a potential intentional contamination event. in 2007, one pasteurized milk outbreak caused by listeria was flagged as aberrative compared with the expected  outbreak profile. conclusions: the creation and dissemination of expected outbreak profiles and epidemiologic baseline characteristics allow public health  and homeland security officials to quickly assess the potential of intentional food contamination. a faster public health and medical system response can result in decreased morbidity and mortality.

TI  == desulfovibrio desulfuricans pglb homolog possesses oligosaccharyltransferase activity with relaxed glycan specificity and distinct protein acceptor sequence requirements.
AB  == oligosaccharyltransferases (otases) are responsible for the transfer of carbohydrates from lipid carriers to acceptor proteins and are present in all domains of life. in bacteria, the most studied member of this family is pglb from campylobacter jejuni (pglb(cj)). this enzyme is functional in escherichia coli and, contrary to its eukaryotic counterparts, has the ability to transfer a variety of oligo- and polysaccharides to protein carriers in vivo. phylogenetic analysis revealed that in the delta proteobacteria desulfovibrio sp., the pglb homolog is more closely related to eukaryotic and archaeal otases than to its campylobacter counterparts. genetic analysis revealed the presence of a putative  operon that might encode all enzymes required for n-glycosylation in desulfovibrio desulfuricans. d. desulfuricans pglb (pglb(dd)) was cloned and successfully expressed in e. coli, and its activity was confirmed by transferring the c. jejuni heptasaccharide onto the model protein acceptor acra. in contrast to pglb(cj), which adds two glycan chains to acra, a single oligosaccharide was attached to the protein by pglb(dd). site-directed mutagenesis of the five putative n-x-s/t glycosylation sites in acra and mass spectrometry analysis showed that pglb(dd) does not recognize the "conventional bacterial glycosylation sequon" consisting of the sequence d/e-x(1)-n-x(2)-s/t (where x(1) and x(2) are any amino acid except proline), and instead used a different site for the attachment of the oligosaccharide than pglb(cj.). furthermore, pglb(dd) exhibited relaxed glycan specificity, being able to transfer mono- and polysaccharides to acra. our analysis constitutes the first characterization of an otase from delta-proteobacteria involved in n-linked protein glycosylation.

TI  == long term risk for hypertension, renal impairment, and cardiovascular disease after gastroenteritis from drinking water contaminated with escherichia coli o157:h7: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the risk for hypertension, renal impairment, and cardiovascular disease within eight years of gastroenteritis from drinking water  contaminated with escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter. design: a prospective cohort study. setting walkerton, ontario, canada. participants: 1977  adult participants in the walkerton health study recruited between 2002 and 2005  after an outbreak of gastroenteritis in may 2000, when a municipal water system was contaminated, with no pre-outbreak history of outcome measures. outcome measures: information was collected annually via survey, physical examination, and laboratory assessment. primary measures were acute gastroenteritis (diarrhoeal illness lasting >3 days, bloody diarrhoea, or >3 loose stools/day), hypertension (blood pressure >/=140/90 mm hg), and renal impairment (microalbuminuria or estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m(2)).  self reported physician diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, or congestive heart failure) was a secondary outcome. results: acute gastroenteritis at the time of the outbreak was reported by 1067 (54%) of participants. incident hypertension was detected in 697 (35%) (294 (32%) of group not exposed to acute gastroenteritis v 403 (38%) of exposed group). while 572 (29%) had at least one indicator of renal impairment (266 (29%) of unexposed v 306 (29%) of exposed), only 30 (1.5%) had both (8 (0.9%) of unexposed v 22 (2.1%) of exposed). cardiovascular disease was reported by 33/1749 (1.9%). the adjusted hazard ratios for hypertension and cardiovascular disease after acute gastroenteritis were 1.33 (95% confidence interval 1.14 to 1.54) and 2.13 (1.03 to 4.43) respectively. the adjusted hazard ratio for the presence of either indicator of renal impairment was 1.15 (0.97 to 1.35) and was 3.41 (1.51 to 7.71) for the presence of both. conclusion: gastroenteritis from drinking water contaminated with e coli o157:h7 and campylobacter was associated with an increased risk for hypertension, renal impairment, and self reported cardiovascular disease. annual monitoring of blood pressure and periodic monitoring of renal function may be warranted for individuals who experience e coli o157:h7 gastroenteritis.

TI  == microbiological quality of blue mussels (mytilus edulis) in nunavik, quebec: a pilot study.
AB  == this pilot study was aimed at documenting the presence of fecal indicators and enteric pathogens in blue mussels (mytilus edulis) from 6 communities in nunavik, quebec. one to four 2 kg samples of mussels were collected at low tide in each community. samples were investigated by enumeration methods for the fecal indicators enterococci, escherichia coli, f-specific coliphages, clostridium perfringens, and by molecular identification for the pathogens norovirus, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter lari, verocytotoxin-producing e. coli (particularly serovar o157:h7), shigella spp., and yersinia enterocolitica. in 5 communities, the presence of giardia duodenalis and cryptosporidium spp. was also tested by microscopy and molecular methods and that of toxoplasma gondii was tested by molecular methods. apart from small quantities of clostridium perfringens in 2 samples, no bacterial or viral pathogens were detected in the mussels. toxoplasma gondii was also not detected.  however, g. duodenalis and cryptosporidium spp. were present in 18% and 73% of the samples investigated for these pathogens, respectively. when considering the  indicators and the viral and bacterial pathogens investigated, the mussels examined were of good microbiological quality, but considering the presence of potentially zoonotic protozoa, it should be recommended that consumers cook the molluscs well before eating them.

TI  == companion animals symposium: microbes and gastrointestinal health of dogs and cats.
AB  == recent molecular studies have revealed complex bacterial, fungal, archaeal, and viral communities in the gastrointestinal tract of dogs and cats. more than 10 bacterial phyla have been identified, with firmicutes, bacteroidetes, proteobacteria, fusobacteria, and actinobacteria constituting more than 99% of all gut microbiota. microbes act as a defending barrier against invading pathogens, aid in digestion, provide nutritional support for enterocytes, and play a crucial role in the development of the immune system. of significance for  gastrointestinal health is their ability to ferment dietary substrates into short-chain fatty acids, predominantly to acetate, propionate, and butyrate. however, microbes can have also a detrimental effect on host health. specific pathogens (e.g., salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, and enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens) have been implicated in acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease. compositional changes in the small intestinal microbiota, potentially leading to changes in intestinal permeability and digestive function, have been suggested in canine small intestinal dysbiosis or antibiotic-responsive diarrhea. there is mounting evidence that microbes play an  important role in the pathogenesis of canine and feline inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). current theories for the development of ibd favor a combination of environmental factors, the intestinal microbiota, and a genetic susceptibility of the host. recent studies have revealed a genetic susceptibility for defective bacterial clearance in boxer dogs with granulomatous colitis. differential expression of pathogen recognition receptors (i.e., toll-like receptors) were identified in dogs with chronic enteropathies. similarly to humans, a microbial dysbiosis has been identified in feline and canine ibd. commonly observed microbial changes are increased proteobacteria (i.e., escherichia coli) with concurrent decreases in firmicutes, especially a reduced diversity in clostridium clusters xiva and iv (i.e., lachnospiraceae, ruminococcaceae, faecalibacterium spp.). this would indicate that these bacterial groups, important short-chain fatty acid producers, may play an important role in promoting intestinal health.

TI  == induction of cytokine formation by human intestinal bacteria in gut epithelial cell lines.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effects of human gut micro-organisms on cytokine production by human intestinal cell lines. methods and results: quantitative real-time pcr assays were developed to measure the production of pro-inflammatory (il-1alpha, il-6, il-18 and tnfalpha) and anti-inflammatory (tgf-beta1, tgf-beta2, tgf-beta3, il-4 and il-10) cytokines in ht-29 and caco-2 cell lines. they were co-cultured with a range of mucosal bacteria isolated from ulcerative colitis patients, together with lactobacilli and bifidobacteria obtained from healthy people. ht-29 cells were also co-cultured with campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteropathogenic e. coli and salmonella  typhimurium. the majority of commensal bacteria tested suppressed the expression  of anti-inflammatory cytokine mrna, increased il-18, reduced il-1alpha, and with  the exception of nonpathogenic e. coli, reduced tnf-alpha. all overtly pathogenic species increased both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine mrna. conclusion: commensal and pathogenic species induced fundamentally different cytokine responses in human intestinal epithelial cell lines. significance and impact of the study: interactions between commensal bacteria tested in this study and the innate immune system were shown to be anti-inflammatory in nature, in contrast to the pathogenic organisms investigated. these data contribute towards  our understanding of how potential probiotic species can be used to suppress the  pro-inflammatory response in inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == controlled study on enteropathogens in travellers returning from the tropics with and without diarrhoea.
AB  == diarrhoea is the most frequent health problem among travellers in the tropics. however, data on the spectrum and relevance of enteropathogens in international travellers with and without diarrhoea are limited. stool samples from 114 cases of diarrhoea in travellers returning from the tropics were collected for microbiological examination and pcr for norovirus genogroups i and ii, enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaec), and enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) producing heat-labile toxin (lt) and heat-stable toxin (st). travel and laboratory data of cases were compared with those of 56 travellers without diarrhoea. among cases, eaec was found in 45% of stool samples, followed by lt-etec (20%), st-etec (16%), blastocystis hominis (15%), campylobacter jejuni (12%), norovirus (11%), giardia lamblia (6%), shigella spp. (6%), and salmonella  spp., cryptosporidium spp., and cyclospora cayetanensis (3% each). however, only  for eaec, st-etec, blastocystis and campylobacter was the prevalence significantly higher among cases than among controls. co-infections were common:  61% for cases and 13% for controls. the most common travel destination was asia (54%), followed by africa (35%) and latin america (9%). the highest relative risk for diarrhoea was calculated for travellers to west africa, east africa, and south asia. in this study, eaec, lt-etec and st-etec were detected most frequently in cases of travellers' diarrhoea. although enteric infections with eaec, st-etec and campylobacter often cause diarrhoea, the pathogenetic relevance remains unclear for most of the other enteropathogens, because of significant prevalence rates also being seen in controls without diarrhoea and the high frequency of co-infections.

TI  == comparison of selected nutrients and bacteria from common contiguous soils inside and outside swine lagoon effluent spray fields after long-term use.
AB  == swine (sus scofa domestica) lagoon effluent is a valuable resource. in the u.s. mid-south it is applied from april to september to fertilize grass hay in spray-irrigated fields. lagoon levels of nutrients and bacteria, and soil levels  of nutrients have been documented, but little was known of effluent bacterial levels in soil. the present study examined levels of selected effluent bacteria and nutrients in soils inside and outside spray fields after >15 yr of effluent irrigation. samples were collected february to march 2009 from contiguous soils spanning adjacent irrigated and nonirrigated areas. separate soil cores for bacterial and nutrient tests were collected in pairs <10 cm apart. five cores each were collected at 15-m intervals and combined, respectively, to comprise inside and outside samples from each of 20 soils (four each from five farms/spray fields). analyses of data combined across all soils showed higher ph and mehlich-3-extracrable (m3-) p, mg, k, na, cu, and zn inside than outside spray fields, while total n, total c, m3-ca, and m3-mn did not differ. bacterial levels were higher inside than outside spray fields for heterotrophic plate counts, thermotolerant coliforms, staphylococcus spp., and clostridium perfringens, but levels of escherichia coli and enterococcus spp. were not different. cultural presence/absence tests for three pathogens (listeria spp., campylobacter spp., and salmonella spp.) detected only listeria spp., which did not differ inside (23% positive samples) and outside (28% positive). molecular tests detected all three pathogens at low levels that were not different inside and outside. we found no evidence of cumulative buildup of campylobacter spp., listeria spp., or  salmonela s. in spray field soils.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of major foodborne pathogens from major meat products.
AB  == the bacterial contamination of raw and processed meat products with resistant pathogens was studied. the raw samples included sheep (40), goat (40), pork (120), beef (80), and chicken (19) meat, and the processed samples included turkey filets (33), salami (8), readymade mincemeat (16), stuffing (22), and roast-beef (50). the samples were collected from retail shops in northwestern greece over a period of 3 years. the isolated pathogens were evaluated for susceptibilities to 19 antimicrobial agents used in humans. out of 428 samples, 157 strains of escherichia coli, 25 of yersinia enterocolitica, 57 of staphylococcus aureus, 57 of enterococcus spp., 4 of salmonella spp., and 3 of campylobacter jejuni were isolated. among the isolates 14.6% of the e. coli, 10.5% of s. aureus, 4% of y. enterocolitica, 25% of salmonella spp., and 42.1% of enterococcus spp. were susceptible to antibiotics. e. coli from chicken exhibited high rates of resistance to ciprofloxacin (62.5%) followed by lamb/goat (10.9%),  pork (15.7%), and beef (27.9%) meat. resistance to nitrofurantoin dominated in the lamb/goat isolates (60%). resistance to tetracycline predominated in pork (68.2%) and chicken (62.5%), and resistance to aminoglycosides dominated in lamb/goat meat isolates. s. aureus resistance to clindamycin predominated in lamb/goat isolates (50%), whereas resistance to ciprofloxacin predominated in the pork strains, but no resistance to methicillin was observed. of the enterococci isolates 21.1% were resistant to vancomycin. high resistance to ampicillin (96%)  was observed in y. enterocolitica and all of the c. jejuni isolates were resistant to ampicillin, cephalothin, and cefuroxime. these results indicate that meat can be a source of resistant bacteria, which could potentially be spread to  the community through the food chain.

TI  == minimal models of growth and decline of microbial populations.
AB  == dynamics of growth and decline of microbial populations were analysed and respective models were developed in this investigation. analysis of the dynamics  was based on general considerations concerning the main properties of microorganisms and their interactions with the environment which was supposed to  be affected by the activity of the population. those considerations were expressed mathematically by differential equations or systems of the equations containing minimal sets of parameters characterizing those properties. it has been found that: (1) the factors leading to the decline of the population have to be considered separately, namely, accumulation of metabolites (toxins) in the medium and the exhaustion of resources; the latter have to be separated again into renewable ('building materials') and non-renewable (sources of energy); (2)  decline of the population is caused by the exhaustion of sources of energy but no decline is predicted by the model because of the exhaustion of renewable resources; (3) the model determined by the accumulation of metabolites (toxins) in the medium does not suggest the existence of a separate 'stationary phase'; (4) in the model determined by the exhaustion of energy resources the 'stationary' and 'decline' phases are quite discernible; and (5) there is no symmetry in microbial population dynamics, the decline being slower than the rise. mathematical models are expected to be useful in getting insight into the process of control of the dynamics of microbial populations. the models are in agreement with the experimental data.

AB  == swine confinement buildings in eastern canada are enclosed and equipped with modern production systems to manage waste. bioaerosols of these swine confinement buildings could be contaminated by human pathogens and antimicrobial resistant bacteria which could colonize exposed workers. we therefore wanted to analyze bioaerosols of swine confinement buildings and nasal flora of canadian hog producers to evaluate possible colonization with human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria. culturable and non-culturable human pathogens and tet genes were investigated in the bioaerosols of 18 barns. the nasal passages of 35 hog producers were sampled and total dna was extracted from the calcium-alginate swabs to detect, by pcr, campylobacter, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, y. enterocolitica, teta/tetc, tetg and ribosomal protection protein genes. airborne culturable c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, and y. enterocolitica were present in the bioaerosols of 16, 17, 11 and 6 of the 18 facilities. aerosolized total (culturable/non culturable) campylobacter, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli and y. enterocolitica were detected in 10, 6, 15, 18 and 2 barns, respectively. tet genes were found in isolates of culturable human pathogens. teta/tetc, tetg and ribosomal protection  protein genes were detected in the bioaerosols of all 18 studied buildings. campylobacter, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, and y. enterocolitica were  found respectively in 4, 9, 17, 14 and one nasal flora of workers. one and 10 workers were positive for teta/tetc and tetg genes, respectively. in swine confinement buildings, hog producers are exposed to aerosolized human pathogens and tetracycline-resistant bacteria that can contaminate the nasal flora.

AB  == campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7 isolated from 898 faecal, 43 sewage, and 342 surface water samples from the oldman river were characterized using bacterial subtyping methods in order to investigate potential sources of contamination of the watershed. among these pathogens, campylobacter spp. were the most frequently isolated from faecal, sewage, and surface water samples (266/895, 11/43, and 91/342, respectively), followed by salmonella (67/898, 8/43, and 29/342, respectively), and e. coli o157:h7 (16/898, 2/43, and 8/342, respectively). salmonella rubislaw was the most common serovar isolated from water. this serovar was also isolated from two wild bird species. most other serovars isolated from water were either not isolated from animals or  were isolated from multiple species. e. coli o157:h7 was predominantly isolated from cattle. the most common phage-types of this pathogen from cattle were also the most common among water isolates, and there were exact pulsed field gel electrophoresis and comparative genomic fingerprint matches between cattle, sewage, and water isolates. campylobacters were commonly isolated from surface waters and faeces from most animal species. restriction fragment length polymorphism of the campylobacter flaa gene identified several location and host  species-specific (cattle, goose, pig) fingerprints. molecular subtyping of these  bacterial pathogens shows considerable promise as a tool for determining the sources of faecal pollution of water.

TI  == molecular mechanisms modulating glutamate kinase activity. identification of the  proline feedback inhibitor binding site.
AB  == proline, the feedback inhibitor of bacterial glutamate kinase (gk) and plant pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase (p5cs) enzymes, is a key regulator of the osmotic and redox balance of cells. using kinetic assays, site-directed mutagenesis, structure-activity analyses, and docking calculations, we have identified the binding site of this metabolite in three-dimensional structures of escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni gks. the proline-binding cavity partially overlaps with the glutamate substrate site, and the interaction of both proline and glutamate with gk is modulated by a flexible, 16-residue loop linking beta-sheet 4 and alpha-helix e in the active-center cavity. this loop is also critical for regulation of plant and human p5css. furthermore, our results indicate that the functional unit of the e. coli enzyme is dimeric and contains an intermolecular hydrogen-bond network that interconnects the active-center cavities of the monomers and is important for substrate binding.

AB  == foodstuffs have traditionally been challenging matrices for conducting immunoassays. proteins, carbohydrates, and other macromolecules present in food matrices may interfere with both immunoassays and pcr-based tests, and removal of particulate matter may also prove challenging prior to analyses. this has been found true when testing for bacterial contamination of foods using the standard polystyrene microspheres utilized with luminex flow cytometers. luminex magplex microspheres are encoded with the same dyes as standard xmap microspheres, but have superparamagnetic properties to aid in preparation of samples in complex matrices. in this work, we present results demonstrating use of magplex for sample preparation and identification of bacteria and a toxin spiked into a variety of food samples. fluorescence-coded magplex microsphere sets coated with  antibodies for salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, listeria, and staphylococcal enterotoxin b (seb) were used to capture these bacteria and toxin  from spiked foodstuffs and then evaluated by the luminex system in a multiplex format; spiked foods included apple juice, green pepper, tomato, ground beef, alfalfa sprouts, milk, lettuce, spinach, and chicken washes. although magplex microspheres facilitated recovery of the microspheres and targets from the complex matrices, assay sensitivity was sometimes inhibited by up to one to three orders of magnitude; for example the detection limits e. coli spiked into apple juice or milk increased 100-fold, from 1000 to 100,000 cfu/ml. thus, while the magnetic and fluorescent properties of the luminex magplex microspheres allow for rapid, multiplexed testing for bacterial contamination in typically problematic food matrices, our data demonstrate that achieving desired limits of detection is still a challenge.

TI  == efficacy of high-intensity pulsed light for the microbiological decontamination of chicken, associated packaging, and contact surfaces.
AB  == the efficacy of high-intensity light pulse (hilp) technology (3 hz, maximum of 505 j/pulse, and a pulse duration of 360 mus) for the decontamination of raw chicken and associated packaging and surface materials was investigated. its ability to reduce microbial counts on raw chicken through plastic films was also  examined. complete inactivation of campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, and salmonella enteritidis in liquid was achieved after 30 sec hilp treatment. reductions of 3.56, 4.69, and 4.60 log(1)(0) cfu/cm(2)) were observed after 5 sec hilp treatment of campylobacter jejuni, e. coli, and salmonella enteritidis inoculated onto packaging materials and contact surfaces, respectively. the greatest reductions on inoculated chicken skin were 1.22, 1.69, and 1.27 log(1)(0) cfu/g for c. jejuni, e. coli, and salmonella enteritidis, respectively. corresponding reductions on inoculated skinless breast meat were 0.96, 1.13, and  1.35 log(1)(0) cfu/g. the effectiveness of hilp treatment for reducing microbial  levels on chicken increased as the film thickness decreased. hilp treatments of 2 sec did not significantly affect the color of raw chicken although treatments of  30 sec impacted color. this study has shown hilp to be an effective method for the decontamination of packaging and surface materials. additionally, it has demonstrated the potential of hilp to be used as a decontamination method for packaged chicken.

TI  == low levels of antibacterial drug resistance expressed by gram-negative bacteria isolated from poultry carcasses in new zealand.
AB  == aim: to provide baseline data on the levels and patterns of antibacterial drug resistance expressed by gram-negative bacteria isolated from poultry carcasses in new zealand. methods: between july and december 2006, isolates of escherichia coli (n=407) and salmonella spp. (n=3) originating from carcass-rinse samples were submitted by testing laboratories affiliated to five major poultry processing plants. isolates of campylobacter jejuni (n=193) originating from retail poultry carcasses in 2005-2006 were retrieved from the massey university archives. all isolates underwent disc diffusion susceptibility testing against panels of 12 (enterobacteriaceae) and six (campylobacter spp.) antibacterial drugs. cephalothin-resistance in isolates of e. coli was confirmed using etest strips, and confirmation of the resistance phenotypes for a subset of c. jejuni isolates used microbroth dilution assays. patterns within the resistance phenotypes of the isolates were investigated using hierarchical clustering, and logistic regression modelling. results: the majority of isolates (71.5% e. coli,  99% c. jejuni, and all three salmonella spp. isolates) were fully susceptible to  the drugs that were tested. four (1%) e. coli isolates showed resistance to three or more drugs. the proportions of susceptible e. coli differed between the five processing plants. resistances were detected in e. coli isolates, using disc diffusion to cephalothin (18.2%), ampicillin (4.4%), tetracycline (4.4%) and gentamicin (1.5%). there was an association between cephalothin-resistant isolates of e. coli and decreased susceptibility to gentamicin. using etests to ascertain the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of e. coli for cephalothin  gave inconsistent results. one of 193 c. jejuni isolates was resistant to erythromycin, and microbroth dilution assays confirmed that this panel of c. jejuni was generally susceptible to antibacterial drugs. conclusions: the levels  of resistance shown by gram-negative bacteria isolated from chicken carcasses in  new zealand are among the lowest reported around the world. no resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporin drugs was detected in e. coli, suggesting that ctx-m and ampc beta-lactamases are rare or absent. salmonella spp. are rarely isolated from poultry carcasses during routine testing in new zealand, and the isolates identified during this study were fully susceptible to the drugs tested. a panel of c. jejuni isolates originating from retail poultry carcasses were susceptible to first-line and second-line antibacterial drugs. the use of cephalothin as a marker of resistance to first-generation cephalosporins may not  be appropriate for non-type-specific e. coli of animal origin.

TI  == bacterial enteropathogens and risk factors associated with childhood diarrhea.
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology of bacterial enteropathogens causing diarrhea among children; to elucidate the risk factors, sign and symptoms involved in developing of infection; and to identify the antimicrobial susceptibility pattern. methods: stool samples from diarrheal cases with clinical diagnosis of gastroenteritis compared to matched controls, were examined for detection of bacterial enteropathogens by conventional cultural method from february 2006 through january 2007. results: ninety three of diarrheal cases comprising enteropathogen isolates. a recognized bacterial enteric pathogen was identified in 31% of the cases and 8% of the control group. the frequency of isolated enteropathogens from faeces of diarrheal cases was recorded in the following order, enterohemorrhagic e. coli 8.3%, shigella spp. 6.7%, campylobacter jejuni 5%, salmonella spp. 4%, yersinia enterocolitica 2.7%, aeromonas spp. 4.7%, and plesiomonas spp. 1.3%. e.h.e coli, shigella and salmonella had shown a significant statistical association with diarrhea (p<0.05). compared to matched uninfected control, multivariate analysis revealed  that malnutrition status (or adjusted 8.37; p<0.001) was the only independent factor associated with infection. antibiotic susceptibility profile indicated that enteropathogens were generally susceptible to meropenem, ceftriaxone, followed by amikacin and ciprofloxacin. almost all enteropathogens were resistant to ampicillin and amoxicillin. conclusions: the results of this study emphasize the importance of bacterial enteropathogens in causing severe diarrhea in children. e.h.e. coli was the most predominant pathogen. malnutrition was identified as the main independent risk factor associated with developing of infection. ampicillin and amoxicillin should not be used as empirical treatment in acute diarrhea.

TI  == analogies and homologies in lipopolysaccharide and glycoprotein biosynthesis in bacteria.
AB  == bacteria generate and attach countless glycan structures to diverse macromolecules. despite this diversity, the mechanisms of glycoconjugate biosynthesis are often surprisingly similar. the focus of this review is on the commonalities between lipopolysaccharide (lps) and glycoprotein assembly pathways and their evolutionary relationship. three steps that are essential for both pathways are completed by membrane proteins. these include the initiation of glycan assembly through the attachment of a first sugar residue onto the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate, the translocation across the plasma membrane  and the final transfer onto proteins or lipid a-core. two families of initiating  enzymes have been described: the polyprenyl-p n-acetylhexosamine-1-p transferases and the polyprenyl-p hexosamine-1-p transferases, represented by escherichia coli weca and salmonella enterica wbap, respectively. translocases are either wzx-like flippases or adenosine triphosphate (atp)-binding cassette transporters (abc transporters). the latter can consist either of two polypeptides, wzt and wzm, or of a single polypeptide homolog to the campylobacter jejuni pglk. finally, there  are two families of conjugating enzymes, the n-oligosaccharyltransferases (n-otase), best represented by c. jejuni pglb, and the o-otases, including neisseria meningitidis pgll and the o antigen ligases involved in lps biosynthesis. with the exception of the n-otases, probably restricted to glycoprotein synthesis, members of all these transmembrane protein families can be involved in the synthesis of both glycoproteins and lps. because many translocation and conjugation enzymes display relaxed substrate specificity, these bacterial enzymes could be exploited in engineered living bacteria for customized glycoconjugate production, generating potential vaccines and therapeutics.

TI  == improved detection of five major gastrointestinal pathogens by use of a molecular screening approach.
AB  == the detection of bacterial and parasitic gastrointestinal pathogens through culture and microscopy is laborious and time-consuming. we evaluated a molecular  screening approach (msa) for the detection of five major enteric pathogens: salmonella enterica, campylobacter jejuni, giardia lamblia, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), and shigella spp./enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec), for use in the daily practice of a clinical microbiology laboratory. the msa consists of  prescreening of stool specimens with two real-time multiplex pcr (mpcr) assays, which give results within a single working day, followed by guided culture/microscopy of the positive or mpcr-inhibited samples. in the present 2-year overview, 28,185 stool specimens were included. the msa was applied to 13,974 stool samples (49.6%), whereas 14,211 samples were tested by conventional  methods only (50.4%). the msa significantly increased the total detection rate compared to that of conventional methods (19.2% versus 6.4%). the detection of all included pathogens, with the exception of s. enterica, significantly improved. msa detection frequencies were as follows: c. jejuni, 8.1%; g. lamblia, 4.7%; s. enterica, 3.0%; stec, 1.9%; and shigella spp./eiec, 1.4%. the guided culture/microscopy was positive in 76.8%, 58.1%, 88.9%, 16.8%, and 18.1% of mpcr-positive specimens, respectively. of all mpcrs, only 1.8% was inhibited. other findings were that detection of mixed infections was increased (0.9% versus 0.02%) and threshold cycle (c(t)) values for msa guided culture/microscopy-positive samples were significantly lower than those for guided culture/microscopy-negative samples. in conclusion, an msa for detection of gastrointestinal pathogens resulted in markedly improved detection rates and a substantial decrease in time to reporting of (preliminary) results.

TI  == recombinant pora, the major outer membrane protein of campylobacter jejuni, provides heterologous protection in an adult mouse intestinal colonization model.
AB  == immunity against campylobacter jejuni, a major food-borne pathogen causing diarrhea, is largely serotype specific. the major outer membrane protein (momp) of c. jejuni, pora, is a common antigen with the potential to provide broad protection. adult balb/c mice were orally immunized with a recombinant glutathione s-transferase (gst) fused to pora prepared from campylobacter jejuni  c31 (o:6,7) (gst-pora) combined with a modified heat-labile enterotoxin of escherichia coli as an adjuvant and later orally challenged with c31 strain or three heterologous strains: 48 (o:19), 75 (o:3), and 111 (o:1,44). protection from colonization with the challenge organism was studied by fecal screening daily for 9 days. serum and intestinal lavage fluid antibodies against the vaccine and sarkosyl-purified momp from c31 were measured by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. the vaccine produced robust antibody responses against both antigens in serum and secretion. since strain c31 was a poor colonizer, homologous protection could not be studied. the protective efficacies  of heterologous strains were 43% (for strain 48, p < 0.001), 29% (for strain 75,  p < 0.005), and 42% (for strain 111, p < 0.001) for the 9-day period compared to  control mice given phosphate-buffered saline. thus, pora provided appreciable protection against colonization with heterologous serotypes.

TI  == infectious colitis.
AB  == purpose of review: the incidence of gastrointestinal infections continues to increase and infectious colitis contributes to significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. the purpose of this review is to highlight the recent advances in knowledge of pathogens causing infectious colitis. we describe the various pathogens and specifically focus on enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) o157:h7, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and entamoeba histolytica infections, and their impact on long-term effects, including postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. recent findings: salmonella, campylobacter, and ehec outbreaks continue to occur with disturbing regularity. peanut butter and peppers were recently responsible for outbreaks of  nontyphoid salmonella. recent research has identified salmonella genes required for colonization of various hosts and transposon-mediated differential hybridization was recently used to identify genes required during infection in different animal models. a number of other strains of ehec in addition to o157:h7 are emerging as serious threats to food safety in the usa. campylobacter jejuni isolates are of interest because of absence of genes encoding for classical enterotoxins, and lack of plasmids encoding genes promoting bacterial invasion. recent research has identified that the organism is able to invade and replicate  in infected epithelia via toll-like receptor (tlr)-2 and tlr-4. also patients with infectious colitis, in particular salmonella and campylobacter, are at increased risk of postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel  disease on long-term follow-up. the paradigm of entamoeba histolytica infection is changing with recent reports of detection of e. dispar deoxyribonucleic acid sequences, previously considered nonpathogenic. summary: there has been an explosion in the understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology, and mechanisms  underlying infectious colitis. additional studies to address prevention strategies and strict screening modalities for these infections are necessary.

TI  == relaxed acceptor site specificity of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase in vivo.
AB  == a number of proteobacteria carry the genetic information to perform n-linked glycosylation, but only the protein glycosylation (pgl) pathway of campylobacter  jejuni has been studied to date. here, we report that the pgl gene cluster of campylobacter lari encodes for a functional glycosylation machinery that can be reconstituted in escherichia coli. we determined that the n-glycan produced in this system consisted of a linear hexasaccharide. we found that the oligosaccharyltransferase (ost) of c. lari conserved a predominant specificity for the primary sequence d/e-x(-1)-n-x(+1)-s/t (where x(-1) and x(+1) can be any  amino acid but proline). at the same time, we observed that this enzyme exhibited a relaxed specificity toward the acceptor site and modified asparagine residues of a protein at sequences dansg and nnnst. moreover, c. lari pgl glycosylated a native e. coli protein. bacterial n-glycosylation appears as a useful tool to establish a molecular description of how single-subunit osts perform selection of glycosyl acceptor sites.

TI  == how a routine checking of escherichia coli in retailed food of animal origin can  protect consumers against exposition to campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes?
AB  == background/aim: according to the literature that has been published over the last two decades campylobacter spp i listeria monocitogens can be identified as causes of numerous diseases derived by consuming food of animal origin. the purpose of this paper was to find out how established national microbiological criteria of the republic of serbia on food safety in retailed food of animal origin could contribute to consumer's protection against exposition to foodborne pathogens such as campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes. methods: during a routine  microbiological safety control of randomly selected 60 samples of fresh poultry meat, 30 samples of other fresh meat readymade for grilling, 30 samples of sausage products, 37 samples of heat-treated meat, 39 samples of toppings for fast food of animal origin and 31 samples of dairy products a national food safety criteria (escherichia coli, aerobic plate count, salmonella spp., coagulasa positive staphylococcus, proteus spp., sulphito-reducting clostridia) were applied and, as well as, testing to campylobacter spp. and listeria monocitogens. in determination of campylobacter spp. and listeria monocytogenes,  food quality control methods of the food and agriculture organization (fao) were  applied, while in determination of the other above motioned bacteria, national provisions on microbiological methods were applied who are adjusted to the fao ones. results: related to the national criteria on microbiological food safety, 88 (38.8%) samples, out of the total 227 tested, were rejected. when to these results, the results of laboratory tests on listeria monocytogens were added, a terminal number of rejected samples were not changed. when to these results, the  results of campylobacter spp. testing were added, 91 (40.1%) out of the 227 samples were unsatisfied. results of logistic regression model with occurrence of escherichia coli as dependent variable indicated that escherichia coli was 4.5 times likely to occur among samples with campylobacter spp. than among samples without campylobacter spp. (or = 4.515, 95% ci: 1.019-20.002). sensitivity of the fitted model (hosmer-lemeshowp = 0.268) was 76.8% and its specificity was 75.0%.  at the same time escherichia coli was confound in all (100%) food samples that were contaminated by listeria monocytogenes. conclusion: statistical analysis indicated that escherichia coli was completely sensitive to identify all samples  contaminated with listeria monocytogenas and highly sensitive to identify samples contaminated with campylobacter spp. nevertheless, 3 (1.3%) of the tested samples were not covered with escherichia coli.

AB  == intestinal microbiotype necessary for life is a source of complications in childhood. bacterial translocation is responsible of endogenous septicaemia and invasive complications. we report five cases of severe invasive infections associated with diarrhoea, digestive bleeding or sepsis. biological parameters for inflammation are highly positive, and blood cultures reveal bacterial identification: salmonella enteridis, enterobacter cloacae, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli or clostridium difficile. we describe the predisposing factors and susceptibility status to develop translocation: invasive diarrhoea, asplenia, gasto-intestinal disease... all invasive infections in children require etiological approach with the possibility of an endogenous septicaemia (bacterial translocation). this approach minimises the nosocomial features undercurrent in these invasive infections, and leads also to other alternative preventive measures: antibiotic association, maintaining an enteral nutrition, pre or probiotic use, specific digestive decontamination.

AB  == we evaluated the performance and cost-effectiveness of a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry-based biotyper system for  the routine identification of common enteric bacterial pathogens seen in middle tennessee from suspicious colonies grown on selective stool culture media. a total of 304 suspicious colonies were selected and further identified from 605 stool specimens. the suspicious colonies were analyzed by the biotyper system, and the results were compared to those from routine phenotypic methods, which identified 22 salmonella species, 39 shigella species, 3 enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) isolates, 2 yersinia enterocolitica isolates, 2 campylobacter species, and 236 gastrointestinal normal flora isolates. the biotyper system correctly identified the salmonella species, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter species but failed to distinguish the shigella  species and ehec isolates from e. coli. among the 236 normal flora isolates, 233  (98.7%) and 228 (96.6%) agreed at the genus and species levels, respectively, between the phenotypic and biotyper methods. organism identification scores were  insignificantly different between colonies directly from selective media and subsequently from pure subculture. the entire biotyper identification procedure,  from smear preparation to final result reporting, can be completed within 30 min. the biotyper system provides a rapid and simple screening tool for identifying many, but not all, suspicious colonies grown on selective media within 24 h after inoculation, which shortens test turnaround time by 2 to 3 days.

TI  == performance of food safety management systems in poultry meat preparation processing plants in relation to campylobacter spp. contamination.
AB  == a diagnostic instrument comprising a combined assessment of core control and assurance activities and a microbial assessment instrument were used to measure the performance of current food safety management systems (fsmss) of two poultry  meat preparation companies. the high risk status of the company's contextual factors, i.e., starting from raw materials (poultry carcasses) with possible high numbers and prevalence of pathogens such as campylobacter spp., requires advanced core control and assurance activities in the fsms to guarantee food safety. the level of the core fsms activities differed between the companies, and this difference was reflected in overall microbial quality (mesophilic aerobic count), presence of hygiene indicators (enterobacteriaceae, staphylococcus aureus, and escherichia coli), and contamination with pathogens such as salmonella, listeria  monocytogenes, and campylobacter spp. the food safety output expressed as a microbial safety profile was related to the variability in the prevalence and contamination levels of campylobacter spp. in poultry meat preparations found in  a belgian nationwide study. although a poultry meat processing company could have an advanced fsms in place and a good microbial profile (i.e., lower prevalence of pathogens, lower microbial numbers, and less variability in microbial contamination), these positive factors might not guarantee pathogen-free products. contamination could be attributed to the inability to apply effective interventions to reduce or eliminate pathogens in the production chain of (raw) poultry meat preparations.

AB  == foodborne diseases remain an important cause of morbidity in the united states among all age groups. a potentially important contributor to this morbidity is improper food handling and preparation practices in kitchens at restaurants and in private homes. in 1998, the los angeles county department of public health (lacdph) established numeric scores for restaurant inspections and posted grades  for these inspections publicly; by the end of 1998 this initiative was credited with helping to reduce by 13.1% (compared with 1997) the number of hospitalizations for foodborne infections from nontyphoidal salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli in the region. in the spring of 2006, the lacdph environmental health program launched the home kitchen self-inspection program, a voluntary self-inspection and education program, to promote safer food hygiene practices at home. this report describes the implementation of this program and the results from its web-based self-assessment questionnaire, the food safety quiz, for the initial program period of 2006--2008. overall, approximately 13,000 adults completed the quiz; 34% received an a rating, 27% a b, 25% a c, and 14% received a numeric score because they scored lower than 70% on the self-assessment. use of interactive, online learning tools such as the food safety quiz can be used to promote home food safety in the community. further research is needed to evaluate and improve the program content and to assess its effect on changing food handling and preparation practices in the home kitchen.

AB  == objective: the objective of the present study was to describe the epidemiology of reportable enteric illness in ontario's waterloo region, including comparing calculated incidence rates with published rates, and adjusting for under-reporting to determine the number of community cases, where published data  were available. methods: descriptive analyses were performed on reportable disease data for 13 enteric diseases collected in the waterloo region from 1990 to 2004. poisson and negative binomial regression analyses were used to investigate differences in incidence rates among age, sex, the 15 years of data and seasons. disease-specific incidence rates were calculated and compared with the literature, where possible. under-reporting ratios from the literature were applied to estimate the number of cases of campylobacteriosis, nontyphoidal salmonellosis and verotoxigenic escherichia coli infection at the community level. results: over the study period, the average annual age- and sex-adjusted incidence rates per 100,000 population were highest for campylobacteriosis (49.69 cases), followed by giardiasis (31.87 cases) and nontyphoidal salmonellosis (25.97 cases). the incidence of most enteric illnesses peaked in the summer. the  highest incidence occurred in young children, followed by adults in their 20s. diarrhea (85.4%) was the most frequently reported symptom, food (57.4%) was the most commonly reported probable source, and home (41.7%) and travel (37.0%) were  the two most frequently reported risk settings. conclusions: enteric illness was  a significant health burden in the waterloo region from 1990 to 2004. because reportable disease data are subject to under-reporting, it is likely that the true burden is greater than estimated in the present study.

TI  == estimating the primary etiologic agents in recreational freshwaters impacted by human sources of faecal contamination.
AB  == epidemiology studies of recreational waters have demonstrated that swimmers exposed to faecally-contaminated recreational waters are at risk of excess gastrointestinal illness. epidemiology studies provide valuable information on the nature and extent of health effects, the magnitude of risks, and how these risks are modified or associated with levels of faecal contamination and other measures of pollution. however, such studies have not provided information about  the specific microbial agents that are responsible for the observed illnesses in  swimmers. the objective of this work was to understand more fully the reported epidemiologic results from studies conducted on the great lakes in the us during  2003 and 2004 by identifying pathogens that could have caused the observed illnesses in those studies. we used a quantitative microbial risk assessment (qmra) approach to estimate the likelihood of pathogen-induced adverse health effects. the reference pathogens used for this analysis were norovirus, rotavirus, adenovirus, cryptosporidium spp., giardia lamblia, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, and escherichia coli o157:h7. two qmra-based approaches were used to estimate the pathogen combinations that would be consistent with observed illness rates: in the first, swimming-associated gastrointestinal (gi) illnesses were assumed to occur in the same proportion as known illnesses in the us due to all non-foodborne sources, and in the second, pathogens were assumed to occur in the recreational waters in the same proportion as they occur in disinfected secondary effluent. the results indicate that human  enteric viruses and in particular, norovirus could have caused the vast majority  of the observed swimming-associated gi illnesses during the 2003/2004 water epidemiology studies. evaluation of the time-to-onset of illness strongly supports the principal finding and sensitivity analyses support the overall trends of the analyses even given their substantial uncertainties.

AB  == background: conjugate vaccines in which polysaccharide antigens are covalently linked to carrier proteins belong to the most effective and safest vaccines against bacterial pathogens. state-of-the art production of conjugate vaccines using chemical methods is a laborious, multi-step process. in vivo enzymatic coupling using the general glycosylation pathway of campylobacter jejuni in recombinant escherichia coli has been suggested as a simpler method for producing conjugate vaccines. in this study we describe the in vivo biosynthesis of two novel conjugate vaccine candidates against shigella dysenteriae type 1, an important bacterial pathogen causing severe gastro-intestinal disease states mainly in developing countries. results: two different periplasmic carrier proteins, acra from c. jejuni and a toxoid form of pseudomonas aeruginosa exotoxin were glycosylated with shigella o antigens in e. coli. starting from shake flask cultivation in standard complex medium a lab-scale fed-batch process  was developed for glycoconjugate production. it was found that efficiency of glycosylation but not carrier protein expression was highly susceptible to the physiological state at induction. after induction glycoconjugates generally appeared later than unglycosylated carrier protein, suggesting that glycosylation was the rate-limiting step for synthesis of conjugate vaccines in e. coli. glycoconjugate synthesis, in particular expression of oligosaccharyltransferase pglb, strongly inhibited growth of e. coli cells after induction, making it necessary to separate biomass growth and recombinant protein expression phases. with a simple pulse and linear feed strategy and the use of semi-defined glycerol medium, volumetric glycoconjugate yield was increased 30 to 50-fold. conclusions: the presented data demonstrate that glycosylated proteins can be produced in recombinant e. coli at a larger scale. the described methodologies constitute an  important step towards cost-effective in vivo production of conjugate vaccines, which in future may be used for combating severe infectious diseases, particularly in developing countries.

TI  == a 17-year review of foodborne outbreaks: describing the continuing decline in england and wales (1992-2008).
AB  == systematic national surveillance of foodborne disease outbreaks effectively serves the development of public health policy on food safety. the health protection agency has maintained a collaborative surveillance system for foodborne outbreaks in england and wales since 1992. up to 2008, 2429 foodborne outbreaks were identified, described and analysed for changes over time. salmonella spp. accounted for half of the outbreaks, although the proportion of these decreased over the surveillance period. similarly, the proportion of outbreaks caused by clostridium perfringens decreased, while those attributed to  campylobacter spp. and vero cytotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157 increased.  although poultry meat was the most frequently implicated food vehicle in outbreaks followed by miscellaneous foods and red meats, the proportion of outbreaks attributed to meats in fact decreased over time but those linked to miscellaneous foods did not. over the surveillance period, the proportion of outbreaks linked to eggs and s. enteritidis non-phage-type 4, particularly in food service establishments, increased, highlighting the importance of this organism/setting/vehicle association. contributory factors in most outbreaks were cross-contamination, inadequate heat treatment, and inappropriate food storage. this study describes the overall decline in foodborne outbreaks, providing evidence that the introduction and adherence to effective control measures provide the best means of minimizing the risk of foodborne infection.

TI  == quantification of pathogenic microorganisms and microbial indicators in three wastewater reclamation and managed aquifer recharge facilities in europe.
AB  == managed aquifer recharge (mar) is becoming an attractive option for water storage in water reuse processes as it provides an additional treatment barrier to improve recharged water quality and buffers seasonal variations of water supply and demand. to achieve a better understanding about the level of pathogenic microorganisms and their relation with microbial indicators in these systems, five waterborne pathogens and four microbial indicators were monitored over one year in three european mar sites operated with reclaimed wastewater. giardia and  cryptosporidium (oo)cysts were found in 63.2 and 36.7% of the samples respectively. salmonella spp. and helminth eggs were more rarely detected (16.3%  and 12.5% of the samples respectively) and campylobacter cells were only found in 2% of samples. at the belgian site advanced tertiary treatment technology prior to soil aquifer treatment (sat) produced effluent of drinking water quality, with no presence of the analysed pathogens. at the spanish and italian sites amelioration of microbiological water quality was observed between the mar injectant and the recovered water. in particular giardia levels decreased from 0.24-6.14 cysts/l to 0-0.01 cysts/l and from 0.4-6.2 cysts/l to 0-0.07 cysts/l in the spanish and italian sites respectively. salmonella gene copies and giardia cysts were however found in the water for final use and/or the recovered groundwater water at the two sites. significant positive spearman correlations (p<0.05, r(s) range: 0.45-0.95) were obtained, in all the three sites, between giardia cysts and the most resistant microbial markers, clostridium spores and bacteriophages.

TI  == travelers' diarrhea.
AB  == purpose of review: travelers' diarrhea affects 20-60% of travelers to low-income  regions of the world. much of the evidence for the clinical description and management of travelers' diarrhea was generated years ago, however, there is new  information on geographic and host risk, etiology, and prevention strategies. recent findings: travel to south asia, followed by sub-saharan africa and south america, carries the highest risk for diarrheal syndromes in returned travelers.  women are more susceptible to travel-related diarrhea than men. host genetic studies have demonstrated that single nucleotide polymorphisms in the lactoferrin, osteoprotegerin, and il-10 genes are associated with small but increased risks for diarrhea and enteric pathogens. enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis is likely to be a new agent identified as causing travelers' diarrhea, and heat-stable toxin-producing escherichia coli appears to be more common than heat-labile toxin e. coli. overall levels of sanitation at the travel destination, including individual eating establishments, are strong predictors for acquisition of travelers' diarrhea. a new transdermal lt vaccine shows promise in modifying the severity of travelers' diarrhea. it remains uncertain whether prophylaxis or prompt self-treatment of travelers' diarrhea will prevent  late-onset irritable bowel syndrome. for self-treatment, azithromycin is the drug of choice in travelers to areas where there is a high risk of fluoroquinolone-resistant campylobacter spp., such as south and southeast asia and possibly north africa, central and south america. summary: there is increased understanding of the determinants of travelers' diarrhea. despite this travelers' diarrhea remains one of the most common illnesses in travelers. continued focus on intervention strategies may ultimately lead to decreased incidence.

TI  == random mutagenesis strategies for campylobacter and helicobacter species.
AB  == campylobacter and helicobacter species are important pathogens in man and animals. the study of their virulence and physiology has been difficult due to the lack of tractable genetic tools, since many of the techniques established in  escherichia coli and related species were found to be non-functional in campylobacter and helicobacter species. the advent of functional genomics techniques in the last decade has been accompanied by the development of genetic  tools, which take advantage of specific features of campylobacter and helicobacter, like natural transformation. this has allowed for the construction  of random mutant libraries based on in vitro transposition or ligated loops followed by natural transformation and recombination, thus circumventing selection against sequences when cloning or passaging libraries through e. coli.  uses of the techniques have been in the study of motility, gene expression, and gene essentiality. in this chapter, we discuss the approaches and techniques used for the construction of random mutant libraries in both campylobacter and helicobacter.

TI  == a filamentous phage display system for n-linked glycoproteins.
AB  == we have developed a filamentous phage display system for the detection of asparagine-linked glycoproteins in escherichia coli that carry a plasmid encoding the protein glycosylation locus (pgl) from campylobacter jejuni. in our assay, fusion of target glycoproteins to the minor phage coat protein g3p results in the display of glycans on phage. the glyco-epitope displayed on phage is the product  of biosynthetic enzymes encoded by the c. jejuni pgl pathway and minimally requires three essential factors: a pathway for oligosaccharide biosynthesis, a functional oligosaccharyltransferase, and an acceptor protein with a d/e-x(1)-n-x(2)-s/t motif. glycosylated phages could be recovered by lectin chromatography with enrichment factors as high as 2 x 10(5) per round of panning  and these enriched phages retained their infectivity after panning. using this assay, we show that desired glyco-phenotypes can be reliably selected by panning  phage-displayed glycoprotein libraries on lectins that are specific for the glycan. for instance, we used our phage selection to identify permissible residues in the -2 position of the bacterial consensus acceptor site sequence. taken together, our results demonstrate that a genotype-phenotype link can be established between the phage-associated glyco-epitope and the phagemid-encoded genes for any of the three essential components of the glycosylation process. thus, we anticipate that our phage display system can be used to isolate interesting variants in any step of the glycosylation process, thereby making it  an invaluable tool for genetic analysis of protein glycosylation and for glycoengineering in e. coli cells.

TI  == fluorescence activated cell sorting as a general ultra-high-throughput screening  method for directed evolution of glycosyltransferases.
AB  == glycosyltransferases (gts) offer very attractive approaches to the synthesis of complex oligosaccharides. however, the limited number of available gts, together  with their instability and strict substrate specificity, have severely hampered the broad application of these enzymes. previous attempts to broaden the range of substrate scope and to increase the activity of gts via protein engineering have  met with limited success, partially because of the lack of effective high-throughput screening methods. recently, we reported an ultra-high-throughput screening method for sialyltransferases based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting (aharoni et al. nat. methods 2006, 3, 609-614). here, we considerably improve this method via the introduction of a two-color screening protocol to minimize the probability of false positive mutants and demonstrate its generality through directed evolution of a neutral sugar transferase, beta-1,3-galactosyltransferase cgtb. a variant with broader substrate tolerance than the wild-type enzyme and 300-fold higher activity was identified rapidly from a library of >10(7) cgtb mutants. importantly, the variant effected much more efficient synthesis of g(m1a) and asialo g(m1) oligosaccharides, the building blocks of important therapeutic glycosphingolipids, than did the parent  enzyme. this work not only establishes a new methodology for the directed evolution of galactosyltransferases, but also suggests a powerful strategy for the screening of almost all gt activities, thereby facilitating the engineering of glycosyltransferases.

TI  == implications of faecal indicator bacteria for the microbiological assessment of roof-harvested rainwater quality in southeast queensland, australia.
AB  == the study aimed to evaluate the suitability of escherichia coli, enterococci, and clostridium perfringens for assessing the microbiological quality of roof-harvested rainwater and assessing whether the concentrations of these faecal indicators can be used to predict the presence or absence of specific zoonotic bacterial or protozoan pathogens. from a total of 100 samples tested, 58%, 83%, and 46% of samples were found to be positive for, respectively, e. coli, enterococci, and clostridium perfringens spores, as determined by traditional culture-based methods. additionally, in the samples tested, 7%, 19%, 1%, 8%, 17%, and 15% were pcr positive for aeromonas hydrophila lip, campylobacter coli ceue,  campylobacter jejuni mapa, legionella pneumophila mip, salmonella inva, and giardia lamblia beta-giardin genes, respectively. however, none of the samples was positive for e. coli o157 lipopolysaccharide, verocytotoxin 1, and verocytotoxin 2 and cryptosporidium parvum oocyst wall protein genes. the presence or absence of these potential pathogens did not correlate with any of the faecal indicator bacterial concentrations as determined by a binary logistic  regression model. the roof-harvested rainwater samples tested in this study appeared to be of poor microbiological quality, and no significant correlation was found between the concentration of faecal indicators and pathogenic microorganisms. the use of faecal indicator bacteria raises questions regarding their reliability in assessing the microbiological quality of water and particularly their poor correlation with pathogenic microorganisms. the presence  of one or more zoonotic pathogens suggests that the microbiological analysis of water should be performed and that appropriate treatment measures should be undertaken, especially in tanks where the water is used for drinking.

TI  == presence of bacteroidales as a predictor of pathogens in surface waters of the central california coast.
AB  == the value of bacteroidales genetic markers and fecal indicator bacteria (fib) to  predict the occurrence of waterborne pathogens was evaluated in ambient waters along the central california coast. bacteroidales host-specific quantitative pcr  (qpcr) was used to quantify fecal bacteria in water and provide insights into contributing host fecal sources. over 140 surface water samples from 10 major rivers and estuaries within the monterey bay region were tested over 14 months with four bacteroidales-specific assays (universal, human, dog, and cow), three fib (total coliforms, fecal coliforms, and enterococci), two protozoal pathogens  (cryptosporidium and giardia spp.), and four bacterial pathogens (campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and vibrio spp.). indicator and  pathogen distribution was widespread, and detection was not highly seasonal. vibrio cholerae was detected most frequently, followed by giardia, cryptosporidium, salmonella, and campylobacter spp. bayesian conditional probability analysis was used to characterize the bacteroidales performance assays, and the ratios of concentrations determined using host-specific and universal assays were used to show that fecal contamination from human sources was more common than livestock or dog sources in coastal study sites. correlations were seen between some, but not all, indicator-pathogen combinations. the ability to predict pathogen occurrence in relation to indicator threshold cutoff levels was evaluated using a weighted measure that showed the universal bacteroidales genetic marker to have a comparable or higher mean predictive potential than standard fib. this predictive ability, in addition to the bacteroidales assays providing information on contributing host fecal sources, supports using bacteroidales assays in water quality monitoring programs.

TI  == alternative microbial methods: an overview and selection criteria.
AB  == this study provides an overview and criteria for the selection of a method, other than the reference method, for microbial analysis of foods. in a first part an overview of the general characteristics of rapid methods available, both for enumeration and detection, is given with reference to relevant bibliography. perspectives on future development and the potential of the rapid method for routine application in food diagnostics are discussed. as various alternative "rapid" methods in different formats are available on the market, it can be very  difficult for a food business operator or for a control authority to select the most appropriate method which fits its purpose. validation of a method by a third party, according to international accepted protocol based upon iso 16140, may increase the confidence in the performance of a method. a list of at the moment validated methods for enumeration of both utility indicators (aerobic plate count) and hygiene indicators (enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus) as well as for detection of the four major pathogens (salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, e. coli o157 and campylobacter spp.) is included with reference to relevant websites to check for updates. in a second part of this study, selection criteria are introduced to underpin the choice of the appropriate method(s) for a defined application. the selection criteria link  the definition of the context in which the user of the method functions - and thus the prospective use of the microbial test results - with the technical information on the method and its operational requirements and sustainability. the selection criteria can help the end user of the method to obtain a systematic insight into all relevant factors to be taken into account for selection of a method for microbial analysis.

TI  == a qualitative risk assessment approach for swiss dairy products: opportunities and limitations.
AB  == switzerland implemented a risk-based monitoring of swiss dairy products in 2002 based on a risk assessment (ra) that considered the probability of exceeding a microbiological limit value set by law. a new ra was launched in 2007 to review and further develop the previous assessment, and to make recommendations for future risk-based monitoring according to current risks. the resulting qualitative ra was designed to ascertain the risk to human health from the consumption of swiss dairy products. the products and microbial hazards to be considered in the ra were determined based on a risk profile. the hazards included campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, coagulase-positive staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin. the release assessment considered the prevalence of the hazards in bulk milk samples, the influence of the process parameters on the microorganisms, and the influence of the type of dairy. the exposure assessment was linked to the production volume. an overall probability was estimated combining the probabilities of release and exposure for each combination of hazard, dairy product and type of dairy. this overall probability  represents the likelihood of a product from a certain type of dairy exceeding the microbiological limit value and being passed on to the consumer. the consequences could not be fully assessed due to lack of detailed information on the number of  disease cases caused by the consumption of dairy products. the results were expressed as a ranking of overall probabilities. finally, recommendations for the design of the risk-based monitoring programme and for filling the identified data gaps were given. the aims of this work were (i) to present the qualitative ra approach for swiss dairy products, which could be adapted to other settings and (ii) to discuss the opportunities and limitations of the qualitative method.

TI  == methods for monitoring trends in the incidence of foodborne diseases: foodborne diseases active surveillance network 1996-2008.
AB  == foodborne illnesses are a substantial health burden in the united states. the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) is the principal foodborne disease component of the centers for disease control and prevention's emerging infections program. foodnet is a collaborative project among centers for disease control and prevention, emerging infections program sites, the u.s. department of agriculture, and the u.s. food and drug administration. one of foodnet's main objectives is to monitor changes in the incidence of selected foodborne pathogens. in 1996, foodnet began active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed cases of campylobacter, listeria, salmonella, shiga toxin-producing e. coli o157, shigella, vibrio, and yersinia infection. surveillance for cases of cryptosporidium and cyclospora infection was added in 1997 and surveillance for non-o157 shiga toxin-producing e. coli was added in 2000. from 1997 to 2008, the foodnet surveillance population increased, primarily through the addition of new sites. the increase in the number of foodnet sites and the size of the population under surveillance as well as the variation in the incidence of infections among sites posed challenges in the selection of the most appropriate method to monitor changes in incidence. to account for variation introduced by changes in population size, a main-effects, log-linear poisson (negative binomial) regression model was adopted to estimate the magnitude of changes in the incidence of pathogens by comparing current year incidence to reference periods. the article explains how foodnet uses the negative binomial model to examine changes in incidence over time, describes the reference periods  used, explains the graphics used to display results, and discusses future directions in the analysis of trends over time.

TI  == cladophora in the great lakes: impacts on beach water quality and human health.
AB  == cladophora in the great lakes grows rapidly during the warm summer months, detaches, and becomes free-floating mats as a result of environmental conditions, eventually becoming stranded on recreational beaches. cladophora provides protection and nutrients, which allow enteric bacteria such as escherichia coli,  enterococci, shigella, campylobacter, and salmonella to persist and potentially regrow in the presence of the algae. as a result of wind and wave action, these microorganisms can detach and be released to surrounding waters and can influence water quality. enteric bacterial pathogens have been detected in cladophora mats; e. coli and enterococci may populate to become part of the naturalized microbiota in cladophora; the high densities of these bacteria may affect water quality, resulting in unnecessary beach closures. the continued use of traditional fecal indicators at beaches with cladophora presence is inadequate at accurately predicting the presence of fecal contamination. this paper offers a substantial review of available literature to improve the knowledge of cladophora impacts on  water quality, recreational water monitoring, fecal indicator bacteria and microorganisms, and public health and policy.

AB  == although considerable research has been carried out on a range of environmental factors that impact on the survival of campylobacter jejuni, there is limited information on the effects of violet/blue light on this pathogen. this investigation was carried out to determine the effects of high-intensity 405-nm light on c. jejuni and to compare this with the effects on two other important gram-negative enteric pathogens, salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7. high-intensity 405-nm light generated from an array of 405-nm light-emitting diodes was used to inactivate the test bacteria. the results demonstrated that while all three tested species were susceptible to 405-nm light inactivation, c. jejuni was by far the most sensitive organism, requiring a total dose of 18 j cm(-)(2) of 405-nm light to achieve a 5-log(1)(0) reduction. this study has established that c. jejuni is particularly susceptible to violet/blue light at a wavelength of 405 nm. this finding, coupled with the safety-in-use advantages of this visible (non-ultraviolet wavelength) light, suggests that high-intensity 405-nm light may have applications for control of c. jejuni contamination levels in situations where this type of illumination can be effectively applied.

TI  == bacterial pathogens associated with bloody diarrhea in uruguayan children.
AB  == diarrheal disease continues to be a serious health problem, especially in developing countries. bloody diarrhea represents approximately 20-30% of all cases and has higher morbidity and mortality. treatment with antibiotics is beneficial in cases of shigella, campylobacter, yersinia and salmonella infection, principally in those children with a higher risk of invasive disease.  the aims of this study were to detect the bacterial agents associated with bloody diarrhea in children and to determine their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. between june 2001 and january 2008, 249 children with bloody diarrhea were studied. shigella and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) were recovered from 48 (19.3%) and 3 (1.2%) of the total of cases, respectively. in 49 out of 249 children, in whom other enteropathogens were investigated, we recovered campylobacter jejuni from 7 children (14.3%), salmonella spp. from 2 (4.1%) and aeromonas spp. from 1 (2%) in addition to shigella from 7 children (14.3%). thirty-four (70%) shigella isolates showed resistance to ampicillin and  13 (27%) to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. all shigella isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid, ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone. salmonella and stec isolates were susceptible to all antibiotics assayed. thus, the use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or ampicillin would not be appropriate for the empirical treatment of shigella - associated diarrhea.

TI  == characterization of n-linked protein glycosylation in helicobacter pullorum.
AB  == the first bacterial n-linked glycosylation system was discovered in campylobacter jejuni, and the key enzyme involved in the coupling of glycan to asparagine residues within the acceptor sequon of the glycoprotein is the oligosaccharyltransferase pglb. emerging genome sequence data have revealed that  pglb orthologues are present in a subset of species from the deltaproteobacteria  and epsilonproteobacteria, including three helicobacter species: h. pullorum, h.  canadensis, and h. winghamensis. in contrast to c. jejuni, in which a single pglb gene is located within a larger gene cluster encoding the enzymes required for the biosynthesis of the n-linked glycan, these helicobacter species contain two unrelated pglb genes (pglb1 and pglb2), neither of which is located within a larger locus involved in protein glycosylation. in complementation experiments, the h. pullorum pglb1 protein, but not pglb2, was able to transfer c. jejuni n-linked glycan onto an acceptor protein in escherichia coli. analysis of the characterized c. jejuni n-glycosylation system with an in vitro oligosaccharyltransferase assay followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (maldi) mass spectrometry demonstrated the utility of this approach, and when applied to h. pullorum, pglb1-dependent n glycosylation with a linear pentasaccharide was observed. this reaction required an acidic residue at the -2  position of the n-glycosylation sequon, as for c. jejuni. attempted insertional knockout mutagenesis of the h. pullorum pglb2 gene was unsuccessful, suggesting that it is essential. these first data on n-linked glycosylation in a second bacterial species demonstrate the similarities to, and fundamental differences from, the well-studied c. jejuni system.

TI  == helicobacter pylori apo-fur regulation appears unconserved across species.
AB  == the ferric uptake regulator (fur) is a transcriptional regulator that is conserved across a broad number of bacterial species and has been shown to regulate expression of iron uptake and storage genes. additionally, fur has been  shown to be an important colonization factor of the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. in h. pylori, fur-dependent regulation appears to be unique in that fur is able to act as a transcriptional repressor when bound to iron as well as in its iron free (apo) form. to date, apo-regulation has not been identified in any  other bacterium. to determine whether fur from other species has the capacity for apo-regulation, we investigated the ability of fur from escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, desulfovibrio vulgaris hildenborough, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and vibrio cholerae to complement both iron-bound and apo-fur regulation within the context of a h. pylori fur mutant. we found that while some fur species (e. coli, c. jejuni, and v. cholerae) complemented iron-bound regulation, apo-regulation was unable to be complemented by any of the examined species. these data suggest that despite the conservation among bacterial fur proteins, h. pylori fur contains unique structure/function features that make it  novel in comparison to fur from other species.

TI  == an epidemiologic review of enteropathogens in gaborone, botswana: shifting patterns of resistance in an hiv endemic region.
AB  == background: the epidemiology of diarrheal disease in botswana, an hiv endemic region, is largely unknown. our primary objective was to characterize the prevalent bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens in gaborone, botswana. secondary objectives included determining corresponding antimicrobial resistance  patterns and the value of stool white and red blood cells for predicting bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens. methodology/principal findings: a retrospective cross-sectional study examined laboratory records of stool specimens analyzed by the botswana national health laboratory in gaborone, botswana from february 2003 through july 2008. in 4485 specimens the median subject age was 23 [interquartile range 1.6-34] years. overall, 14.4% (644 of 4485) of samples yielded a pathogen. bacteria alone were isolated in 8.2% (367 of 4485), parasites alone in 5.6% (253 of 4485) and both in 0.5% (24 of 4485) of samples. the most common bacterial pathogens were shigella spp. and salmonella spp., isolated from 4.0% (180 of 4485) and 3.9% (175 of 4485) of specimens, respectively. escherichia coli (22 of 4485) and campylobacter spp. (22 of 4485) each accounted for 0.5% of pathogens. comparing antimicrobial resistance among shigella spp. and salmonella spp. between two periods, february 2003 to february  2004 and july 2006 to july 2008, revealed an increase in ampicillin resistance among shigella spp. from 43% to 83% (p<0.001). among salmonella spp., resistance  to chloramphenicol decreased from 56% to 6% (p<0.001). the absence of stool white and red blood cells correlated with a high specificity and negative predictive value. conclusions/significance: most gastroenteritis stools were culture and microscopy negative suggesting that viral pathogens were the majority etiologic agents in this botswana cohort. shigella spp. and salmonella spp. were the most common bacteria; isospora spp. and cryptosporidium spp. were the most common parasites. resistance to commonly used antimicrobials is high and should be closely monitored.

AB  == clostridium difficile (cd), salmonella, campylobacter and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) are major causes of morbidity in a variety of enteric diseases in humans and animals, but subclinical carriage in both is probably more common than are clinical cases. little is known regarding the prevalence of these pathogens in animals raised for exhibit at michigan county fairs or the frequency with which michigan citizens raising these animals may have been subclinically colonized. to address these issues, 361 fecal specimens from 158 humans and 203 of their farm animals were cultured for cd, salmonella and campylobacter. additionally, 50 people and their cattle were tested for ehec. no ehec, salmonella or campylobacter were detected. however, 16 specimens (4.4%) were positive for cd: 13 humans, two horses and one pig. none of the farm animal specimens submitted by any of the 13 cd-positive humans were positive for cd. strain characterization [toxinotype, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge)] demonstrated that the human cd isolates were similar to what has been reported previously in the general us population. we conclude that horses and farm animals (cattle, sheep, goats and swine) at 1-2 months before market weight showed no evidence of wide-spread carriage of the common enteric pathogens, including the recently reported cd toxinotype v. these results provide no support to the hypothesis that 4-h members or others visiting county fair animal husbandry projects in these counties may be at increased risk for acquisition of cd, salmonella, campylobacter or ehec from animals.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni and salmonella, shigella, and yersinia species (along with shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli) are the most common causes of acute bacterial diarrheal disease in the united states. current detection techniques are time-consuming, limiting usefulness for patient care. we developed and validated a panel of rapid pcr assays for the detection and identification of c.  jejuni, c. coli, salmonella, and yersinia species and shigella and enteroinvasive e. coli in stool samples. a total of 392 archived stool specimens, previously cultured for enteric pathogens, were evaluated by pcr. overall, 104 stool specimens had been culture positive (c. jejuni/coli [n = 51], salmonella species  [n = 42], shigella species [n = 6], and yersinia species [n = 5]). compared to culture, the overall sensitivity and specificity of pcr detection of these organisms were 92 and 98% (96/104 and 283/288), respectively, from fresh or cary  blair stool (p = 0.41); 87 and 98% (41/47 and 242/246), respectively, from fresh  stool (p = 0.53); and 96 and 98% (55/57 and 41/42), respectively, from cary blair stool (p = 0.56). for individual genera, pcr was as sensitive as the culture method, with the exception of salmonella culture using selenite enrichment for which pcr was less sensitive than culture from fresh, but not cary blair (p = 0.03 and 1.00, respectively) stools. this pcr assay panel for the rapid diagnosis of acute infectious bacterial diarrheal pathogens has a sensitivity and specificity equivalent to that of culture for stools in cary blair transport medium. paired with reflexive culture of stools testing positive, this should provide an improvement in care for patients with acute infectious diarrheal disease.

AB  == as meat consumption is increasing around the world, so do concerns and challenges to meat hygiene and safety. these concerns are mostly of a biological nature and  include bacterial pathogens, such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella and campylobacter in raw meat and poultry, and listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat processed products, while viral pathogens are of major concern at foodservice. a  major goal of scientists, industry, public health and regulatory authorities is to control pathogenic microorganisms and improve meat product hygiene and safety  within a country and internationally. this paper is not a comprehensive or critical review of the scientific literature on the broad area of meat hygiene and safety, but it provides an overview of major current meat hygiene and safety  issues, and then a summary of studies on biofilm formation by pathogens, control  of e. coli o157:h7 in nonintact meat products, and control of l. monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meat products, conducted at the center for meat safety & quality and food safety cluster of colorado state university in recent years.

TI  == investigation of water washes suitable for very small meat plants to reduce pathogens on beef surfaces.
AB  == water washing with a handheld hose was performed on beef surfaces to ascertain the most effective combination of methods needed to remove potentially harmful microorganisms. for these experiments, beef brisket surfaces were experimentally  inoculated with a fecal slurry containing escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter jejuni. in a pilot study, surfaces were washed with cold water (15 degrees c) at various water pressures, spray distances, application times, and drip times, and remaining bacterial populations were determined following the enumeration and isolation of pathogens  and naturally occurring hygiene indicators (mesophilic aerobic bacteria, coliforms, and e. coli). the most efficacious combinations of these washing conditions were applied subsequently to artificially contaminated beef brisket surfaces in conjunction with hot (77 degrees c), warm (54 degrees c), and additional cold (15 degrees c) water washes. in the cold water washing pilot study, combinations of physical washing conditions significantly reduced all bacterial populations (p < 0.05). further studies clearly indicated the superior  bactericidal effectiveness of hot water washing; e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella typhimurium were reduced by 3.8 and 4.1 log cfu/cm(2), respectively. overall, higher water temperature, longer application times, and shorter spray distances more effectively removed pathogens from inoculated beef surfaces. these findings  will be used to formulate water washing recommendations for very small meat processing establishments.

TI  == foodborne illness: is it on the rise?
AB  == foodborne illness is a serious public health threat. the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) estimates that 76 million foodborne illnesses, including 325,000 hospitalizations and 5,000 deaths, occur in the united states each year. two recently published foodborne diseases active surveillance network  (foodnet) reports showed that salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, cryptosporidium, and shiga toxin escherichia coli (stec) o157 continue to be leading causes of both the number and incidence of laboratory-confirmed foodborne infections in the united states. according to the united states department of agriculture (usda), foodborne illness costs the us economy $10-83 billion per year. recent large foodborne outbreaks have led to claims that the number of foodborne disease outbreaks and concomitant illnesses has increased in recent years. however, a comparison of data from the cdc showed very little change in the incidence of foodborne illness caused by common pathogens between 2008 and the preceding 3 years (2005-2007). nevertheless, despite intensified prevention efforts, foodborne illness remains a persistent problem in the united states. food can become contaminated at any point in the farm-to-table continuum, as well as in consumers' own kitchens. therefore, foodborne illness risk reduction and control interventions must be implemented at every step throughout the food preparation process, from farm to table. in addition, more effective food safety  education programs for foodhandlers and consumers are needed. strategies should take into account food safety-related trends including large-scale production and wide distribution of food, globalization of the food supply, eating outside of the home, emergence of new pathogens, and growing population of at-risk consumers.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance in indicator and zoonotic bacteria isolated from domestic animals in argentina].
AB  == antimicrobial resistance profiles in indicator and zoonotic bacteria isolated from faeces of healthy animals without clinical signs of the following species: bovine, equine, ovine, porcine, layer hens, and canine, were studied. the chosen  antimicrobials are frequently used in veterinary and human medicine. the agar diffusion was the method used. the obtained results of 240 escherichia coli, 189  enterococcus spp., 11 campylobacter spp. and 2 salmonella gaminara (16:d:1,7) showed a greater percentage of resistance and multiresistance in intensive breeding animals, porcine and layer hens. the observed resistance to ampicillin,  streptomycin, tetracycline and nalidixic acid in e. coli coincides with the antimicrobials most commonly used on animal farms, the same as tetracycline and erythromycin in enterococcus spp. the strains of salmonella gaminara (16:d:1,7) were susceptible to the antimicrobials tested. in campylobacter spp. the scarce number of isolates hindered an adequate interpretation of the results. owing to the lack of data in our country on antimicrobial resistance in indicator and zoonotic bacteria in domestic animals, we consider that the obtained values could be used as a starting point for a future monitoring program.

TI  == n-linked glycoengineering for human therapeutic proteins in bacteria.
AB  == approx. 70% of human therapeutic proteins are n-linked glycoproteins, and therefore host cells for production must contain the relevant protein modification machinery. the discovery and characterisation of the n-linked glycosylation pathway in the pathogenic bacterium campylobacter jejuni, and subsequently its functional transfer to escherichia coli, presents the opportunity of using prokaryotes as cell factories for therapeutic protein production. not only could bacteria reduce costs and increase yields, but the improved feasibility to genetically control microorganisms means new and improved pharmacokinetics of therapeutics is an exciting possibility. this is a relatively new concept, and progress in bacterial n-glycosylation characterisation is reviewed and metabolic engineering targets revealed.

TI  == high bacterial contamination of pig tonsils at slaughter.
AB  == food-borne zoonoses have a major health impact in industrial countries. campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, yersinia enterocolitica and listeria monocytogenes are high-risk food-borne zoonotic hazards in finishing pigs. the objectives of this work were (1) to study the isolation rate of pathogenic y. enterocolitica, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and l. monocytogenes in the tonsils and feces and (2) to determine the number of mesophilic aerobic bacteria  (mab) and escherichia coli in the tonsils of fattening pigs at slaughter. the samples, which were collected from one slaughterhouse on five occasions, originated from 50 pigs and 15 farms. the number of mab varied from 6.40 to 7.82  log(10) cfu/g and e. coli from 4.38 to 6.53 log(10) cfu/g. additionally, 31 (62%) of the tonsils were colonized with y. enterocolitica and 16 (32%) with l. monocytogenes. campylobacter spp. were more frequently excreted in feces and only 3 (6%) of the pigs carried campylobacter spp. in the tonsils. no salmonella spp.  were isolated. the pig tonsils were shown to be colonized with a high number of bacteria including e. coli, which is the most important indicator for fecal contamination, and with y. enterocolitica and l. monocytogenes, which are important food-borne pathogens. this study demonstrates that the tonsils are highly contaminated with micro-organisms and can be a very important source of contamination in the slaughterhouse.

TI  == the occurrence of campylobacter in river water and waterfowl within a watershed in southern ontario, canada.
AB  == aims: quantitative pcr and a culture method were used to investigate campylobacter occurrence over 3 years in a watershed located in southern ontario, canada that is used as a source of drinking water. methods and results: direct dna extraction from river water followed by quantitative pcr analysis detected thermophilic campylobacters at low concentrations (<130 cells 100 ml(-1) ) in 57-79% of samples taken from five locations. by comparison, a culture-based method detected campylobacter in 0-23% of samples. water quality parameters such  as total escherichia coli were not highly correlated with campylobacter levels, although higher pathogen concentrations were observed at colder water temperatures (<10 degrees c). strains isolated from river water were primarily nalidixic acid-susceptible campylobacter lari, and selected isolates were identified as campylobacter lari ssp. concheus. campylobacter from wild birds (seagulls, ducks and geese) were detected at a similar rate using pcr (32%) and culture-based (29%) methods, and although campylobacter jejuni was isolated most  frequently, c. lari ssp. concheus was also detected. conclusions: campylobacter were frequently detected at low concentrations in the watershed. higher prevalence rates using quantitative pcr was likely because of the formation of viable but nonculturable cells and low recovery of the culture method. in addition to animal and human waste, waterfowl can be an important contributor of  campylobacter in the environment. significance and impact of the study: results of this study show that campylobacter in surface water can be an important vector for human disease transmission and that method selection is important in determining pathogen occurrence in a water environment.

TI  == microbial transport from dairying under two spray-irrigation systems in canterbury, new zealand.
AB  == transport through the soil and vadose zone to groundwater of escherichia coli, fecal coliforms, and campylobacter spp. from pasturing of dairy cows was studied  on two working dairy farms under a traveling irrigator and a center pivot system. leachate was collected from 1.5 m depth using a large linear lysimeter over a period of 4 yr after rainfall or irrigation applied using a traveling irrigator.  there was little transport of fecal coliforms or campylobacter from irrigation applications of 55 mm. there was some transport of fecal coliforms at applications of 80 mm (corresponding to irrigation plus heavy rainfall) but no detectable campylobacter. when fresh cow pats were placed on half of the lysimeter plots with an 80-mm water application, there was transport of fecal coliforms and campylobacter, but levels of campylobacter were low (<or=4 mpn l(-1)). groundwater at the farm with center pivot spray irrigation was monitored  monthly from september 2001 to june 2007, with 60% of samples being collected from downgradient wells. escherichia coli were detected in 5.4 and 2.8% of samples from upgradient and downgradient wells, respectively, at concentrations of >or=1 cfu 100 ml(-1). campylobacter was detected in 0.7% of samples over the study period, with equal percentages from up- and downgradient wells. the results indicate minimal impact of dairying at these sites on microbial quality of groundwater as a result of spray irrigation using traveling irrigators at rates of approximately 55 mm every 2 wk or center pivot irrigators at 18 mm every 3 to  4 d.

TI  == amino-terminal residues dictate the export efficiency of the campylobacter jejuni filament proteins via the flagellum.
AB  == bacterial flagella play an essential role in the pathogenesis of numerous enteric pathogens. the flagellum is required for motility, colonization, and in some instances, for the secretion of effector proteins. in contrast to the intensively studied flagella of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium, the flagella of  campylobacter jejuni, helicobacter pylori and vibrio cholerae are less well characterized and composed of multiple flagellin subunits. this study was performed to gain a better understanding of flagellin export from the flagellar type iii secretion apparatus of c. jejuni. the flagellar filament of c. jejuni is comprised of two flagellins termed flaa and flab. we demonstrate that the amino-termini of flaa and flab determine the length of the flagellum and motility of c. jejuni. we also demonstrate that protein-specific residues in the amino-terminus of flaa and flab dictate export efficiency from the flagellar type iii secretion system (t3ss) of yersinia enterocolitica. these findings demonstrate that key residues within the amino-termini of two nearly identical proteins influence protein export efficiency, and that the mechanism governing the efficiency of protein export is conserved among two pathogens belonging to distinct bacterial classes. these findings are of additional interest because c.  jejuni utilizes the flagellum to export virulence proteins.

TI  == cytolethal distending toxin family members are differentially affected by alterations in host glycans and membrane cholesterol.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxins (cdts) are tripartite protein exotoxins produced by  a diverse group of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria. based on their ability to induce dna damage, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis of cultured cells, cdts are proposed to enhance virulence by blocking cellular division and/or directly killing epithelial and immune cells. despite the widespread distribution of cdts  among several important human pathogens, our understanding of how these toxins interact with host cells is limited. here we demonstrate that cdts from haemophilus ducreyi, aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni differ in their abilities to intoxicate host cells with defined defects in host factors previously implicated in cdt binding, including glycoproteins, and glycosphingolipids. the absence of cell surface sialic acid sensitized cells to intoxication by three of the four cdts tested. surprisingly,  fucosylated n-linked glycans and glycolipids, previously implicated in cdt-host interactions, were not required for intoxication by any of the cdts tested. finally, altering host-cellular cholesterol, also previously implicated in cdt binding, affected intoxication by only a subset of cdts tested. the findings presented here provide insight into the molecular and cellular basis of cdt-host  interactions.

TI  == exposure of campylobacter jejuni to 6 degrees c: effects on heat resistance and electron transport activity.
AB  == human infection with campylobacter jejuni is frequently associated with the consumption of foods, especially chicken meat, which have been exposed to a range of temperatures during processing, storage, and cooking. despite the public health importance of c. jejuni, little is known about the effects of cold exposure (refrigeration) on the subsequent ability of this pathogen to survive heat challenge. this work examined the effect of rapid exposure to 6 degrees c for 24 h on the heat resistance at 52 degrees c of 19 c. jejuni strains originally isolated from various sources. the resulting death curves were analyzed with the weibull model. unlike cold-exposed cells of escherichia coli and salmonella, which have been reported to show significant increased sensitivity to heat, such exposure had only a marginal effect on heat resistance  of the c. jejuni strains in this study. a possible explanation for this effect is that rapid chilling renders c. jejuni cells unable to adapt to reduced temperatures in an active manner. this hypothesis is supported by the observation that exposure to 6 degrees c for 24 h resulted in a significant and marked reduction in electron transport system activity when compared with controls at 37 degrees c.

TI  == danish initiatives to improve the safety of meat products.
AB  == during the last two decades the major food safety problems in denmark, as determined by the number of human patients, has been associated with bacterial infections stemming from meat products and eggs. the bacterial pathogens causing  the majority of human infections has been salmonella and campylobacter, and to a  lesser extent yersinia, escherichiacoli o157 and listeria. danish initiatives to  improve the safety of meat products have focused on the entire production chain from the farm to the consumer, with a special emphasis on the pre-harvest stage of production. the control of bacterial pathogens which are resistant to antibiotics has been a new area of attention in the recent decade, and recently,  the increasing globalization of the domestic food supply has called for a complete rethinking of the national food safety strategies. the implementations of a "case-by-case" risk assessment system, as well as increased international collaboration on surveillance, are both elements in this new strategy.

TI  == culture-independent techniques applied to food industry water surveillance--a case study.
AB  == culture-independent techniques were used for the detection of pathogenic bacteria in drinking water at potentially critical control points along the production lines at a german dairy company and a spanish dry cured ham company. denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge) was used to describe bacterial population shifts indicating biological instability in the drinking water samples. autochthonous bacteria were identified by sequencing the excised dgge dna bands.  more specifically, real-time pcr was applied to detect a number of pathogenic bacteria, i.e. listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, enterococcus spp., salmonella spp, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. due to the detection limits of the  real-time pcr method, a specific protocol was established in order to meet the technical detection requirements and to avoid unwanted polymerase inhibitions. autochthonous bacterial populations were found to be highly stable at most of the sampling points. only one sampling point exhibited population shifts at the german dairy company. enterococci and p.aeruginosa were detected in some water samples from these companies by molecular biology detection methods, but not by conventional culturing methods. some opportunistic bacteria as enterobacter sp.,  acinetobacter, sphingomonas sp. and non-pathogenic bacillus, were also detected after dna sequencing of dgge bands.

TI  == the effect of clinical outbreaks of salmonellosis on the prevalence of fecal salmonella shedding among dairy cattle in new york.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine if the within-herd prevalence of fecal salmonella shedding is higher in dairy herds with clinical outbreaks of disease, as compared to herds with subclinical infections only. data were collected prospectively from dairy herds throughout new york that had at least 150 lactating cows and that received clinical service from participating veterinarians. after enrollment, salmonella surveillance consisted of both environmental screening and disease monitoring within the herd. herds positive by either environmental or fecal culture were sampled during three visits to estimate the within-herd prevalence of salmonella. we characterized isolates by serovar and antimicrobial resistance pattern. among 57 enrolled herds, 44 (77%) yielded salmonella-positive samples during the study period; 27 (61%) of the positive herds had salmonella isolated from environmental samples only, and 17 (39%) had one or more laboratory-confirmed clinical cases. the within-herd prevalence of fecal salmonella shedding ranged from 0 to 53%. salmonella cerro was the predominant serovar, accounting for 56% of all isolates. antimicrobial resistance ranged from zero to nine drugs, and 14 (32%) of the positive farms generated multidrug-resistant isolates. herds with laboratory-confirmed clinical  cases had a higher prevalence of fecal salmonella shedding than herds that only generated positive environmental samples, as estimated by a poisson regression model (prevalence ratio, 2.7; p = 0.01). an association between dairy herd outbreaks of salmonellosis and a higher prevalence of asymptomatic shedding should help guide strategies for reducing the public health threat of salmonella, as the ability to recognize high-risk herds by clinical laboratory submissions presents an obvious opportunity to maximize food safety at the preharvest level.  this is in contrast with other foodborne zoonotic pathogens, such as campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157:h7, which occur widely in adult cattle without accompanying clinical disease.

TI  == altered linkage of hydroxyacyl chains in lipid a of campylobacter jejuni reduces  tlr4 activation and antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == modification of the lipid a moiety of bacterial lipopolysaccharide influences cell wall properties, endotoxic activity, and bacterial resistance to antimicrobial peptides. known modifications are variation in the number or length of acyl chains and/or attached phosphoryl groups. here we identified two genes (gnna and gnnb) in the major foodborne pathogen campylobacter jejuni that enable  the synthesis of a glcn3n precursor udp 2-acetamido-3-amino-2,3-dideoxy-alpha-d-glucopyranose (udp-glcnac3n) in the lipid a backbone. mass spectrometry of purified lipooligosaccharide verified that the gene products facilitate the formation of a 2,3-diamino-2,3-dideoxy-d-glucose (glcn3n) disaccharide lipid a backbone when compared with the beta-1'-6-linked d-glucosamine (glcn) disaccharide observed in escherichia coli lipid a. functional assays showed that inactivation of the gnna or gnnb gene enhanced the  tlr4-md2-mediated nf-kappab activation. the mutants also displayed increased susceptibility to killing by the antimicrobial peptides polymyxin b, colistin and the chicken cathelicidin-1. the gnna and gnnb genes are organized in one operon with hemh, encoding a ferrochelatase catalyzing the last step in heme biosynthesis. these results indicate that lipid a modification resulting in amide-linked acyl chains in the lipid a is an effective mechanism to evade activation of the innate host defense and killing by antimicrobial peptides.

TI  == overexpression and topology of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase pglb.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni contains a post-translational n-glycosylation system in which a stt3 homologue, pglb, functions as the oligosaccharyltransferase. herein, we established a method for obtaining relatively large quantities of homogenous pglb proteins. pglb was overexpressed in escherichia coli c43(de3) at a level of  1 mg/l cell cultures. the activity of purified pglb was verified using a chemically synthesized sugar donor: n-acetylgalactosamine-diphospho-undecaprenyl  (galnac-pp-und) and a synthesized peptide acceptor. the result confirms that pglb is solely responsible for the oligosaccharyltransferase activity and complements  the finding that pglb exhibits relaxed sugar substrate specificity. in addition,  we performed the topology mapping of pglb using the phoa/lacz fusion method. the  topological model shows that pglb possesses 11 transmembrane segments and two relatively large periplasmic regions other than the c-terminal domain, which is consistent with the proposal of the common n(cyt)-c(peri) topology with 11 transmembrane segments for the stt3 family proteins.

TI  == microbial risks associated with exposure to pathogens in contaminated urban flood water.
AB  == urban flood incidents induced by heavy rainfall in many cases entail flooding of  combined sewer systems. these flood waters are likely to be contaminated and may  pose potential health risks to citizens exposed to pathogens in these waters. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the microbial risk associated with sewer flooding incidents. concentrations of escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci and campylobacter were measured in samples from 3 sewer flooding incidents. the results indicate faecal contamination: faecal indicator organism concentrations were similar to those found in crude sewage under high-flow conditions and campylobacter was detected in all samples. due to infrequent occurrence of such incidents only a small number of samples could be collected; additional data were collected from controlled flooding experiments and analyses of samples from combined sewers. the results were used for a screening-level quantitative microbial risk assessment (qmra). calculated annual risks values vary from 5 x 10(-6) for cryptosporidium assuming a low exposure scenario to 0.03 for giardia assuming a high exposure scenario. the results of this screening-level risk assessment justify further research and data collection to allow more reliable quantitative assessment of health risks related to contaminated urban flood waters.

TI  == a link between the assembly of flagella and lipooligosaccharide of the gram-negative bacterium campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of acute bacterial diarrhea worldwide and is implicated in development of guillain-barre syndrome. two major surface features, the outer membrane lipooligosaccharide and flagella, are highly variable and are often targets for modification. presumably, these modifications  provide a competitive advantage to the bacterium. in this work, we identify a gene encoding a phosphoethanolamine (petn) transferase (cj0256) that serves a dual role in modifying not only the lipooligosaccharide lipid anchor lipid a with petn, but also the flagellar rod protein flgg. generation of a mutant in c. jejuni 81-176 by interruption of cj0256 resulted in the absence of petn modifications on lipid a as well as flgg. the cj0256 mutant showed a 20-fold increase in sensitivity to the cationic antimicrobial peptide, polymyxin b, as well as a decrease in motility. transmission em of the cj0256 mutant revealed a population (approximately 95%) lacking flagella, indicating that, without petn modification of flgg, flagella production is hindered. most intriguing, this research identifies a petn transferase showing preference for two periplasmic substrates linking membrane biogenesis and flagellar assembly. cj0256 is a member of a large family of mostly uncharacterized proteins that may play a larger role  in the decoration of bacterial surface structures.

TI  == an outbreak of acute bacterial gastroenteritis is associated with an increased incidence of irritable bowel syndrome in children.
AB  == objectives: acute bacterial gastroenteritis is associated with subsequent post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (pi-ibs) in adults. less is known about  this relationship in children. in may 2000, contamination of municipal water by escherichia coli 0157:h7 and campylobacter species caused a large outbreak of acute gastroenteritis in walkerton, ontario. we assessed this association among a cohort of children enrolled in the walkerton health study (whs). methods: whs participants who were under age 16 at the time of the outbreak but who reached age 16 during the 8-year study follow-up were eligible for the pediatric pi-ibs study cohort. eligibility also required no diagnosis of ibs or inflammatory bowel disease before the outbreak and permanent residency in the walkerton postal code  at the time of the outbreak. validated criteria were used to classify subjects as having had no gastroenteritis (unexposed controls), self-reported gastroenteritis, or clinically suspected gastroenteritis during the outbreak. from 2002 to 2008, standardized biennial interviews used a modified bowel disease questionnaire to diagnose ibs by rome i criteria. risk factors for ibs were identified by logistic regression. results: in all, 467 subjects were eligible for the pediatric pi-ibs study cohort (47.1% female; mean age 11.6+/-2.44 years at the time of the outbreak). of these, 305 were exposed to ge (130 clinically suspected and 175 self-reported) and 162 were unexposed controls. the cumulative  incidence of ibs was significantly increased among exposed subjects vs. controls  (10.5% vs. 2.5%; odds ratio 4.6, 95% confidence interval (1.6, 13.3)). in an unadjusted risk factor analysis, ibs was associated with a shorter time interval  from exposure to assessment of ibs symptoms, female gender, diarrheal illness lasting more than 7 days, weight loss >10 lb, and antibiotic use during the outbreak. in adjusted analyses, both female gender and time interval to assessment of ibs symptoms remained independent predictors of pi-ibs. conclusions: acute bacterial gastroenteritis is associated with subsequent ibs in children as in adults. risk factors for pi-ibs in children are similar to those identified among adults. confirmation of these findings in similar cohorts is needed.

TI  == evaluation of diffusion and dilution methods to determine the antibacterial activity of plant extracts.
AB  == the aim of this study was to evaluate diffusion and dilution methods for determining the antibacterial activity of plant extracts and their mixtures. several methods for measurement of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) of  a plant extract are available, but there is no standard procedure as there is for antibiotics. we tested different plant extracts, their mixtures and phenolic acids on selected gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, and listeria monocytogenes) and gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella infantis, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli) with the disk diffusion, agar dilution, broth microdilution and macrodilution methods. the disk diffusion method was appropriate only as a preliminary screening test prior to quantitative mic determination with dilution methods. a comparison of the results for mic obtained by agar dilution and broth microdilution was possible only for gram-positive bacteria, and indicated the latter as the most accurate way of assessing the antimicrobial effect. the microdilution method with ttc (2,3,5-triphenyl tetrazolium chloride) or int (2-p-iodophenyl-3-p-nitrophenyl-5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride) to indicate the viability of aerobic bacteria was found to be the best alternative approach, while only atp determination was appropriate for microaerophilic campylobacter spp. using survival curves the kinetics of bacterial inactivation on plant extract exposure was followed for 24h and in this way the mic values determined by the microdilution method were confirmed as the concentrations of extracts that inhibited bacterial growth. we suggest evaluation of the antibacterial activity of plant extracts using the broth microdilution method as a fast screening method for mic determination and the macrodilution method at selected mic values to confirm bacterial inactivation. campylobacter spp. showed a similar sensitivity to plant extracts as the tested gram-positive bacteria, but s. infantis and e. coli o157:h7 were more resistant.

TI  == reconstitution of a functional toll-like receptor 5 binding site in campylobacter jejuni flagellin.
AB  == bacterial flagellin is important for intestinal immune homeostasis. flagellins from most species activate toll-like receptor 5 (tlr5). the principal bacterial food-borne pathogen campylobacter jejuni escapes tlr5 recognition, probably due to an alternate flagellin subunit structure. we investigated the molecular basis  of tlr5 evasion by aiming to reconstitute tlr5 stimulating activity in live c. jejuni. both native glycosylated c. jejuni flagellins (flaa and flab) and recombinant proteins purified from escherichia coli failed to activate nf-kappab  in hek293 cells expressing tlr5. introduction of multiple defined regions from salmonella flagellin into c. jejuni flaa via a recombinatorial approach revealed  three regions critical for the activation of human and mouse tlr5, including a beta-hairpin structure not previously implicated in tlr5 recognition. surprisingly, this domain was not required for the activation of chicken tlr5, indicating a selective requirement for the beta-hairpin in the recognition of mammalian tlr5. expression of the active chimeric protein in c. jejuni resulted in secreted glycosylated flagellin that induced a potent tlr5 response. overall,  our results reveal a novel structural requirement for tlr5 recognition of bacterial flagellin and exclude flagellin glycosylation as an additional mechanism of bacterial evasion of the tlr5 response.

AB  == in this study, we wished to assess the prevalence and determine the sources of three zoonotic bacterial pathogens (salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli o157:h7) in the salmon river watershed in southwestern british columbia. surface water, sewage, and animal faecal samples were collected from the watershed. selective bacterial culture and pcr techniques were used to isolate these three pathogens and indicator bacteria from these samples and characterize  them. campylobacter was the most prevalent pathogen in all samples, followed by salmonella, and e. coli o157:h7. e. coli o157:h7 and salmonella isolation rates from water, as well as faecal coliform densities correlated positively with precipitation, while campylobacter isolation rates correlated negatively with precipitation. analysis of dna extracted from water samples for the presence of bacteroides host-species markers, and comparisons of c. jejuni flaa-rflp types and salmonella serovars from faecal and water samples provided evidence that human sewage and specific domestic and wild animal species were sources of these  pathogens; however, in most cases the source could not be determined or more than one source was possible. the frequent isolation of these zoonotic pathogens in the salmon river highlights the risks to human health associated with intentional and unintentional consumption of untreated surface waters.

TI  == food-borne diseases - the challenges of 20 years ago still persist while new ones continue to emerge.
AB  == the burden of diseases caused by food-borne pathogens remains largely unknown. importantly data indicating trends in food-borne infectious intestinal disease is limited to a few industrialised countries, and even fewer pathogens. it has been  predicted that the importance of diarrhoeal disease, mainly due to contaminated food and water, as a cause of death will decline worldwide. evidence for such a downward trend is limited. this prediction presumes that improvements in the production and retail of microbiologically safe food will be sustained in the developed world and, moreover, will be rolled out to those countries of the developing world increasingly producing food for a global market. in this review  evidence is presented to indicate that the microbiological safety of food remains a dynamic situation heavily influenced by multiple factors along the food chain from farm to fork. sustaining food safety standards will depend on constant vigilance maintained by monitoring and surveillance but, with the rising importance of other food-related issues, such as food security, obesity and climate change, competition for resources in the future to enable this may be fierce. in addition the pathogen populations relevant to food safety are not static. food is an excellent vehicle by which many pathogens (bacteria, viruses/prions and parasites) can reach an appropriate colonisation site in a new host. although food production practices change, the well-recognised food-borne pathogens, such as salmonella spp. and escherichia coli, seem able to evolve to exploit novel opportunities, for example fresh produce, and even generate new public health challenges, for example antimicrobial resistance. in addition, previously unknown food-borne pathogens, many of which are zoonotic, are constantly emerging. current understanding of the trends in food-borne diseases for bacterial, viral and parasitic pathogens has been reviewed. the bacterial pathogens are exemplified by those well-recognized by policy makers; i.e. salmonella, campylobacter, e. coli and listeria monocytogenes. antimicrobial resistance in several bacterial food-borne pathogens (salmonella, campylobacter,  shigella and vibrio spp., methicillin resistant staphylcoccus aureas, e. coli and enterococci) has been discussed as a separate topic because of its relative importance to policy issues. awareness and surveillance of viral food-borne pathogens is generally poor but emphasis is placed on norovirus, hepatitis a, rotaviruses and newly emerging viruses such as sars. many food-borne parasitic pathogens are known (for example ascaris, cryptosporidia and trichinella) but few of these are effectively monitored in foods, livestock and wildlife and their epidemiology through the food-chain is poorly understood. the lessons learned and future challenges in each topic are debated. it is clear that one overall challenge is the generation and maintenance of constructive dialogue and collaboration between public health, veterinary and food safety experts, bringing together multidisciplinary skills and multi-pathogen expertise. such collaboration is essential to monitor changing trends in the well-recognised diseases and detect emerging pathogens. it will also be necessary understand the  multiple interactions these pathogens have with their environments during transmission along the food chain in order to develop effective prevention and control strategies.

TI  == bacterial enteritis as a risk factor for childhood intussusception: a retrospective cohort study.
AB  == objective: to assess the relationship between bacterial enteritis and intussusception. study design: the patient administration systems and biostatistics activity database from january 2002 to december 2005 was examined for clinic visits or hospital admission to a department of defense medical facility for children age 0-5 years. the study included the international statistical classification of diseases and related health problems diagnosis-related group (drg) codes for infections with yersinia enterocolitica,  escherichia coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and campylobacter. identified patients were then assessed for the intussusception drg code for 0-180 days postinfection. the total number of children enrolled in military treatment facilities in the same age group (denominator) was obtained. results: bacterial enteritis significantly increased the relative risk of intussusception. an increased risk was found following infection with salmonella, e coli, shigella, and campylobacter. the relative risk for intussusception following any bacterial  enteritis was 40.6 (95% confidence interval = 28.6-57.5; p < .0001). conclusions: bacterial enteritis is a significant risk factor for the subsequent development of intussusception in children.

TI  == presence of zoonotic pathogens in physico-chemically characterized manures from hog finishing houses using different production systems.
AB  == hog production has been intensified in eastern canada, by 50% over the last 20years. wastes are now managed with conventional production systems (slatted floor), litter systems or source separation systems. we studied the presence of total and fecal coliforms, campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus,  escherichia coli, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica, giardia and cryptosporidium in the manure of all of these production systems. the concentrations of the studied zoonotic pathogens did not differ between the conventional and the litter systems investigated. the source separation system yielded separated solid and liquid fractions. total and fecal coliforms, c. perfringens, enterococcus, e. coli, and y. enterocolitica were found in the solids and the liquid fractions of a source separation system.campylobacter species were not detected in the liquid fractions. zoonotic pathogens are therefore, found in the manure of eastern canadian hog finishing houses equipped  either with conventional, sawdust litter or source separation systems. pathogens  inactivation will require changes in manure management practices or the use of manure disinfection methods.

TI  == cesarean delivery and risk of intestinal bacterial infection.
AB  == background: an individual's intestinal bacterial flora is established soon after  birth. delivery by cesarean section (c-section) deprives the newborn of colonization with maternal vaginal bacteria. we determined whether delivery by c-section is associated with an altered risk of infection with intestinal bacterial pathogens. methods: in a cohort of 1.7 million danes born 1973-2005 we  identified cases of laboratory-confirmed non-typhoidal salmonella species, campylobacter species, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella species, and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli from 1991-2005 in the national registry of enteric pathogens. using poisson-regression we estimated confounder-adjusted incidence rate ratios (irrs) for infection according to mode of delivery. results: during 14.0 million person-years of follow-up, 22,486 individuals were diagnosed with 1 intestinal bacterial infection. c-section was associated with a  small increase in risk at age 1 to <2 years (irr, 1.09; 95% confidence interval,  1.00-1.18) and at age 2 to <5 years (irr, 1.08; 95% confidence interval, 1.00-1.17), but after age 5 years, there was no significant association. assuming causality only 0.62% of intestinal bacterial infections were attributable to c-section. conclusions: mode of delivery appears not to be a clinically relevant  determinant of risk for intestinal bacterial infections. the possible impact of increasing frequencies of c-section on the overall burden of intestinal bacterial infections appears negligible.

TI  == campylobacteriosis and other bacterial gastrointestinal diseases in sofia, bulgaria for the period 1987-2008.
AB  == campylobacter is the most commonly reported enteric bacterial pathogen in humans. we still do not have any systematic data concerning campylobacteriosis in bulgaria. for that reason, we present data of the thermophilic campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli in the aetiology of diarrhoeal diseases in sofia, for the period from 1987 to 2008. the study included patients from 0 to over 65 years-old. a total of 51,607 faecal specimens were screened for campylobacter. c. jejuni and c. coli were detected in 3.58% (1,847) of the strains, with the highest percentage in 1988 (7.5%) and the lowest in 2006 (0.3%). campylobacteriosis occurred most frequently in the wet months of march, april, may and june, with 105, 102, 124 and 141 cases, respectively, and was rare in january with 25 cases. the most affected groups were children between 0 and 4 years of age (52%) and between five and 14 years of age (30%). campylobacter infection occurred in 22% of all bacterial gastrointestinal diseases in the city  of sofia during the study period. salmonella was the most frequently identified pathogen with 32%, followed by shigella (30%), campylobacter (22%) and diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli (16%). the study shows that campylobacter plays an important role as a bacterial cause of enterocolitis in sofia, bulgaria.

TI  == extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli in patients with travellers' diarrhoea.
AB  == the identification of patients carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing bacteria is important, since these patients are at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical therapy if they become infected. the purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of esbl-producing bacteria in patients with travellers' diarrhoea. patients with travellers' diarrhoea (n = 242) having delivered stool samples for the diagnosis of salmonella, shigella, yersinia or campylobacter, were also examined for esbl-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis. the overall prevalence of faecal carriage of esbl-producing bacteria was 24% (58/242). of the patients who  had travelled in europe, 3% (2/63) were found to be esbl carriers in comparison to 36% (50/138) of those who had travelled outside europe. esbl-producing e. coli was especially common among patients returning from india (11/14), egypt (19/38;  50%) and thailand (8/38; 22%). in total, 90% of the genes of the esbl-positive samples were of ctx-m type. the ctx-m-1 group dominated, followed by the ctx-m-9  group. the repetitive sequence-based pcr fingerprint pattern showed that there was no similarity between the esbl strains found. patients who have travelled outside europe are at high risk of being colonized with esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae, and, if infected, are also at risk of receiving inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy.

TI  == complete genome sequence and comparative metabolic profiling of the prototypical  enteroaggregative escherichia coli strain 042.
AB  == background: escherichia coli can experience a multifaceted life, in some cases acting as a commensal while in other cases causing intestinal and/or extraintestinal disease. several studies suggest enteroaggregative e. coli are the predominant cause of e. coli-mediated diarrhea in the developed world and are second only to campylobacter sp. as a cause of bacterial-mediated diarrhea. furthermore, enteroaggregative e. coli are a predominant cause of persistent diarrhea in the developing world where infection has been associated with malnourishment and growth retardation. methods: in this study we determined the complete genomic sequence of e. coli 042, the prototypical member of the enteroaggregative e. coli, which has been shown to cause disease in volunteer studies. we performed genomic and phylogenetic comparisons with other e. coli strains revealing previously uncharacterised virulence factors including a variety of secreted proteins and a capsular polysaccharide biosynthetic locus. in addition, by using biolog phenotype microarrays we have provided a full metabolic profiling of e. coli 042 and the non-pathogenic lab strain e. coli k-12. we have  highlighted the genetic basis for many of the metabolic differences between e. coli 042 and e. coli k-12. conclusion: this study provides a genetic context for  the vast amount of experimental and epidemiological data published thus far and provides a template for future diagnostic and intervention strategies.

TI  == the application of food safety interventions in primary production of beef and lamb: a review.
AB  == the production of safe red meat depends on effective control of pathogenic microorganisms at all stages of the "farm-to-fork" chain. eight microorganisms have been selected as the focus of the pathogencombat project: shiga toxin producing escherichia coli (stec), mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (map), listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, penicillium nordicum, invasive variants of saccharomyces cerevisiae, hepatitis e virus and tick borne encephalitis virus. the need and potential for coordinated control of  the selected food-borne pathogens by on-farm interventions is assessed using a decision tree and a review of the relevant scientific literature. control measures to reduce the carriage of these pathogens in ruminants prior to slaughter are reviewed with reference to the current regulations and guidelines relating to the primary production. from the eight pathogens investigated, two (stec and map), are likely to be effectively controlled by interventions at farm  level and the applicable interventions are described and discussed. ruminants are the main reservoir for these two pathogens; hence a reduction of carriage in livestock should directly reduce human exposure through the consumption of beef and lamb.

TI  == osteoradionecrosis contains a wide variety of cultivable and non-cultivable bacteria.
AB  == background: direct microscopy, anaerobic culture and dna-dna hybridization have previously demonstrated an association between microorganisms and osteoradionecrosis (orn). the purpose of our study was to use culture independent molecular techniques to detect bacteria in necrotic bone lesions of the mandible  after radiation therapy. design: bacterial dna was extracted from eight deep medullar specimens from resected mandibles (six cases), including one patient with relapse. 16s rrna genes were pcr amplified, cloned, transformed into escherichia coli and sequenced to determine species identity and closest relatives. results: from the analysis of 438 clones, 59 predominant species were  detected, 27% of which have not been cultivated. the predominant species detected from radionecrotic mandibles were campylobacter gracilis, streptococcus intermedius, peptostreptococcus sp. oral clone fg014, uncultured bacterium clone  rl178, fusobacterium nucleatum, and prevotella spp. the study demonstrated intersubject variability of the bacteria present in orn. in contrast to the diverse bacterial profile detected in primary infection, only a few members of the oral indigenous flora were identified from the relapse case. conclusions: diverse bacterial profiles in specimens of orn in marrow spaces of the mandible were detected by culture independent molecular techniques. to better understand the pathogenesis and to improve the therapy of the infection, detection of all members of the complex bacterial flora associated with orn is necessary.

TI  == distribution and diversity of escherichia coli populations in the south nation river drainage basin, eastern ontario, canada.
AB  == we investigated the prevalence and diversity of escherichia coli strains isolated from surface waters from multiple watersheds within the south nation river basin  in eastern ontario, canada. the basin is composed of mixed but primarily agricultural land uses. from march 2004 to november 2007, a total of 2,004 surface water samples were collected from 24 sampling sites. e. coli densities ranged from undetectable to 1.64 x 10(5) cfu 100 ml(-1) and were correlated with  stream order and proximity to livestock production systems. the diversity of 21,307 e. coli isolates was characterized using repetitive extragenic palindromic pcr (rep-pcr), allowing for the identification of as many as 7,325 distinct genotypes, without capturing all of the diversity. the community was temporally and spatially dominated by a few dominant genotypes (clusters of more than 500 isolates) and several genotypes of intermediary abundance (clustering between 10  and 499 isolates). simpson diversity indices, assessed on a normalized number of  isolates per sample, ranged from 0.050 to 0.668. simpson indices could be statistically discriminated on the basis of year and stream order, but land use,  discharge, weather, and water physical-chemical properties were not statistically important discriminators. the detection of campylobacter species was associated with statistically lower simpson indices (greater diversity; p < 0.05). waterborne e. coli isolates from genotypes of dominant and intermediary abundance were clustered with isolates obtained from fecal samples collected in the study area over the same period, and 90% of the isolates tested proved to share genotypes with fecal isolates. overall, our data indicated that the densities and distribution of e. coli in these mixed-use watersheds were linked to stream order and livestock-based land uses. waterborne e. coli populations that were distinct  from fecal isolates were detected and, on this basis, were possibly naturalized e. coli strains.

TI  == development and evaluation of an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of antibodies against campylobacter fetus in cattle.
AB  == campylobacteriosis is a zoonosis that occurs worldwide. infection with campylobacter fetus (c. fetus) causes infertility and abortion in sheep and cattle. the current study focuses on the sapa gene of c. fetus that encodes surface array proteins and plays an important role in the virulence of c. fetus.  the sapa-n (1398bp) and sapa-c (1422bp) fragments were amplified from the c. fetussapa gene using polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and the corresponding recombinant proteins rsapa-n and rsapa-c were expressed in escherichia. coli bl21 cells. results of western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa)  showed that the immunological activity of rsapa-n was higher than that of rsapa-c (p<0.05). therefore, rsapa-n was selected to establish an indirect elisa for detecting antibodies against c. fetus. the diagnostic criteria were as follows: s/p0.45: positive; s/p<0.4: negative; 0.45>s/p0.4: suspected. the specificity and sensitivity of our method were 94.3% and 88.6%, respectively. moreover, no cross-reactions were observed between rsapa-n and serum samples that were positive for other bovine bacterial pathogens diseases such as mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis. one hundred and two serum samples from cows that had experienced abortion were tested. four and 2 c. fetus-positive serum samples were found among the 70 bovine brucellosis-positive samples and the 32 infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (ibr)-positive samples, respectively. the findings suggest that the rsapa-n-based elisa method has immense potential in future applications.

TI  == identification and characterization of the aspartate chemosensory receptor of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a highly motile bacterium that responds via chemotaxis to environmental stimuli to migrate towards favourable conditions. previous in silico analysis of the c. jejuni strain nctc11168 genome sequence identified 10 open reading frames, tlp1-10, that encode putative chemosensory receptors. we describe the characterization of the role and specificity of the tlp1 chemoreceptor (cj1506c). in vitro and in vivo models were used to determine if tlp1 had a role in host colonization. the tlp1(-) isogenic mutant was more adherent in cell culture, however, showed reduced colonization ability in chickens. specific interactions between the purified sensory domain of tlp1 and l-aspartate were identified using an amino acid array and saturation transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. chemotaxis assays showed differences between migration of wild-type c. jejuni cells and that of a tlp1(-)  isogenic mutant, specifically towards aspartate. furthermore, using yeast two-hybrid and three-hybrid systems for analysis of protein-protein interactions, the cytoplasmic signalling domain of tlp1 was found to preferentially interact with chev, rather than the chew homologue of the chemotaxis signalling pathway; this interaction was confirmed using immune precipitation assays. this is the first identification of an aspartate receptor in bacteria other than escherichia  coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.

TI  == nucleases encoded by the integrated elements cjie2 and cjie4 inhibit natural transformation of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the species campylobacter jejuni is naturally competent for dna uptake; nevertheless, nonnaturally transformable strains do exist. for a subset of strains we previously showed that a periplasmic dnase, encoded by dns, inhibits natural transformation in c. jejuni. in the present study, genetic factors coding for dnase activity in the absence of dns were identified. dna arrays indicated that nonnaturally transformable dns-negative strains contain putative dna/rna nonspecific endonucleases encoded by cje0566 and cje1441 of strain rm1221. these  genes are located on c. jejuni integrated elements 2 and 4. expression of cje0566 and cje1441 from strain rm1221 and a homologous gene from strain 07479 in dnase-negative escherichia coli and c. jejuni strains indicated that these genes  code for dnases. genetic transfer of the genes to a naturally transformable c. jejuni strain resulted in a decreased efficiency of natural transformation. modeling suggests that the c. jejuni dnases belong to the serratia nuclease family. overall, the data indicate that the acquisition of prophage-encoded dna/rna nonspecific endonucleases inhibits the natural transformability of c. jejuni through hydrolysis of dna.

TI  == antimicrobial drug use and antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria among cattle from alberta feedlots.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to determine whether antimicrobial resistance (amr) in foodborne pathogens (escherichia coli o157, salmonella, and campylobacter) and non-type-specific e. coli obtained from fecal samples of feedlot cattle was associated with antimicrobial drug (amd) use. a secondary objective was to determine if amr in non-type-specific e. coli could be used as a predictor of amr in foodborne pathogens. fecal samples were collected from pen floors in 21 alberta feedlots during march through december 2004, and resistance prevalence was estimated by season (spring, fall) and cattle type (fewest days-on-feed and closest to slaughter). amd exposures were obtained by calculating therapeutic animal daily doses for each drug before sampling from feedlot records. generalized linear mixed models were used to investigate the relationship between each amr and amd use. non-type-specific e. coli was commonly recovered from fecal samples (88.62%), and the highest prevalence of resistance was found toward tetracycline (53%), streptomycin (28%), and sulfadiazine (48%). campylobacter jejuni was recovered from 55.3% of the fecal samples, and resistance was generally less for the drugs that were evaluated (doxycycline 38.1%, ciprofloxacin 2.6%, nalidixic acid 1.64%, erythromycin 1.2%). e. coli o157 and salmonella were recovered much less frequently (7% and 1% prevalence, respectively). the prevalence of recovery for the bacteria studied varied between seasons and cattle types, as did patterns of amr. among non-type-specific e. coli, resistance to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfadiazine was found to be  positively associated with in-feed exposure as well as injectable tetracycline, but these differences were relatively small and of questionable practical relevance. among c. jejuni isolates, cattle type was significantly associated with doxycycline resistance. results suggested that resistance in non-type-specific e. coli to chloramphenicol, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and  tetracycline might be used as predictors of resistance to these drugs in e. coli  o157 recovered from the same fecal samples.

TI  == mass spectrometric characterization of the campylobacter jejuni adherence factor  cadf reveals post-translational processing that removes immunogenicity while retaining fibronectin binding.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major gastrointestinal pathogen that colonizes host mucosa via interactions with extracellular matrix proteins, such as fibronectin (fn). fn-binding is mediated by a 37 kda outer membrane protein termed campylobacter adherence factor (cadf). the outer membrane protein profile of a recent gastrointestinal c. jejuni clinical isolate (jhh1) was analysed using 2-de and ms. several spots were identified as products of the cadf gene. these included mass and pi variants of 34 and 30 kda, as well as 24 kda (cadf(24)) and  22 kda (cadf(22)) mass variants. cadf variants were fully characterized by maldi-tof ms and maldi-ms/ms. these data confirmed that cadf forms re-folding variants resulting in spots with lower mass and varying pi that are identical at  the amino acid sequence level and are not modified post-translationally. cadf(22) and cadf(24), however, were characterized as n-terminal, membrane-associated polypeptides resulting from cleavage between serine(195) and leucine(196), and glycine(201) and phenylalanine(202), respectively. these variants were more abundant in the virulent (o) isolate of c. jejuni nctc11168 when compared with the avirulent (genome sequenced) isolate. hexahistidine fusion constructs of full-length cadf (34 kda), cadf(24), and the deleted c-terminal ompa domain (14 kda; cadf(14)) were created in escherichia coli. recombinant cadf variants were probed against patient sera and revealed that only full-length cadf retained reactivity. binding assays showed that cadf(24) retained fn-binding capability, while cadf(14) did not bind fn. these data suggest that the immunogenic epitope of cadf is cleaved to generate smaller fn-binding polypeptides, which are not recognized by the host humoral response. cadf cleavage therefore may be associated with virulence in c. jejuni.

AB  == background: diarrhea is highly prevalent in racing sled dogs, although the underlying causes are poorly understood. hypothesis: clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (cpe) and clostridium difficile toxin a and b are associated with diarrhea in racing sled dogs. animals: one hundred and thirty-five sled dogs. methods: freshly voided feces were obtained from 55 dogs before racing and from 80 dogs after 400 miles of racing. samples were visually scored for diarrhea, mucus, blood, and melena. cpe and c. difficile toxin a and b were detected by elisa. samples were cultured for c. perfringens, c. difficile, campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli o157; giardia and cryptosporidium spp. were detected via immunofluorescence. results: diarrhea occurred in 36% of dogs during racing, and hematochezia, fecal mucus or melena, or all 3 occurred in 57.5% of dogs. salmonella was isolated from 78.2% of dogs before racing, and from 71.3% of dogs during racing. c. perfringens and c. difficile were isolated from 100 and 58.2% of dogs before racing, and from 95 and 36.3% of dogs during racing. dogs were more likely to test positive for cpe during than before racing (18.8 versus  5.5%, p = .021); however, no enteropathogens or their respective toxins were significantly associated with hematochezia or diarrhea. conclusions and clinical  importance: sled dogs participating in long distance racing have a high prevalence of diarrhea and hematochezia that is not associated with common enteropathogens. it is possible that diarrhea and hematochezia represent the effect of prolonged exercise on the gastrointestinal tract.

AB  == escherichia coli strain o157 produces an o-antigen with the repeating tetrasaccharide unit alpha-d-pernac-alpha-l-fuc-beta-d-glc-alpha-d-galnac, preassembled on undecaprenyl pyrophosphate (und-p-p). these studies were conducted to determine whether the biosynthesis of the lipid-linked repeating tetrasaccharide was initiated by the formation of galnac-p-p-und by weca. when membrane fractions from e. coli strains k12, o157, and pr4019, a weca-overexpressing strain, were incubated with udp-[3h]galnac, neither the enzymatic synthesis of [3h]glcnac-p-p-und nor [3h]galnac-p-p-und was detected. however, when membrane fractions from strain o157 were incubated with udp-[3h]glcnac, two enzymatically labeled products were observed with the chemical and chromatographic properties of [3h]glcnac-p-p-und and [3h]galnac-p-p-und, suggesting that strain o157 contained an epimerase capable of interconverting glcnac-p-p-und and galnac-p-p-und. the presence of a novel epimerase was demonstrated by showing that exogenous [3h]glcnac-p-p-und was converted to [3h]galnac-p-p-und when incubated with membranes from strain o157. when strain o157 was metabolically labeled with [3h]glcnac, both [3h]glcnac-p-p-und and [3h]galnac-p-p-und were detected. transformation of e. coli strain 21546 with the z3206 gene enabled these cells to synthesize galnac-p-p-und in vivo and in vitro. the reversibility of the epimerase reaction  was demonstrated by showing that [3h]glcnac-p-p-und was reformed when membranes from strain o157 were incubated with exogenous [3h]galnac-p-p-und. the inability  of z3206 to complement the loss of the gne gene in the expression of the campylobacter jejuni n-glycosylation system in e. coli indicated that it does not function as a udp-glcnac/udp-galnac epimerase. based on these results, galnac-p-p-und is synthesized reversibly by a novel glcnac-p-p-und epimerase after the formation of glcnac-p-p-und by weca in e. coli o157.

TI  == substrate specificity of three cytochrome c haem lyase isoenzymes from wolinella  succinogenes: unconventional haem c binding motifs are not sufficient for haem c  attachment by nrfi and ccsa1.
AB  == bacterial c-type cytochrome maturation is dependent on a complex enzymic machinery. the key reaction is catalysed by cytochrome c haem lyase (cchl) that usually forms two thioether bonds to attach haem b to the cysteine residues of a  haem c binding motif (hbm) which is, in most cases, a cx(2)ch sequence. here, the hbm specificity of three distinct cchl isoenzymes (nrfi, ccsa1 and ccsa2) from the epsilonproteobacterium wolinella succinogenes was investigated using either w. succinogenes or escherichia coli as host organism. several reporter c-type cytochromes were employed including cytochrome c nitrite reductases (nrfa) from e. coli and campylobacter jejuni that differ in their active-site hbms (cx(2)ck or cx(2)ch). w. succinogenes ccsa2 was found to attach haem to standard cx(2)ch motifs in various cytochromes whereas other hbms were not recognized. nrfi was able to attach haem c to the active-site cx(2)ck motif of both w. succinogenes and e. coli nrfa, but not to nrfa from c. jejuni. different apo-cytochrome variants carrying the cx(15)ch motif, assumed to be recognized by ccsa1 during maturation of the octahaem cytochrome mcca, were not processed by ccsa1 in either w. succinogenes or e. coli. it is concluded that the dedicated cchls nrfi and ccsa1 attach haem to non-standard hbms only in the presence of further, as yet uncharacterized structural features. interestingly, it proved impossible to delete the ccsa2 gene from the w. succinogenes genome, a finding that is discussed in the light of the available genomic, proteomic and functional data on w. succinogenes c-type cytochromes.

TI  == molybdenum and tungsten in campylobacter jejuni: their physiological role and identification of separate transporters regulated by a single mode-like protein.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important human pathogen that causes millions of cases of food-borne enteritis each year. the c. jejuni respiratory chain is highly branched and contains at least four enzymes predicted to contain a metal binding  pterin (mpt), with the metal being either molybdenum or tungsten. also predicted  are two separate transport systems, one for molybdenum encoded by modabc and a second for tungsten encoded by tupabc. both transport systems were mutated and the activities of the four predicted mpt-containing enzymes were assayed in the presence of molybdenum and tungsten in wild-type and mod and tup backgrounds. results indicate that mod is primarily a molybdenum transporter that can also transport tungsten, while tup is a tungsten-specific transporter. the mpt containing enzymes nitrate reductase, sulphite oxidase, and sn oxide reductase are strict molybdoenzymes while formate dehydrogenase prefers tungsten. a mode-like protein regulates both transporters, repressing mod in the presence of  both molybdenum and tungsten and tup only in the presence of tungsten. like other mode proteins, the c. jejuni mode binds dna through a helix-turn-helix dna binding domain, but unlike other members of the mode family it does not have a metal binding domain.

TI  == development of a dna microarray to detect antimicrobial resistance genes identified in the national center for biotechnology information database.
AB  == to understand the mechanisms and epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance (ar), the genetic elements responsible must be identified. due to the myriad of possible genes, a high-density genotyping technique is needed for initial screening. to achieve this, ar genes in the national center for biotechnology information genbank database were identified by their annotations and compiled into a nonredundant list of 775 genes. a dna microarray was constructed of 70mer  oligonucelotide probes designed to detect these genes encoding resistances to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, chloramphenicols, glycopeptides, heavy metals, lincosamides, macrolides, metronidazoles, polyketides, quaternary ammonium compounds, streptogramins, sulfonamides, tetracyclines, and trimethoprims as well as resistance transfer genes. the microarray was validated with two fully sequenced control strains of salmonella enterica: typhimurium lt2 (sensitive) and typhi ct18 (multidrug resistance [mdr]). all resistance genes encoded on the mdr  plasmid, phcm1, harbored by ct18 were detected in that strain, whereas no resistance genes were detected in lt2. the microarray was also tested with a variety of bacteria, including mdr salmonella enterica serovars, escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, listeria spp., and clostridium difficile. the results presented here demonstrate that a microarray can be designed to detect virtually all ar genes found in the national center for biotechnology information database, thus reducing the subsequent assays necessary to identify specific resistance gene alleles.

TI  == the epidemiology of travelers' diarrhea in incirlik, turkey: a region with a predominance of heat-stabile toxin producing enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
AB  == this study evaluated travelers' diarrhea among us military personnel on short-term deployment to incirlik air base, turkey, from june through september 2002. upon reporting for care for travelers' diarrhea, subjects were enrolled into the study and completed a series of questionnaires and provided stool specimens for pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. fifty-three percent of the 202 participating subjects had a pathogen isolated from their stool. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) was the predominant pathogen (41%), followed by campylobacter spp. (12%). the most common etec phenotype recovered was stable toxin (st) cs6 (47% of all etec). most (91.1%) of  the cases presented with water diarrhea regardless of isolated pathogen. however, there were some differences in nongastrointestinal symptoms among subjects with campylobacter spp. all illnesses were well managed with antibiotics with or without loperamide with a median time to the last unformed stool of 9 h (interquartile range, 1-32 h). we found no food or environmental factors associated with a differential risk of infection with a specific pathogen. travelers' diarrhea among a us military population in and around incirlik, turkey, can commonly be attributed to etec and campylobacter spp. the high proportion of st-only-producing cs6 etec in this region highlights the pathogen's worldwide diversity. future studies of travelers' diarrhea in this population should adapt more novel microbiologic techniques such as polymerase chain reaction and enhanced culture methods to increase the likelihood of identifying pathogenic e. coli.

TI  == isolation of enteric pathogens from bats in trinidad.
AB  == bats are one of the most widely distributed mammals in the world, and they are reservoirs or carriers of several zoonoses. bats were trapped in 27 geographic locations across trinidad and tobago, and following euthanasia, gastrointestinal  tracts were aseptically removed. contents were subjected to bacteriologic analysis to detect salmonella spp., escherichia coli, and campylobacter spp. isolates of salmonella were serotyped, and e. coli isolates were screened for o157 strains and antimicrobial sensitivity to eight antimicrobial agents; phenotypic characteristics also were determined. of 377 tested bats, representing 12 species, four bats (1.1%) were positive for samonella spp, 49 (13.0%) were positive for e. coli, and no bats were positive for e. coli o157 strain or campylobacter spp. isolated serotypes of salmonella included rubislaw and molade, both from noctilio leporinus, a fish-eating bat, caracas recovered from molossus  major, and salmonella group i from molossus ater, both insect-eating bats. of the 49 isolates of e. coli tested, 40 (82%) exhibited resistance to one or more antimicrobial agents, and the prevalence of resistant strains was comparatively high to erythromycin (61%) and streptomycin (27%) but lower to gentamycin (0%) and sulphamethozaxole/trimethoprim (2%).

TI  == wild boars as an important reservoir for foodborne pathogens.
AB  == one hundred fifty-three wild boars shot in the canton of geneva, switzerland, were studied for the occurrence of foodborne pathogens. tonsils and fecal samples of the animals were examined using real-time polymerase chain reaction, enzyme-linked fluorescent immunoassay, and cultural methods. the detection rate of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, stx-positive escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes was 12%, 35%, 20%, 9%,  and 17%, respectively, when tonsil samples were studied. only y. enterocolitica (5%) and l. monocytogenes (1%) were detected in fecal samples. none of the samples was positive for campylobacter spp. females (71%) and young animals (61%) carried more frequently one or more pathogens than males (53%) and older ones (44%). in total, 8 salmonella spp., 14 y. enterocolitica, 4 y. pseudotuberculosis, and 26 l. monocytogenes strains were further characterized. most of the salmonella spp. strains were of serotype salmonella enteritidis (75%) followed by serotypes salmonella stourbridge (13%) and salmonella veneziana (13%). l. monocytogenes strains belonged to serotypes 1/2a (42%), 1/2b (19%), and 4b (38%). serotypes o:3 (36%), o:5,27 (21%), and o:9 (29%) were identified among  y. enterocolitica strains and serotypes o:1 (75%) and o:2 (25%) among y. pseudotuberculosis strains. this study shows that wild boars are frequent carriers of foodborne pathogens. high wild boar densities and increasing popularity of outdoor ranging of pigs may intensify the risk of transmission of these pathogens to fattening pigs.

TI  == fluorescence spectroscopy for rapid detection and classification of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == this study deals with the rapid detection and differentiation of escherichia coli, salmonella, and campylobacter, which are the most commonly identified commensal and pathogenic bacteria in foods, using fluorescence spectroscopy and multivariate analysis. each bacterial sample cultured under controlled conditions was diluted in physiologic saline for analysis. fluorescence spectra were collected over a range of 200-700 nm with 0.5 nm intervals on the perkinelmer fluorescence spectrometer. the synchronous scan technique was employed to find the optimum excitation (lambda(ex)) and emission (lambda(em)) wavelengths for individual bacteria with the wavelength interval (deltalambda) being varied from  10 to 200 nm. the synchronous spectra and two-dimensional plots showed two maximum lambda(ex) values at 225 nm and 280 nm and one maximum lambda(em) at 335-345 nm (lambda(em) = lambda(ex) + deltalambda), which correspond to the lambda(ex) = 225 nm, deltalambda = 110-120 nm, and lambda(ex) = 280 nm, deltalambda = 60-65 nm. for all three bacterial genera, the same synchronous scan results were obtained. the emission spectra from the three bacteria groups were very similar, creating difficulty in classification. however, the application of  principal component analysis (pca) to the fluorescence spectra resulted in successful classification of the bacteria by their genus as well as determining their concentration. the detection limit was approximately 10(3)-10(4) cells/ml for each bacterial sample. these results demonstrated that fluorescence spectroscopy, when coupled with pca processing, has the potential to detect and to classify bacterial pathogens in liquids. the methodology is rapid (>10 min), inexpensive, and requires minimal sample preparation compared to standard analytical methods for bacterial detection.

TI  == bacterial infections: new and emerging enteric pathogens.
AB  == purpose of review: the aim of this review is to highlight recent advances in knowledge of bacterial enteric infections. we focus on understanding of enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni infections, and to link these acute events with long-term consequences in a susceptible host, including irritable bowel syndrome and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. recent findings: enterohemorrhagic e. coli and c. jejuni are zoonotic infections  that are acquired from exposure to tainted food (undercooked hamburger and chicken, respectively) and contaminated drinking water. noninvasive e. coli o157:h7 elaborates shiga-like toxins and protein effectors that are injected, via a molecular syringe that is encoded by a bacterial type 3 secretion system, into  infected eukaryotic cells. less is known about the precise virulence properties of enteroinvasive campylobacter strains, but both enteric pathogens are able to disrupt polarized epithelial monolayers resulting in increased uptake of macromolecules and antigens. summary: an improved understanding of the epidemiology, pathobiology and mechanisms underlying infectious enterocolitides will provide the basis for developing new intervention strategies including, for  example, the use of probiotics, to interrupt the infectious process.

TI  == characterization of a bifunctional pyranose-furanose mutase from campylobacter jejuni 11168.
AB  == udp-galactopyranose mutases (ugm) are the enzymes responsible for the synthesis of udp-galactofuranose (udp-galf) from udp-galactopyranose (udp-galp). the enzyme, encoded by the glf gene, is present in bacteria, parasites, and fungi that express galf in their glycoconjugates. recently, a ugm homologue encoded by  the cj1439 gene has been identified in campylobacter jejuni 11168, an organism possessing no galf-containing glycoconjugates. however, the capsular polysaccharide from this strain contains a 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-d-galactofuranose  (galfnac) moiety. using an in vitro high performance liquid chromatography assay  and complementation studies, we characterized the activity of this ugm homologue. the enzyme, which we have renamed udp-n-acetylgalactopyranose mutase (ungm), has  relaxed specificity and can use either udp-gal or udp-galnac as a substrate. complementation studies of mutase knock-outs in c. jejuni 11168 and escherichia coli w3110, the latter containing galf residues in its lipopolysaccharide, demonstrated that the enzyme recognizes both udp-gal and udp-galnac in vivo. a homology model of ungm and site-directed mutagenesis led to the identification of two active site amino acid residues involved in the recognition of the udp-galnac substrate. the specificity of ungm was characterized using a two-substrate co-incubation assay, which demonstrated, surprisingly, that udp-gal is a better substrate than udp-galnac.

TI  == antibiotic resistant bacterial profiles of anaerobic swine lagoon effluent.
AB  == although land application of swine (sus scrofa) manure lagoon effluent is a common and effective method of disposal, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, both pathogenic and commensal can complicate already understood issues  associated with its safe disposal. the aim of this study was to assess antibiotic resistance in swine lagoon bacteria from sow, nursery, and finisher farms in the  southeastern united states. effluents from 37 lagoons were assayed for the presence of escherichia coli, campylobacter, listeria, and salmonella. antibiotic resistance profiles were determined by the kirby-bauer swab method for 12 antibiotics comprising eight classes. statistical analyses indicated that farm type influenced the amount and type of resistance, with nurseries and sow farms ranking as most influential, perhaps due to use of more antibiotic treatments. finisher farms tended to have the least amount of antibiotic class resistance, signaling an overall healthier market pig, and less therapeutic or prophylactic antibiotic use. many bacterial isolates were resistant to penicillin, cephalosporin, and tetracycline class antibiotics, while nearly all were susceptible to quinolone antibiotics. it appeared that swine farm type had a significant association with the amount of resistance associated with bacterial genera sampled from the lagoons; nurseries contributed the largest amount of bacterial resistance.

TI  == characterization of selected nutrients and bacteria from anaerobic swine manure lagoons on sow, nursery, and finisher farms in the mid-south usa.
AB  == swine (sus scrofa domestica) production in the mid-south usa comprises sow, nursery, and finisher farms. a 2007 packing plant closure started a regional shift from finisher to sow and nursery farms. changes in manure stored in lagoons and land-applied as fertilizer were expected but were unknown because nutrient and bacterial levels had not been characterized by farm type. the objectives of this study were to quantify selected nutrients and bacteria, compare levels by farm types, and project impacts of production shifts. nutrients and bacteria were characterized in 17 sow, 10 nursery, and 10 finisher farm lagoons. total and thermotolerant coliforms, escherichia coli (migula) castellani and chalmers, enterococcus spp., clostridium perfringens (veillon and zuber) hauduroy et al., campylobacter spp., listeria spp., and salmonella spp. were evaluated. highest levels were from total coliforms (1.4- 5.7x10(5) cfu 100 ml(-1)), which occurred  with e. coli, campylobacter spp., c. perfringens, and enterococcus spp., in every lagoon and virtually every sample. lowest levels were from listeria spp. and salmonella spp. (<or=1.3x10(2) most probable number [mpn] 100 ml(-1)), detected in 81 and 89% of lagoons and 68 and 64% of samples, respectively. sow farm levels were higher for all except listeria spp. and salmonella spp., which were lower (1.4x10(1) and 2.8x10(1) mpn 100 ml(-1), respectively) and only slightly below their respective levels from nursery farms (1.1x10(2) and 3.4x10(1) mpn 100 ml(-1)). shifting from finisher to nursery farm would not affect bacterial levels, but shifting to sows would. either shift would reduce npk and n:p and suggest modification of nutrient management plans.

TI  == age-related susceptibility to infection with diarrheagenic escherichia coli among infants from periurban areas in lima, peru.
AB  == background: diarrheagenic escherichia coli strains are being recognized as important pediatric enteropathogens worldwide. however, it is unclear whether there are differences in age-related susceptibility to specific strains, especially among infants. methods: we conducted a passive surveillance cohort study of diarrhea that involved 1034 children aged 2-12 months in lima, peru. control stool samples were collected from randomly selected children without diarrhea. all samples were analyzed for common enteric pathogens and for diarrheagenic e. coli with use of multiplex real-time polymerase chain reaction.  results: the most frequently isolated pathogens in 1065 diarrheal episodes were diarrheagenic e. coli strains (31%), including enteroaggregative (15.1%) and enteropathogenic e. coli (7.6%). diarrheagenic e. coli, campylobacter species, and rotavirus were more frequently isolated from infants aged >or=6 months. among older infants, diffusely adherent e. coli and enterotoxigenic e. coli were more frequently isolated from diarrheal samples than from control samples (p <.05). children aged >or=6 months who were infected with enterotoxigenic e. coli had a 4.56-fold increased risk of diarrhea (95% confidence interval, 1.20-17.28), compared with younger children. persistent diarrhea was more common in infants aged <6 months (13.5% vs 3.6%; p <.001). among children with diarrheagenic e. coli-positive samples, coinfections with other pathogens were more common in children with diarrhea than in control children (40.1% vs 15.6%; p <.001). conclusions: diarrheagenic e. coli strains were more frequently isolated in samples from older infants. in this setting with high frequency of pathogen exposure and high frequency of breastfeeding, we hypothesize that the major age-related differences result from decreased exposure to milk-related protective factors and from increased exposure to contaminated food and water.

AB  == while maintaining nutritional and sensorial attributes of fresh foods mild processing technologies generally deliver microbiologically perishable food products. currently little information exists on possible increase in the resistance of pathogens after repetitive exposure to mild (sub-lethal) treatments. multiple strain-cocktails of listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni were exposed to 20 consecutive cycles of sub-lethal inactivation by three different techniques. used techniques comprised  inactivation with lactic acid (la), chlorine dioxide (clo(2)) and intense light pulses (ilp). results showed that the selection of resistant cells was both species and technique dependent. while repetitive cycles of clo(2) treatment did  not result in increased resistance, repetitive inactivation with la yielded l. monocytogenes culture of higher resistance in comparison to the parental culture. the increased resistance, expressed as decreased level of reduction in bacterial  counts in subsequent inactivation cycles, was also observed with ilp for both l.  monocytogenes and e. coli o157:h7 strains. visual trend observations were confirmed through statistical linear regression analysis. no such effects were noted for c. jejuni which became undetectable after first 2-5 cycles. current findings indicate the ability of foodborne pathogens to adapt to mild bactericidal treatments creating new challenges in risk assessment and more specifically in hazard analysis.

TI  == development of an oligonucleotide-based microarray to detect multiple foodborne pathogens.
AB  == escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni are considered important pathogens causing the most food-related human illnesses worldwide. current methods for pathogen detection have limitations in the effectiveness of identifying multiple foodborne pathogens. in this study, a pathogen detection microarray was developed using various 70-mer oligonucleotides specifically targeting the above pathogens. to reduce the cost of detection, each microarray chip was designed and fabricated to accommodate 12 identical arrays which could be used for screening up to 12 different samples. to achieve high detection sensitivity and specificity, target-specific dna amplification instead of whole genome random amplification was used prior to microarray analysis. combined with 14-plex pcr amplification of target sequences, the microarray unambiguously distinguished all 4 pathogens with a detection sensitivity of 1 x 10(-4) ng (approximately 20 copies) of each genomic dna. applied the assay to 39 fresh meat samples, 16 samples were found to be contaminated by either 1 or 2 of these pathogens. the co-occurrences of salmonella and e. coli o157:h7, salmonella and l. monocytogenes in the same meat  samples were also observed. overall, the microarray combined with multiplex pcr method was able to effectively screen single or multiple pathogens in food samples and to provide important genotypic information related to pathogen virulence.

TI  == a role for tungsten in the biology of campylobacter jejuni: tungstate stimulates  formate dehydrogenase activity and is transported via an ultra-high affinity abc  system distinct from the molybdate transporter.
AB  == the food-borne pathogen campylobacter jejuni possesses no known tungstoenzymes, yet encodes two abc transporters (cj0300-0303 and cj1538-1540) homologous to bacterial molybdate (modabc) uptake systems and the tungstate transporter (tupabc) of eubacterium acidaminophilum respectively. the actual substrates and physiological role of these transporters were investigated. tryptophan fluorescence spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry of the purified periplasmic binding proteins of each system revealed that while cj0303 is unable  to discriminate between molybdate and tungstate (k(d) values for both ligands of  4-8 nm), cj1540 binds tungstate with a k(d) of 1.0 +/- 0.2 pm; 50 000-fold more tightly than molybdate. induction-coupled plasma mass spectroscopy of single and  double mutants showed that this large difference in affinity is reflected in a lower cellular tungsten content in a cj1540 (tupa) mutant compared with a cj0303c (moda) mutant. surprisingly, formate dehydrogenase (fdh) activity was decreased approximately 50% in the tupa strain, and supplementation of the growth medium with tungstate significantly increased fdh activity in the wild type, while inhibiting known molybdoenzymes. our data suggest that c. jejuni possesses a specific, ultra-high affinity tungstate transporter that supplies tungsten for incorporation into fdh. furthermore, possession of two moea paralogues may explain the formation of both molybdopterin and tungstopterin in this bacterium.

AB  == this study assessed the levels of two key pathogens, salmonella and campylobacter, along with the indicator organism escherichia coli in aerosols within and outside poultry sheds. the study ranged over a 3-year period on four poultry farms and consisted of six trials across the boiler production cycle of around 55 days. weekly testing of litter and aerosols was carried out through the cycle. a key point that emerged is that the levels of airborne bacteria are linked to the levels of these bacteria in litter. this hypothesis was demonstrated by e. coli. the typical levels of e. coli in litter were approximately 10(8) cfu g(-1) and, as a consequence, were in the range of 10(2) to 10(4) cfu m(-3) in aerosols, both inside and outside the shed. the external levels were always lower than the internal levels. salmonella was only present intermittently in litter and at lower levels (10(3) to 10(5) most probable number [mpn] g(-1)) and consequently present only intermittently and at low levels in air inside (range of 0.65 to 4.4 mpn m(-3)) and once outside (2.3 mpn m(-3)). the salmonella serovars isolated in litter were generally also isolated from aerosols and dust, with the salmonella serovars chester and sofia being the dominant serovars across these interfaces. campylobacter was detected late in the production cycle, in litter at levels of around 10(7) mpn g(-1). campylobacter was detected only once inside the shed and then at low levels of 2.2 mpn m(-3). thus, the public health risk from these organisms in poultry environments via the aerosol pathway is minimal.

TI  == characterization of escherichia coli from raw poultry in belgium and impact on the detection of campylobacter jejuni using bolton broth.
AB  == a comparative study examining bolton broth and preston broth for enrichment and reliable detection of campylobacter jejuni (both healthy and freeze stressed cells) was performed. tested as pure cultures, bolton broth enabled faster resuscitation and growth of c. jejuni compared to preston broth. when c. jejuni was co-incubated with extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl) producing escherichia coli isolated from belgian poultry meat preparations, the latter dominated in the bolton enrichment broth and crowded the mccda plates. this resulted in the inability to recover c. jejuni by iso 10272-1:2006 standard method. preston broth did not support the growth of the esbl e. coli isolates, but showed longer detection time of c. jejuni compared to bolton broth. the use of the same antibiotic (sodium cefoperazone) in bolton broth and in mccda plates  may explain the problems encountered for detection of c. jejuni, as high numbers  of esbl e. coli present after enrichment in bolton broth, also caused overgrowth  and masked the few c. jejuni colonies present on the mccda plates. the use of campylobacter spp. specific real-time pcr circumvented these problems and enabled rapid detection of the pathogen after 24h enrichment in both bolton and preston broth, for both healthy and freeze stressed cells.

TI  == isolation and characterization of bacteriophages specific for campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == human infection by campylobacter jejuni is mainly through the consumption of contaminated poultry products, which results in gastroenteritis and, rarely, bacteremia and polyneuropathies. in this study, six c. jejuni-specific bacteriophages (cps1-6) were isolated by the spot-on-the-lawn technique from chicken samples in korea and characterized for potential use as biocontrol agents. all isolated bacteriophages exhibited a high specificity, being able to lyse only c. jejuni, but not other gram-negative bacteria, including c. coli, escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria. bacteriophages contain an icosahedral head and a contractile tail sheath in transmission electron microscopy, and possess ds-dna with an average genome size of approximately 145 kb; therefore, all bacteriophages are categorized into the myoviridae family. bacterial lysis studies in liquid media revealed that cps2 could be used to control the growth of c. jejuni.

TI  == comprehensive study on the occurrence and distribution of pathogenic microorganisms carried by synanthropic flies caught at different rural locations  in germany.
AB  == in the current study, samples of 50 synanthropic flies were collected from each of five rural locations used for domestic animal husbandry (specifically a cattle barn, a dog pound, a horse stable, and a pigpen). flies were examined using a variety of microbiological methods to determine the pathogenic agents that they carried. the most frequently sampled species were musca domestica (l.) (51%) followed by stomoxys calcitrans (l.) (24%). all fly species were found to carry an array of different pathogenic bacterial and fungal species. among these were human pathogens such as campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli-strains (ehec,  epec, and etec) and the fungi candida albicans and candida tropicalis. the germs  could be detected in the intestines as well as on the exoskeletons of the flies.  the current study confirms and supplements the general knowledge about pathogens  that may be transmitted to domestic animals and humans by synanthropic flies.

TI  == comparative quantification of campylobacter jejuni from environmental samples using traditional and molecular biological techniques.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis in the world. given the potential risks to human, animal, and environmental health, the  development and optimization of methods to quantify this important pathogen in environmental samples is essential. two of the most commonly used methods for quantifying c. jejuni are selective plate counting and quantitative real-time pcr (qpcr). unfortunately, little comparative research has been performed to evaluate the accuracy of these methods for quantification of c. jejuni in aqueous and solid matricies. in this study, the limit of detection and the level of resolution obtained using these 2 methods was evaluated for c. jejuni and compared with that of the common indicator organism escherichia coli. the use of  selective plate count media for quantification of c. jejuni resulted in a 0.7-1.2 log underestimation of cell concentrations, compared with qpcr in both water and  column leachate samples, whereas e. coli concentrations were found to be similar  with either technique. for c. jejuni, only the qpcr assay accurately measured 2-fold changes in cell concentrations in water samples, whereas concentrations of e. coli were accurately measured regardless of method. based on these data, qpcr  assays were found to be more accurate than selective plate counts for quantification of c. jejuni from environmental samples.

TI  == can stress in farm animals increase food safety risk?
AB  == all farm animals will experience some level of stress during their lives. stress  reduces the fitness of an animal, which can be expressed through failure to achieve production performance standards, or through disease and death. stress in farm animals can also have detrimental effects on the quality of food products. however, although a common assumption of a potential effect of stress on food safety exists, little is actually known about how this interaction may occur. the aim of this review was to examine the current knowledge of the potential impact of stress in farm animals on food safety risk. colonization of farm animals by enteric pathogens such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, and campylobacter, and their subsequent dissemination into the human food chain are a major public health and economic concern for the food industries. this review shows that there is increasing evidence to demonstrate that stress can have a significant deleterious effect on food safety through a variety of potential mechanisms. however, as the impact of stress is difficult to precisely determine, it is imperative that the issue receives more research attention in the interests of optimizing animal welfare and minimizing losses in product yield and quality,  as well as to food safety risks to consumers. while there is some evidence linking stress with pathogen carriage and shedding in farm animals, the mechanisms underlying this effect have not been fully elucidated. understanding when pathogen loads on the farm are the highest or when animals are most susceptible to infection will help identifying times when intervention strategies for pathogen control may be most effective, and consequently, increase the safety of food of animal origin.

TI  == thermotolerant coliforms are not a good surrogate for campylobacter spp. in environmental water.
AB  == this study aimed to assess the importance of quantitatively detecting campylobacter spp. in environmental surface water. the prevalence and the quantity of campylobacter spp., thermotolerant coliforms, and escherichia coli in 2,471 samples collected weekly, over a 2-year period, from 13 rivers and 12 streams in the eastern townships, quebec, canada, were determined. overall, 1,071 (43%), 1,481 (60%), and 1,463 (59%) samples were positive for campylobacter spp., thermotolerant coliforms, and e. coli, respectively. there were weak correlations between the weekly distributions of campylobacter spp. and thermotolerant coliforms (spearman's rho coefficient = 0.27; p = 0.008) and between the quantitative levels of the two classes of organisms (kendall tau-b correlation coefficient = 0.233; p < 0.0001). well water samples from the eastern townships were also tested. five (10%) of 53 samples from private surface wells were positive for campylobacter jejuni, of which only 2 were positive for thermotolerant coliforms. these findings suggest that microbial monitoring of raw water by using only fecal indicator organisms is not sufficient for assessing the occurrence or the load of thermophilic campylobacter spp. insights into the role  of environmental water as sources for sporadic campylobacter infection will require genus-specific monitoring techniques.

TI  == the dif/xer recombination systems in proteobacteria.
AB  == in e. coli, 10 to 15% of growing bacteria produce dimeric chromosomes during dna  replication. these dimers are resolved by xerc and xerd, two tyrosine recombinases that target the 28-nucleotide motif (dif) associated with the chromosome's replication terminus. in streptococci and lactococci, an alternative system is composed of a unique, xer-like recombinase (xers) genetically linked to a dif-like motif (dif(sl)) located at the replication terminus. preliminary observations have suggested that the dif/xer system is commonly found in bacteria with circular chromosomes but that assumption has not been confirmed in an exhaustive analysis. the aim of the present study was to extensively characterize the dif/xer system in the proteobacteria, since this taxon accounts for the majority of genomes sequenced to date. to that end, we analyzed 234 chromosomes from 156 proteobacterial species and showed that most species (87.8%) harbor xerc and xerd-like recombinases and a dif-related sequence which (i) is located in non-coding sequences, (ii) is close to the replication terminus (as defined by the cumulative gc skew) (iii) has a palindromic structure, (iv) is encoded by a low g+c content and (v) contains a highly conserved xerd binding site. however, not all proteobacteria display this dif/xercd system. indeed, a sub-group of pathogenic epsilon-proteobacteria (including helicobacter sp and campylobacter sp) harbors a different recombination system, composed of a single recombinase (xerh) which is phylogenetically distinct from the other xer recombinases and a motif (dif(h)) sharing homologies with dif(sl). furthermore, no homologs to dif or xer recombinases could be detected in small endosymbiont genomes or in certain bacteria with larger chromosomes like the legionellales. this raises the question of the presence of other chromosomal deconcatenation systems in these species. our study highlights the complexity of dif/xer recombinase systems in proteobacteria and paves the way for systematic detection of these components in  prokaryotes.

TI  == comparison of the entericbio multiplex pcr system with routine culture for detection of bacterial enteric pathogens.
AB  == the entericbio system uses a multiplex pcr assay for the simultaneous detection of campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, shigella spp., and escherichia coli o157 from feces. it combines overnight broth enrichment with pcr amplification and detection by hybridization. an evaluation of this system was conducted by comparing the results obtained with the system with those obtained by routine culture, supplemented with alternative pcr detection methods. in a study of 773 samples, routine culture and the entericbio system yielded 94.6 and 92.4% negative results, respectively. forty-two samples had positive results by culture, and all of these were positive with the entericbio system. this system detected an additional 17 positive samples (campylobacter spp., n = 12; shigella  spp., n = 1; e. coli o157, n = 4), but the results for 5 samples (campylobacter spp., n = 2; shigella spp., n = 1; e. coli o157, n = 2) could not be confirmed. the target for shigella spp. detected by the entericbio system is the ipah gene,  and the molecular indication of the presence of shigella spp. was investigated by sequence analysis, which confirmed that the ipah gene was present in a klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from the patient. the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were 100%, 99.3%, 91.5%, and 100%, respectively. turnaround times were significantly reduced with the entericbio system, and a result was available between 24 and 32 h after receipt of the sample in the laboratory. in addition, the amount of laboratory waste was  significantly reduced by use of this system. in summary, the entericbio system proved convenient to use, more sensitive than the conventional culture used in this study, and highly specific; and it generated results significantly faster than routine culture for the pathogens tested.

AB  == this study explored the impact of feeding raw meat to dogs on the fecal prevalence of several enteric bacterial zoonotic pathogens. campylobacter jejuni  was isolated from 1/42 (2.6%) raw meat-fed dogs. salmonella enterica was isolated from 2/40 (5%) of the raw meat feeds, 6/42 (14%) raw meat-fed dog feces, none of  the dogs that did not receive raw meat (p = 0.001), 4/38 (10.5%) of the vacuum cleaner waste samples from households where raw meat was fed, and 2/44 (4.5%) of  vacuum cleaner waste samples from households where raw meat was not fed to dogs (p = 0.41). responses to a questionnaire probing practices and beliefs regarding  raw meat feeding that was administered to dog owners demonstrated that dog owners may either not be aware or refuse to acknowledge the risks associated with raw meat-feeding; thus, they may neglect to conduct adequate intervention strategies  to prevent zoonoses among themselves and their families.

TI  == enteric bacterial pathogen detection in southern sea otters (enhydra lutris nereis) is associated with coastal urbanization and freshwater runoff.
AB  == although protected for nearly a century, california's sea otters have been slow to recover, in part due to exposure to fecally-associated protozoal pathogens like toxoplasma gondii and sarcocystis neurona. however, potential impacts from exposure to fecal bacteria have not been systematically explored. using selective media, we examined feces from live and dead sea otters from california for specific enteric bacterial pathogens (campylobacter, salmonella, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile and escherichia coli o157:h7), and pathogens endemic to the marine environment (vibrio cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus and plesiomonas shigelloides). we evaluated statistical associations between detection of these pathogens in otter feces and demographic or environmental risk factors for otter  exposure, and found that dead otters were more likely to test positive for c. perfringens, campylobacter and v. parahaemolyticus than were live otters. otters  from more urbanized coastlines and areas with high freshwater runoff (near outflows of rivers or streams) were more likely to test positive for one or more  of these bacterial pathogens. other risk factors for bacterial detection in otters included male gender and fecal samples collected during the rainy season when surface runoff is maximal. similar risk factors were reported in prior studies of pathogen exposure for california otters and their invertebrate prey, suggesting that land-sea transfer and/or facilitation of pathogen survival in degraded coastal marine habitat may be impacting sea otter recovery. because otters and humans share many of the same foods, our findings may also have implications for human health.

TI  == multiplexed bead-based mesofluidic system for detection of food-borne pathogenic  bacteria.
AB  == in the present study, a simple and rapid multiplexed bead-based mesofluidic system (bms) was developed for simultaneous detection of food-borne pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, vibrio parahaemolyticus, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, enterobacter sakazakii, shigella, escherichia coli o157:h7, and campylobacter jejuni. this system is based on utilization of isothiocyanate-modified microbeads that are 250 mum in diameter, which were immobilized with specific amino-modified oligonucleotide probes and placed in polydimethylsiloxane microchannels. pcr products from the pathogens studied were  pumped into microchannels to hybridize with the oligonucleotide-modified beads, and hybridization signals were detected using a conventional microarray scanner.  the short sequences of nucleic acids (21 bases) and pcr products characteristic of bacterial pathogens could be detected at concentrations of 1 pm and 10 nm, respectively. the detection procedure could be performed in less than 30 min with high sensitivity and specificity. the assay was simple and fast, and the limits of quantification were in the range from 500 to 6,000 cfu/ml for the bacterial species studied. the feasibility of identification of food-borne bacteria was investigated with samples contaminated with bacteria, including milk, egg, and meat samples. the results demonstrated that the bms method can be used for effective detection of multiple pathogens in different foodstuffs.

TI  == evidence-based semiquantitative methodology for prioritization of foodborne zoonoses.
AB  == objectives: to prioritize an extended list of food- and water-borne zoonoses to allow food safety authorities to focus on the most relevant hazards in the food chain. methods: an evidence-based semiquantitative methodology was developed. scores were given by 35 scientific experts in the field of animal and public health, food, and clinical microbiology and epidemiology to 51 zoonotic agents according to five criteria related to public health (severity and occurrence in humans), animal health (severity of disease coupled with economic consequences and occurrence in animals), and food (occurrence in food). the scoring procedure  was standardized and evidence-based as experts were provided, for each zoonotic agent, a same set of up-to-date help information data related to the five criteria. independently, the relative importance of the five criteria was weighted by seven food chain risk managers. the zoonotic agents were ranked based on overall weighted scores and were grouped in four statistically different levels of importance. results: the following foodborne zoonotic pathogens were classified as "most important": salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, and verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli. a second group of "significant importance" included toxoplasma gondii, the agent of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, clostridium botulinum, staphylococcus aureus, cryptosporidium parvum, mycobacterium bovis, echinococcus granulosus, streptococcus spp., echinococcus multilocularis, yersinia enterocolitica, mycobacterium avium, fasciola hepatica, giardia intestinalis, and rotavirus. conclusions: this methodology allowed to rank 51 zoonotic agents with objectivity and taking account of a combined input from risk assessors and risk managers. applications: these results support food safety policy makers to establish the multiannual monitoring program of foodborne zoonoses. they also enable to identify knowledge gaps on specific zoonotic agents and to formulate key research questions. principally, this method of prioritization is of general interest as it can be applied for any other ranking exercise and in any country.

AB  == objectives: the aim was to purify and characterise an antimicrobial component from celery (apium graveolens) seeds, which have been used for centuries as a herbal medicine with reported antibacterial effects. methods: a crude alcoholic extract of celery seeds was fractionated by organic solvent extractions, column chromatography and hplc. fractions were assayed for antimicrobial activity against the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori and other bacteria. the purified antibacterial component was characterised via ms and nmr. preliminary investigation of its mechanism of action included morphological studies, incorporation of macromolecular precursors, membrane integrity and two-dimensional protein electrophoresis. key findings: the purified component, termed 'compound with anti-helicobacter activity' (cah), had potent bactericidal  effects against h. pylori; the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration were 3.15 microg/ml and 6.25-12.5 microg/ml, respectively. cah (m(r) = 384.23; empirical formula c(24)h(32)o(4)) had specific  inhibitory effects on h. pylori and was not active against campylobacter jejuni or escherichia coli. ms and nmr data were consistent with a dimeric phthalide structure. the results appeared to rule out mechanisms that operated solely by loss of membrane integrity or inhibition of protein or nucleic acid synthesis. conclusions: cah may be suitable for further investigation as a potent agent for  treating h. pylori infections.

TI  == pumping iron: mechanisms for iron uptake by campylobacter.
AB  == campylobacter requires iron for successful colonization of the host. in the last  7 years, a wealth of data has been generated allowing detailed molecular characterization of campylobacter iron-uptake systems. several exogenous siderophores have been identified as sources of ferric iron for campylobacter. ferri-enterochelin uptake requires both the outer-membrane receptor protein cfra  and the inner-membrane abc transporter system ceubcde. ferrichrome has been shown to support growth of some campylobacter jejuni strains and the presence of homologues of escherichia coli fhuabd genes was proposed; the cj1658-cj1663 system appears to be involved in the uptake of ferri-rhodotorulic acid. in addition to siderophores, the importance of host iron sources was highlighted by  recent studies demonstrating that c. jejuni can exploit haem compounds and the transferrins using chuabcdz and cj0173c-cj0178, respectively. an additional putative receptor, cj0444, present in some, but not all, strains has not yet been characterized. following diffusion through the outer membrane, inner-membrane transport of ferrous iron can occur via the feob protein. while it may be assumed that all systems are not essential, there is growing evidence supporting the need for multiple iron-uptake systems for successful host colonization by campylobacter. in light of this, comparative molecular characterization of iron systems in all campylobacter strains is necessary to gain further insight into the pathogenesis of members of this genus.

TI  == n-glycosylated proteins and distinct lipooligosaccharide glycoforms of campylobacter jejuni target the human c-type lectin receptor mgl.
AB  == an increasing number of bacterial pathogens produce an array of glycoproteins of  unknown function. here we report that campylobacter jejuni proteins that are modified by the n-linked glycosylation machinery encoded by the pgl locus bind the human macrophage galactose-type lectin (mgl). mgl receptor binding was abrogated by edta and n-acetylgalactosamine (galnac) and was successfully transferred to escherichia coli by introducing the c. jejuni pgl locus together with a glycan acceptor protein. in addition to glycoproteins, c. jejuni lipooligosaccharide with a terminal galnac residue was recognized by mgl. recombinant e. coli expressing the c. jejuni pgl locus in the absence of a suitable glycan acceptor protein produced altered lipopolysaccharide glycoforms that gained mgl reactivity. infection assays demonstrated high levels of galnac-dependent interaction of the recombinant e. coli with mgl-transfected mammalian cells. in addition, interleukin-6 production by human dendritic cells was enhanced by c. jejuni lacking n-linked glycans compared with wild-type bacteria. collectively, our results provide evidence that both n-linked glycoproteins and distinct lipooligosaccharide glycoforms of c. jejuni are ligands for the human c-type lectin mgl and that the c. jejuni n-glycosylation machinery can be exploited to target recombinant bacteria to mgl-expressing eukaryotic cells.

TI  == a multifactorial risk prioritization framework for foodborne pathogens.
AB  == we develop a prioritization framework for foodborne risks that considers public health impact as well as three other factors (market impact, consumer risk acceptance and perception, and social sensitivity). canadian case studies are presented for six pathogen-food combinations: campylobacter spp. in chicken; salmonella spp. in chicken and spinach; escherichia coli o157 in spinach and beef; and listeria monocytogenes in ready-to-eat meats. public health impact is measured by disability-adjusted life years and the cost of illness. market impact is quantified by the economic importance of the domestic market. likert-type scales are used to capture consumer perception and acceptance of risk and social  sensitivity to impacts on vulnerable consumer groups and industries. risk ranking is facilitated through the development of a knowledge database presented in the format of info cards and the use of multicriteria decision analysis (mcda) to aggregate the four factors. three scenarios representing different stakeholders illustrate the use of mcda to arrive at rankings of pathogen-food combinations that reflect different criteria weights. the framework provides a flexible instrument to support policymakers in complex risk prioritization decision making when different stakeholder groups are involved and when multiple pathogen-food combinations are compared.

TI  == the response of campylobacter jejuni to low temperature differs from that of escherichia coli.
AB  == human infection with campylobacter jejuni is often associated with the consumption of foods that have been exposed to both chilling and high temperatures. despite the public health importance of this pathogen, little is known about the effects of cold exposure on its ability to survive a subsequent heat challenge. this work examined the effect of rapid exposure to chilling, as would occur in poultry processing, on the heat resistance at 56 degrees c of two  c. jejuni strains, 11168 and 2097e48, and of escherichia coli k-12. unlike e. coli k-12, whose cold-exposed cells showed increased sensitivity to 56 degrees c, such exposure had only a marginal effect on subsequent heat resistance in c. jejuni. this may be explained by the finding that during rapid chilling, unlike e. coli cells, c. jejuni cells are unable to alter their fatty acid composition and do not adapt to cold exposure. however, their unaltered fatty acid composition is more suited to survival when cells are exposed to high temperatures. this hypothesis is supported by the fact that in c. jejuni, the ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids was not significantly different after cold exposure, but it was in e. coli. the low-temperature response of c. jejuni is very different from that of other food-borne pathogens, and this may contribute to its tolerance to further heat stresses.

AB  == the prevalence and concentrations of campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp. and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) were investigated in surface waters in brisbane, australia using quantitative pcr (qpcr) based methodologies. water samples were collected from brisbane city botanic gardens (cbg) pond, and two urban tidal creeks (i.e., oxley creek and blunder creek). of the 32 water samples collected, 8 (25%), 1 (3%), 9 (28%), 14 (44%), and 15 (47%) were positive for c.  jejuni mapa, salmonella inva, ehec o157 lps, ehec vt1, and ehec vt2 genes, respectively. the presence/absence of the potential pathogens did not correlate with either e. coli or enterococci concentrations as determined by binary logistic regression. in conclusion, the high prevalence, and concentrations of potential zoonotic pathogens along with the concentrations of one or more fecal indicators in surface water samples indicate a poor level of microbial quality of surface water, and could represent a significant health risk to users. the results from the current study would provide valuable information to the water quality managers in terms of minimizing the risk from pathogens in surface waters.

TI  == the effects of dietary additives on faecal levels of lactobacillus spp., coliforms, and escherichia coli, and faecal prevalence of salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. in us production nursery swine.
AB  == aims: in the united states, carbadox and copper sulfate are growth promoters commonly used in combination in nursery swine diets. our aim was to determine how selected dietary additives affect selected bacterial populations and pathogens in nursery swine, and compare to larch extract, which contains potential antibacterial activities. methods and results: piglets were weaned and sorted into one of the four treatments: (i) basal diet without antimicrobials; (ii) basal diet with carbadox + copper sulfate; (iii) basal diet + 1000 ppm larch extract; or (iv) basal diet + 2000 ppm larch extract. diets were fed for a 4-week period after weaning. in both trials, the carbadox + copper sulfate group consumed more feed over the 4-week period relative to the other three diet groups (p < 0.05), but did not gain significantly more weight. faecal shedding of salmonella spp. was not affected by dietary supplement in either trial, but faecal shedding of campylobacter spp. was the lowest for the carbadox + copper sulfate diet. in faecal samples collected at the end of each trial, lactobacillus spp. cell counts for the basal and larch extract diets were nearly 1.0 log(10) g(-1) faeces greater (p < 0.05) than the carbadox + copper sulfate group, whereas the coliforms and escherichia coli were nearly 1.0 log(10) g(-1) faeces lower (p  < 0.05). conclusions: compared to basal fed animals, supplementation with carbadox + copper sulfate significantly altered faecal e. coli, coliform bacteria and lactobacillus spp. larch extract has no benefit up to 0.2% of diet in regard  to pathogen shedding, whereas carbadox + copper sulfate decreased faecal shedding of campylobacter spp. significance and impact of the study: current swine management practices in the united states may be beneficial to managing campylobacter spp. shedding in nursery swine, but also result in significant changes in the resident gastrointestinal microflora.

TI  == simultaneous identification of seven foodborne pathogens and escherichia coli (pathogenic and nonpathogenic) using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism coupled with multiplex pcr.
AB  == the objective of this study was to develop a novel technique for parallel analysis of eight important foodborne microbes using capillary electrophoresis-based single-strand conformation polymorphism (ce-sscp) coupled with multiplex pcr. specific primers for multiplex pcr amplification of the 16s rrna gene were designed, corresponding to eight species of bacteria, including escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica, listeria monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, and bacillus cereus, for the species-specific identification and optimal separation of their pcr products in subsequent analysis by ce-sscp. multiplex pcr conditions including annealing temperature, extension time, the number of pcr cycles, and primer concentrations were then optimized for simultaneous detection  of all target foodborne bacteria. the diagnostic system using ce-sscp combined with multiplex pcr developed here can be used for rapid investigation of causative agents of foodborne illness. the simplicity and high sensitivity of the method may lead to improved management of safety and illness related to food.

TI  == where's the pump? associating sporadic enteric disease with drinking water using  a geographic information system, in british columbia, canada, 1996-2005.
AB  == we investigated whether risk of sporadic enteric disease differs by drinking water source and type using surveillance data and a geographic information system. we performed a cross-sectional analysis, at the individual level, that compared reported cases of enteric disease with drinking water source (surface or ground water) and type (municipal or private). we mapped 814 cases of campylobacteriosis, cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis, salmonellosis and verotoxigenic escherichia coli infection, in a region of british columbia, canada, from 1996 to 2005, and determined the water source and type for each case's residence. over the 10-year period, the risk of disease was 5.2 times higher for individuals living on land parcels serviced by private wells and 2.3 times higher for individuals living on land parcels serviced by the municipal surface/ground water mixed system, than the municipal ground water system. rates  of sporadic enteric disease potentially differ by drinking water source and type. geographic information system technology and surveillance data are accessible to  local public health authorities and used together are an efficient and affordable way to assess the role of drinking water in sporadic enteric disease.

TI  == an alternative menaquinone biosynthetic pathway operating in microorganisms: an attractive target for drug discovery to pathogenic helicobacter and chlamydia strains.
AB  == menaquinone is an essential vitamin as an obligatory component of the electron transfer pathway in microorganisms. menaquinone has been shown to be derived from chorismate by eight enzymes, designated mena to -h in escherichia coli. however,  bioinformatic analyses of whole-genome sequences have suggested that some microorganisms, such as helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni, which are known to cause gastric carcinoma and diarrhea, respectively, do not have orthologs of most of the men genes, although they synthesize menaquinone. the (13)c-labeling pattern of menaquinone purified from streptomyces coelicolor a3(2) grown on [u-(13)c]glucose was quite different from that of e. coli, suggesting that an alternative pathway was operating in the strain. we searched for candidate genes participating in the alternative pathway by in silico screening,  and the involvement of these genes in the pathway was confirmed by gene-disruption experiments. we also used mutagenesis to isolate mutants that required menaquinone for their growth and used these mutants as hosts for shotgun cloning experiments. metabolites that accumulated in the culture broth of mutants were isolated and their structures were determined. taking these results together, we deduced the outline of the alternative pathway, which branched at chorismate in a similar manner to the known pathway but then followed a completely different pathway. as humans and some useful intestinal bacteria, such as lactobacilli, lack the alternative pathway, it would be an attractive target for the development of chemotherapeutics.

TI  == characterisation of campylobacter jejuni genes potentially involved in phosphonate degradation.
AB  == potential biological roles of the campylobacter jejuni genes cj0641, cj0774c and  cj1663 were investigated. the proteins encoded by these genes showed sequence similarities to the phosphonate utilisation phnh, k and l gene products of escherichia coli. the genes cj0641, cj0774c and cj1663 were amplified from the pathogenic c. jejuni strain 81116, sequenced, and cloned into pgem-t easy vectors. recombinant plasmids were used to disrupt each one of the genes by inserting a kanamycin resistance (kmr) cassette employing site-directed mutagenesis or inverse pcr. campylobacter jejuni 81116 isogenic mutants were generated by integration of the mutated genes into the genome of the wild-type strain. the c. jejuni mutants grew on primary isolation plates, but they could not be purified by subsequent passages owing to cell death. the mutant c. jejuni  strains survived and proliferated in co-cultures with wild-type bacteria or in media in which wild-type c. jejuni had been previously grown. pcr analyses of mixed wild-type/mutant cultures served to verify the presence of the mutated gene in the genome of a fraction of the total bacterial population. the data suggested that each mutation inactivated a gene essential for survival. rates of phosphonate catabolism in lysates of e. coli strain dh5 alpha were determined using proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. whole-cell lysates of the wild-type degraded phosphonoacetate, phenylphosphonate and aminomethylphosphonate. significant differences in the rates of phosphonate degradation were observed between lysates of wild-type e. coli, and of bacteria transformed with each one of the vectors carrying one of the c. jejuni genes, suggesting that these genes were involved in phosphonate catabolism.

TI  == pathogen detection in milk samples by ligation detection reaction-mediated universal array method.
AB  == this paper describes a new dna chip, based on the use of a ligation detection reaction coupled to a universal array, developed to detect and analyze, directly  from milk samples, microbial pathogens known to cause bovine, ovine, and caprine  mastitis or to be responsible for foodborne intoxication or infection, or both. probes were designed for the identification of 15 different bacterial groups: staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, nonaureus staphylococci, streptococcus bovis, streptococcus equi, streptococcus canis, streptococcus dysgalactiae, streptococcus parauberis, streptococcus uberis, streptococcus pyogenes, mycoplasma spp., salmonella spp., bacillus spp., campylobacter spp., and escherichia coli and related species. these groups were identified based on the 16s rrna gene. for microarray validation, 22 strains from the american type culture collection or other culture collections and 50 milk samples were tested.  the results demonstrated high specificity, with sensitivity as low as 6 fmol. moreover, the ligation detection reaction-universal array assay allowed for the identification of mycoplasma spp. in a few hours, avoiding the long incubation times of traditional microbiological identification methods. the universal array  described here is a versatile tool able to identify milk pathogens efficiently and rapidly.

TI  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for molecular epidemiology of food pathogens.
AB  == foodborne diseases due to well-recognized pathogens have emerged as an important  and growing public health problem with a significant impact on health. molecular  methods for subtyping these microorganisms have become a valid adjunct to the traditional techniques employed in most laboratories. one such molecular technique for the detection and identification of food pathogens is pulsed-field  gel electrophoresis (pfge). this method separates large dna molecules by the use  of an alternating electrical field, such that greater size resolution can be obtained when compared to normal agarose gel electrophoresis. pfge is often employed to track pathogens, such as salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli (including o157), campylobacter, and listeria species through the food chain. the contour-clamped homogeneous electric field (chef) pfge system is considered to be the gold standard for use in epidemiological studies of these organisms.

AB  == the use of defined primers for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of interspersed repetitive dna elements present at distinct locations in prokaryotic genomes is referred to as repetitive element sequence based-polymerase chain reaction (rep-pcr). the initial discovery of repetitive extragenic palindromic (rep) elements occurred in the genomes of escherichia coli and salmonella. the family of rep elements is generally between 33 and 40 bp in length, has 500 to 1,000 copies per genome, and comprises about 1% of the bacterial genomes of e. coli or salmonella. the amplified dna fragments, when separated by electrophoresis, constitute a genomic fingerprint that can be employed for subspecies discrimination and strain delineation of bacteria and fungi. the application of rep-pcr to microbes has proven a discriminatory and reproducible tool for microbial subtype analyses and for microbial ecology investigations.

AB  == the maintenance and survival of target pathogens during transport from the field  collection site to the analytical laboratory is essential for obtaining accurate  and reliable data. this study was conducted to compare the efficacy of sterile tap water (sw), buffered peptone water (bpw), and universal preenrichment broth (up) for maintaining populations of campylobacter spp., salmonella, and escherichia coli for 24 h under simulated transport conditions. freshly processed broiler carcasses (n = 100) were rinsed in sw. the rinses were divided, and components were added to create equal volumes of rinse samples consisting of sw,  bpw, and up. the rinses were analyzed for the target organisms immediately and again after 24 h of simulated chilled transport conditions. the only meaningful difference between the different transport media was found for up, which recovered fewer e. coli than did either sw or bpw. these findings support the conclusion that either sw or bpw should be used as a broiler carcass rinse and/or transport medium to accurately depict the levels or presence of these three target bacteria as a whole. because potable water differs in ph and hardness across the united states, a follow-up study was conducted to investigate whether  water hardness or ph within the ranges normally found across the united states would affect campylobacter recovery from carcass rinses. no significant differences were detected.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of campylobacter jejuni pseg: a udp-sugar hydrolase from the pseudaminic acid biosynthetic pathway.
AB  == flagella of the bacteria helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni are important virulence determinants, whose proper assembly and function are dependent upon glycosylation at multiple positions by sialic acid-like sugars, such as 5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-l-glycero-l-manno-nonulosonic acid (pseudaminic acid (pse)). the fourth enzymatic step in the pseudaminic acid pathway, the hydrolysis of udp-2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-beta-l-altropyranose to generate 2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-l-altropyranose, is performed by the nucleotide sugar hydrolase pseg. to better understand the molecular basis of the pseg catalytic reaction, we have determined the crystal structures of c. jejuni pseg in apo-form and as a complex with its udp product at 1.8 and 1.85 a resolution, respectively. in addition, molecular modeling was utilized to provide insight into the structure of the pseg-substrate complex. this modeling identifies a his(17)-coordinated water molecule as the putative nucleophile and suggests the udp-sugar substrate adopts a twist-boat conformation upon binding to pseg, enhancing the exposure of the anomeric bond cleaved and favoring inversion at c-1. furthermore, based on these structures a series of amino acid substitution derivatives were constructed, altering residues within the active site, and each  was kinetically characterized to examine its contribution to pseg catalysis. in conjunction with structural comparisons, the almost complete inactivation of the  pseg h17f and h17l derivatives suggests that his(17) functions as an active site  base, thereby activating the nucleophilic water molecule for attack of the anomeric c-o bond of the udp-sugar. as the pseg structure reveals similarity to those of glycosyltransferase family-28 members, in particular that of escherichia coli murg, these findings may also be of relevance for the mechanistic understanding of this important enzyme family.

AB  == gram-negative bacterial foodborne pathogens are a worldwide cause of morbidity and mortality. the ability to carry out epidemiological investigations to determine the primary sources of bacterial contamination is important to improve  public health. multiple methods are available for bacterial source tracking and to determine the distribution of pathogens isolated from sick patients. the molecular based typing methods available fall into three general categories: those based on restriction analysis of the bacterial dna; those based on polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification of particular genetic targets; and  those based on the identification of dna sequence polymorphisms. the techniques that are examined in this review include: plasmid analysis, restriction fragment  length polymorphism methods, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis, pcr-based genotyping, variable number of tandem repeat analysis, multilocus sequence typing, and single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. these methods are described along with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the techniques for genotyping the major gram-negative foodborne pathogens--campylobacter spp., salmonella enterica, shigella spp., escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica.

TI  == transmission of foodborne zoonotic pathogens to riparian areas by grazing sheep.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine if sheep grazing near riparian areas on pasture in ontario are an important risk factor for the contamination of water with specific foodborne pathogens. ten ontario sheep farms were visited weekly for 12 wk during the summer of 2005. samples of feces, soil, and water were collected and analyzed for the presence of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni and c. coli, and yersinia enterocolitica, by bacteriological identification and polymerase chain reaction (pcr). the data was  analyzed as repeated measures over time using mixed models. no samples were positive for salmonella, and no samples were confirmed positive for e. coli o157:h7 after pcr. levels of campylobacter were highest in the soil, but did not  differ between soil where sheep grazed or camped and roadside soil that had never been grazed (p = 0.85). levels of yersinia were highest in water samples and were higher in soil where sheep had access (p = 0.01). the prevalence of positive campylobacter and yersinia samples were not associated with locations where sheep spent more time (campylobacter p = 0.46, yersinia p = 0.99). there was no effect  of stocking density on the prevalence of campylobacter (p = 0.30), but as the stocking density increased the levels of yersinia increased (p = 0.04). it was concluded that although sheep transmit yersinia to their environment, pastured sheep flocks are not major risk factors for the transmission of zoonotic pathogens into water.

TI  == enzymatic properties of futalosine hydrolase, an enzyme essential to a newly identified menaquinone biosynthetic pathway.
AB  == in prokaryotes, menaquinone is used for respiration. in escherichia coli, menaquinone is biosynthesized from chorismate by seven enzymes. however, very recently, we identified an alternative pathway (the futalosine pathway), which operates in some bacteria, including streptomyces coelicolor, helicobacter pylori, campylobacter jejuni, and thermus thermophilus. we describe the steps of  this pathway, which branches at chorismate in a manner similar to the known pathway, but then follows a different route. this new pathway includes futalosine, an unusual nucleoside derivative consisting of inosine and o-substituted benzoate moieties, as a biosynthetic intermediate. in this study, a recombinant futalosine hydrolase (ttha0556) of t. thermophilus, which participates in the second step of the pathway and catalyzes the reaction releasing hypoxanthine from futalosine, was prepared and used in functional analyses. recombinant ttha0556 formed a homotetramer and reacted only with futalosine; other structurally related nucleotides and nucleosides were not accepted. recombinant ttha0556 required no cofactors, and the optimum ph and temperature were 4.5 and 80 degrees c. the km value was calculated to be 154.0+/-5.3 microm and the kcat value was 1.02/s. recombinant ttha0556 was slightly inhibited by hypoxanthine, with a ki value of 1.1 mm.

TI  == a new sialidase mechanism: bacteriophage k1f endo-sialidase is an inverting glycosidase.
AB  == bacteriophages specific for escherichia coli k1 express a tailspike protein that  degrades the polysialic acid coat of e. coli k1 that is essential for bacteriophage infection. this enzyme is specific for polysialic acid and is a member of a family of endo-sialidases. this family is unusual because all other previously reported sialidases outside of this family are exo- or trans-sialidases. the recently determined structure of an endo-sialidase derived  from bacteriophage k1f (endonf) revealed an active site that lacks a number of the residues that are conserved in other sialidases, implying a new, endo-sialidase-specific catalytic mechanism. using synthetic trifluoromethylumbelliferyl oligosialoside substrates, kinetic parameters for hydrolysis at a single cleavage site were determined. measurement of kcat/km at a series of ph values revealed a dependence on a single protonated group of pka 5.  mutation of a putative active site acidic residue, e581a, resulted in complete loss of sialidase activity. direct 1h nmr analysis of the hydrolysis of trifluoromethylumbelliferyl sialotrioside revealed that endonf is an inverting sialidase. all other wild type sialidases previously reported are retaining glycosidases, implying a new mechanism of sialidase action specific to this family of endo-sialidases.

TI  == recombinant interleukin-4 enhances campylobacter jejuni invasion of intestinal pig epithelial cells (ipec-1).
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis, has a diverse spectrum of disease expression. polymicrobial infections may contribute to this,  such as trichuris, which elicits type 2 cytokines (including il-4) and downregulates type 1 immunity. in previous studies, gnotobiotic piglets infected  with c. jejuni and trichuris suis had bloody diarrhea and marked gastrointestinal pathology, including bacterial invasion into epithelial cells and macrophages. neonatal swine given these dual infections had elevated il-4 and il-10 responses  in feces. in the studies reported here, we hypothesized that il-4 or il-10 enhances invasion of intestinal pig epithelial cells (ipec-1) by c. jejuni. 10-14-day-old ipec-1 cells were pretreated with recombinant il-4 (ril-4) or ril-10 for 5h and then challenged with c. jejuni. cells pretreated with ril-4 were viable and showed approximately 6-fold increases in c. jejuni (but not escherichia coli dh5alpha) internalization compared to cells with no pretreatment. enhanced c. jejuni invasion was ril-4 dose-dependent and reversed by addition of anti-il-4 antibody. preincubation with ril-10 did not significantly alter c. jejuni internalization. transepithelial electrical resistance (teer) was significantly reduced following ril-4 treatment, but not ril-10 treatment. after ril-4 pretreatment and c. jejuni challenge, light microscopy showed vacuolated cells with damaged paracellular junctions. transmission electron microscopy (tem) showed multiple internalized bacteria. most were in the cytoplasm, but some were within or adjacent to vacuoles. we conclude that ril-4 damages paracellular junctions and alters the physiology of these epithelial cells allowing increased invasion of c. jejuni.

TI  == enumeration of escherichia coli cells on chicken carcasses as a potential measure of microbial process control in a random selection of slaughter establishments in the united states.
AB  == to evaluate whether the number of escherichia coli bacteria in carcass rinses from chicken slaughter establishments could be monitored for the purpose of microbial process control, we drew a random sample from 20 of 127 large usda-inspected operations. in 2005, every 3 months, two sets of 10 carcass rinses, 100 ml each, were collected from establishments, netting 80 sample sets from the rehang and postchill stages. e. coli and campylobacter numbers and salmonella prevalence were measured. mixed-effect models were used to estimate variance of mean log(10) e. coli cell numbers of 10-carcass rinse sample sets. relationships between e. coli and campylobacter and salmonella were examined. for 10-carcass rinse sets, at both the rehang and postchill stages the mean log(10) e. coli cfu/ml fit the logistic distribution better than the normal distribution. the rehang overall mean log(10) e. coli was 3.3 cfu/ml, with a within-sample set  standard deviation of 0.6 cfu/ml. the overall postchill mean log(10) e. coli was  0.8 cfu/ml, with 13 establishments having mean log(10) e. coli cfu/ml values of less than 1.0 and 7 having mean values of 1.2 or more. at the midpoint separating these establishments, a mean log(10) e. coli cfu/ml of 1.1, the within-sample set standard deviation was 0.5 cfu/ml, with smaller standard deviations as means increased. postchill sample sets with mean log(10) e. coli counts less than or equal to 1.1 cfu/ml had lower overall prevalence of salmonella and mean log(10) campylobacter cfu/ml than sample sets with higher means. these findings regarding reductions in e. coli numbers provide insight relevant to microbial process control.

TI  == preliminary foodnet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food--10 states, 2008.
AB  == foodborne diseases remain an important public health problem in the united states. the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) of cdc's emerging infections program collects data from 10 u.s. states on diseases caused  by enteric pathogens transmitted commonly through food. foodnet is an active, population-based surveillance system for these laboratory-confirmed infections. this report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2008 and trends since 1996. in 2008, the estimated incidence of infections caused by campylobacter, cryptosporidium, cyclospora, listeria, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157, salmonella, shigella, vibrio, and yersinia did not change significantly when compared with the preceding 3 years. for most infections, incidence was highest among children aged <4 years, whereas the percentage of persons hospitalized and the case fatality rate were highest among persons aged >/=50 years. none of the healthy people 2010 targets for reduction of foodborne pathogens (objective 10-1) were reached in 2008. the lack of recent progress points to gaps in the current food safety system and the need to continue to develop and evaluate food safety practices as food moves from the farm to the table.

TI  == a microbiological survey of selected alberta-grown fresh produce from farmers' markets in alberta, canada.
AB  == previously there was no available information on the levels of indicator bacteria and the prevalence of pathogens in fresh produce grown in alberta, canada. baseline information on the occurrence and levels of escherichia coli and the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in selected produce items available to consumers from farmers' and public markets in two large urban centers and surrounding areas in alberta was obtained. a total of 10 large markets with between 1 and 12 produce vendors and 26 small markets with between 1 and 6 produce vendors were sampled from 21 june to 7 october 2007. lettuce (128 samples), spinach (59 samples), tomatoes (120 samples), carrots (206 samples), green onions (129 samples), and strawberries (31 samples) were analyzed for e. coli, salmonella, e. coli o157:h7, and campylobacter spp. lettuce, spinach, green onion, and strawberry samples were also tested for the presence of cryptosporidium spp. information on whether produce was grown using organic or conventional practices was obtained from the produce vendors. e. coli was isolated from 8.2% of the samples that included lettuce, spinach, carrots, and green onions. the bacterial counts ranged from <0.48 to >3.04 log most probable number per g. e. coli was not isolated from tomatoes or strawberries. the percentage of positive samples ranged from 4.4% for carrots to 27.1% for spinach. salmonella, e. coli o157:h7, and campylobacter spp. were not isolated from any of the samples. cryptosporidium was identified by pcr in one sample of spinach (0.6% of the samples).

TI  == temporal patterns and risk factors for escherichia coli o157 and campylobacter spp, in young cattle.
AB  == escherichia coli o157 and campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are zoonotic pathogens originating from farm animals. cattle are the main reservoir for e. coli o157 and also contribute to human cases of campylobacteriosis through contaminated milk, direct contact, and environmental contamination. thirty groups of young cattle on 30 farms were observed for 7 months and sampled on 4 to 6 separate occasions for e. coli o157 and c. jejuni/coli to characterize shedding patterns and identify risk factors. the within herd prevalence of e. coli o157 per sampling occasion ranged from 0 to 60% (mean = 24%) and average campylobacter spp. within herd prevalence was 47% ranging from 0 to 100%. the prevalence of e.  coli o157-positive herds declined with a linear trend throughout the study from 100 to 38% (or: 0.5, p < 0.01), whereas time in the study was not significantly associated with campylobacter prevalence (p = 0.13). larger herds were more likely to be positive with either or both agents, whereas the number of suckler calves on the farm reduced the risk of both organisms (or: 0.4/0.6, p < 0.01). poultry on the premises reduced the risk of e. coli o157, but was not associated  with campylobacter. emptying and cleaning the water troughs more often than once  monthly reduced the risk of detecting campylobacter and cattle sourced by private water supplies were more likely to be campylobacter positive. no drinking water management practices were associated with e. coli o157. the risk of detecting both organisms were almost five times higher when the cattle were housed indoors  (or: 4.9, p = 0.03).

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli isolated from retail turkey meat from southern ontario, canada.
AB  == this study estimated the prevalence of campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli isolated from fresh retail turkey purchased at grocery stores in ontario, canada. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were determined and assessed for potential public health risk. from february 2003 to may 2004, 465 raw turkey  meat samples were collected. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for campylobacter isolates with a concentration gradient test and for salmonella  and e. coli isolates with a broth microdilution assay. campylobacter isolates were recovered from 188 (46%) of 412 samples. the prevalence of resistance to one or more antimicrobials was 168 (81%) of 208. for antimicrobials of very high human health importance (category i of health canada's antimicrobial categorization), 12 (6%) of 208 campylobacter isolates were ciprofloxacin resistant. salmonella isolates were recovered from 95 (24%) of 397 samples. the prevalence of resistance to one or more antimicrobials was 50 (49%) of 102, and 13 (13%) of 102 samples were resistant to five or more antimicrobials. for category i antimicrobials, 14 (14%) of 102 and 1 (1%) of 102 isolates were resistant to ceftiofur and ceftriaxone, respectively. e. coli isolates were recovered from 392 (95%) of 412 turkey samples. the prevalence of resistance to one or more antimicrobials was 906 (71%) of 1,281, and 225 (18%) of 1,281 samples were resistant to five or more antimicrobials. for category i antimicrobials, 30  (2%) of 1,281 samples were resistant to ceftiofur. this study demonstrated that raw turkey pieces are a potential source of human exposure to enteric pathogens,  including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, if undercooked or improperly handled.

TI  == seasonal relationships among indicator bacteria, pathogenic bacteria, cryptosporidium oocysts, giardia cysts, and hydrological indices for surface waters within an agricultural landscape.
AB  == the south nation river basin in eastern ontario, canada is characterized by mixed agriculture. over 1600 water samples were collected on a bi-weekly basis from up  to 24 discrete sampling sites on river tributaries of varying stream order within the river basin between 2004 and 2006. water samples were analyzed for: densities of indicator bacteria (escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, enterococci, total and fecal coliforms), the presence of pathogenic bacteria (listeria monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp.), and densities of parasite giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts. relationships between indicator bacteria, pathogens, and parasite oocysts/cysts were overall weak, seasonally dependent, site specific, but primarily positive. however, l. monocytogenes was inversely related with indicator bacteria densities. campylobacter, salmonella, giardia cysts and cryptosporidium oocysts were most frequently detected in the fall. e. coli o157:h7 was detected at a very low frequency. exploratory decision tree analyses found overall that e. coli densities were the most utilitarian classifiers of parasite/pathogen presence and absence, followed closely by fecal coliforms, and to a lesser extent enterococci  and total coliforms. indicator bacteria densities that classified pathogen presence and absence groupings, were all below 100 cfu per 100 ml(-1). microorganism relationships with rainfall indices and tributary discharge variables were globally weak to modest, and generally inconsistent among season,  site and microorganism. but, overall rainfall and discharge were primarily positively associated with indicator bacteria densities and pathogen detection. instances where a pathogen was detected in the absence of a detectable bacterial  indicator were extremely infrequent; thus, the fecal indicators were conservative surrogates for a variety of pathogenic microorganisms in this agricultural setting. the results from this study indicate that no one indicator or simple hydrological index is entirely suitable for all environmental systems and pathogens/parasites, even within a common geographic setting. these results place more firmly into context that robust prediction and/or indicator utility will require a more firm understanding of microorganism distribution in the landscape, the nature of host sources, and transport/environmental fate affinities among pathogens and indicators.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni induces transcellular translocation of commensal bacteria via lipid rafts.
AB  == background: campylobacter enteritis represents a risk factor for the development  of inflammatory bowel disease (ibd) via unknown mechanisms. as ibd patients exhibit inflammatory responses to their commensal intestinal microflora, factors  that induce translocation of commensal bacteria across the intestinal epithelium  may contribute to ibd pathogenesis. this study sought to determine whether campylobacter induces translocation of non-invasive intestinal bacteria, and characterize underlying mechanisms. methods: mice were infected with c. jejuni and translocation of intestinal bacteria was assessed by quantitative bacterial culture of mesenteric lymph nodes (mlns), liver, and spleen. to examine mechanisms of campylobacter-induced bacterial translocation, transwell-grown t84  monolayers were inoculated with non-invasive escherichia coli hb101 +/- wild-type campylobacter or invasion-defective mutants, and bacterial internalization and translocation were measured. epithelial permeability was assessed by measuring flux of a 3 kda dextran probe. the role of lipid rafts was assessed by cholesterol depletion and caveolin co-localization. results: c. jejuni 81-176 induced translocation of commensal intestinal bacteria to the mlns, liver, and spleen of infected mice. in t84 monolayers, campylobacter-induced internalization and translocation of e. coli occurred via a transcellular pathway, without increasing epithelial permeability, and was blocked by depletion of epithelial plasma membrane cholesterol. invasion-defective mutants and campylobacter-conditioned cell culture medium also induced e. coli translocation, indicating that c. jejuni does not directly 'shuttle' bacteria into enterocytes.  in c. jejuni-treated monolayers, translocating e. coli associated with lipid rafts, and this phenomenon was blocked by cholesterol depletion. conclusion: campylobacter, regardless of its own invasiveness, promotes the translocation of  non-invasive bacteria across the intestinal epithelium via a lipid raft-mediated  transcellular process.

TI  == dynamics of endemic infectious diseases of animal and human importance on three dairy herds in the northeastern united states.
AB  == endemic infectious diseases in dairy cattle are of significant concern to the industry as well as for public health because of their potential impact on animal and human health, milk and meat production, food safety, and economics. we sought to provide insight into the dynamics of important endemic infectious diseases in  3 northeastern us dairy herds. fecal samples from individual cows and various environmental samples from these farms were tested for the presence of major zoonotic pathogens (i.e., salmonella, campylobacter, and listeria) as well as commensal bacteria escherichia coli and enterococci. additionally, the presence of mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was tested in fecal and serum samples from individual cows. test results and health and reproductive records were maintained in a database, and fecal, plasma, dna, and tissue samples were kept in a biobank. all bacteria of interest were detected on these farms and their presence was variable both within and between farms. the prevalence of listeria spp. and l. monocytogenes in individual fecal samples within farm a ranged from 0 to 68.2% and 0 to 25.5%, respectively, over a period of 3 yr. within farm b, continuous fecal shedding of salmonella spp. was observed with a prevalence ranging from 8 to 88%; salmonella cerro was the predominant serotype.  farm c appeared less contaminated with salmonella and listeria, although in the summer of 2005, 50 and 19.2% of fecal samples were positive for listeria and l. monocytogenes, respectively. the high prevalence of e. coli (89 to 100%), enterococcus (75 to 100%), and campylobacter (0 to 81%) in feces suggested they were ubiquitous throughout the farm environment. fecal culture and elisa results  indicated a low prevalence of mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis infection in these farms (0 to 13.6% and 0 to 4.9% for culture-positive and elisa-positive, respectively), although the occasional presence of high shedders was observed. results have major implications for food safety and epidemiology by providing a better understanding of infectious disease dynamics on dairy farms. comprehensive understanding of these infections may lead to better farm management practices and pathogen reduction programs to control and reduce the on-farm contamination of these pathogens and to prevent their further entry into the food-chain.

TI  == structure and function of a campylobacter jejuni thioesterase cj0915, a hexameric hot dog fold enzyme.
AB  == acyl-coenzyme a (coa) thioesterases are a large family of enzymes that hydrolyze  acyl-coa esters to the free fatty acid and coa and thereby regulate essential cellular functions such as lipid metabolism, membrane synthesis, signal transduction, and gene transcription. to better understand the virulence mechanisms of campylobacter jejuni, and its possible link to membrane lipid biosynthesis, we have investigated c. jejuni thioesterases, annotated as putative proteins. while little is known about fatty acid biosynthesis and regulation in c. jejuni, remarkable differences in the genome and its organization from escherichia coli, the paradigm system, raise questions as to the functions of these putative proteins. here we present the crystal structure and biochemical analysis of cj0915, defining the first functional thioesterase from c. jejuni. the structure of cj0915 reveals the hot dog fold with an ycia-type hexameric assembly. enzymatic assays performed with the purified protein show that cj0915 is an efficient thioesterase with a broad specificity toward acyl-coa substrates. this study provides a framework for investigation on roles of the cj0915 thioesterase in virulence, and functional activities associated with the cj0915 thioesterase in vivo.

TI  == tri-county comprehensive assessment of risk factors for sporadic reportable bacterial enteric infection in children.
AB  == background: the aim of this study was to determine risk factors for childhood sporadic reportable enteric infection (rei) caused by bacteria, specifically campylobacter, salmonella, escherichia coli o157, or shigella (rei-b). methods: matched case-control study. case patients aged <19 years who were reported to 3 washington state county health departments and matched control subjects were interviewed from november 2003-november 2005. matched odds ratios (ors) were calculated by using conditional logistic regression. population attributable risk percentages were calculated for exposures associated with infection. results: two hundred ninety-six case patients were matched to 580 control subjects. aquatic recreation was the most important factor associated with all rei-bs studied (beach water exposure [or for salmonella infection, 28.3 {ci, 7.2-112.2}; or for  shigella infection, 14.5 {ci 1.5-141.0} or any recreational water exposure [or for campylobacter infection, 2.7 {ci, 1.5-4.8}; or for escherichia coli o157 infection, 7.4 {ci, 2.1-26.1}]). suboptimal kitchen hygiene after preparation of  raw meat or chicken (or, 7.1 [ci, 2.1-24.1]) and consumption of food from restaurants were additional risks for campylobacter infection. infection with salmonella was associated with the use of private wells as sources of drinking water (or, 6.5 [ci, 1.4-29.7]), and the use of residential septic systems was a risk for both salmonella (or, 3.2 [ci, 1.3-7.8]) and e. coli (or, 5.7 [ci, 1.2-27.2]) o157 infection. conclusions: overall, non-food exposures were as important as food-related exposures with regard to their contributions to the proportion of cases. infection prevention efforts should address kitchen hygiene  practices and non-food exposures, such as recreational water exposure, in addition to food-consumption risks.

TI  == foodborne outbreaks, austria 2007.
AB  == in 2007 austria reported a total of 438 foodborne outbreaks affecting 1715 people, including 286 hospitalized patients and one death. salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. accounted for 95% of all reported outbreaks. forty-eight (11%) of the 438 austrian outbreaks were acquired abroad. of the 390 domestically acquired foodborne outbreaks, bacterial infection caused 376, viruses (norovirus  and 1-time hepatitis a virus) caused 11, and intoxications (staphylococcus aureus enterotoxins, alkaloid toxins) caused two. in one outbreak the causative agent was unknown. salmonella spp. caused 264 (70%) of the bacterial outbreaks, campylobacter spp. caused 104 (28%), enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec o145:h-, o157:h-, o157:h7, o182: h49, o91:h7, ont:h4) caused six, shigella flexneri and shigella sonnei each caused two. the hospitalization rates were 22%  for domestically acquired infections with salmonella spp. and 14% for campylobacter spp. among outbreaks where the source was known, eggs were implicated in 49%, meat products (especially poultry) in 44% and fish in 2%. the  ratio of household outbreaks to general outbreaks was 82.3% to 17.7%. in 54 of the 62 general domestic outbreaks the following locations of exposure were documented: commercial food suppliers (e.g. restaurants, cafeterias) 24 times, family celebrations, nursery schools, take-aways and barbecues 22 times, nursing  homes and hospitals eight times. it is likely that the relatively high number of  household outbreaks reflects an insufficient level of epidemiological investigation of outbreaks in austria. more resources may be needed for identification of individual clusters that belong to larger foodborne outbreaks exceeding district or provincial borders.

TI  == evaluation of procedures for outer membrane isolation from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == although infection with campylobacter jejuni is one of the leading causes of gastroenteritis worldwide, relatively little is known about the factors that are  required to elicit a protective immune response. the need for a vaccine against this pathogen is well recognized and a number of vaccine candidates have been tested with varying degrees of success; however, there is still a lack of a suitable vaccine. to gain a better understanding of the outer-membrane protein components of this organism, a 'gold standard' method to purify the outer membrane is needed. therefore, we attempted to develop a robust and reliable method which resulted in a pure outer-membrane fraction. a total of nine methodologies were examined and analysed by sds-page and immunoblotting using subcellular markers for the cytoplasm, cytoplasmic membrane and outer membrane. we found that glycine extraction, differential detergent extraction using triton  x-100, serial extraction using 1 m tris ph 7, spheroplasting by lysozyme and sonication, and carbonate extraction did not produce pure outer-membrane preparations. however, we identified three methods that provided outer-membrane fractions free from subcellular contamination. isopycnic centrifugation using a 30-60 % sucrose gradient produced seven fractions free from cytoplasmic or cytoplasmic membrane contamination; however, these fractions did not correspond as well as expected with the typical outer-membrane-associated peak (e.g. escherichia coli or salmonella). the spheroplast method using lysozyme alone also resulted in pure outer-membrane fraction, as did carbonate washing of this sample. the extraction of outer membranes using n-lauroylsarcosine (sarkosyl) produced the purest and most reproducible sample. these outer-membrane preparations will be useful for future studies aimed at identifying c. jejuni surface proteins as vaccine components.

TI  == a pan-european survey of antimicrobial susceptibility towards human-use antimicrobial drugs among zoonotic and commensal enteric bacteria isolated from healthy food-producing animals.
AB  == objectives: the aim of the study was to study antimicrobial susceptibility in escherichia coli, salmonella, campylobacter and enterococcus recovered from chickens, pigs and cattle using uniform methodology. methods: intestinal samples  were taken at slaughter in five eu countries per host and bacteria isolated in national laboratories. mics were determined in a central laboratory of key antimicrobials used in human medicine. clinical resistance was based on clsi breakpoints and decreased susceptibility on efsa epidemiological cut-off values.  results: isolation rates from a total of 1500 samples were high for e. coli (n=1465), low for salmonella (n=205) and intermediate for campylobacter (n=785) and enterococcus (n=718). resistance prevalence varied among antibiotics, bacteria, hosts and countries. for e. coli and salmonella, clinical resistance to newer compounds (cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin) was absent or low, but a decreased susceptibility was apparent, particularly in chickens. clinical resistance to older compounds (except colistin and gentamicin) was variable and higher. for campylobacter jejuni from chickens, ciprofloxacin resistance was markedly higher than in isolates from cattle. clinical resistance to erythromycin was absent for both hosts; decreased susceptibility very low. similar trends were determined for campylobacter coli, but c. jejuni was less resistant. none of the  enterococcal strains was resistant to linezolid, but a few displayed resistance to ampicillin or vancomycin. resistance prevalence to quinupristin/dalfopristin was clearly higher. conclusions: antimicrobial resistance among enteric organisms in food animals varied among countries, particularly for older antimicrobials, but clinical resistance to essential compounds used to treat disease in humans was generally zero or low. in the absence of clinical resistance to newer compounds in e. coli and salmonella, the apparent decreased susceptibility should be monitored carefully.

TI  == factors related to the carriage of verocytotoxigenic e. coli, salmonella, thermophilic campylobacter and yersinia enterocolitica in cattle, sheep and pigs  at slaughter.
AB  == a 12-month abattoir study was undertaken from january 2003. we collected 7492 intestinal samples from cattle, sheep and pigs at slaughter. rectal samples were  taken from cattle and sheep and caecal samples from pigs. they were examined for  verocytotoxigenic e. coli (vtec) o157, salmonella, thermophilic campylobacter and yersinia enterocolitica. data were collected on the animal from which the sample  came and this information was analysed to look at potential risk factors for carriage of these organisms. logistic regression models were run where an adequate number of positive results were available. this revealed that vtec o157  carriage in cattle was associated with the summer period and that age was a protective factor. salmonella carriage in pigs was associated with lairage times  >12 h, the north east and not feeding when there was no bedding available. in cattle, carriage was associated with the summer period, the eastern region of gb  and dairy animals. in sheep a spring seasonal effect was seen, which coincided with the lambing period. the carriage of thermophilic campylobacter in cattle was associated with single-species abattoirs, with age a protective factor. in sheep, winter was a risk period with lairage management influential. for pigs, lairage times of <12 h were found to be associated with carriage. a seasonal trend for carriage of y. enterocolitica in all species was demonstrated with the period december-may a risk. for cattle, age was also a risk factor; for sheep feeding in the lairage and for pigs being held overnight were risk factors.

TI  == a biosecure composting system for disposal of cattle carcasses and manure following infectious disease outbreak.
AB  == during outbreaks of infectious animal diseases, composting may be an effective method of disposing of mortalities and potentially contaminated manure. duplicate biosecure structures containing 16 cattle (bos taurus) mortalities (343 kg average weight) were constructed with carcasses placed on a 40-cm straw layer and overlaid with 160 cm of feedlot manure. at a depth of 80 cm (p80), compost heated rapidly, exceeding 55 degrees c after 8 d and maintained temperatures of 55 to 65 degrees c for > 35 d. temperatures at 160 cm (p160) failed to exceed 55 degrees c, but remained above 40 degrees c for >4 mo. to investigate rates of microbial inactivation, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, and newcastle disease virus (ndv) were inoculated in manure (e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni approximately 10(8) cfu g(-1); ndv, approximately 10(6) eid(50) g(-1)), embedded  at p80 and p160 and retrieved at intervals during composting. escherichia coli o157:h7 and ndv were undetectable after 7 d at both depths. the c. jejuni dna was detected up to 84 d at p80 and >147 d at p160. to estimate degradation of recalcitrant substrates, bovine brain, hoof, and rib bones were also embedded at  p80 and p160 and retrieved at intervals. residues of soft tissues remained in carcasses after opening at 147 d and bovine tissue decomposition ranked as brain  > hoof > bone. more than 90% dry matter (dm) of brain disappeared after 7 d and 80% dm of hoof decomposed after 56 d. high degradation of cattle carcasses, rapid suppression of e. coli o157:h7 and ndv and reduction in viable cell densities of  >6 logs for c. jejuni demonstrates that the biosecure composting system can dispose of cattle carcasses and manure in an infectious disease outbreak.

TI  == activation of the campylobacter jejuni flgsr two-component system is linked to the flagellar export apparatus.
AB  == activation of sigma(54)-dependent gene expression essential for formation of flagella in campylobacter jejuni requires the components of the inner membrane-localized flagellar export apparatus and the flgsr two-component regulatory system. in this study, we characterized the flgs sensor kinase and how activation of the protein is linked to the flagellar export apparatus. we found that flgs is localized to the c. jejuni cytoplasm and that his141 of flgs is essential for autophosphorylation, phosphorelay to the cognate flgr response regulator, motility, and expression of sigma(54)-dependent flagellar genes. mutants with incomplete flagellar export apparatuses produced wild-type levels of flgs and flgr, but they were defective for signaling through the flgsr system. by using genetic approaches, we found that flgsr activity is linked to and downstream of the flagellar export apparatus in a regulatory cascade that terminates in expression of sigma(54)-dependent flagellar genes. by analyzing defined flhb and flii mutants of c. jejuni that form flagellar export apparatuses that are secretion incompetent, we determined that formation of the apparatus is  required to contribute to the signal sensed by flgs to terminate in activation of expression of sigma(54)-dependent flagellar genes. considering that the flagellar export apparatuses of escherichia coli and salmonella species influence sigma(28)-dependent flagellar gene expression, our work expands the signaling activity of the apparatuses to include sigma(54)-dependent pathways of c. jejuni  and possibly other motile bacteria. this study indicates that these apparatuses have broader functions beyond flagellar protein secretion, including activation of essential two-component regulatory systems required for expression of sigma(54)-dependent flagellar genes.

AB  == aim: to determine the relationship between the presence of thermotolerant campylobacters and their bacteriophages (phages) in surface waters for the potential to use phages as an indicator of campylobacter spp. methods and results: thermotolerant campylobacters were enumerated in 53 water samples using  a three tube most probable number (mpn) series in m-exeter broth. the presence of phages in the same samples was tested using two approaches: qualitative enrichment with five different campylobacter hosts and a quantitative membrane concentration method. phages infecting an escherichia coli o157:h7 isolate were also enumerated by the membrane concentration method. campylobacter spp. were isolated from 45/53 (85%) of the samples at 0.4-110 mpn 100 ml(-1). no campylobacter phages were isolated, but coliphages were present in 43/46 (93%) of samples. conclusions: the membrane concentration method recovered >80% of campylobacter phages from spiked samples. the absence of campylobacter phages in  environmental samples, from both enrichment and concentration methods, suggests that, if present, they are at very low titres. significance and impact of the study: testing for campylobacter phages as an indicator of campylobacter spp. presence is not effective. the quantitative data for campylobacter spp. will be useful for risk assessment purposes.

AB  == polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplicons (approximately 2.5 kbp) encoding a cdt  gene operon and two partial and putative open reading frames (orfs) were identified in six urease-negative (un) campylobacter lari isolates using a new pcr primer pair constructed in silico. three closely spaced and putative orfs for cdta, cdtb and cdtc, two putative promoters and a hypothetically intrinsic p-independent transcription terminator were found in the operon. each orf commenced with an atg start codon and terminated with a tga stop codon for cdta and cdtb and a taa for cdtc. interestingly, an overlap of four nucleotides was detected between cdta and cdtb and the non-coding region of six base pairs occurring between cdtb and cdtc. the start codons for the three cdt genes were preceded by shine-dalgarno sequences. although nucleotide sequence differences were identified at seven loci in the cdta gene, six in cdtb and two in cdtc among the seven isolates (including c. lari rm2100), no polymorphic sites occurred in the putative promoters, hypothetically intrinsic transcription terminator and the three ribosome binding sites among the seven isolates. all nine amino acid residues specific for both escherichia coli cdtb and mammalian dnase i were completely conserved in the cdtb gene locus in the 26 c. lari isolates, as well as in c. jejuni and c. coli. no pcr amplicons were generated with urease-positive thermophilic campylobacters (uptc; n=10) using the primer pair.

TI  == post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome following water contamination.
AB  == post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (pi-ibs) is a common disorder wherein symptoms of ibs begin after an episode of acute gastroenteritis. the walkerton health study (whs) was initiated in 2002 to study the long-term outcomes of tragic contamination of its municipal water supply with escherichia coli and campylobacter species in 2000. within a cohort of 2069 adult walkerton residents  with no prior history of chronic gastrointestinal disorders, the incidence of pi-ibs 2 years after the outbreak was 10.1% among subjects with no acute gastroenteritis vs 36.2% among those with clinically suspected gastroenteritis (p<0.001). long-term follow-up of the whs cohort has shown pi-ibs to have a favorable prognosis, with spontaneous remission in most patients. a recent meta-analysis of nine cohort studies estimated the pooled odds ratio for developing ibs after enteric infection to be 5.86 (95% ci 3.60-9.54). risk factors for pi-ibs include female gender, younger age, more severe acute enteric  infection, and psychiatric comorbidity. a prevailing hypothesis is that pi-ibs results from a failure to downregulate inflammation after an acute insult from gastroenteritis, a model supported by preliminary studies of intestinal permeability and pro-inflammatory genotypes. ongoing research is testing the hypothesis that pi-ibs denotes increased susceptibility to more overt inflammatory disorders such as crohn's disease. although the walkerton outbreak of acute gastroenteritis was an awful human tragedy, it is hoped that the whs will advance our understanding of pi-ibs and improve the outcomes of people who suffer similar tragedies in the future.

TI  == factors that led to the walkerton tragedy.
AB  == in may 2000, bacterial contamination of municipal water in walkerton, ontario, resulted in the worst public health disaster involving municipal water in canadian history. at least seven people died and 2300 became ill. a public inquiry led by judge dennis o'connor examined the events and delineated the causes of the outbreak, including physical causes, the role of the public utilities operators, the public utilities commissioners, the ministry of the environment (moe), and the provincial government. improper practices and systemic fraudulence by the public utility operators, the recent privatization of municipal water testing, the absence of criteria governing quality of testing, and the lack of provisions made for notification of results to multiple authorities all contributed to the crisis. the moe noted significant concerns 2 years before the outbreak; however, no changes resulted because voluntary guidelines as opposed to legally binding regulations governed water safety. the inquiry concluded that budgetary restrictions introduced by the provincial government 4 years before the outbreak were enacted with no assessment of risk to human health. the ministers and the cabinet had received warnings about serious risks. budgetary cuts destroyed the checks and balances that were necessary to ensure municipal water safety.

TI  == analysis of foodborne outbreak data reported internationally for source attribution.
AB  == analysis of foodborne outbreak data is one approach to estimate the proportion of human cases of specific enteric diseases attributable to a specific food item (food attribution). although we recognize that for a variety of reasons reported  outbreaks represent only a small portion of all actual outbreaks, using outbreak  data for food attribution is the only methodological approach where, theoretically, there is an actual direct link between the pathogen, its source and each infected person. the purpose of this study was to explore the usefulness of foodborne outbreak data extracted from publicly available international electronic reports and publications to provide estimates of food attribution, to  derive and compare these estimates between regions, while improving the understanding of the pathogen/food vehicle combination. electronic reports and publications of foodborne outbreaks that occurred globally since the 1980s were systematically scanned and their data were extracted and compiled in a database.  a system of food categorization was developed and food vehicles assigned accordingly. the association between the aetiology and the food source was statistically described for outbreaks with both reported aetiology and incriminated food vehicle. differences in associations between australia and new  zealand, canada, the european union (eu) and the united states (us) were explored using multiple correspondence analysis and were formally tested between the eu and the us for selected pathogens and food sources. as a result, the food and aetiology cross tabulation of 4093 foodborne outbreaks that occurred globally between 1988 and 2007 is presented and discussed. for a few aetiologies and some  foods the association is very specific. the lack of a specific association between the other foods and aetiologies highlights the potential roles of cross-contamination, environmental contamination and the role of the infected foodhandler along the food chain from farm to fork. detailed analysis of the four regions highlighted some specific associations: salmonella enteritidis outbreaks  occurred relatively often in the eu states with eggs as the most common source; campylobacter associated outbreaks were mainly related to poultry products in the eu and to dairy products in the us; there was an association between escherichia  coli outbreaks and beef in canada; and while salmonella typhiumurium outbreaks were relatively common in australia and new zealand, across all regions, salmonella was associated with a variety of food groups. the value and limitations of the study are discussed, as well as the extrapolation of the food  attribution estimates beyond their outbreak context.

TI  == risk scoring for setting priorities in a monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in meat and meat products.
AB  == meat and meat products can be contaminated with different species of bacteria resistant to various antimicrobials. the human health risk of a type of meat or meat product carry by emerging antimicrobial resistance depends on (i) the prevalence of contamination with resistant bacteria, (ii) the human health consequences of an infection with a specific bacterium resistant to a specific antimicrobial and (iii) the consumption volume of a specific product. the objective of this study was to compare the risk for consumers arising from their  exposure to antibiotic resistant bacteria from meat of four different types (chicken, pork, beef and veal), distributed in four different product categories  (fresh meat, frozen meat, dried raw meat products and heat-treated meat products). a semi-quantitative risk assessment model, evaluating each food chain  step, was built in order to get an estimated score for the prevalence of campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp. and escherichia coli in each product category. to assess human health impact, nine combinations of bacterial species and antimicrobial agents were considered based on a published risk profile. the combination of the prevalence at retail, the human health impact and the amount of meat or product consumed, provided the relative proportion of total risk attributed to each category of product, resulting in a high, medium or low human  health risk. according to the results of the model, chicken (mostly fresh and frozen meat) contributed 6.7% of the overall risk in the highest category and pork (mostly fresh meat and dried raw meat products) contributed 4.0%. the contribution of beef and veal was of 0.4% and 0.1% respectively. the results were tested and discussed for single parameter changes of the model. this risk assessment was a useful tool for targeting antimicrobial resistance monitoring to those meat product categories where the expected risk for public health was greater.

TI  == etiology of acute gastroenteritis in three sentinel general practices, austria 2007.
AB  == background: we studied the etiology of acute gastroenteritis in a village with a  total population of approximately 6,000. this is the first study in austria that  has investigated a broad range of pathogens recovered from an unselected population of patients who had consulted general practitioners because of gastroenteritis. materials and methods: in 2007, all patients who visited one of  three local general practitioners for acute gastroenteritis were invited to provide stool specimens to be tested for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) (mtsb enrichment [r-biopharm] followed  by toxin elisa plus culture), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), yersinia, vibrio cholerae, clostridium difficile (toxin plus culture), rotavirus plus adenovirus (rida) quick rotavirus/adenovirus combi test), giardia duodenalis plus cryptosporidium parvum (rida) quick cryptosporidium/giardia combi test), astrovirus (elisa), and norovirus (reverse-transcriptase pcr). results: stool specimens were provided by 306 patients (161 female) with acute diarrhea. the ages of the patients ranged from 1 to 89 years (mean 37, median 36). pathogens were detected in 71 (23.2%) patients, with incidence peaks in february and june.  norovirus accounted for 36.0% of positive results, c. difficile for 18.7%, rotavirus for 17.3%, campylobacter for 9.3%, salmonella for 6.6%, adenovirus for  5.4%, g. duodenalis and c. parvum for 2.7% each, and yersinia enterocolitica for  1.3%. no cases of shigellosis or infection with ehec, epec, or astrovirus were diagnosed. viruses accounted for 58.7% of the 75 positive results, bacteria for 36.0%, and parasites for 5.3%. conclusion: our study underlines a dominant role of norovirus and toxigenic c. difficile as etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis among the patients of general practitioners.

TI  == improvement in detection of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli in patients with travelers' diarrhea by increasing the number of e. coli colonies tested.
AB  == no cause of one-third of travelers' diarrhea (td) cases can be detected despite microbiologic assessment. we propose that these pathogen-negative td cases include undetected enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec). as a standard in diagnostic microbiology, samples of five e. coli colonies were tested to detect etec from stool cultures. we compared the sensitivities and the number of etec detected by 20 colonies with those of 5, 10, and 15 colonies. the percent detection of etec with five e. coli colonies was significantly different from that using 20 e. coli colonies. of the 116 subjects studied, the number positive  for etec for 5, 10, 15 and 20 colonies tested were 22 (19.0%), 37 (31.9%), 45 (38.8%) and 46 (39.7%), respectively. based on our results, we recommend the testing of at least 10 e. coli colonies for optimum detection of etec in patients with td.

TI  == farm-level risk factors for fluoroquinolone resistance in e. coli and thermophilic campylobacter spp. on finisher pig farms.
AB  == logistic regression, supported by other statistical analyses was used to explore  the possible association of risk factors with the fluoroquinolone (fq)-resistance status of 108 pig finisher farms in great britain. the farms were classified as 'affected' or 'not affected' by fq-resistant e. coli or campylobacter spp. on the basis of isolation of organisms from faecal samples on media containing 1 mg/l fq. the use of fq was the most important factor associated with finding resistant e. coli and/or campylobacter, which were found on 79% (fq-resistant e. coli) and  86% (fq-resistant campylobacter) of farms with a history of fq use. however, resistant bacteria were also found on 19% (fq-resistant e. coli) and 54% (fq-resistant campylobacter) of farms with no history of fq use. for fq-resistant e. coli, biosecurity measures may be protective and there was strong seasonal variation, with more farms found affected when sampled in the summer. for fq-resistant campylobacter, the buying-in of grower stock may increase risk and good on-farm hygiene may be protective. the findings suggest that resistant organisms, particularly campylobacter, may spread between pig farms.

TI  == structures of acrr and cmer: insight into the mechanisms of transcriptional repression and multi-drug recognition in the tetr family of regulators.
AB  == the transcriptional regulators of the tetr family act as chemical sensors to monitor the cellular environment in many bacterial species. to perform this function, members of the tetr family harbor a diverse ligand-binding domain capable of recognizing the same series of compounds as the transporters they regulate. many of the regulators can be induced by a wide array of structurally unrelated compounds. binding of these structurally unrelated ligands to the regulator results in a conformational change that is transmitted to the dna-binding region, causing the repressor to lose its dna-binding capacity and allowing for the initiation of transcription. the multi-drug binding proteins acrr of escherichia coli and cmer from campylobacter jejuni are members of the tetr family of transcriptional repressors that regulate the expression of the multidrug resistant efflux pumps acrab and cmeabc, respectively. to gain insights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation and how multiple ligands induce the same physiological response, we determined the crystal structures of the acrr and cmer regulatory proteins. in this review, we will summarize the new findings  with acrr and cmer, and discuss the novel features of these two proteins in comparison with other regulators in the tetr family.

AB  == after heavy rains campylobacter jejuni together with high counts of escherichia coli, other coliforms and intestinal enterococci were detected from drinking water of a municipal distribution system in eastern finland in august 2004. three patients with a positive c. jejuni finding, who had drunk the contaminated water, were identified and interviewed. the pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) genotypes from the patient samples were identical to some of the genotypes isolated from the water of the suspected contamination source. in addition, repetitive dna element analysis (rep-pcr) revealed identical patterns of e. coli  and other coliform isolates along the distribution line. further on-site technical investigations revealed that one of the two rainwater gutters on the roof of the water storage tower had been in an incorrect position and rainwater had flushed a large amount of faecal material from wild birds into the drinking water. the findings required close co-operation between civil authorities, and application of cultivation and genotyping techniques strongly suggested that the  municipal drinking water was the source of the infections. the faecal contamination associated with failures in cleaning and technical management stress the importance of instructions for waterworks personnel to perform maintenance work properly.

TI  == a campylobacter jejuni znua orthologue is essential for growth in low-zinc environments and chick colonization.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni infection is a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the united states and is acquired primarily through the ingestion of contaminated poultry products. here, we describe the c. jejuni orthologue of znua in other gram-negative bacteria. znua (cj0143c) is the periplasmic component of a putative zinc abc transport system and is encoded on a zinc-dependent operon with cj0142c  and cj0141c, which encode the other two likely components of the transport system of c. jejuni. transcription of these genes is zinc dependent. a mutant lacking cj0143c is growth deficient in zinc-limiting media, as well as in the chick gastrointestinal tract. the protein is glycosylated at asparagine 28, but this modification is dispensable for zinc-limited growth and chick colonization. affinity-purified flag-tagged cj0143c binds zinc in vitro. based on our findings  and on its homology to e. coli znua, we conclude that cj0143c encodes the c. jejuni orthologue of znua.

TI  == [detection and identification of seven clinical common pathogenic bacteria by oligonucleotide microarray].
AB  == objective: using 16s rdna and 23s rdna genes as the target sequences to develop a system based on oligonucleotide microarray and to detect the seven clinical pathogenic bacteria, commonly seen. methods: double polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was applied to amplify the segments of 16s rdna and 23s rdna genes of the target bacteria. an oligonucleotide microarray was constructed to simultaneously  detect ehec o157:h7, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella sp., vibrio cholerae, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni and shigella sp. specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility of the microarray during detection were checked.  and then microarray was used to detect the microbes in stool specimens of 81 patients with diarrhea and vomiting. results: the double pcr method could simultaneously amplify the target sequences of 16s rdna and 23s rdna genes of the seven pathogens. the sensitivity of the developed oligonucleotide microarray could reach 10(3) cfu/ml but no positive results were presented for non-targeted  bacteria. the coefficients of differentiation in one lot or among different lots  of the microarray slices were 3.89% - 5.81%. the positive detection rate of the stool specimens by oligonucleotide microarray was 39.5% (32/81), with a coincidence of 96.3% (78/81) for the patients and another coincidence of 96.8% (31/32) for bacterial genus or species identification, when comparing to the results by routine bacteriological examinations. conclusion: the established assay in this study based on oligonucleotide microarray to detect the seven pathogenic bacteria has many advantages such as convenient, rapid, accurate, stable and high flux, which is suitable for clinical specimen examination and epidemiological field investigation.

AB  == the successful use of virulent (lytic) bacteriophages (phages) in preventing and  treating neonatal enterotoxigenic escherichia coli infections in calves, lambs and pigs has prompted investigation of other applications of phage therapy in food animals. while results have been very variable, some indicate that phage therapy is potentially useful in virulent salmonella and e. coli infections in chickens, calves and pigs, and in control of the food-borne pathogens salmonella  and campylobacter jejuni in chickens and e. coli o157:h7 in cattle. however, more rigorous and comprehensive research is required to determine the true potential of phage therapy. particular challenges include the selection and characterization of phages, practical modes of administration, and development of formulations that maintain the viability of phages for administration. also, meaningful evaluation of phage therapy will require animal studies that closely represent the intended use, and will include thorough investigation of the emergence and characteristics of phage resistant bacteria. as well, effective use will require understanding the ecology and dynamics of the endemic and therapeutic phages and their interactions with target bacteria in the farm environment. in the event that the potential of phage therapy is realized, adoption will depend on its efficacy and complementarity relative to other interventions. another potential challenge will be regulatory approval.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in selected bacteria from poultry.
AB  == this paper reviews the present state of antimicrobial resistance (amr) in the zoonotic bacteria salmonella, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli, and in escherichia coli from chickens and turkeys. for salmonella, the frequencies and patterns of amr vary depending on time, region, serovar, the particular farm, layers versus broilers, and the antimicrobial agent. there is usually a higher frequency of amr in salmonella from turkeys compared with salmonella from chickens. clonal and horizontal transmission of amr occur and there is concern about the spread of transmissible plasmids that encode extended spectrum cephalosporinases. resistance to fluoroquinolones is generally low. for campylobacter, resistance to tetracycline is usually at moderate to high frequency, resistance to quinolones/fluoroquinolones varies from low to high, and resistance to macrolides is usually low. there are high levels of fluoroquinolone resistance in some countries. avian pathogenic e. coli are often highly resistant, especially to tetracycline, streptomycin, and sulfonamides. plasmid-mediated resistance is common. high levels of resistance to ciprofloxacin have been reported from china. commensal e. coli from poultry have similar patterns of resistance but at lower frequencies. integron associated resistance occurs commonly in salmonella and e. coli but has not been detected in campylobacter.

TI  == divercin v41 from gene characterization to food applications: 1998-2008, a decade of solved and unsolved questions.
AB  == the emergence of an increasing number of antibiotic resistant human clinical bacteria has been a great cause of concern for the last decades. as an example, staphylococcus aureus isolates in the hospital environment are becoming more and  more resistant to antibiotics including vancomycin which is considered as a last  line of defence in treatment of staphylococcus aureus-resistant methicillin. on the other hand, food safety is threatened by development of pathogenic bacteria including listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157:h7 and staphylococcus aureus. the use of antimicrobial peptides such as glycopeptides, semi-synthetic peptides, bacteriocins including lantibiotics offers a hope to face these clinical and food microbiology concerns. clinical approval of new chemotherapeutic agents requires a long period of time.  research on bacteriocins has demonstrated potential use to fight against undesired foodborne pathogens but the use industrial use of bacteriocins is limited. to date only lantibiotic nisin and in class iia bacteriocin pediocin pa-1 are legally used as food preservative in many countries. the present minireview is focused on divercin v41 (dvnv41), a class iia bacteriocin naturally produced by carnobacterium divergens v41. the last decade has been the witness of intensive investigations carried out on this cationic peptide tempting to answer  multiple questions covering basic and applied aspects. dvnv41 has shown a wide spectrum of activity either alone or in combination with nisin and/or polymixins  (synergistic effect). this outcome indicates that cb. divergens v41 could potentially be used for safe and efficient prevention of l. monocytogenes growth  in cold smoked salmon.

AB  == the genetic basis of macrolide resistance in campylobacter coli (n = 17) and c. jejuni (n = 35) isolates previously subjected to in vivo selective pressure was investigated to determine if the number of copies of 23s rrna genes with macrolide-associated mutations affects the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of macrolides. sequence data for domain v of the 23s rrna gene revealed that two  macrolide-resistant c. coli isolates had adenine-->guanine transitions at position 2059 (a2059g, escherichia coli numbering). one of the two isolates had the a2059g transition in only two of the three gene copies. among the macrolide-resistant c. jejuni isolates (n = 9), two different point mutations within domain v were observed. three macrolide-resistant c. jejuni isolates had a2059g transitions. one of these three c. jejuni isolates had the a2059g transition in only two of the three gene copies. six macrolide-resistant c. jejuni isolates had an adenine-->cytosine transversion at position 2058 (a2058c,  e. coli numbering) in all three copies of the 23s rrna gene. campylobacter jejuni isolates with the a2058c transversion had higher erythromycin mics (>256 microg/ml) compared to c. jejuni isolates with a2059g transitions (64-128 microg/ml). in addition, the c. jejuni and c. coli isolates with only two copies  of the 23s rrna gene having a2059g substitutions had lower macrolide mics compared to isolates with all three copies of the gene mutated. no isolates were  observed having only one copy of the 23s rrna gene with a mutation. sequence analysis of ribosomal proteins l4 (rpld) and l22 (rplv) indicated that ribosomal  protein modifications did not contribute to macrolide resistance among the collection of campylobacter examined.

AB  == objectives: the goal of this study was to identify potential environmental and demographic factors associated with campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni), salmonella  enterica (salmonella spp.), and antimicrobial-resistant escherichia coli (e. coli) infection in northern elephant seals stranded along the california coastline. methods: e. coli, salmonella spp., and c. jejuni were isolated from rectal swabs from 196 juvenile northern elephant seals, which were found stranded and alive along the california coast and brought to the marine mammal center in sausalito, california, for rehabilitation. gender, weight, county where the animal stranded, month stranded, coastal human population density, exposure to sewage outfall or freshwater outflow (river or stream), and cumulative precipitation in the previous 24 hours, seven days, 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days were analyzed as potential risk factors for infection. results: the odds of  c. jejuni and antimicrobial-resistant e. coli were higher in feces of seals stranded at sites with higher levels of freshwater outflow compared with lower levels of freshwater outflow. the odds of salmonella spp. in feces were 5.4 times greater in seals stranded in locations with lower levels of 30-day cumulative precipitation, along with substantially lower odds of salmonella shedding for seals stranded in monterey or santa cruz county compared with seals stranded in regions further north or south of this central california location. conclusions:  juvenile northern elephant seals that have entered the water are being colonized  by antimicrobial-resistant and pathogenic fecal bacteria that may be acquired from terrestrial sources transmitted via river and surface waters.

TI  == [bacterial diarrheas and antibiotics: european recommendations].
AB  == the need to limit unnecessary antibiotic treatments and recent studies with unusual antibiotics in pediatrics (fluoroquinolones) or in digestive tract infections (azithromycin) have led to update the treatment of acute gastro-enteritis. in 2007, the european society for pediatric infectious diseases and the european society for gastroenterology hepatology and nutrition have issued guidelines. the proven shigellosis as well as the strong suspicion have to be treated promptly with antibiotics, mainly azithromycin. there is no argument to treat moderate salmonella gastroenteritis or carriage. however, the severe cases and those occurring in high risk patient must be treated (ciprofloxacin or  ceftriaxone). it is recommended to treat diarrhoea due to campylobacter jejuni in case of early diagnosis. the presumptive antibiotic treatment should be limited but can not be dismissed, in invasive cases gastro-enteritis, especially in traveller children.

TI  == causality and gastrointestinal infections: koch, hill, and crohn's.
AB  == the gastrointestinal tract contains a complex mix of microorganisms. therefore, the finding of a particular microbe in the gastrointestinal tract or stools of a  patient with intestinal disease does not necessarily indicate that the clinical state resulted from the presence of this organism. for this reason, extending from epidemiological association to causality is particularly challenging for gastrointestinal diseases. most established agents of acute bacterial gastroenteritis (eg, escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni) have been shown to fulfil koch's postulates of causality in human volunteer studies. for helicobacter pylori, which can cause both acute and chronic disease, the organism was first linked to an acute syndrome through volunteer studies and then later assessed for a role in chronic disease by use of hill's epidemiological criteria  of causation. however, for agents of chronic intestinal disease, this approach is not ethical and risks overlooking events occurring long after the exposure. we examine the criteria used to judge causality (koch's postulates and hill's criteria) and their applicability for chronic gastrointestinal diseases (eg, whipple's disease and crohn's disease). we also identify crucial research questions required to advance towards assessing the causal role of candidate microbes in the aetiopathogenesis of crohn's disease.

TI  == detection of escherichia coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, and campylobacter spp. enteropathogens by 3-reaction multiplex polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == the magnitude of bacterial diarrhea in developing countries is largely unknown because affordable detection methods are not available. we have developed a polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based assay for use in areas with limited resources to screen for diarrheogenic strains from clinical isolates. to simplify the assay and minimize reagents, our method implemented the use of plasmids rather than bacteria as template controls and the use of bacterial suspensions or crude dna preparations rather than purified genomic dna as template dna. the assay consisted of 3 pcr reactions using 3 groups of 5 to 6 primer pairs to identify the 11 most common bacterial diarrheogenic pathogens. the 3-reaction multiplex pcr amplifies dna targets specific for each 1 of the 6 escherichia coli diarrheogenic strains and the 5 non-e. coli diarrheogenic strains, including salmonella spp., shigella spp., campylobacter spp., yersinia enterocolitica, and  vibrio cholerae. the assay may provide an important epidemiologic tool to investigate the role of diarrheogenic bacterial pathogens in areas of the world with limited resources.

TI  == [these infectious diseases imported with food].
AB  == people are sometimes frightened by food scares and foodstuffs are increasingly suspected of containing dangerous substances or infectious agents, as a result of the unprecedented development of the industry and food trade in the world. rightly or wrongly, imported food is held responsible for the greatest risks. importing an infectious disease along with food can be a source of danger, involving multiple agents, mainly bacterial (salmonella, campylobacter, verotoxin producing escherichia coli, listeria...), but also parasitic (toxoplasma gondii,  cyclospora cayetanensis, trichinella spp...), and viral (norovirus, hepatitis a virus), as well as non conventional communicable agents and mycotoxins. prevention of food risks means enforcing international regulations on the part of the 149 member states of the wto, increasing vigilance with regard to illegal imports of food, systematically investigating collective food-borne outbreaks, and finally implementing controls according to the hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp) method.

TI  == complete chemoenzymatic synthesis of the forssman antigen using novel glycosyltransferases identified in campylobacter jejuni and pasteurella multocida.
AB  == we have identified an alpha1,4-galactosyltransferase (cgtd) and a beta1,3-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (cgte) in the lipooligosaccharide (los) locus of campylobacter jejuni lio87. strains that carry these genes may have the  capability of synthesizing mimics of the p blood group antigens of the globoseries glycolipids. we have also identified an alpha1,3-n-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase (pm1138) from pasteurella multocida pm70, which is involved in the synthesis of an los-bound forssman antigen mimic and represents the only known bacterial glycosyltransferase with this specificity. the genes encoding the three enzymes were cloned and expressed in escherichia coli as soluble recombinant proteins that can be used to chemoenzymatically synthesize the forssman antigen, and its biosynthetic precursors, in high yields.

TI  == conserved residues in the hamp domain define a new family of proposed bipartite energy taxis receptors.
AB  == hamp domains, found in many bacterial signal transduction proteins, generally transmit an intramolecular signal between an extracellular sensory domain and an  intracellular signaling domain. studies of hamp domains in proteins where both the input and output signals occur intracellularly are limited to those of the aer energy taxis receptor of escherichia coli, which has both a hamp domain and a sensory pas domain. campylobacter jejuni has an energy taxis system consisting of the domains of aer divided between two proteins, ceta (hamp domain containing) and cetb (pas domain containing). in this study, we found that the ceta hamp domain differs significantly from that of aer in the predicted secondary structure. using similarity searches, we identified 55 pairs of hamp/pas proteins encoded by adjacent genes in a diverse group of microorganisms. we propose that these hamp/pas pairs form a new family of bipartite energy taxis receptors. within these proteins, we identified nine residues in the hamp domain and proximal signaling domain that are highly conserved, at least three of which are  required for ceta function. additionally, we demonstrated that ceta contributes to the invasion of human epithelial cells by c. jejuni, while cetb does not. this finding supports the hypothesis that members of hamp/pas pairs possess the capacity to act independently of each other in cellular traits other than energy  taxis.

TI  == microbial recovery from genetically featherless broiler carcasses after forced cloacal fecal expulsion.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine external microbiology of genetically featherless broiler carcasses after forced cloacal fecal expulsion. full-fed featherless broilers were placed into coops, transported, unloaded, shackled, stunned, suffocated, weighed, and divided into 3 treatments groups. carcasses were transferred to a separate shackle line and passed through a machine designed to induce defecation (squeeze) and then remove external feces (wash). treatments  were obtained by turning the squeezing and washing components on or off. treatments were as follows: s carcasses were squeezed but not washed; w carcasses were not squeezed but were washed; and sw carcasses were squeezed and washed. concentrations of total aerobic microorganisms (ab), escherichia coli (ec), coliforms (cf), and campylobacter (cpy) recovered from whole carcass rinses did not vary with treatment (p > 0.05). however, counts of salmonella (sal) in rinses of s carcasses were 1.4 log(10) cfu/ml greater than counts of sal found in rinses of sw carcasses (p < 0.05). the sal prevalence was similar for s (86% positive),  w (90% positive), and sw (83% positive) carcasses (p > 0.05). populations of ab and cf recovered from wash water (water applied in the machine after fecal expulsion) for sw carcasses were significantly higher by 3.1 and 1.5 log(10) cfu/ml, respectively, than the populations of the same bacteria recovered from wash water for w carcasses (p < 0.05). levels of ec and cpy recovered from wash water did not vary with treatment. there was no difference in cpy and sal prevalence in water collected after washing w carcasses or sw carcasses (p > 0.05). data from the present study show that controlled cloacal fecal expulsion followed by carcass washing immediately after slaughter can be used to minimize the numbers of carcass salmonella and can reduce the likelihood of visible carcass fecal contamination or cross-contamination to other carcasses and processing equipment.

TI  == a multicopper oxidase (cj1516) and a copa homologue (cj1161) are major components of the copper homeostasis system of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == metal ion homeostasis mechanisms in the food-borne human pathogen campylobacter jejuni are poorly understood. the cj1516 gene product is homologous to the multicopper oxidase cueo, which is known to contribute to copper tolerance in escherichia coli. here we show, by optical absorbance and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy, that purified recombinant cj1516 contains both t1 and trinuclear copper centers, which are characteristic of multicopper oxidases. inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry revealed that the protein contained  approximately six copper atoms per polypeptide. the presence of an n-terminal "twin arginine" signal sequence suggested a periplasmic location for cj1516, which was confirmed by the presence of p-phenylenediamine (p-pd) oxidase activity in periplasmic fractions of wild-type but not cj1516 mutant cells. kinetic studies showed that the pure protein exhibited p-pd, ferroxidase, and cuprous oxidase activities and was able to oxidize an analogue of the bacterial siderophore anthrachelin (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate), although no iron uptake impairment was observed in a cj1516 mutant. however, this mutant was very sensitive to increased copper levels in minimal media, suggesting a role in copper tolerance. this was supported by increased expression of the cj1516 gene in copper-rich media. a mutation in a second gene, the cj1161c gene, encoding a putative copa homologue, was also found to result in copper hypersensitivity, and a cj1516 cj1161c double mutant was found to be more copper sensitive than either  single mutant. these observations and the apparent lack of alternative copper tolerance systems suggest that cj1516 (cueo) and cj1161 (copa) are major proteins involved in copper homeostasis in c. jejuni.

TI  == closing the diarrhoea diagnostic gap in indian children by the application of molecular techniques.
AB  == a large proportion of diarrhoeal illnesses in children in developing countries are ascribed to an unknown aetiology because the only available methods, such as  microscopy and culture, have low sensitivity. this study was aimed at decreasing  the diagnostic gap in diarrhoeal disease by the application of molecular techniques. faecal samples from 158 children with and 99 children without diarrhoea in a hospital in south india were tested for enteric pathogens using conventional diagnostic methods (culture, microscopy and enzyme immunoassays) and molecular methods (six pcr-based assays). the additional use of molecular techniques increased identification to at least one aetiological agent in 76.5 %  of diarrhoeal specimens, compared with 40.5 % using conventional methods. rotavirus (43.3 %), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (15.8 %), norovirus (15.8 %) and cryptosporidium spp. (15.2 %) are currently the most common causes of diarrhoea in hospitalized children in vellore, in contrast to a study conducted two decades earlier in the same hospital, where bacterial pathogens such as shigella spp., campylobacter spp. and enterotoxigenic e. coli were more prevalent. molecular techniques significantly increased the detection rates of pathogens in children with diarrhoea, but a more intensive study, testing for a wider range of infectious agents and including more information on non-infectious causes of diarrhoea, is required to close the diagnostic gap in diarrhoeal disease.

AB  == a microarray technique for the detection and identification of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels was developed in this study, and the target bacteria included pathogenic escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonella enterica, campylobacter jejuni, shigellae, yersinia  enterocolitica, and listeria monocytogenes. the virulence gene of each pathogen was chosen as the amplification target, labeled with a fluorescence dye by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and hybridized to the specific virulence gene probes that had been immobilized on a microchip. stool specimens from 34 patients with diarrhea were tested in this study. five were positive for  multiple genera. nested pcrs and sequencing were used to amplify and identify the related genes, which were found to share 95.8% to 100% of the nucleotide identity with the corresponding regions in the genbank database. real-time pcr was used to determine the number of gene copies to determine the sensitivity of this technique, which was shown to be 58 copies/microl. the results indicated that the microarray technique which targets multiple virulence genes of enteropathogenic bacteria at the species and subspecies levels is an attractive diagnostic tool for rapidly and simultaneously identifying multiple enteropathogenic pathogens in clinical practice, especially in patients with infectious diarrhea.

AB  == to estimate multipliers linking surveillance of salmonellosis, campylobacteriosis, and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) infections  to community incidence, we used data from a gastroenteritis survey and other sources. multipliers for severe (bloody stool/long duration) and milder cases were estimated from the component probabilities of doctor visit, stool test, sensitivity of laboratory test, and reporting to surveillance system. pathogens were classified by the same severity criteria and appropriate multipliers applied. precision of estimates was quantified by using simulation techniques to  construct 95% credible intervals (cris). the multiplier for salmonellosis was estimated at 7 (95% cri 4-16), for campylobacteriosis at 10 (95% cri 7-22), and for stec at 8 (95% cri 3-75). australian annual community incidence rates per 100,000 population were estimated as 262 (95% cri 150-624), 1,184 (95% cri 756-2,670), and 23 (95% cri 13-54), respectively. estimation of multipliers allows assessment of the true effects of these diseases and better understanding  of public health surveillance.

TI  == recombinant glycans on an s-layer self-assembly protein: a new dimension for nanopatterned biomaterials.
AB  == crucial biological phenomena are mediated through carbohydrates that are displayed in a defined manner and interact with molecular scale precision. we lay the groundwork for the integration of recombinant carbohydrates into a "biomolecular construction kit" for the design of new biomaterials, by utilizing  the self-assembly system of the crystalline cell surface (s)-layer protein sgse of geobacillus stearothermophilus nrs 2004/3a. sgse is a naturally o-glycosylated protein, with intrinsic properties that allow it to function as a nanopatterned matrix for the periodic display of glycans. by using a combined carbohydrate/protein engineering approach, two types of s-layer neoglycoproteins  are produced in escherichia coli. based on the identification of a suitable periplasmic targeting system for the sgse self-assembly protein as a cellular prerequisite for protein glycosylation, and on engineering of one of the natural  protein o-glycosylation sites into a target for n-glycosylation, the heptasaccharide from the acra protein of campylobacter jejuni and the o7 polysaccharide of e. coli are co- or post-translationally transferred to the s-layer protein by the action of the oligosaccharyltransferase pglb. the degree of glycosylation of the s-layer neoglycoproteins after purification from the periplasmic fraction reaches completeness. electron microscopy reveals that recombinant glycosylation is fully compatible with the s-layer protein self-assembly system. tailor-made ("functional") nanopatterned, self-assembling neoglycoproteins may open up new strategies for influencing and controlling complex biological systems with potential applications in the areas of biomimetics, drug targeting, vaccine design, or diagnostics.

TI  == mechanisms of infectious diarrhea.
AB  == infectious diarrhea is an important public health problem worldwide. research has provided new insights into the mechanisms of diarrhea caused by various pathogens that are classified as noninflammatory, inflammatory or invasive. these three groups of organisms cause two diarrheal syndromes--noninflammatory diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea. the noninflammatory diarrheas are caused by enterotoxin-producing organisms such as vibrio cholerae and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, or by viruses that adhere to the mucosa and disrupt the absorptive and/or secretory processes of the enterocyte without causing acute inflammation or mucosal destruction. inflammatory diarrhea is caused by two groups of organisms--cytotoxin-producing, noninvasive bacteria (e.g. enteroaggregative escherichia coli, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli and clostridium difficile), or by invasive organisms (e.g. salmonella spp., shigella  spp., campylobacter spp., entamoeba histolytica). the cytotoxin-producing organisms adhere to the mucosa, activate cytokines and stimulate the intestinal mucosa to release inflammatory mediators. invasive organisms, which can also produce cytotoxins, invade the intestinal mucosa to induce an acute inflammatory  reaction, involving the activation of cytokines and inflammatory mediators. regardless of the underlying mechanism they use, these various types of pathogen  have all successfully evolved to evade and modulate the host defense systems. the mechanisms by which the different pathogens invade the host and cause infectious  diarrhea are the topic of this review.

AB  == introduction: a poorly described bacterium, campylobacter rectus, has been implicated as an etiological agent of periodontal disease. the aim of this study  was to use a comparative genomics approach to identify genes that contribute to the lifestyle of c. rectus as an oral pathogen. methods: suppressive subtractive  hybridization was used to identify genes encoded by c. rectus atcc 33238, but not present in the genome of a related campylobacter species, campylobacter jejuni atcc 11168. results: suppressive subtractive hybridization identified 154 unique  dna sequences from the c. rectus genome. ninety-two of the 154 clones were classified as c. rectus-specific, as they did not show significant sequence homology to genes identified in any strain of c. jejuni (blast e-value >1e-3). blast analysis predicted that the 92 c. rectus-specific gene fragments play a role in a variety of biological processes including signal transduction mechanisms (histidine kinase, response regulators, diguanylate cyclases, chemotaxis receptor) and potentially virulence (s-layer rtx and cysteine desulfhydrase). further analysis of the c. rectus-specific clones showed that 10  genes had campylobacter homologues that were only found in species that commonly  reside within the oral cavity of humans and 10 other fragments shared homology only with non-campylobacter organisms. conclusions: these data provide the first  substantial insights into the genomic content of c. rectus, a significant oral pathogen. the genes identified in this study are a valuable resource for initiating new research on the virulence of c. rectus during periodontitis.

AB  == this study was conducted to compare the presence and antimicrobial susceptibility of campylobacter, salmonella spp., and other enteric bacteria between chickens and guinea fowls. birds were reared on enclosed concrete floor housing covered with pine wood shavings litter material. chicken (n = 40) and guinea fowl (n = 40) carcasses, drinking water (10 ml; n = 40), and litter (10 g; n = 40) were aseptically collected randomly from a poultry farm and analyzed within 1 h of collection. individual pens served as experimental units and were replicated twice. campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and other enterobactericeae were isolated and identified using standard selective media and biochemical tests. isolates were tested for sensitivity to tetracycline, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid, gentamicin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, cefoxitin, and colistin using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion test. campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. were isolated from 28 and 35% of whole carcass rinses of chickens and from 18 and 23% of whole carcass rinses of guinea fowl, respectively. although only salmonella spp. were recovered from drinking water, both salmonella and campylobacter spp. were recovered from litter material. campylobacter upsaliensis was recovered only in the guinea fowl, whereas klebsiella oxytoca and enterobacter sakazakii were recovered only in chickens. although no antibiotic resistance was determined in campylobacter upsaliensis, most campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli isolates from both chickens and guinea fowl were resistant to antibiotics such as ampicillin, kanamycin, erythromycin, and nalidixic acid.

TI  == assessment of the stability of cell-surface components of microorganisms by maldi-tof-ms following preservation on lenticule discs.
AB  == strains representing the species campylobacter coli, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, and staphylococcus aureus were randomly selected to assess the consistency of cells preserved on lenticule discs to those archived in traditional freeze-dried ampoules. each matched pair was cultured using identical conditions and analysed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ms) to profile the surface-associated molecules of the cells. in addition, the cytosolic/membrane-bound proteins of c. coli and s. aureus strains were further analysed by surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight ms. the mass spectral profiles in all cases showed a high degree of concordance between cells preserved by both methods and suggest that the properties of cells preserved on lenticule disc are consistent with those archived by the traditional method of freeze-drying.

TI  == not just for eukarya anymore: protein glycosylation in bacteria and archaea.
AB  == of the many post-translational modifications proteins can undergo, glycosylation  is the most prevalent and the most diverse. today, it is clear that both n-glycosylation and o-glycosylation, once believed to be restricted to eukaryotes, also transpire in bacteria and archaea. indeed, prokaryotic glycoproteins rely on a wider variety of monosaccharide constituents than do those of eukaryotes. in recent years, substantial progress in describing the enzymes involved in bacterial and archaeal glycosylation pathways has been made.  it is becoming clear that enhanced knowledge of bacterial glycosylation enzymes may be of therapeutic value, while the demonstrated ability to introduce bacterial glycosylation genes into escherichia coli represents a major step forward in glyco-engineering. a better understanding of archaeal protein glycosylation provides insight into this post-translational modification across evolution as well as protein processing under extreme conditions. here, we discuss new structural and biosynthetic findings related to prokaryotic protein glycosylation, until recently a neglected topic.

TI  == azithromycin and loperamide are comparable to levofloxacin and loperamide for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in united states military personnel in turkey.
AB  == background: the recommended treatment for traveler's diarrhea is the combination  of an appropriate antibiotic (usually a fluoroquinolone) and loperamide. azithromycin compared favorably with fluoroquinolones in trials that did not include the use of loperamide, but combination therapy has not, to our knowledge, been studied to date. methods: a randomized, double-blind trial was conducted at  incirlik air base, turkey, fromj une 2003 through august 2004. adults from the united states with noninflammatory diarrhea were randomized to receive a single dose of azithromycin (1000 mg; 106 persons) or levofloxacin (500 mg; 101 persons) plus loperamide (4 mg initially and as needed thereafter). volunteers maintained  a symptom diary and were evaluated on days 1, 3, and 7 after treatment. results:  no differences were noted with respect to pretreatment symptoms or pathogen distribution. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli was the most common pathogen isolated (from 45% of patients in the azithromycin group and 42% of patients in the levofloxacin group), and campylobacter species was the second most common pathogen isolated (from 6% of patients in the azithromycin group and 9% of patients in the levofloxacin group). median time to last diarrheal stool (azithromycin group, 13 h; levofloxacin group, 3 h), median time to resolution of associated symptoms (2 days), and additional loperamide usage (azithromycin group, 39% of patients; levofloxacin group, 34% of patients) were similar between groups. azithromycin use was associated with more nausea in the 30 min after dosing (azithromycin group, 8% of patients; levofloxacin group, 1% of patients; pp.004), but no vomiting or other adverse events were noted in either group. conclusions: single-dose treatment with azithromycin (1000 mg) and loperamide is  as effective as single-dose treatment with levofloxacin (500 mg) and loperamide for noninflammatory diarrhea. although nausea after dosing is uncommon, it is more frequently associated with azithromycin than with levofloxacin. future studies should focus on determining whether lower doses of azithromycin would decrease the frequency of nausea and decrease treatment costs without affecting efficacy.

TI  == towards on-site pathogen detection using antibody-based sensors.
AB  == in this paper, the recent progress within biosensors for plant pathogen detection will be reviewed. bio-recognition layers on sensors can be designed in various ways, however the most popular approach is to immobilise antibodies for specific  capture of analytes. focus will be put on antibody surface-immobilisation strategies as well as the use of antibodies in the widely used sensors, quartz crystal microbalance, surface plasmon resonance and cantilevers. we will describe the available data on antibody-based plant pathogen detection and furthermore use examples from detection of the pathogens salmonella, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus mutans, bacillus cereus, bacillus anthracis, campylobacter and escherichia coli. we will touch upon optimal assay design and further discuss the strengths and limitations of current sensor technologies for detection of viruses, bacteria and fungi.

TI  == in vivo expression technology and signature-tagged mutagenesis screens for identifying mechanisms of survival of zoonotic foodborne pathogens.
AB  == high-throughput genetic screens provide great insights into the biochemistry and  molecular biology of how bacteria sense, respond to, and propagate within their environments. genomics era techniques such as microarrays and proteomics have great potential to increase our understanding of how foodborne pathogens grow and survive within animal and human hosts, in the environment and foods, and during thermal and nonthermal inactivation protocols. while these techniques are incredibly useful for studying gene expression in simplified in vitro conditions, it is much more challenging to pursue similar studies within more complex experimental models such as in vivo, within the food matrix, or within heterogeneous microbial populations. techniques such as in vivo expression technology (ivet) and signature-tagged mutagenesis (stm) provide alternatives for studying bacterial gene expression and growth requirements within these settings. these techniques are used extensively by the medical, veterinary, and plant research communities for identifying genes promoting the colonization and disease process, factors mediating commensalism between bacteria and their host, and genes that promote survival of environmental bacteria within natural settings. research into the transmission and survival of foodborne pathogens from farm-to-fork would likely benefit from these techniques, however there are few reports describing their use for such purposes. this review will briefly cover the methods of ivet and stm, discuss how these techniques improved our understanding of the interactions between zoonotic foodborne pathogens and their  animal hosts, and ask whether these techniques could be further exploited to better understand the survival of foodborne pathogens within the environment, within food matrices, and during inactivation protocols.

TI  == transcriptome analysis of organisms with food safety relevance.
AB  == transcriptome analysis using microarrays has become a powerful tool to better understand the process of disease and other complex biological processes such as  food spoilage and biofilm formation. this review is divided into two basic sections: 1) a short history and description of microarrays and 2) a discussion of studies involving bacterial food safety pathogens that focused on whole genome transcript analysis. not included are the many studies using microarrays to identify, diagnose, or genetically characterize these organisms. this review focuses on studies involving escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, and yersinia enterocolitica. many of the studies involve altering the growth environment to simulate stress conditions and the use of host-pathogen model systems to explore virulence mechanisms. few studies use conditions that might be considered unique to the food industry. exceptions are studies of biofilm-specific transcriptome changes and analysis following pressure treatment. this review should not be considered as a comprehensive review, and where appropriate, species-specific reviews are cited that are more complete.

TI  == comparative analysis of antibiotic resistance characteristics of gram-negative bacteria isolated from laying hens and eggs in conventional and organic keeping systems in bavaria, germany.
AB  == by investigating the prevalence and resistance characteristics of gram-negative bacteria from organic and conventional kept laying hens against 31 (campylobacter: 29) different antibiotics using the microdilution method, we determined to what extent different keeping systems influence bacterial resistance patterns. for this purpose, samples from 10 organic and 10 conventional flocks in bavaria (germany) were investigated four times between january 2004 and april 2005. altogether, 799 cloacal swabs and 800 eggs (contents and shells) were examined. the bacterial investigation performed with standardized cultural methods showed prevalence for all bacteria groups in about  the same order of magnitude in the two different keeping systems: salmonella spp. 3.5% (organic ([org])) versus 1.8% (conventional ([con])); campylobacter spp. 34.8%(org) versus 29.0%(con) and e. coli 64.4%(org) versus 69.0%(con). coliforms  (citrobacter, enterobacter, pantoea) were only isolated in single cases. in eggs, generally less bacteria were detected, predominantly escherichia; salmonella and  campylobacter were only scarcely isolated. salmonella enterica ssp. enterica serovar typhimurium (n=10) were resistant to up to nine, s. of the serogroup b (n=4) up to six antibiotics. all tested salmonella (n=23) proved to be resistant  to spectinomycin. escherichia coli (n=257(org) and 276(con)) from organic layers  showed significant lower resistance rates and higher rates of susceptible isolates to nine agents, namely amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefaclor, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, doxycycline, mezlocillin, neomycin and piperacillin. in contrast, only two antibiotics turned out to be more effective in conventional isolates (gentamicin and tobramycin). in the case of campylobacter jejuni (n=118(org) and 99(con)), statistically significantly better rates were observed for isolates from organic flocks concerning imipenem and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, whereas fosfomycin was more potent in strains from conventional flocks. results of this study indicate that both resistance rates and mean minimum inhibitory concentrations of bacteria isolated from organic keeping systems have lower values than those from conventional ones, particularly recognizable for e. coli. thus, organic livestock farming with its restrictions and additional requirements contributes to further effectiveness of antibiotics.

TI  == acute diarrhea due to enteropathogenic bacteria in patients at hospitals in tehran.
AB  == during a study examining causes of diarrhea from may 2004 to may 2005, 808 stool  specimens were collected from patients with acute diarrhea in tehran. fecal samples were cultured and identified according to the standard biochemical methods. molecular identification of enteropathogens was carried out by amplification of their virulence genes by polymerase chain reaction. a total of 369 (45.6%) bacterial pathogens were recovered from 808 patients as follows: shigella spp., 155 (45.6%); diarrheagenic escherichia coli 143 (38.8%); salmonella spp., 51 (13.8%); and campylobacter spp., 20 (5.4%). most of the diarrheagenic e. coli were shiga toxin-producing e. coli, with 64 (44.7%) isolates, followed by 47 (32.9%) enterotoxigenic e. coli isolates; among shigella spp. isolates, 69 (44.5%) shigella flexneri were predominant. the molecular diagnosis of enteropathogens yielded a more accurate characterization of the prevalence of diarrhea-causing bacterial strains in iran. the present study revealed a high prevalence of shigella and diarrheagenic e. coli as the predominant causes of bacterial diarrhea in this region of the world. these two types of bacteria should therefore be considered when designing preventive strategies for people living in iran.

TI  == the effect of alum addition on microbial communities in poultry litter.
AB  == alum [al(2)(so(4))(3).14h(2)o] is a common poultry litter amendment used to decrease water-soluble phosphorus or reduce ammonia volatilization, or both. although the physiochemical effects of alum addition have been well researched, little attention has been given to the poultry litter microbial communities. the  goal of this study was to use molecular biological methods [denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (dgge), community cloning, and quantitative real-time pcr] to characterize general, group-specific and pathogenic microbial communities in alum (10% wt/wt) and non-alum-treated litter. according to quantitative real-time pcr  analyses, alum addition to the poultry litter resulted in significant reductions  in both campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli concentrations by the end of the first month of the experiment (3 log and 2 log, respectively). the concentrations of salmonella spp. were below detection (<5 x 10(3) cell.g(-1) of  litter) for the entire experiment. the dgge analyses revealed significant reductions in the clostridium/eubacterium and low %gc gram-positive groups in the alum-treated litters by the end of the first month, with no bands detectable for  either group after 8 wk of incubation. conversely, minimal effects of alum addition were observed in the actinomycetes community. the most significant shift in the microbial community (based on dgge analyses) occurred in the fungal population, with a large increase in diversity and abundance within 1 mo of alum  addition (1 dominant band on d 0 to 9 dominant bands at 4 wk). specifically, the  incidence of aspergillus spp. increased from 0 to 50% of the sequences in fungal  clone libraries (n = 80) over the course of the experiment. this suggests that the addition of alum to poultry litter potentially shifts the microbial populations from bacterially dominated to dominated by fungi. the ramifications of this shift in dominance are still unknown, and future work will be aimed at characterizing these fungi and elucidating their role in the acidified litter environment.

TI  == characterization of ceta and cetb, a bipartite energy taxis system in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the energy taxis receptor aer, in escherichia coli, senses changes in the redox state of the electron transport system via an flavin adenine dinucleotide cofactor bound to a pas domain. the pas domain (a sensory domain named after three proteins per, arnt and sim, where it was first identified) is thought to interact directly with the aer hamp domain to transmit this signal to the highly  conserved domain (hcd) found in chemotaxis receptors. an apparent energy taxis system in campylobacter jejuni is composed of two proteins, ceta and cetb, that have the domains of aer divided between them. cetb has a pas domain, while ceta has a predicted transmembrane region, hamp domain and the hcd. in this study, we  examined the expression of ceta and cetb and the biochemical properties of the proteins they encode. ceta and cetb are co-transcribed independently of the flagellar regulon. ceta has two transmembrane helices in a helical hairpin while  cetb is a peripheral membrane protein tightly associated with the membrane. cetb  levels are ceta dependent. additionally, we demonstrated that both ceta and cetb  participate in complexes, including a likely cetb dimer and a complex that may include both ceta and cetb. this study provides a foundation for further characterization of signal transduction mechanisms within ceta/cetb.

TI  == is irritable bowel syndrome an inflammatory disorder?
AB  == histopathologic data demonstrate low-grade mucosal inflammation in a subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). this inflammatory infiltrate is mainly represented by increased numbers of t lymphocytes and mast cells lying in  the lamina propria. the close apposition of immunocytes to gut nerves supplying the mucosa provides a basis for neuroimmune cross-talk, which may explain gut sensorimotor dysfunction and related symptoms in patients with ibs. a previous gastroenteritis (due to campylobacter jejuni, salmonella, shigella, escherichia coli, and, likely, viruses) is now an established etiologic factor for ibs (hence, postinfectious ibs). other putative causes, such as undiagnosed food allergies, genetic abnormalities, stress, or bile acid malabsorption, may also promote and maintain a low-grade mucosal inflammation in ibs. the identification  of mucosal inflammation in ibs has pathophysiologic implications and paves the way for novel therapeutic options.

TI  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat and risk ratings of various pathogen/product combinations.
AB  == risk profiles of pork and poultry meat were carried out using an excel-based software program, risk ranger. it is a semi-quantitative risk estimator answering various questions relating to the probability of exposure to a hazard, susceptibility of the population of interest, severity of the illness caused by the hazard if present and probability of food containing an infectious dose. therefore, qualitative and quantitative inputs were used to estimate and rank the risk of various hazards/food combinations. risk scores provided by the tool were  characterized as low, medium and high. also, health risk was estimated separately, where needed, for low and high risk populations. low risk scores were obtained for salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) for low risk population. high risk scores were obtained for hepatitis e virus (hev) in raw pork products (both low and high risk populations). moderate risk scores for salmonella spp. and l. monocytogenes in processed pork or poultry-meat products (ready-to-eat or to be reheated) and partially cooked pork products were also obtained (low risk population). scores for staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus and various product types were mostly in the "medium" risk category, except for s. aureus/ready-to-eat pork products able to support growth of the organism, which fell into the high risk category. campylobacter spp. gave moderate risk scores with one exception (raw poultry products), whereas y. enterocolitica showed combinations of low risk and few of medium risk. high risk pathogen/product combinations identified were: 1) temperature abused, ready-to-eat pork and/or poultry-meat products with extended shelf life and cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes (high risk population), ehec (high risk population) or s. aureus (all population), 2) partially cooked or processed intended to be reheated pork products cross-contaminated by l. monocytogenes, served undercooked and receiving improper cooling or reheating (high risk population), and 3) all people consuming undercooked meals cross-contaminated with campylobacter spp. (e.g. from raw poultry and raw poultry-meat products) and hev (e.g. from raw pork and raw pork-meat products). salmonellae gave high risk scores in all food categories (except preserved meat products) for high risk population. preserved meats (mainly pork) such as dry fermented sausages gave low risk scores. only salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes and e. coli ehec gave moderate risk ratings in  case of ingredients likely to be contaminated at an early stage of processing (e.g. animal at slaughter) and inadequate fermentation process. these results may constitute a source of information for hazard assessment during application of a  food safety management system.

AB  == poultry litter provides nutrients for crop and pasture production; however, it also contains fecal bacteria, sex hormones (17beta-estradiol and testosterone) and antibiotic residues that may contaminate surface waters. our objective was to quantify transport of fecal bacteria, estradiol, testosterone and antibiotic residues from a cecil sandy loam managed since 1991 under no-till (nt) and conventional tillage (ct) to which either poultry litter (pl) or conventional fertilizer (cf) was applied based on the nitrogen needs of corn (zea mays l) in the southern piedmont of ne georgia. simulated rainfall was applied for 60 min to 2 by 3-m field plots at a constant rate in 2004 and variable rate in 2005. runoff was continuously measured and subsamples taken for determining flow-weighted concentrations of fecal bacteria, hormones, and antibiotic residues. neither salmonella, nor campylobacter, nor antimicrobial residues were detected in litter, soil, or runoff. differences in soil concentrations of fecal bacteria before and after rainfall simulations were observed only for escherichia coli in  the constant rainfall intensity experiment. differences in flow-weighted concentrations were observed only for testosterone in both constant and variable  intensity rainfall experiments, and were greatest for treatments that received poultry litter. total loads of e. coli and fecal enterococci, were largest for both tillage treatments receiving poultry litter for the variable rainfall intensity. load of testosterone was greatest for no-till plots receiving poultry  litter under variable rainfall intensity. poultry litter application rates commensurate for corn appeared to enhance only soil concentrations of e. coli, and runoff concentrations of testosterone above background levels.

TI  == diarrhea among children admitted to a private tertiary-care hospital, bangkok, thailand: a case series.
AB  == we report here a case series of pediatric diarrhea cases admitted to a private tertiary-care hospital in bangkok, thailand. retrospective data were collected from computerized medical records of 2,001 children with diarrhea (80.9% thai), ages birth to 14 years, admitted to our facility during 2000-2005. the most common symptom leading to admission was vomiting (34.6%), while the most common sign was dehydration (63.6%). the largest proportion was comprised of toddlers (45.4%), followed by infants (24.2%). of the total 2,564 admissions, 1,874 (73.1%) stool samples were collected and examined for red blood cells (rbc) and white blood cells (wbc); 57.1% and 70.6% were negative for rbc and wbc, respectively. of the 1,878 blood specimens collected for electrolytes, 21.6% show acidosis. of 1,793 stool specimens collected, the majority revealed normal flora  (72.9%). enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) were seen in 10.8%. campylobacter jejuni was found in only 2.9% of specimens, while of 1,065 specimens tested for rotavirus antigen, 23.9% were positive. in addition to bacterial cultures and their anti-microbial sensitivities, factors associated with rotavirus infection, c. jejuni, and metabolic acidosis, were also explored in this study. rotavirus infections were more likely to be associated with children older than toddlers (3-14 years old), being admitted within the first day of the symptoms, those who were more acidotic, and was more common in the first 3 months of each year. our data were little different from community-acquired infections reported among the general population.

TI  == expression, purification, and structural characterization of cfra, a putative iron transporter from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the gene for the campylobacter ferric receptor (cfra), a putative iron-siderophore transporter in the enteric food-borne pathogen campylobacter jejuni, was cloned, and the membrane protein was expressed in escherichia coli, affinity purified, and then reconstituted into model lipid membranes. fourier transform infrared spectra recorded from the membrane-reconstituted cfra are similar to spectra that have been recorded from other iron-siderophore transporters and are highly characteristic of a beta-sheet protein (approximately 44% beta-sheet and approximately 10% alpha-helix). cfra undergoes relatively extensive peptide hydrogen-deuterium exchange upon exposure to (2)h(2)o and yet is resistant to thermal denaturation at temperatures up to 95 degrees c. the secondary structure, relatively high aqueous solvent exposure, and high thermal stability are all consistent with a transmembrane beta-barrel structure containing a plug domain. sequence alignments indicate that cfra contains many of the structural motifs conserved in other iron-siderophore transporters, including the ton box, pgv, irg, rp, and lidg motifs of the plug domain. surprisingly, a homology model reveals that regions of cfra that are expected to play a role in enterobactin binding exhibit sequences that differ substantially from the sequences of the corresponding regions that play an essential role in binding/transport by the e. coli enterobactin transporter, fepa. the sequence variations suggest that there are differences in the mechanisms used by cfra and  fepa to interact with bacterial siderophores. it may be possible to exploit these structural differences to develop cfra-specific therapeutics.

TI  == affinity-capture tandem mass spectrometric characterization of polyprenyl-linked  oligosaccharides: tool to study protein n-glycosylation pathways.
AB  == n-glycosylation of proteins is recognized as one of the most common post-translational modifications. until recently it was believed that n-glycosylation occurred exclusively in eukaryotes before the discovery of the general protein glycosylation pathway (pgl) in campylobacter jejuni. to date, most techniques to analyze lipid-linked oligosaccharides (llos) of these pathways involve the use of radiolabels and chromatographic separation. technologies capable of characterizing eukaryotic and the newly described bacterial n-glycosylation systems from biologically relevant samples in a quick, accurate,  and cost-effective manner are needed. in this paper a new glycomics strategy based on lectin-affinity capture was devised and validated on the c. jejuni n-glycan pathway and the engineered escherichia coli strains expressing the functional c. jejuni pathway. the lipid-linked oligosaccharide intermediates of the pgl pathway were then enriched using sba-agarose affinity-capture and examined by capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (ce-ms). we demonstrate that this method is capable of detecting low levels of llos, the sugars are indeed assembled on undecaprenylpyrophosphate, and structural information for expected and unexpected llos can be obtained without further sample manipulation. furthermore, ce-ms analyses of c. jejuni and the e. coli "glyco-factories" showed striking differences in the assembly and control of n-glycan biosynthesis.

TI  == viral, bacterial and parasitic etiology of pediatric diarrhea in gaza, palestine.
AB  == objectives: to determine the etiology of acute diarrhea in palestinian children under 5 years of age and to improve knowledge of the etiology of gastrointestinal pathogens using traditional and molecular diagnostic techniques. materials and methods: various common enteropathogens (viral, bacterial and parasites) associated with diarrhea were investigated by conventional and molecular techniques (pcr) in 150 children less than 5 years of age admitted to the central pediatric hospital, gaza strip, palestine. results: the occurrence of enteropathogens identified was as follows: rotavirus 42/150 (28%), entamoeba histolytica/dispar 23/150 (15%), shigella spp. 9/150 (6%), campylobacter coli/jejuni and escherichia coli o157:h7 7/150 (5%) each, salmonella spp. 3/150 (2%), giardia intestinalis 1/150 (1%), and strongyloides stercoralis 1/150 (1%) of the samples. shigella and salmonella isolates were tested for their susceptibility to common antimicrobial agents and most of the isolates were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. conclusion: this study demonstrated that rotavirus, e. coli o157:h7 and campylobacter, which are not routinely screened for in gaza strip, were significant enteropathogens. the results highlight the value of using a combination of traditional and pcr techniques in the diagnosis of enteropathogens related to gastroenteritis.

TI  == a simple method for the production of bacterial controls for immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization.
AB  == immunohistochemical and fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish) assays are useful diagnostic methods for the identification of bacteria on formalin fixed paraffin embedded histological sections. to validate an anti-bacterial antibody or an oligonucleotide probe and to ensure fidelity during subsequent analyses, suitable positive and negative controls are necessary. suspensions of fixed bacteria are often used, but ideally, these controls should be fixed, embedded and processed in the same way of tissue samples under analysis. herein, we describe a simple method for the production of bacterial histological control samples: the sandwich. the sandwich is composed of two external layers of equine  lung parenchyma and a central layer of the target bacterium. we prepared sandwiches containing escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, and arcanobacterium pyogenes and tested them with appropriate antibodies and eub338 fish probe. the sandwich is an effective and simple method to prepare bacterial histological controls fixed and processed in the same way as the diagnostic tissues.

TI  == shedding of food-borne pathogens and microbiological carcass contamination in rabbits at slaughter.
AB  == to obtain microbiological data from rabbits at slaughter, 500 fecal samples and 500 carcasses samples were examined. all samples tested negative for listeria and salmonella. campylobacter were detected in two fecal samples. of the 500 fecal samples, 45.8% tested positive for eae (intimin), 1.2% for stx (shiga toxin), and 1.8% for both eae and stx. by colony hybridization, 56 eae positive escherichia coli strains were isolated. among them, 27 strains (48.2%) were of the serotypes  o178:h7 and o153:h7, whereas 15 strains (26.8%) belonged to a serogroup that has  not yet been described (o(cb10681):h7). all strains possessed intimin beta1 and the translocated intimin receptor (tir) capable of being tyrosine phosphorylated. none of the strains harbored the genes for shiga toxins, east1 (asta), bundlin (bfpa), or the eaf plasmid. slaughter rabbits therefore constitute a reservoir for certain atypical enteropathogenic escherichia coli. on rabbit carcasses, average total bacterial counts accounted for 3.3 log cfu cm(-2). enterobacteriaceae and coagulase positive staphylococci (cps) were detected on 118 (23.6%) and 153 (30.6%) carcasses, respectively. enterobacteriaceae and cps counts of positive samples were mainly <1.5 log cfu cm(-2). among 153 selected cps isolates, 98.7% were identified as staphylococcus aureus. none of the 151 isolated strains harbored the gene for methicillin resistance (meca). genes for staphylococcal enterotoxins (se) were detected in 102 strains. the combinations of seg and sei (53 strains) and sed, seg, sei, and sej (27 strains) dominated.

TI  == the crystal structure of the superoxide dismutase from helicobacter pylori reveals a structured c-terminal extension.
AB  == superoxide dismutases (sods) are key enzymes for fighting oxidative stress. helicobacter pylori produces a single sod (hpsod) which contains iron. the structure of this antioxidant protein has been determined at 2.4 a resolution. it is a dimer of two identical subunits with one iron ion per monomer. the protein shares 53% sequence identity with the corresponding enzyme from escherichia coli. the model is compared with those of other dimeric fe-containing sods. hpsod shows significant differences in relation to other sods, the most important being an extended c-terminal tail. this structure provides a model for closely related sequences from species such as campylobacter, where no structures are currently known. the structure of extended carboxyl termini is discussed in light of putative functions it may serve.

TI  == epidermal growth factor inhibits campylobacter jejuni-induced claudin-4 disruption, loss of epithelial barrier function, and escherichia coli translocation.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of acute bacterial enteritis in humans. poultry serves as a major reservoir of c. jejuni and is thought to act as a principal vehicle of transmission to humans. epidermal growth factor (egf) is a small amino acid peptide that exerts a broad range of activities on the intestinal epithelium. the aims of this study were to determine the effect of egf on c. jejuni intestinal colonization in newly hatched chicks and to characterize  its effects on c. jejuni-induced intestinal epithelial barrier disruption. white  leghorn chicks were treated with egf daily, starting 1 day prior to c. jejuni infection, and were compared to control and c. jejuni-infected, egf-treated chicks. infected chicks shed c. jejuni in their feces throughout the study period. c. jejuni colonized the small intestine and cecum, disseminated to extraintestinal organs, and caused jejunal villus atrophy. egf reduced jejunal colonization and dissemination of c. jejuni to the liver and spleen. in egf-treated c. jejuni-infected chicks, villus height was not significantly different from that in untreated c. jejuni-infected chicks or controls. in vitro, c. jejuni attached to and invaded intestinal epithelial cells, disrupted tight junctional claudin-4, and increased transepithelial permeability. c. jejuni also  promoted the translocation of noninvasive escherichia coli c25. these c. jejuni-induced epithelial abnormalities were abolished by pretreatment with egf,  and the effect was dependent upon activation of the egf receptor. these findings  highlight egf's ability to alter colonization of c. jejuni in the intestinal tract and to protect against pathogen-induced barrier defects.

TI  == the omp50 gene is transcriptionally controlled by a temperature-dependent mechanism conserved among thermophilic campylobacter species.
AB  == the thermophilic campylobacters are enteropathogenic for humans. we recently showed that omp50 is a campylobacter species-specific porin produced in campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter lari but not in campylobacter coli. in the present study, we investigated regulation of the omp50 gene and found that its expression in c. jejuni was temperature-dependent, but independent of growth phase or medium viscosity. the use of rt-pcr and omp50::lacz fusions showed that  growth temperature control occurred at the transcriptional level. the promoter and the coding sequence were cloned in an escherichia coli-campylobacter shuttle  plasmid and transferred to e. coli and to a c. jejuni omp50-deficient strain. regulation of omp50 gene expression by growth temperature was observed in the recombinant c. jejuni strain, but not in e. coli. the same regulation was also observed in wild-type c. lari strains and in a c. coli strain supplemented by the plasmid, suggesting that omp50 expression is controlled by a mechanism conserved  among campylobacter species.

AB  == anaerobic digestion is continually gaining importance for the processing of the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes. although methods for studying the survival of pathogen exist, these methods often need adaptations, are expensive,  time consuming or generally not well suited for the harsh conditions within an anaerobic digestion system. in the present study we investigated the applicability of commercially available, mechanically stable and inexpensive pathogen carriers to validate in situ pathogen inhibition within a 750,000l thermophilic, bio-waste treating anaerobic digester. none of the pathogens investigated (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and  campylobacter jejuni) was capable of survival under the conditions of the biogas  reactor for more than 24 h indicating that the temperature and physico-chemical properties of the sludge of the fermenter were effective in inhibiting the survival of these microorganisms.

TI  == microbial responses to nitric oxide and nitrosative stress: growth, "omic," and physiological methods.
AB  == the study of bacterial responses to nitric oxide (no), nitrosating agents, and other agents of nitrosative stress has a short history but has rapidly produced important insights into the interactions of these agents with model microbial systems as well as pathogenic species. several methodological problems arise in attempting to define the global responses to these agents, whether in simply measuring growth or performing "omic" experiments in which the objective is to determine the genome-wide (transcriptomic) or proteome-wide responses. the first  problem is the relatively long timescale over which the experiments are conducted--minutes, hours, or days in the case of slow-growing cultures. the second problem is not unique to no and its congeners but concerns the difficulties encountered when sensitive and comprehensive analytical techniques (such as transcriptomics) are applied to cultures whose growth and physiology are perturbed by an inhibitor. in essence, the problem is "seeing the wood for the trees." this chapter reviews briefly the state of knowledge of no responses and mechanisms in bacteria, particularly escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni. continuous culture has several advantages for investigating the consequences of no exposure, and this approach is outlined with examples of recent results and conclusions. the major advantage of the chemostat is establishment of a reproducible quasi-steady state in growth, in which the growth rate can be controlled and maintained. contrary to common belief, neither the concept nor the apparatus is difficult. commercially available and homemade systems are described with practical advice. establishing continuous cultures paves the way for other "omic" approaches, particularly proteomics and metabolomics, which are not covered here, as their application to the field of no biology is in its infancy.  a key to the literature describing methods suitable for assessing toxicity to microbes of no and reactive nitrogen species is given.

AB  == cold air or ice water can be used to chill poultry carcasses after slaughter. the objective of this study was to compare the effect of 2 chill methods on broiler carcass bacteria. broiler carcasses were cut in half along the dorsal-ventral midline; one half was subjected to an ice-water immersion chill in an agitated bath for 50 min, whereas the reciprocal half was subjected to an air chill in a 1 degrees c cold room for 150 min. total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, and campylobacter were enumerated from half-carcass rinses. species of campylobacter isolates was determined by a commercial pcr method, which was followed by molecular subtyping with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and determination of antimicrobial susceptibility to 9 drugs. although significantly  fewer of each bacterial type were detected per milliliter from immersion-chilled  carcasses than from air-chilled carcasses, in each case the difference was less than 1 log(10) cfu/ml. chilling method did not affect species; both campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli were recovered. results of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis subtyping did not suggest that either chilling method selected for any specific subtypes; most subtypes were found on carcass halves used for both the air chill and water immersion chill. resistance to 2 antimicrobial drugs was noted in 9 c. coli isolates, 6 from air-chilled carcass halves and 3 from immersion-chilled carcass halves. these data showed that immersion-chilled carcasses had lower numbers of bacteria; however, the difference was not large and may have been due to simple dilution. both methods were effective for lowering carcass temperature, and neither chilling method seemed to select for specific species, subtypes, or antimicrobial-resistant campylobacter.

AB  == a randomized intervention study was conducted to determine if discontinuing use of calf milk replacer medicated with oxytetracycline results in increased tetracycline susceptibility in salmonella and campylobacter spp. and escherichia  coli in dairy calves over a 12-month period. dairy herds with enteric bacteria with known low tetracycline susceptibility were enrolled for the study. fecal samples from preweaned calves and environmental samples were collected from eight dairy herds in michigan and new york state. samples were collected monthly for 3  months prior to and 12 months after four of the eight herds discontinued medicated milk replacer feeding. salmonella and campylobacter spp. and e. coli were isolated, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using automated broth microdilution. a total of 804 intervention and 1,026 control calf fecal samples and 122 intervention and 136 control environmental samples were collected for testing. no differences in owner-reported morbidity and mortality between treatment groups were seen. the intervention was significantly associated with increasing tetracycline susceptibility in e. coli and salmonella. tetracycline susceptibility increased in intervention herds for the first 3 months after switching to nonmedicated milk replacer but declined in subsequent months. discontinuing the practice of feeding medicated milk replacers to calves  increased tetracycline susceptibility in e. coli and salmonella on dairy farms, without increasing cattle disease, but declines in effectiveness after 3 months suggest that other factors contribute to decreasing susceptibility on the farm.

AB  == infectious diarrhea is one of the many threats to the deployed military, and given limited resources, a decision to pursue a vaccine acquisition strategy should be based on best evidence that weighs costs and benefits compared to alternatives. an economic model was developed to estimate the marginal cost to avert a duty day lost due to diarrhea for a vaccine acquisition strategy compared to current clinical management, for both multiplex and pathogen-specific vaccines. vaccines against campylobacter and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli appeared to be more favorable than a shigella vaccine. this model provides an evidence-based decision tool to support prioritization in vaccine development.

TI  == preliminary foodnet data on the incidence of infection with pathogens transmitted commonly through food--10 states, 2007.
AB  == the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) of cdc's emerging infections program collects data from 10 u.s. states regarding diseases caused by pathogens commonly transmitted through food. foodnet quantifies and monitors the  incidence of these infections by conducting active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed infections. this report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2007 and compares them with data for previous years. in 2007, the estimated incidence of infections caused by campylobacter, listeria, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157 (stec o157), salmonella, shigella, vibrio, and yersinia did not change significantly, and cryptosporidium infections increased compared with 2004-2006. progress toward the targets for healthy people 2010 national health objectives and targets regarding the incidence of foodborne  infections occurred before 2004; however, none of the targets were reached in 2007. salmonella incidence was the furthest from its national health target, suggesting that reaching this target will require new approaches.

TI  == large-scale freshwater microbiological study: rationale, results and risks.
AB  == a fifteen-month fortnightly survey of microbial health risk indicators and pathogens has been carried out at 25 freshwater recreational and water supply sites distributed throughout new zealand, for: e. coli, clostridium perfringens spores, f-rna bacteriophage, somatic coliphage, human enteroviruses, human adenoviruses, cryptosporidium oocysts, giardia cysts, salmonella and campylobacter. sites were selected to represent five geographical areas covering  new zealand and five categories of predominant environmental impact: birds, dairy farming, forestry/undeveloped, municipal, and sheep/pastoral farming. six of the  sites were also source waters for treated drinking-water supplies. of the indicators, e. coli was detected in 99 % of all samples, with somatic coliphage being detected most of the time (89 %). of the pathogens tested, campylobacter and human adenoviruses were inferred to be the most likely to cause human waterborne illness to recreational freshwater users. using data from all sites, an estimated 5 % of notified campylobacteriosis cases in new zealand could be attributable to water contact recreation. the critical value for e. coli as an indicator of increased campylobacter infection is in the range of 200-500 e. coli per 100 ml. this result has been used to derive new national water quality guidelines for recreational fresh water in new zealand.

TI  == control of enteric pathogens in ready-to-eat vegetable crops in organic and 'low  input' production systems: a haccp-based approach.
AB  == risks from pathogens such as salmonella, yersinia, campylobacter and escherichia  coli o157 have been identified as a particular concern for organic and 'low input' food production systems that rely on livestock manure as a nutrient source. current data do not allow any solid conclusions to be drawn about the level of this risk, relative to conventional production systems. this review describes six risk reduction points (rrps) where risks from enteric pathogens can be reduced in ready-to-eat vegetables. changes can be made to animal husbandry practices (rrp1) to reduce inoculum levels in manure. outdoor livestock management (rrp2) can be optimized to eliminate the risk of faecal material entering irrigation water. manure storage and processing (rrp3), soil management  practices (rrp4) and timing of manure application (rrp5), can be adjusted to reduce the survival of pathogens originating from manure. during irrigation (rrp6), pathogen risks can be reduced by choosing a clean water source and minimizing the chances of faecal material splashing on to the crop. although preventive measures at these rrps can minimize enteric pathogen risk, zero risk can never be obtained for raw ready-to-eat vegetables. good food hygiene practices at home are essential to reduce the incidence of food-borne illnesses.

TI  == estimated numbers of community cases of illness due to salmonella, campylobacter  and verotoxigenic escherichia coli: pathogen-specific community rates.
AB  == objective: to estimate the annual number of cases of illness due to verotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec), salmonella and campylobacter in the canadian population, using data from the national notifiable disease registry (nnd), estimates of under-reporting derived from several national studies on acute gastrointestinal illness, and the literature. methods: for each of the three pathogens (vtec, salmonella and campylobacter), data were used to estimate the percentage of cases reported at each step in the surveillance system. the number of reported cases in the nnd for each pathogen was then divided by these percentages. in cases where the pathogen-specific estimates were unavailable, data on acute gastrointestinal  illness were used, accounting for differences between those with bloody and nonbloody diarrhea. results: for every case of vtec, salmonella and campylobacter infection reported in the nnd, there were an estimated 10 to 47, 13 to 37, and 23 to 49 cases annually in the canadian population, respectively. conclusions: the authors estimate that a significant number of infections due to vtec, salmonella  and campylobacter occur each year in canada, highlighting the fact that these enteric pathogens still pose a significant health burden. recognizing the significant amount of under-reporting is essential to designing appropriate interventions and assessing the impact of these pathogens in the population.

TI  == chemoenzymatic synthesis of polyprenyl phosphates.
AB  == polyprenyl phosphates, including undecaprenyl phosphate and dolichyl phosphate, are essential intermediates in several important biochemical pathways including n-linked protein glycosylation in eukaryotes and prokaryotes and prokaryotic cell wall biosynthesis. herein, we describe the evaluation of three potential undecaprenol kinases as agents for the chemoenzymatic synthesis of polyprenyl phosphates. target enzymes were expressed in crude cell envelope fractions and quantified via the use of luminescent lanthanide-binding tags (lbts). the streptococcus mutans diacylglycerol kinase (dgk) was shown to be a very useful agent for polyprenol phosphorylation using atp as the phosphoryl transfer agent.  in addition, the s. mutans dgk can be coupled with two campylobacter jejuni glycosyltransferases involved in n-linked glycosylation to efficiently biosynthesize the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate-linked disaccharide needed for studies of pglb, the c. jejuni oligosaccharyl transferase.

AB  == batch solar disinfection (sodis) inactivation kinetics are reported for suspensions in water of campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, staphylococcus epidermidis, and endospores of  bacillus subtilis, exposed to strong natural sunlight in spain and bolivia. the exposure time required for complete inactivation (at least 4-log-unit reduction and below the limit of detection, 17 cfu/ml) under conditions of strong natural sunlight (maximum global irradiance, approximately 1,050 w m(-2) +/- 10 w m(-2))  was as follows: c. jejuni, 20 min; s. epidermidis, 45 min; enteropathogenic e. coli, 90 min; y. enterocolitica, 150 min. following incomplete inactivation of b. subtilis endospores after the first day, reexposure of these samples on the following day found that 4% (standard error, 3%) of the endospores remained viable after a cumulative exposure time of 16 h of strong natural sunlight. sodis is shown to be effective against the vegetative cells of a number of emerging waterborne pathogens; however, bacterial species which are spore forming may survive this intervention process.

TI  == cross-contamination in the kitchen: effect of hygiene measures.
AB  == aims: to determine the effect of hygiene measures on cross-contamination of campylobacter jejuni at home and to select a safe tracer organism for c. jejuni.  methods and results: comparative tests were conducted with nonpathogenic escherichia coli and lactobacillus casei and l. casei was chosen as the safe tracer organism. salads containing chicken breast fillet contaminated with a known number of c. jejuni and l. casei were prepared according to different cross-contamination scenarios and contamination levels of salads were determined. cross-contamination could be strongly reduced when cleaning cutting board and cutlery with hot water (68 degrees c), but generally was not prevented using consumer-style cleaning methods for hands and cutting board. conclusions: dish-washing does not sufficiently prevent cross-contamination, thus different cutting boards for raw meat and other ingredients should be used and meat-hand contact should be avoided or hands should be thoroughly cleaned with soap. lactobacillus casei can be used as a safe tracer organism for c. jejuni in consumer observational studies. significance and impact of the study: cross-contamination plays an important role in the transmission of food-borne illness, especially for c. jejuni. this study delivers suitable data to quantitatively assess the risk of campylobacteriosis caused by cross-contamination and it shows the effect of different preventive hygiene measures.

TI  == allpaths: de novo assembly of whole-genome shotgun microreads.
AB  == new dna sequencing technologies deliver data at dramatically lower costs but demand new analytical methods to take full advantage of the very short reads that they produce. we provide an initial, theoretical solution to the challenge of de  novo assembly from whole-genome shotgun "microreads." for 11 genomes of sizes up  to 39 mb, we generated high-quality assemblies from 80x coverage by paired 30-base simulated reads modeled after real illumina-solexa reads. the bacterial genomes of campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli assemble optimally, yielding single perfect contigs, and larger genomes yield assemblies that are highly connected and accurate. assemblies are presented in a graph form that retains intrinsic ambiguities such as those arising from polymorphism, thereby providing  information that has been absent from previous genome assemblies. for both c. jejuni and e. coli, this assembly graph is a single edge encompassing the entire  genome. larger genomes produce more complicated graphs, but the vast majority of  the bases in their assemblies are present in long edges that are nearly always perfect. we describe a general method for genome assembly that can be applied to  all types of dna sequence data, not only short read data, but also conventional sequence reads.

TI  == impact of infections and normal flora in nonhuman primates on drug development.
AB  == preclinical safety studies that are required for the marketing approval of a pharmaceutical include single and repeat dose studies in rodent and nonrodent species. the use of nonhuman primates (nhps), primarily macaques, as the nonrodent species has increased in recent years, in part due to the increase in development of biopharmaceuticals and immunomodulatory agents. depending on the source of the macaques, they may vary in genetic background, normal flora, and/or the incidence of preexisting pathogens and inflammatory conditions. as the use of alternative sources of macaques rises to meet the increased demand for these animals in biomedical research, the toxicologic pathologist should be well versed in nhp pathology to adequately assess potential drug-related effects in the context of these variations. such knowledge is particularly important in studies  involving immunomodulatory drugs as the toxicologic pathologist should anticipate which type(s) of infections are most likely to arise depending on which arm of the immune system is modulated. the purpose of this review is to discuss the immunosuppressive (e.g., simian type d retrovirus, simian immunodeficiency virus) and opportunistic viruses (e.g., cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, simian virus 40, rhesus rhadinovirus, and lymphocryptovirus), primary and opportunistic bacteria (e.g., campylobacter spp., shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, moraxella  catarrhalis, mycobacterium avium complex, enteropathogenic escherichia coli), and parasites (e.g., plasmodium spp., schistosoma spp., strongyloides fulleborni) that have had the most profound impact on the interpretation of drug safety studies and/or that may reemerge as alternative sources of nhps are used for drug safety studies.

TI  == quinolone resistance in the food chain.
AB  == antimicrobials are used in pet animals and in animal husbandry for prophylactic and therapeutic reasons and also as growth promoters, causing selective pressure  on bacteria of animal origin. the impact of quinolones or quinolone-resistant bacteria on the management of human infections may be associated with three different scenarios. (i) quinolone-resistant zoonotic bacterial pathogens are selected and food is contaminated during slaughter and/or preparation. (ii) quinolone-resistant bacteria non-pathogenic to humans are selected in the animal. when the contaminated food is ingested, the bacteria may transfer resistance determinants to other bacteria in the human gut (commensal and potential pathogens). and (iii) quinolones remain in residues of food products, which may allow the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria after the food is consumed.  in this review, we analyse the abovementioned aspects, emphasising the molecular  basis of quinolone resistance in escherichia coli, salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp.

TI  == socioeconomic risk factors for bacterial gastrointestinal infections.
AB  == background: bacterial gastrointestinal infections cause considerable morbidity in industrialized countries, but little is known about socioeconomic factors affecting the risk of infection. methods: by linkage among 3 national registers,  we followed the entire population of denmark (5.3 million people) from 1993 to 2004 for the occurrence of laboratory-confirmed bacterial gastrointestinal infections. using poisson regression analyses, incidence rate ratios (irrs) were  estimated for the major groups of bacteria in different socioeconomic strata, focusing on income group, level of education, marital status, number of children  in the household, and country of birth. results: associations with socioeconomic  variables varied by type of bacterium. high-income groups had increased risks of  infection with campylobacter, shigella, and salmonella enteritidis, and education was positively associated with increased risk of infection with campylobacter and shigella. married persons were generally at higher risk than single persons, but  adults with children had lower risks compared with adults without children. foreign-born persons generally had lower risks, whereas danish-born persons with  foreign-born parents were at reduced risk of infection with the pork-associated bacterium yersinia (irr = 0.33; 95% confidence interval 0.25-0.42), but increased risk with shigella (5.7; 4.8-6.1), salmonella, and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli. conclusions: the findings suggest that risk of infection is not primarily associated with poverty, but rather with increasing socioeconomic status. risk of infection also varies with cultural background. observed differences may be explained by differences in diet and travel activity, although they may also in part reflect differential probabilities of diagnostic reporting.

TI  == expression and purification of cgb and ctb, the no-inducible globins of the foodborne bacterial pathogen c. jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative microaerophilic bacterium that occurs as  a common gut commensal in many food-producing animals and birds. contamination of meat during processing is an important route of transmission, and c. jejuni is now recognized as one of the most important causes of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide. c. jejuni is notable, but not unique, in possessing two different hemoglobins. the first is termed cgb and is a single-domain hemoglobin (i.e., having no other protein domain or cofactor) with clear structural similarities (3/3) with myoglobin, the heme domain of flavohemoglobins and vitreoscilla hemoglobin. it is well established that cgb plays a key role in providing resistance to c. jejuni in the face of no and other reactive nitrogen species that might be encountered in its environments. the second globin is ctb, a truncated globin (2/2trhb) in class iii, until recently the least well-understood class of these ubiquitous globins. in c. jejuni, both globin genes are members of a small regulon activated by the nssr protein, which acts as an no sensor and transcriptional regulator. in this contribution, we describe the cloning of both  the cgb and ctb genes from c. jejuni chromosomal dna, construction of expression  vectors in e. coli, and a simple purification procedure for each globin. a brief  account of the spectroscopic characteristics of both globins is presented.

TI  == hygiene indicator microorganisms for selected pathogens on beef, pork, and poultry meats in belgium.
AB  == several bacterial indicators are used to evaluate hygiene during the meat slaughtering process. the objectives of this study were to assess the belgian baseline data on hygienic indicators and the relationship between the indicators  and zoonotic agents to establish hygiene indicator criteria for cattle, pig, and  chicken carcasses and meat. the study used the results from the official belgian  surveillance plan from 2000 to 2003, which included the monitoring of escherichia coli counts (ecc), enterobacteriaceae counts (ec), aerobic colony counts (acc), and pseudomonas counts (pc). the sampling method was the wet and dry swabbing technique for cattle and pig carcasses and neck skin excision for broiler and layer chicken carcasses. the 75th and 95th percentiles of ecc were -0.20 and 0.95 log cfu/cm2 for cattle carcasses, 1.20 and 2.32 log cfu/cm2 for pig carcasses, and 4.05 and 5.24 log cfu/g for chicken carcasses. the acc were 2.1- to 4.5-log higher than the ecc for cattle, pigs, and chickens. for cattle and pig carcasses, a significant correlation between ecc, ec, and acc was found. ecc for pork and beef samples and ec in pig carcasses were significantly higher in samples contaminated with salmonella. in poultry samples, ecc were in general higher for  samples containing salmonella or campylobacter. thus, e. coli may be considered as a good indicator for enteric zoonotic agents such as salmonella for beef, pork, and poultry samples and for campylobacter in poultry samples.

TI  == a survey of food-borne pathogens in free-range poultry farms.
AB  == a survey of the occurrence of campylobacter, salmonella, listeria and shiga toxin-producing e. coli was performed on 60 flocks of free-range chicken from 34  farms in the basque country (northern spain). campylobacter was the most prevalent of the four pathogens, isolated in 70.6% of the farms, followed by l. monocytogenes (26.5%), and salmonella (2.9%). no e. coli o157 or other stec were  isolated. in total 48 flocks from 26 farms were positive for at least one pathogen: 31 of them for a single pathogen (64.6%), and 17 for more than one species (35.4%). c. coli was more prevalent than c. jejuni (15 vs. 13 farms), and both species of campylobacter were found in 3 farms. l. monocytogenes isolates were identified as serotype 4b complex, and the only salmonella isolated was serovar enteritidis. flaa pcr-rflp performed on 91 campylobacter isolates (36 c.  jejuni and 55 c. coli) yielded 26 patterns, with higher diversity among the c. jejuni isolates. more than one pattern was found in 11 farms, and in 8 of them several patterns were found within the same flock. the findings of the present study suggest that the free-range rearing conditions described herein might have  an advantageous effect on diminishing salmonella but not on campylobacter or l. monocytogenes flock contamination.

TI  == functional analysis of a campylobacter jejuni alkaline phosphatase secreted via the tat export machinery.
AB  == bacterial alkaline phosphatases (phoa) hydrolyse phosphate-containing substrates  to provide the preferred phosphorus source inorganic phosphate (p(i)). campylobacter jejuni does not contain a typical phoa homologue but contains a phosphatase that is regulated by the two-component system phoss/phosr. here we describe the characterization of the enzyme, its secretion pathway and its function in the bacterium's biology. phosphatase assays showed that the enzyme utilizes exclusively phosphomonoesters as a substrate, requires ca(2+) for its activity, and displays maximum activity at a ph of 10. gene disruption revealed that it is the sole alkaline phosphatase in c. jejuni. the protein contained a twin-arginine motif (rr) at its n terminus, typical of substrates of the tat secretion system. substitution of the twin-arginine residues showed that they are essential for enzyme activity. c. jejuni genome analysis indicated the presence of four ubiquitously expressed tat components that may form a functional tat secretion system as well as 11 putative tat substrates, including the alkaline phosphatase (phoa(cj)) and the nitrate reductase napa. inactivation of tatc caused defects in both phoa(cj) and napa activity as well as a reduction in bacterial growth that were all restored by complementation in trans with an intact tatc copy. the atypical overall features of the phoa(cj) compared to escherichia coli phoa support the existence in prokaryotes of a separate group of tat-dependent alkaline phosphatases, classified as the phox family.

TI  == new information about pediatric foodborne infections: the view from foodnet.
AB  == purpose of review: diarrheal illness is a significant burden to children and their parents. recent studies describing the etiologic agents that cause diarrheal illness and examining the risk factors for the most common bacterial enteric pathogens are presented. recent findings: the most common bacterial causes of diarrheal illness among children are campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., shigella spp. and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli. the highest incidence of both campylobacter and salmonella is among infants. risk factors for campylobacteriosis in this group include traveling outside the us, having a pet in the home with diarrhea and visiting or living on a farm. risk factors for salmonellosis include traveling outside the us, exposure to reptiles and attending day-care with another child with diarrhea. breastfeeding is a factor that protects against infection. summary: despite a limited diet, infants are at  risk of acquiring enteric pathogens that are commonly associated with consumption of contaminated food. exposure to these pathogens may be through cross-contamination in the home or the environment. educational measures that focus on improving prevention of exposure to infectious agents and an emphasis on eliminating cross-contamination are needed for parents and care-takers of this vulnerable population.

AB  == as part of a community screening study to assess the long-term health outcomes among residents of walkerton, ontario, after contamination of its municipal water supply by escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter in 2000, we identified 100 adults who had proteinuria and polyuria but no medical history or medication use  to explain their condition. fifty-six of the 100 participants underwent both initial and confirmatory urine concentration tests, which showed that their urine osmolality could reach normal levels. we then instructed them to reduce their fluid intake to less than 2 l/d for 1 week. the proteinuria and polyuria were largely reversed by this manoeuvre. we do not know at this time whether the proteinuria associated with excessive fluid intake in these otherwise healthy people will affect their kidney function in the long term.

TI  == arthritis risk after acute bacterial gastroenteritis.
AB  == objectives: reactive arthritis (rea) may occur from bacterial gastroenteritis. we studied the risk of arthritis after an outbreak of escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter species within a regional drinking water supply to examine the relationship between the severity of acute diarrhoea and subsequent symptoms of arthritis. methods: participants with no known history of arthritis before the outbreak participated in a long-term follow-up study. of the 2299 participants, 788 were asymptomatic during the outbreak, 1034 had moderate symptoms of acute gastroenteritis and 477 had severe symptoms that necessitated medical attention.  the outcomes of interest were new arthritis by self-report and a new prescription of medication for arthritis during the follow-up period. results: after a mean follow-up of 4.5 yrs after the outbreak, arthritis was reported in 15.7% of participants who had been asymptomatic during the outbreak, and in 17.6 and 21.6% of those who had moderate and severe symptoms of acute gastroenteritis, respectively (p-value for trend = 0.009). compared with the asymptomatic participants, those with moderate and severe symptoms of gastroenteritis had an adjusted relative risk of arthritis of 1.19 [95% confidence interval (ci) 0.99-1.43] and 1.33 (95% ci 1.07-1.66), respectively. no association was observed between gastroenteritis and the subsequent risk of prescription medication for arthritis (p = 0.49). conclusions: acute bacterial gastroenteritis necessitating  medical attention was associated with a higher risk of arthritic symptoms, but not arthritic medications, up to 4 yrs afterwards. the nature and chronicity of these arthritic symptoms requires further study.

TI  == knowledge and practice of foodborne disease clinical specimen testing and reporting in north carolina, 2004.
AB  == background: detection of foodborne disease outbreaks relies on health care practitioners (hcps), infection control practitioners (icps), and clinical laboratorians to report notifiable diseases to state or local health departments. methods: to examine knowledge and practices about notifiable foodborne disease reporting among hcps and icps in western north carolina and among clinical laboratorians statewide, participants responded to a self-administered questionnaire about foodborne pathogen testing and reporting, referencing campylobacter, shiga-toxin producing escherichia coli, and other organisms. results: three hundred seventy-two of 1442 health care providers participated in  this survey. of 372 study participants, fewer than 20% knew that both the clinician and the laboratorian were legally responsible for reporting the study pathogens. most laboratorians identified the icp (57%) as responsible for reporting. there was a lack of understanding about which infections and test results were reportable. limitations: the response rate was very low, particularly among hcps; participants may have been biased towards those with a particular interest in foodborne disease or surveillance. this descriptive study  cannot be used to determine rates of reporting among the medical community. conclusions: although not legally obliged to report, icps were found to play a significant role in disease reporting. dissemination of surveillance information  and training through the established network of north carolina icps may be ideal  for improving foodborne disease surveillance in this state.

TI  == factors and selenocysteine insertion sequence requirements for the synthesis of selenoproteins from a gram-positive anaerobe in escherichia coli.
AB  == selenoprotein synthesis in escherichia coli strictly depends on the presence of a specific selenocysteine insertion sequence (secis) following the selenocysteine-encoding uga codon of the respective mrna. it is recognized by the selenocysteine-specific elongation factor selb, leading to cotranslational insertion of selenocysteine into the nascent polypeptide chain. the synthesis of  three different selenoproteins from the gram-positive anaerobe eubacterium acidaminophilum in e. coli was studied. incorporation of (75)se into glycine reductase protein b (grdb1), the peroxiredoxin prxu, and selenophosphate synthetase (seld1) was negligible in an e. coli wild-type strain and was fully absent in an e. coli selb mutant. selenoprotein synthesis, however, was strongly  increased if selb and selc (trna(sec)) from e. acidaminophilum were coexpressed.  putative secondary structures downstream of the uga codons did not show any sequence similarity to each other or to the e. coli secis element. however, mutations in these structures strongly reduced the amount of (75)se-labeled protein, indicating that they indeed act as secis elements. uga readthrough mediated by the three different secis elements was further analyzed using gst-lacz translational fusions. in the presence of selb and selc from e. acidaminophilum, uga readthrough was 36 to 64% compared to the respective cysteine-encoding ugc variant. uga readthrough of secis elements present in desulfomicrobium baculatum (hydv), treponema denticola (seld), and campylobacter  jejuni (selw-like gene) was also considerably enhanced in the presence of e. acidaminophilum selb and selc. this indicates recognition of these secis elements and might open new perspectives for heterologous selenoprotein synthesis in e. coli.

TI  == microbial safety of meat in the european union.
AB  == the two most frequently reported zoonotic diseases in humans in the eu in 2005 were campylobacter and salmonella infections with incidences of 51.6 and 38.2 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. reported human infections caused by yersinia spp., verocytotoxigenic escherichia coli, and listeria monocytogenes had comparably lower incidences of 2.6, 1.2 and 0.3 cases per 100,000 population, respectively. meat and meat products are important sources for these infections but knowledge on exactly how important they are compared with other types of food, drinking water and environmental exposure is quite limited. occurrences of  zoonotic pathogens in raw meat are variable, although most often are between 1% and 10%, depending on the organism, geographical factors, farming and/or meat production practices, etc. zoonotic pathogens in meat have to be controlled through a complete, continuous farm-to-fork system. it is of utmost importance to control faecal contamination of carcasses through efficient haccp-based process hygiene management systems.

TI  == challenges to meat safety in the 21st century.
AB  == the safety of meat has been at the forefront of societal concerns in recent years, and indications exist that challenges to meat safety will continue in the  future. major meat safety issues and related challenges include the need to control traditional as well as "new," "emerging," or "evolving" pathogenic microorganisms, which may be of increased virulence and low infectious doses, or  of resistance to antibiotics or food related stresses. other microbial pathogen related concerns include cross-contamination of other foods and water with enteric pathogens of animal origin, meat animal manure treatment and disposal issues, foodborne illness surveillance and food attribution activities, and potential use of food safety programs at the farm. other issues and challenges include food additives and chemical residues, animal identification and traceability issues, the safety and quality of organic and natural products, the  need for and development of improved and rapid testing and pathogen detection methodologies for laboratory and field use, regulatory and inspection harmonization issues at the national and international level, determination of responsibilities for zoonotic diseases between animal health and regulatory public health agencies, establishment of risk assessment based food safety objectives, and complete and routine implementation of haccp at the production and processing level on the basis of food handler training and consumer education. viral pathogens will continue to be of concern at food service, bacterial pathogens such as escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella and campylobacter will continue affecting the safety of raw meat and poultry, while listeria monocytogenes will be of concern in ready-to-eat processed products. these challenges become more important due to changes in animal production, product processing and distribution; increased international trade; changing consumer needs and increased preference for minimally processed products; increased worldwide meat consumption; higher numbers of consumers at-risk for infection; and, increased interest, awareness and scrutiny by consumers, news media, and consumer activist groups. issues such as bovine sponginform encephalopathy will continue to be of interest mostly as a target for eradication, while viral agents affecting food animals, such as avian influenza,  will always need attention for prevention or containment.

TI  == outbreak of acute gastroenteritis of unknown etiology caused by contaminated drinking water in a rural village in austria, august 2006.
AB  == background: in august 2006 a physician from a rural village reported an outbreak  of acute gastroenteritis. an investigation was undertaken in order to determine the magnitude of the outbreak, the source of infection and to prevent further disease. this is the first published outbreak of acute gastroenteritis caused by  contaminated drinking water in austria. methods: for descriptive epidemiology, the investigators had to rely on voluntary cooperation from physicians and patients, data collected by a police officer and data on sick leave reported by physicians to the health insurance system. results: microbiological testing of water samples indicated that this cluster was caused by fecal contamination of untreated drinking water. age and sex distributions were available for 146 of 160 cases: ages ranged from 5 to 91 years (median 45) and 81 cases (55.5%) were female. stool samples from 14 patients were sent for microbiological analysis: all tested negative for salmonella, campylobacter, shigella and yersinia enterocolitica. specimens were not tested for viruses, parasites or enteropathogenic escherichia coli. discussion: in this outbreak no identification was made of pathogenic microorganisms in stool samples from affected patients, despite the occurrence of fecal indicator organisms in samples of drinking water. in outbreaks of gastroenteritis, medical practitioners should encourage microbiological testing beyond the limited routine program. public health officers must be made aware that the spectrum of routine laboratory tests on stool specimens does not cover the wide array of pathogens capable of causing waterborne outbreaks. the springs serving the affected village originate in a mountainous area of karst formations, and heavy falls of rain that occurred at the beginning of the outbreak may explain introduction of fecal bacteria. in view of the unsolved problem of possible future contamination of springs in karst areas, the water department of this district authority has issued an order requesting installation of a permanent ultraviolet water-treatment facility.

TI  == lfna from pseudomonas aeruginosa o12 and wbux from escherichia coli o145 encode membrane-associated proteins and are required for expression of 2,6-dideoxy-2-acetamidino-l-galactose in lipopolysaccharide o antigen.
AB  == the rare sugar 2,6-dideoxy-2-acetamidino-l-galactose (l-fucnam) is found only in  bacteria and is a component of cell surface glycans in a number of pathogenic species, including the o antigens of pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype o12 and escherichia coli o145. p. aeruginosa is an important opportunistic pathogen, and  the o12 serotype is associated with multidrug-resistant epidemic outbreaks. o145  is one of the classic non-o157 serotypes associated with shiga toxin-producing, enterohemorrhagic e. coli. the acetamidino (nam) moiety of l-fucnam is of interest, because at neutral ph it contributes a positive charge to the cell surface, and we aimed to characterize the biosynthesis of this functional group.  the pathway is not known, but expression of nam-modified sugars coincides with the presence of a psea homologue in the relevant biosynthetic locus. psea is a putative amidotransferase required for synthesis of a nam-modified sugar in campylobacter jejuni. in p. aeruginosa o12 and e. coli o145, the psea homologues  are lfna and wbux, respectively, and we hypothesized that these genes function in l-fucnam biosynthesis. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, western blotting, and nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the lfna mutant o-antigen structure indicated that the mutant expresses 2,6-dideoxy-2-acetamido-l-galactose (l-fucnac) in place of l-fucnam. the mutation could be complemented by expression of either his(6)-tagged lfna or wbux in trans, confirming that these genes are functional homologues and that they are required for nam moiety synthesis. both proteins retained their activity when fused to a his(6) tag and localized to the membrane fraction. these data will assist future biochemical investigation of this pathway.

TI  == ammonia disinfection of animal feeds --laboratory study.
AB  == animal feeds may be contaminated, accidentally or maliciously, with a number of zoonotic bacteria. animal infections with these bacterial agents, whether or not  they cause animal disease, may lead to human illnesses. anhydrous ammonia was introduced on farms in developed countries as a high-nitrogen soil amendment, but later found use in enhancing crude protein in low-quality roughage fed to ruminants and in neutralizing mycotoxins in fungus-infested feed grains. although ammonia has been known to be effective against bacteria in other contexts (e.g.,  manure, community sewage sludge, seeds for sprouting, and boneless lean beef trimmings), it appears that the antibacterial effect of ammoniating animal feeds  had not been tested. in the present study, samples of roughage (wheat straw, corn silage) and concentrates (corn grain, cottonseed) produced as animal feed were contaminated with dried-on zoonotic bacteria (salmonella newport in all; campylobacte jejuni, e. coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, yersinia enterocolitica in corn grain only). disinfection with anhydrous ammonia gas was conducted for 24 h at room temperature ( 25 degrees c). the treatment was least effective in silage because the silage alone showed strong antibacterial activity, which may have been slightly reduced by ammoniation. in the other three feeds, depending on the initial level of contamination, ammonia destruction of >or= 5 log10 cfu/g (99.999%) of the selected contaminant was usually observed.

AB  == strain nrrl b-30745, isolated from chicken ceca and identified as enterococcus durans, enterococcus faecium, or enterococcus hirae, was initially identified as  antagonistic to campylobacter jejuni. the isolate produced a 5,362-da bacteriocin (enterocin) that inhibits the growth of salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis,  s. enterica serovar choleraesuis, s. enterica serovar typhimurium, s. enterica serovar gallinarum, escherichia coli o157:h7, yersinia enterocolitica, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, shigella dysenteriae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, morganella morganii, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and 20  other campylobacter species isolates. the enterocin, e-760, was isolated and purified by cation-exchange and hydrophobic-interaction chromatographies. the proteinaceous nature of purified enterocin e-760 was demonstrated upon treatment  with various proteolytic enzymes. specifically, the antimicrobial peptide was found to be sensitive to beta-chymotrypsin, proteinase k, and papain, while it was resistant to lysozyme and lipase. the enterocin demonstrated thermostability  by retaining activity after 5 min at 100 degrees c and was stable at ph values between 5.0 and 8.7. however, activity was lost below ph 3.0 and above ph 9.5. administration of enterocin e-760-treated feed significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of young broiler chicks experimentally challenged and colonized  with two strains of c. jejuni by more than 8 log(10) cfu. enterocin e-760 also significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the colonization of naturally acquired campylobacter species in market age broiler chickens when administered in treated feed 4 days prior to analysis.

AB  == the popularity of open farms and petting zoos has increased markedly over the last 5 years, with most children in developed countries now having the opportunity to visit such a facility at some stage in their childhood, either through school or family visits. the open access policy of these establishments allows visitors to be in direct contact with animals such as sheep (lambs), goats, cats (kittens), dogs (puppies), and birds and to have the opportunity to feed such animals. this contact may lead to the transmission of microbial pathogens from animals to humans, e.g., escherichia coli o157:h7, resulting in human disease. this review outlines the causal organisms associated with such zoonoses, a description of previous outbreaks at farms and zoos, as well as infection control measures to help prevent such zoonotic infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in bacteria from swiss veal calves at slaughter.
AB  == bacteria with antimicrobial resistance can be transferred from animals to humans  and may compromise antimicrobial treatment in case of infection. to determine the antimicrobial resistance situation in bacteria from swiss veal calves, faecal samples from 500 randomly selected calves originating from 129 farms were collected at four big slaughterhouses. samples were cultured for escherichia coli, enterococcus sp. and campylobacter sp. and isolated strains were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility to selected antimicrobial agents by the minimal inhibitory concentration technique using the broth microdilution method. from 100 farms, data on farm management, animal husbandry and antimicrobial treatments of  the calves were collected by questionnaire. risk factors associated with antimicrobial resistance were identified by logistic regression. in total, 467 e. coli, 413 enterococcus sp. and 202 campylobacter sp. were isolated. of those, 68.7%, 98.7% and 67.8%, respectively, were resistant to at least one of the tested antimicrobial agents. resistance was mainly observed to antimicrobials frequently used in farm animals. prevalence of resistance to antimicrobials important for human treatment was generally low. however, a rather high number of quinupristin/dalfopristin-resistant enterococcus faecium and ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacter sp. were detected. external calf purchase,  large finishing groups, feeding of milk by-products and administration of antimicrobials through feed upon arrival of the animals on the farm significantly increased the risk of antimicrobial resistance at farm level. participation in a  quality assurance programme and injection of a macrolide upon arrival of the animals on the farm had a protective effect. the present study showed that veal calves may serve as a reservoir for resistant bacteria. to ensure food safety, veal calves should be included in the national monitoring programme for antimicrobial resistance in farm animals. by improving farm management and calf husbandry the prevalence of resistance may be reduced.

TI  == use of genomic dna control features and predicted operon structure in microarray  data analysis: arraylearna - a bayesian approach.
AB  == background: microarrays are widely used for the study of gene expression; however deciding on whether observed differences in expression are significant remains a  challenge. results: a computing tool (arraylearna) has been developed for gene expression analysis. it implements a bayesian approach which is based on the gumbel distribution and uses printed genomic dna control features for normalization and for estimation of the parameters of the bayesian model and prior knowledge from predicted operon structure. the method is compared with two  other approaches: the classical lowess normalization followed by a two fold cut-off criterion and the opwise method (price, et al. 2006. bmc bioinformatics.  7, 19), a published bayesian approach also using predicted operon structure. the  three methods were compared on experimental datasets with prior knowledge of gene expression. with arraylearna, data normalization is carried out according to the  genomic features which reflect the results of equally transcribed genes; also the statistical significance of the difference in expression is based on the variability of the equally transcribed genes. the operon information helps the classification of genes with low confidence measurements. arraylearna is implemented in visual basic and freely available as an excel add-in at http://www.ifr.ac.uk/safety/arraylearna/ conclusion: we have introduced a novel bayesian model and demonstrated that it is a robust method for analysing microarray expression profiles. arraylearna showed a considerable improvement in  data normalization, in the estimation of the experimental variability intrinsic to each hybridization and in the establishment of a clear boundary between non-changing and differentially expressed genes. the method is applicable to data derived from hybridizations of labelled cdna samples as well as from hybridizations of labelled cdna with genomic dna and can be used for the analysis of datasets where differentially regulated genes predominate.

TI  == quantitative microbial risk assessment of distributed drinking water using faecal indicator incidence and concentrations.
AB  == quantitative microbial risk assessments (qmra) have focused on drinking water system components upstream of distribution to customers, for nominal and event conditions. yet some 15-33% of waterborne outbreaks are reported to be caused by  contamination events in distribution systems. in the majority of these cases and  probably in all non-outbreak contamination events, no pathogen concentration data was available. faecal contamination events are usually detected or confirmed by the presence of e. coli or other faecal indicators, although the absence of this  indicator is no guarantee of the absence of faecal pathogens. in this paper, the  incidence and concentrations of various coliforms and sources of faecal contamination were used to estimate the possible concentrations of faecal pathogens and consequently the infection risks to consumers in event-affected areas. the results indicate that the infection risks may be very high, especially from campylobacter and enteroviruses, but also that the uncertainties are very high. the high variability of pathogen to thermotolerant coliform ratios estimated in environmental samples severely limits the applicability of the approach described. importantly, the highest ratios of enteroviruses to thermotolerant coliform were suggested from soil and shallow groundwaters, the most likely sources of faecal contamination that are detected in distribution systems. epidemiological evaluations of non-outbreak faecal contamination of drinking water distribution systems and thorough tracking and characterisation of the contamination sources are necessary to assess the actual risks of these events.

TI  == assessment of source water pathogen contamination.
AB  == during the last decade, the source to tap risk-based approach to pathogens in drinking water has been largely promoted. this paper addresses the issue of source water pathogen contamination, which is the first step of quantitative microbial risk assessment. it is focused on a selection of pathogens considered to be a major risk to human health. source water quality is highly variable and understanding the reasons for this variability is important as it will influence  the requirements for treatment, treatment efficiency and the resulting health risk associated with the finished water. a framework for source water microbial quality assessment based on catchment surveys and monitoring programmes was set and tested on ten water sources. the monitoring programmes included faecal indicators and pathogens, during both baseline and hazardous event conditions. concentrations varied greatly within and between systems. faecal indicators were  shown to be poor surrogates for pathogen presence and concentrations. there was no recurring evidence that the pathogens correlated together and links between microbial parameters appeared to be very site specific. such variability between  systems shows the importance of running local monitoring programs for use in risk assessment. finally, pathogen detection methods are not yet optimal due to their  sensitivity and to the lack of knowledge on viability and infectivity of pathogens. a great effort needs to be made in the future to ensure better quality data as this may have large implications in the statistical risk assessment calculations.

AB  == while the normal microbiota has been implicated as a critical defense against invading pathogens, the impact of enteropathogenic infection and host inflammation on intestinal microbial communities has not been elucidated. using mouse models of citrobacter rodentium, which closely mimics human diarrheal pathogens inducing host intestinal inflammation, and campylobacter jejuni infection, as well as chemically and genetically induced models of intestinal inflammation, we demonstrate that host-mediated inflammation in response to an infecting agent, a chemical trigger, or genetic predisposition markedly alters the colonic microbial community. while eliminating a subset of indigenous microbiota, host-mediated inflammation supported the growth of either the resident or introduced aerobic bacteria, particularly of the enterobacteriaceae family. further, assault by an enteropathogen and host-mediated inflammation combined to significantly reduce the total numbers of resident colonic bacteria.  these findings underscore the importance of intestinal microbial ecosystems in infectious colitis and noninfectious intestinal inflammatory conditions, such as  inflammatory bowel disease.

TI  == characterization of the alpha-2,8-polysialyltransferase from neisseria meningitidis with synthetic acceptors, and the development of a self-priming polysialyltransferase fusion enzyme.
AB  == glycoconjugates containing polysialic acid have many biological activities and represent target molecules for therapeutic interventions. enzymatic synthesis of  these glycoconjugates should give access to these important molecules to evaluate their potential. the polysialyltransferases from both neisseria meningitidis and  escherichia coli were cloned and expressed as recombinant proteins in e. coli. we have used synthetic acceptors to probe the acceptor requirement of these enzymes  and to examine the basic enzymology. the minimum number of sialic acid residues (neu5ac) on the acceptor for activity in vitro was shown to be 2 for both enzymes, but a large increase in activity was seen if the acceptor had three neu5ac residues. the polysialyltransferase from n. meningitidis generated longer  reaction products than the enzyme from e. coli on fchase acceptors. examination of the products showed them to be a heterogeneous mixture, but products with >50  neu5ac residues could be seen using capillary zone electrophoresis analyses. in addition we made fusion proteins of these polysialyltransferase enzymes with the  bifunctional alpha-2,3/alpha-2,8-sialyltransferase from campylobacter jejuni to create self priming polysialyltransferases. these bifunctional sialyltransferases utilized various synthetic disaccharide acceptors with a terminal galactose, and  we demonstrate here that the pst enzyme from n. meningitidis and its fusion protein with the c. jejuni sialyltransferase can be used to create polysialic acid on o-linked glycopeptides.

TI  == microbial groundwater quality and its health implications for a border-strip irrigated dairy farm catchment, south island, new zealand.
AB  == intensification of dairying on irrigated pastures has led to concern over the microbial quality of shallow groundwater used for drinking purposes. the effects  of intensive dairying and border-strip irrigation on the leaching of e. coli and  campylobacter to shallow groundwater were assessed over a three-year period in the waikakahi catchment, canterbury, new zealand. well selection excluded other sources of contamination so that the effect of dairying with border-strip irrigation could be assessed. groundwater samples (135) were collected, mostly during the irrigation season, with e. coli being detected in 75% of samples. campylobacter was identified in 16 samples (12%). a risk assessment of drinking water with these levels of campylobacter was undertaken. a probability distribution was fitted to the observed campylobacter data and the @risk modeling software was used, assuming a dose response relationship for campylobacter and consumption of 1 l/day of water. the probability of infection on any given day in the study area was estimated at 0.50% to 0.76%, giving an estimated probability of infection during the irrigation season of 60% to 75%. an epidemiological assessment of the canterbury region comparing areas encompassing dairy within major irrigation schemes (approximately 55% border-strip irrigation) to two control groups was undertaken. control group 1 (cg1) encompasses areas of dairying without major irrigation schemes, and a second larger control group (cg2) comprises the rest of the canterbury region. comparisons of the subject group to control groups indicated that there was a statistically significant increase in age-standardised rates of campylobacteriosis (cg1 relative risk (rr)=1.51 (95% ci = 1.31-1.75); cg2 rr = 1.51 (1.33-1.72)); cryptosporidiosis (cg1 rr = 2.08 (1.55-2.79); cg2 rr = 5.33 (4.12-6.90)); and salmonellosis (cg2 rr = 2.05 (1.55-2.71)).

TI  == evidence of lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacterial pathogens exposed to high-intensity pulsed-plasma gas discharges.
AB  == aims: to apply scanning electron microscopy, image analysis and a fluorescent viability stain to assess lethal and sublethal injury in food-borne bacteria exposed to pulsed-plasma gas discharges (ppgd). methods and results: the fluorescent redox probe 5-cyano-2,3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (ctc) was used for enumerating actively respiring cells of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium that were suspended in sterile water at 4 degrees c and exposed to separate ppgd and heat treatments. while there was good agreement between use of respiratory staining (rs) and direct-selective agar plate counting (pc) for enumerating untreated bacteria, there were c. 1 and 3 log-unit differences in surviving cell numbers per millilitre for test organisms subjected to ppgd and heat treatments respectively, when enumerated by these different viability indicators. ppgd-treated bacteria were markedly altered at the cellular level when examined by scanning electron microscopy. conclusions: use of this rs  method revealed that substantial subpopulations of test bacteria rendered incapable of forming colonies by separate ppgd and heat treatments may remain metabolically active. significance and impact of the study: use of this rs method offers interesting perspectives on assessing established and novel microbial inactivation methods, and may also provide a better understanding of mechanisms involved in microbial inactivation induced by high-intensity ppgd treatments.

TI  == the cytoplasmic phosphoproteome of the gram-negative bacterium campylobacter jejuni: evidence for modification by unidentified protein kinases.
AB  == we have undertaken a comprehensive analysis of cytoplasmic protein phosphorylation in campylobacter jejuni by mass spectrometric identification of phosphoproteins and localization of the sites of modification by phosphopeptide analyses. cell extracts, enriched for phosphoproteins using fe(iii) imac or commercial phosphoprotein purification kits, were analyzed by 1-d and 2-d sds-page and subjected to mass fingerprinting by in-gel tryptic digestion and maldi-tof ms. fifty-eight phosphopeptides were identified from 1-d gel bands by nano-lc-ms/ms and automated searching in a c. jejuni orf database resulting in the unequivocal identification of 36 phosphoproteins of diverse function. in addition to elongation factors and chaperonins, which have been reported to be phosphorylated in other bacteria, the major phosphoproteins included bacterioferritin and superoxide dismutase. the sequences around the phosphorylated ser and thr residues are indicative of specific kinases being responsible for some of the modifications. however, many of the other identified  proteins are enzymes that have phosphorylated substrates, including atp, hence other modifications may arise from autophosphorylation. comparative analyses of imac extracts from the escherichia coli strain ad202 and helicobacter pylori resulted in the identification of homologs of six of the c. jejuni phosphoproteins, though their overall phosphoproteome maps were distinctly different.

TI  == the growing threat of foodborne bacterial enteropathogens of animal origin.
AB  == campylobacter and salmonella species and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec; the majority of which are type o157:h7) efficiently enter the human food chain from infected or colonized animals. poultry contamination with campylobacter and/or salmonella species and produce contamination with stec have  become major public health challenges. the global food supply, which allows us to purchase desired items throughout the year, a growing interest in consuming fresh vegetables and fruits, and an increasing number of persons who consume foods at restaurants all assure that the health threats associated with these pathogens will continue. antibiotic use by humans and food animals selects for the development of resistance among campylobacter and salmonella strains, promoting invasive forms of infection and complicating therapy of illness. a comprehensive  public health approach is needed that focuses on disease surveillance and infection control in the food industry continuum, from harvesting and processing, to distribution, to later preparation in public eating establishments and in homes. good agricultural practices, including the hazard analysis and critical control point program and validation of critical infection-control points at all  stages of the food industry cycle, coupled with other food safety interventions,  including irradiation for certain higher-risk foods, should help us improve the quality of food with regard to microbials and reduce human disease.

TI  == incidence and persistence of zoonotic bacterial and protozoan pathogens in a beef cattle feedlot runoff control vegetative treatment system.
AB  == determining the survival of zoonotic pathogens in livestock manure and runoff is  critical for understanding the environmental and public health risks associated with these wastes. the occurrence and persistence of the bacterial pathogens escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter spp. in a passive beef cattle feedlot  runoff control-vegetative treatment system were examined over a 26-mo period. incidence of the protozoans cryptosporidium spp. and giardia spp. was also assessed. the control system utilizes a shallow basin to collect liquid runoff and accumulate eroded solids from the pen surfaces; when an adequate liquid volume is attained, the liquid is discharged from the basin onto a 4.5-ha vegetative treatment area (vta) of bromegrass which is harvested as hay. basin discharge transported e. coli o157, campylobacter spp., and generic e. coli into  the vta soil, but without additional discharge from the basin, the pathogen prevalences decreased over time. similarly, the vta soil concentrations of generic e. coli initially decreased rapidly, but lower residual populations persisted. isolation of cryptosporidium oocysts and giardia cysts from vta samples was infrequent, indicating differences in sedimentation and/or transport  in comparison to bacteria. isolation of generic e. coli from freshly cut hay from vta regions that received basin discharge (12 of 30 vs. 1 of 30 control samples)  provided evidence for the risk of contamination; however, neither e. coli o157 or campylobacter spp. were recovered from the hay following baling. this work indicates that the runoff control system is effective for reducing environmental  risk by containing and removing pathogens from feedlot runoff.

TI  == survival of indicator and pathogenic bacteria in bovine feces on pasture.
AB  == the survival of enteric bacteria was measured in bovine feces on pasture. in each season, 11 cow pats were prepared from a mixture of fresh dairy cattle feces and  sampled for up to 150 days. four pats were analyzed for escherichia coli, fecal streptococci, and enterococci, and four inoculated pats were analyzed for campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enterica. two pats were placed on drainage collectors, and another pat was fitted with a temperature probe. in the first 1 to 3 weeks, there were increases (up to 1.5 orders of magnitude) in the counts of enterococci (in four seasons), e. coli (three seasons), fecal streptococci (three seasons), and s. enterica (two seasons), but there was no increase in the counts  of c. jejuni. thereafter, the counts decreased, giving an average ranking of the  times necessary for 90% inactivation of c. jejuni (6.2 days from deposition) < fecal streptococci (35 days) < s. enterica (38 days) < e. coli (48 days) < enterococci (56 days). the pat temperature probably influenced bacterial growth,  but the pattern of increases and decreases was primarily determined by desiccation; growth occurred when the water content was greater than 80%, but at  a water content of 70 to 75% counts decreased. e. coli and enterococcus regrowth  appeared to result from pat rehydration. of 20 monthly leaching losses of e. coli, 16 were <10% of the total counts in the pat, and 12 were <1%. drainage losses of c. jejuni (generally <1%) were detected for only 1 to 2 months. although enterococci exhibited the best survival rate, higher final counts suggested that e. coli is the more practical indicator of bovine fecal pollution.

TI  == [infectious aetiologies of travelers' diarrhoea].
AB  == traveler's diarrhoea (td) occurs in 20 to 60% of european or north-american travelers in intertropical areas. following return from endemic zone, malaria must always be evocated in front of febrile diarrhoea. many causative infectious  agents are involved in td and their frequency may vary according to destination and seasons. the main agents involved in td are escherichia coli pathovars (especially enterotoxigenic and enteroaggregative e. coli) followed by enteroinvasive bacteria (campylobacter spp., shigella spp., salmonella enterica), enteric viruses (norovirus, rotavirus) and protozoa (gardia intestinalis, cryptosporidium parvum et entamoeba histolytica). the development of molecular biology methods as pcr may allow us to evaluate the relative frequency of these agents and especially of viral agents in td. protozoa and microsporidia are more  frequently isolated in persistent and chronic td, especially in compromised patients. a complete etiological research in routine microbiology laboratories is difficult and time-consuming, related to the high diversity of causative agents and the need for specific methods. implementation of laboratory diagnosis is highly recommended when diarrhoea is associated with fever or presence of blood in stools, immunosuppression, antibiotic treatment (clostridium difficile toxins) or in case of persistent/chronic diarrhoea. according to the high frequency of acquired antibiotic-resistance in enteric bacteria, an antibiogram must be performed for all causative bacterial agents.

AB  == viable but non-culturable (vbnc) bacteria concept has been defined in 1982 when it has been shown that there exists bacteria whose metabolic activity continue and which can have the ability to reproduce in suitable conditions although they  have lost their capability to reproduce in culture. recent studies have shown that most of the human pathogens (campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, francisella tularensis, helicobacter pylori, legionella pneumophila, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella spp., shigella spp., vibrio cholerae, v. parahaemolyticus, v. vulnificus) have vbnc form. the interest on this subject has increased due to the detection of some disinfection procedures such as pasteurization of milk and chlorinization of water, cause bacteria to switch to vbnc form. it is thought that, the bacteria in this form may have an important role in recurrent and drug resistant infections as well as infections of unknown origin. however, advanced studies should be done to clarify the role of vbnc bacteria in the setting of recurrent infections, together with their pathogenity and antibiotic resistance. in this review article, the importance of viable but non-culturable bacteria, their morphology,  metabolic and genetic properties, pathogenity, resuscitation and identification have been discussed.

TI  == partitioning of external and internal bacteria carried by broiler chickens before processing.
AB  == broiler chickens from the loading dock of a commercial processing plant were sampled to determine the incidence and counts of coliforms, escherichia coli, and pathogenic bacteria. feathers were removed by hand from ten 6-week-old chickens from each of seven different flocks and rinsed in 400 ml of 0.1% peptone water. heads and feet were removed and rinsed, and the picked carcass was also rinsed, each in 200 ml. the ceca, colon, and crop were aseptically removed and stomached  separately in 100 ml of peptone water. campylobacter was present in six of the seven flocks. salmonella was isolated from 50 of the 70 carcasses, with at least  2 positive carcasses in each flock, and five-tube most-probable-number (mpn) assays were performed on positive samples. significantly (p < 0.05) more coliforms and e. coli were found in the ceca than in the feathers, which in turn  carried more than the other samples, but total external and internal counts were  roughly equivalent. counts of campylobacter were higher in the ceca and colon than in the other samples. salmonella was isolated in external samples from 46 of the 50 positive carcasses compared with 26 positive internal samples or 17 positives in the ceca alone. the total mpn of salmonella was approximately equivalent in all samples, indicating that contamination was distributed through  all external and internal sampling locations. salmonella-positive samples did not carry higher counts of coliforms or e. coli, and there were no significant correlations between the indicators and pathogens in any sample. campylobacter numbers in the ceca were correlated with campylobacter numbers in the feathers and colon, but salmonella numbers in those samples were not correlated. the pattern of bacterial contamination before processing is complex and highly variable.

AB  == the inactivation of campylobacter jejuni and salmonella enterica, compared with escherichia coli, was determined in 100 l chambers of seawater and river water located at an outdoor site. the chambers (paired with dark controls) were seeded  with waste stabilization pond effluent and laboratory-cultured pathogens, and exposed to sunlight in summer and winter experiments. all sunlight inactivation (k(s)) rates, as a function of cumulative global solar radiation (insolation), were far higher than the corresponding dark (k(d)) rates, with a ranking (and average k(s) rates for seawater and river water, respectively) of: c. jejuni (3.23; 2.34)>s. enterica (0.51; 0.37)>e. coli (0.34; 0.26). all the t(90) (time to 90% inactivation) values were higher in winter than in summer, but there was far greater similarity between the summer and winter s(90) (insolation needed for 90% inactivation) values. the rapid inactivation of c. jejuni was attributed to a high susceptibility to photooxidative damage. the results suggest that, in sunlight-exposed waters, e. coli will be a more conservative indicator for c. jejuni than for s. enterica, and c. jejuni transmission as a pathogenic agent is  less likely than for s. enterica.

AB  == a study was conducted to investigate the effects of spray washing broiler carcasses with acidified electrolyzed oxidizing water (eo) or sodium hypochlorite (hocl) solutions for 5, 10, or 15 s. commercial broiler carcasses were contaminated with 0.1 g of broiler cecal contents inoculated with 10(5) cells of  campylobacter and 10(5) cells of nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella. numbers of  bacteria recovered from unwashed control carcasses were 6.7, 5.9, 6.3, and 3.9 log(10) cfu/ml for total aerobic bacteria, escherichia coli, campylobacter, and salmonella, respectively. washing in either eo (50 mg/l of sodium hypochlorite, ph 2.4, oxidation reduction potential of 1,180 mv) or hocl (50 mg/l of sodium hypochlorite, ph 8.0) significantly reduced the levels of bacteria recovered from carcasses (p < 0.05). carcasses washed with eo had slightly lower levels of total aerobic bacteria (0.3 log(10) cfu/ml) and e. coli (0.2 log(10) cfu/ml) than hocl-treated carcasses; however, populations of campylobacter and salmonella were comparable after washing in either solution. increasing the carcass washing time  from 5 to 10 s lowered the levels of total aerobic bacteria (6.1 vs. 5.8 log(10)  cfu/ml), e. coli (4.6 vs. 4.1 log(10) cfu/ml), campylobacter (5.2 vs. 4.2 log(10) cfu/ml), and salmonella (2.0 vs. 1.2 log(10) cfu/ml), but no further microbiological reductions occurred when washing time was extended from 10 to 15  s. data from the present study show that washing poultry carcasses with eo is slightly better (total aerobic bacteria and e. coli) or equivalent to (campylobacter and salmonella) washing with hocl. washing broiler carcasses for a period equivalent to 2 inside-outside bird washers (10 s) provided greater reductions in carcass bacterial populations than periods simulating 1 (5 s) or 3  inside-outside bird washers (15 s).

TI  == the role of gene fusions in the evolution of metabolic pathways: the histidine biosynthesis case.
AB  == background: histidine biosynthesis is one of the best characterized anabolic pathways. there is a large body of genetic and biochemical information available, including operon structure, gene expression, and increasingly larger sequence databases. for over forty years this pathway has been the subject of extensive studies, mainly in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica, in both of which details of histidine biosynthesis appear to be identical. in these two enterobacteria the pathway is unbranched, includes a number of unusual reactions, and consists of nine intermediates; his genes are arranged in a compact operon (hisgdc [nb]haf [ie]), with three of them (hisnb, hisd and hisie) coding for bifunctional enzymes. we performed a detailed analysis of his gene fusions in available genomes to understand the role of gene fusions in shaping this pathway. results: the analysis of hisa structures revealed that several gene elongation events are at the root of this protein family: internal duplication have been identified by structural superposition of the modules composing the tim-barrel protein. several his gene fusions happened in distinct taxonomic lineages; hisnb  originated within gamma-proteobacteria and after its appearance it was transferred to campylobacter species (epsilon-proteobacteria) and to some bacteria belonging to the cfb group. the transfer involved the entire his operon. the hisie gene fusion was found in several taxonomic lineages and our results suggest that it probably happened several times in distinct lineages. gene fusions involving hisie and hisd genes (his4) and hish and hisf genes (his7) took place in the eukarya domain; the latter has been transferred to some delta-proteobacteria. conclusion: gene duplication is the most widely known mechanism responsible for the origin and evolution of metabolic pathways; however, several other mechanisms might concur in the process of pathway assembly and gene fusion appeared to be one of the most important and common.

TI  == polyphosphate kinase 1 is a pathogenesis determinant in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is the leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world. despite its prevalence, relatively little is known about c. jejuni's precise pathogenesis mechanisms, particularly in comparison to other well-studied enteric organisms such as escherichia coli and salmonella spp. altered expression of phosphate genes in a c. jejuni stringent response mutant, together with known correlations between the stringent response, polyphosphate (poly-p), and virulence in other bacteria, led us to investigate the role of poly-p in c. jejuni stress survival and pathogenesis. all sequenced c. jejuni strains harbor a conserved putative polyphosphate kinase 1 predicted to be principally responsible for poly-p synthesis. we generated a targeted ppk1 deletion mutant (deltappk1) in c. jejuni strain 81-176 and found that deltappk1,  as well as the deltaspot stringent response mutant, exhibited low levels of poly-p at all growth stages. in contrast, wild-type c. jejuni poly-p levels increased significantly as the bacteria transitioned from log to stationary phase. phenotypic analyses revealed that the deltappk1 mutant was defective for survival during osmotic shock and low-nutrient stress. however, certain phenotypes associated with ppk1 deletion in other bacteria (i.e., motility and oxidative stress) were unaffected in the c. jejuni deltappk1 mutant, which also displayed an unexpected increase in biofilm formation. the c. jejuni deltappk1 mutant was also defective for the virulence-associated phenotype of intraepithelial cell survival in a tissue culture infection model and exhibited a striking, dose-dependent chick colonization defect. these results indicate that poly-p utilization and accumulation contribute significantly to c. jejuni pathogenesis and affect its ability to adapt to specific stresses and stringencies. furthermore, our study demonstrates that poly-p likely plays both similar and unique roles in c. jejuni compared to its roles in other bacteria and that poly-p metabolism is linked to stringent response mechanisms in c. jejuni.

TI  == a systematic review of the clinical, public health and cost-effectiveness of rapid diagnostic tests for the detection and identification of bacterial intestinal pathogens in faeces and food.
AB  == objectives: to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tests for the rapid diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning in clinical and public health practice and to estimate the cost-effectiveness of these assays in a hypothetical population in order to inform policy on the use of these tests. data sources: studies evaluating diagnostic accuracy of rapid tests were retrieved using electronic databases and handsearching reference lists and key journals. hospital laboratories and test manufacturers were contacted for cost data, and clinicians  involved in the care of patients with food poisoning were invited to discuss the  conclusions of this review using the nominal group technique. review methods: a systematic review of the current medical literature on assays used for the rapid  diagnosis of bacterial food poisoning was carried out. specific organisms under review were salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157, staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus. data extraction was undertaken using standardised data extraction forms. where a sufficient number of studies evaluating comparable tests were identified, meta-analysis was performed. a decision analytic model was developed, using effectiveness data from the review and cost data from hospitals and manufacturers, which contributed to an assessment of the cost-effectiveness of rapid tests in a hypothetical uk population. finally, diagnostic accuracy and cost-effectiveness results were presented to a focus group of gps, microbiologists and consultants in communicable disease control, to assess professional opinion on the use of rapid  tests in the diagnosis of food poisoning. results: good test performance levels were observed with rapid test methods, especially for polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays. the estimated levels of diagnostic accuracy using the area under the curve of the summary receiver operating characteristic curve was very high. indeed, although traditional culture is the natural reference test to use for comparative statistical analysis, on many occasions the rapid test outperforms culture, detecting additional 'truly' positive cases of food-borne illness. the significance of these additional positives requires further investigation. economic modelling suggests that adoption of rapid tests in combination with routine culture is unlikely to be cost-effective, however, as the cost of rapid technologies decreases; total replacement with rapid technologies may be feasible. conclusions: despite the relatively poor quality of reporting of studies evaluating rapid detection methods, the reviewed evidence shows that pcr  for campylobacter, salmonella and e. coli o157 is potentially very successful in  identifying pathogens, possibly detecting more than the number currently reported using culture. less is known about the benefits of testing for b. cereus, c. perfringens and s. aureus. further investigation is needed on how clinical outcomes may be altered if test results are available more quickly and at a greater precision than in the current practice of bacterial culture.

TI  == purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction studies of the soluble domain of the oligosaccharyltransferase stt3 subunit from the thermophilic archaeon pyrococcus furiosus.
AB  == oligosaccharyltransferase catalyzes the transfer of preassembled oligosaccharides onto asparagine residues in nascent polypeptide chains. the stt3 subunit is thought to bear the catalytic site. the c-terminal domain of the stt3 protein of  pyrococcus furiosus was expressed in escherichia coli cells. stt3 protein prepared from two different sources, the soluble fraction and the inclusion bodies, produced crystals that diffracted to 2.7 a. during crystallization screening, cocrystals of p. furiosus stt3 with an e. coli 50s ribosomal protein,  l7/l12, were accidentally obtained. this cross-species interaction is not biologically relevant, but may be used to design a built-in polypeptide substrate for the stt3 crystals.

TI  == variants of the beta 1,3-galactosyltransferase cgtb from the bacterium campylobacter jejuni have distinct acceptor specificities.
AB  == the gene clusters encoding the lipooligosaccharide biosynthesis glycosyltransferases from campylobacter jejuni have previously been divided in eight classes based on their genetic organization. here, three variants of the beta1,3-galactosyltransferase cgtb from two classes were purified as fusions with the maltose-binding protein (male) from escherichia coli and their acceptor preference was determined. the acceptor preference of each cgtb variant was directly related to the presence or absence of sialic acid in the acceptor, which correlated with the core oligosaccharide structure in vivo. the three variants were evaluated for their ability to use a derivitized monosaccharide, a gm2 ganglioside mimic, a ga2 ganglioside mimic as well as a peptide containing alpha-linked galnac. this characterization shows the flexibility of these galactosyltransferases for diverse acceptors. the cgtb variants were engineered via carboxy-terminal deletions and inversion of the gene fusion order. the combination of a 20 to 30 aa deletion in cgtb followed by male at its carboxy terminus significantly improved the glycosyltransferase activity (up to a 51.8-fold increase of activity compared to the full length enzyme) in all cases regardless of the acceptor tested. the improved enzyme cgtb(oh4384)deltac-male was used to galactosylate a glyco-peptide acceptor based on the interferon alpha2b protein o-linked glycosylation site as confirmed by the ce-ms analysis of the reaction products. this improved enzyme was also used successfully to galactosylate the human therapeutic protein ifnalpha2b[galnacalpha]. this constitutes the first report of the in vitro synthesis of the o-linked t-antigen  glycan on a human protein by a bacterial glycosyltransferase and illustrates the  potential of bacterial glycosyltransferases as tools for in vitro glycosylation of human proteins of therapeutic value.

TI  == establishment of procedures provoking sub-lethal injury of listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157 to serve method performance testing.
AB  == in this study procedures provoking sub-lethal injury for three different pathogens are described which may be used in determination of accuracy and robustness of methods, comparison studies and or validation of rapid detection methods. three common food-borne pathogens were used, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157. the pathogens were exposed to heat stress, cold stress, freeze stress, acid stress, oxidative stress and "food" stress. sub-lethal injury was determined by plating in parallel on selective and  non-selective media. the statistical significant differences in enumeration were  established. the choice of stress to create sub-lethal injury to cells depended on the fact that the procedure must be easy to handle, repeatable and relevant for stress conditions in foods, but also on the micro-organism itself. oxidative  stress (1000 microm h(2)o(2)) was chosen to impose sub-lethal injury on l. monocytogenes and a specific "food" stress for e. coli o157. for c. jejuni a specific "food" stress as well as the oxidative stress (750 microm h(2)o(2)) were capable of creating a standardized procedure of provoking injury.

TI  == survival of campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli in groundwater during prolonged starvation at low temperatures.
AB  == aims: to evaluate the survival of campylobacter jejuni relative to that of escherichia coli in groundwater microcosms varying in nutrient composition. methods and results: studies were conducted in groundwater and deionized water incubated for up to 470 days at 4 degrees c. samples were taken for culturable and total cell counts, nutrient and molecular analysis. die-off in groundwater microcosms was between 2.5 and 13 times faster for c. jejuni than for e. coli. campylobacter jejuni had the lowest decay rate and longest culturability in microcosms with higher dissolved organic carbon (4 mg l(-1)). escherichia coli survival was the greatest when the total dissolved nitrogen (12.0 mg l(-1)) was high. the transition of c. jejuni to the coccoid stage was independent of culturability. conclusion: the differences in the duration of survival and response to water nutrient composition between the two organisms suggest that e.  coli may be present in the waters much longer and respond to water composition much differently than c. jejuni. significance and impact of the study: the data from these studies would aid in the evaluation of the utility of e. coli as an indicator of c. jejuni. this study also provided new information about the effect of nutrient composition on c. jejuni viability.

TI  == cj0011c, a periplasmic single- and double-stranded dna-binding protein, contributes to natural transformation in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important bacterial pathogen causing gastroenteritis in humans. c. jejuni is capable of natural transformation, which is considered a  major mechanism mediating horizontal gene transfer and generating genetic diversity. despite recent efforts to elucidate the transformation mechanisms of c. jejuni, the process of dna binding and uptake in this organism is still not well understood. in this study, we report a previously unrecognized dna-binding protein (cj0011c) in c. jejuni that contributes to natural transformation. cj0011c is a small protein (79 amino acids) with a partial sequence homology to the c-terminal region of comea in bacillus subtilis. cj0011c bound to both single- and double-stranded dna. the dna-binding activity of cj0011c was demonstrated with a variety of dnas prepared from c. jejuni or escherichia coli,  suggesting that the dna binding of cj0011c is not sequence dependent. deletion of the cj0011c gene from c. jejuni resulted in 10- to 50-fold reductions in the natural transformation frequency. different from the b. subtilis comea, which is  an integral membrane protein, cj0011c is localized in the periplasmic space of c. jejuni. these results indicate that cj0011c functions as a periplasmic dna receptor contributing to the natural transformation of c. jejuni.

TI  == explaining unexplained diarrhea and associating risks and infections.
AB  == gastrointestinal illnesses are common afflictions. however, knowledge of their etiology is often lacking. moreover, most cases of infections with reportable enteric pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, shigella, yersinia, cryptosporidia and giardia) have sporadic modes of acquisition, yet control measures are often biased towards mitigation of risks discerned by outbreak analysis. to determine the etiology of unexplained diarrhea it is important to study populations that can be matched to appropriate controls  and to couple thorough classic microbiologic evaluation on receipt of specimens with archiving and outgrowth capabilities. research evaluations should address the potential roles of a broad panel of candidate bacterial pathogens including diarrheagenic e. coli, listeria monocytogenes, helicobacters and jejuni campylobacters, and also apply novel massively parallel sequencing and nucleic acid detection technologies that allow the detection of viral pathogens. to fill  voids in our knowledge regarding sources of known enteric pathogens it will be critical to extend case-control studies to assess risk factors and exposures to patients with non-epidemic illnesses and to appropriate controls. by filling these gaps in our knowledge it should be possible to formulate rational prevention mechanisms for human gastrointestinal illnesses.

TI  == salmonella, campylobacter and enterococcus spp.: their antimicrobial resistance profiles and their spatial relationships in a synoptic study of the upper oconee  river basin.
AB  == rivers may serve as reservoirs for enteric organisms. very little is known about  the boundaries of microbial communities in moving bodies of water so this study was undertaken to find the limits of distribution of some bacteria, focusing on enteric organisms. the presence of salmonella, campylobacter, and enterococcus spp. and the antimicrobial resistance phenotypes carried by these organisms was evaluated for the upper oconee river basin, a small river in the lower piedmont of northeastern georgia, usa. samples were obtained from 83 sites during a 3-h period on a spring day (april 2005) in an approximately 30 x 20 km region. campylobacter spp. was isolated at 12 sites. the campylobacter isolates from three sites were resistant to tetracycline. of the five short-variable region (svr) subtypes of campylobacter that were found, three were found at more than one site, two types were found twice, and one subtype was found three times. enterococcus was isolated at 71 sites. e. casseliflavus was the most common species. based on species identification and antimicrobial resistance patterns, 24 types of enterococcus were found. salmonella was isolated from 62 sites. of the 19 salmonella serovars that were isolated, serovar muenchen accounted for about 20% of the isolates. the next three most common serovars isolated, rubislaw, hartford, and give, accounted for about 44% of the river isolates. antimicrobial resistance profiling offered limited differentiation of salmonella  isolates because only seven isolates were resistant to any antimicrobial. the sites at which salmonella, campylobacter, or enterococcus were isolated did not correlate with each other or with the total coliform number or escherichia coli count for the site. however, isolates of some of the same species and type occurred in clusters that were restricted to areas within 5 to 6 km.

TI  == postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome: a long-term consequence of bacterial gastroenteritis.
AB  == irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) is a commonly diagnosed disease characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms that may be associated with psychological illness and emotional problems. the prevalence rate worldwide for ibs ranges from 10 to 20% and is higher for women than for men. ibs imposes a substantial financial burden  on both patients and employers because of increased medical costs and decreased work productivity. recent studies indicate that inflammatory processes involving  the gastrointestinal tract are strongly correlated with ibs. acute bacterial gastroenteritis has been linked with the onset of symptoms in approximately 15% of patients diagnosed with ibs; these cases have been called postinfectious ibs.  organisms commonly associated with postinfectious ibs include the foodborne pathogens campylobacter, escherichia coli, salmonella, and shigella. the pathologic changes associated with postinfectious ibs are likely due to inflammatory reactions induced by the infecting organisms. postinfectious ibs should be recognized as a potential long-term consequence of foodborne gastroenteritis.

TI  == pathogen and indicator variability in a heavily impacted watershed.
AB  == water samples were collected from 36 locations within the grand river watershed,  in southwestern ontario, canada from july 2002 to december 2003 and were analyzed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, escherichia coli, escherichia coli o157:h7, and thermophilic campylobacter spp. a subset of samples was also analyzed for cryptosporidium spp., giardia spp., culturable human enteric viruses, and clostridium perfringens. storm and snowmelt events were sampled at two locations  including a drinking water intake. for the majority of the events, the spearman rank correlation test showed a positive correlation between e. coli levels and turbidity. peaks in pathogen numbers frequently preceded the peaks in numbers of  indicator organisms and turbidity. pathogen levels sometimes decreased to undetectable levels during an event. as pathogen peaks did not correspond to turbidity and indicator peaks, the correlations were weak. weak correlations may  be the result of differences in the sources of the pathogens, rather than differences in pathogen movement through the environment. results from this investigation have implications for planning monitoring programs for water quality and for the development of pathogen fate and transport models to be used  for source water risk assessment.

TI  == the protein network of bacterial motility.
AB  == motility is achieved in most bacterial species by the flagellar apparatus. it consists of dozens of different proteins with thousands of individual subunits. the published literature about bacterial chemotaxis and flagella documented 51 protein-protein interactions (ppis) so far. we have screened whole genome two-hybrid arrays of treponema pallidum and campylobacter jejuni for ppis involving known flagellar proteins and recovered 176 and 140 high-confidence interactions involving 110 and 133 proteins, respectively. to explore the biological relevance of these interactions, we tested an escherichia coli gene deletion array for motility defects (using swarming assays) and found 159 gene deletion strains to have reduced or no motility. comparing our interaction data with motility phenotypes from e. coli, bacillus subtilis, and helicobacter pylori, we found 23 hitherto uncharacterized proteins involved in motility. integration of phylogenetic information with our interaction and phenotyping data reveals a conserved core of motility proteins, which appear to have recruited many additional species-specific components over time. our interaction data also  predict 18,110 interactions for 64 flagellated bacteria.

TI  == a bacterial virulence factor with a dual role as an adhesin and a solute-binding  protein: the crystal structure at 1.5 a resolution of the peb1a protein from the  food-borne human pathogen campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the peb1a protein is an antigenic factor exposed on the surface of the food-borne human pathogen campylobacter jejuni, which has a major role in adherence and host colonisation. peb1a is also the periplasmic binding protein component of an aspartate/glutamate abc transporter essential for optimal microaerobic growth on  these dicarboxylic amino acids. here, we report the crystal structure of peb1a at 1.5 a resolution. the protein has a typical two-domain alpha/beta structure, characteristic of periplasmic extracytoplasmic solute receptors and a chain topology related to the type ii subfamily. an aspartate ligand, clearly defined by electron density in the interdomain cleft, forms extensive polar interactions  with the protein, the majority of which are made with the larger domain. arg89 and asp174 form ion-pairing interactions with the main chain alpha-carboxyl and alpha-amino-groups, respectively, of the ligand, while arg67, thr82, lys19 and tyr156 co-ordinate the ligand side-chain carboxyl group. lys19 and arg67 line a positively charged groove, which favours binding of asp over the neutral asn. the ligand-binding cleft is of sufficient depth to accommodate a glutamate. this is the first structure of an abc-type aspartate-binding protein, and explains the high affinity of the protein for aspartate and glutamate, and its much weaker binding of asparagine and glutamine. stopped-flow fluorescence spectroscopy indicates a simple bimolecular mechanism of ligand binding, with high association rate constants. sequence alignments and phylogenetic analyses revealed peb1a homologues in some gram-positive bacteria. the alignments suggest a more distant  homology with glti from escherichia coli, a known glutamate and aspartate-binding protein, but lys19 and tyr156 are not conserved in glti. our results provide a structural basis for understanding both the solute transport and adhesin/virulence functions of peb1a.

TI  == a proteome-wide protein interaction map for campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == background: data from large-scale protein interaction screens for humans and model eukaryotes have been invaluable for developing systems-level models of biological processes. despite this value, only a limited amount of interaction data is available for prokaryotes. here we report the systematic identification of protein interactions for the bacterium campylobacter jejuni, a food-borne pathogen and a major cause of gastroenteritis worldwide. results: using high-throughput yeast two-hybrid screens we detected and reproduced 11,687 interactions. the resulting interaction map includes 80% of the predicted c. jejuni nctc11168 proteins and places a large number of poorly characterized proteins into networks that provide initial clues about their functions. we used  the map to identify a number of conserved subnetworks by comparison to protein networks from escherichia coli and saccharomyces cerevisiae. we also demonstrate  the value of the interactome data for mapping biological pathways by identifying  the c. jejuni chemotaxis pathway. finally, the interaction map also includes a large subnetwork of putative essential genes that may be used to identify potential new antimicrobial drug targets for c. jejuni and related organisms. conclusion: the c. jejuni protein interaction map is one of the most comprehensive yet determined for a free-living organism and nearly doubles the binary interactions available for the prokaryotic kingdom. this high level of coverage facilitates pathway mapping and function prediction for a large number of c. jejuni proteins as well as orthologous proteins from other organisms. the broad coverage also facilitates cross-species comparisons for the identification  of evolutionarily conserved subnetworks of protein interactions.

TI  == blood group antigen recognition by escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin.
AB  == in a number of bacterial infections, such as helicobacter pylori, campylobacter jejuni and vibrio cholerae infections, a correlation between the severity of disease and blood group phenotype of infected individuals has been observed. in the present investigation, we have studied the molecular basis of this effect for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) infections. etec are non-invasive bacteria, which act through second messenger pathways to cause diarrhea. it has been suggested that the major virulence factor of etec from human isolates, i.e.  the human heat-labile enterotoxin (hlt), recognizes certain blood group epitopes, although the molecular basis of blood group antigen recognition is unknown. the 2.5 a crystal structure of the receptor-binding b-subunit of hlt in complex with  the blood group a antigen analog galnacalpha3(fucalpha2)galbeta4(fucalpha3)glcbeta provides evidence of a previously unknown binding site in the native toxin. the structure reveals the molecular interactions underlying blood group antigen recognition and suggests how this protein can discriminate between different blood group epitopes. these results support the previously debated role of hlt in the blood group dependence  of etec infections. similar observations regarding the closely related cholera toxin in v. cholera infections are also discussed.

TI  == infection-induced antibodies against the major outer membrane protein of campylobacter jejuni mainly recognize conformational epitopes.
AB  == the major outer membrane protein (momp) of campylobacter jejuni is an abundant surface protein with a pore-forming function and may be a potential candidate for vaccine development. despite the fact that momp is immunogenic and the recombinant momp (rmomp) can be readily produced in escherichia coli, the nature  of the antibody response to momp during in vivo infection is not well understood. in this study, various methods involving detergent replacement and liposome reconstitution were used to refold rmomp, and antibody responses to momp elicited in campylobacter-colonized chickens were evaluated using sera from chickens either naturally or experimentally infected by c. jejuni. the results demonstrated that proteoliposomes restored the reactivity of rmomp to rabbit antibodies elicited by native momp, indicating the recovery of native momp conformation by this refolding method. importantly, sera from naturally or experimentally infected chickens reacted weakly with denatured rmomp, but strongly with rmomp reconstituted in proteoliposome, suggesting that the chicken  antibody response to momp is predominantly directed against conformational epitopes. these observations provide direct evidence for conformation-dependent humoral responses to momp induced by campylobacter infection, demonstrate that c. jejuni momp is immunogenic in its natural host and suggest that proteoliposomes may be potentially used for the evaluation of rmomp-based vaccines.

TI  == development of experimental genetic tools for campylobacter fetus.
AB  == molecular analysis of the virulence mechanisms of the emerging pathogen campylobacter fetus has been hampered by the lack of genetic tools. we report the development and functional analysis of escherichia coli-campylobacter shuttle vectors that are appropriate for c. fetus. some vectors were constructed based on the known campylobacter coli plasmid pip1455 replicon, which confers a wide host  range in campylobacter spp. versatility in directing gene expression was achieved by introducing a strong c. fetus promoter. the constructions carry features necessary and sufficient to detect the expression of phenotypic markers, including molecular reporter genes in both subspecies of c. fetus, while retaining function in c. jejuni. the capacity to express several gene products from different vectors in a single host can be advantageous but requires distinct plasmid replicons. to this end, replication features derived from a cryptic plasmid of c. fetus subsp. venerealis strain 4111/108, designated pcfv108, were adapted for a compatible series of constructions. the substitution of the c. coli replication elements reduced vector size while apparently limiting the host range to c. fetus. the complementation of a ciprofloxacin-resistant mutant phenotype via vector-driven gyra expression was verified. cocultivation demonstrated that shuttle vectors based on the pcfv108 replicon were compatible with pip1455 replication functions, and the stable maintenance of two plasmids in a c. fetus subsp. venerealis host over several months was observed. the application of both  vector types will facilitate the investigation of the genetics and cellular interactions of the emerging pathogen c. fetus.

AB  == during processing, fecal material may contact broiler carcasses externally or internally. a study was conducted to determine the effect of external vs. internal fecal contamination on numbers of bacteria on broiler carcasses. in each of 3 trials, 12 carcasses just prior to evisceration were obtained from a commercial processing plant, placed on a shackle line, and eviscerated with commercial equipment in a pilot scale processing plant. also, approximately 20 intestinal tracts were collected from the processing plant; then cecal contents were collected and pooled. one gram of cecal content was placed on the exterior breast skin (external), inside the carcass cavity (internal), or not applied (control). all carcasses were held 10 min, then placed on the shackle line and passed through a commercial inside-outside bird washer set at 552 kpa, 5 s dwell  time, using approximately 189 l per min of tap water at ambient temperature. after a 1-min drip, whole carcass rinses were conducted on each carcass, and coliforms, escherichia coli, and campylobacter counts were determined and reported as log cfu/ml of rinse. external carcass contamination resulted in significantly higher (p<0.05) coliform, e. coli, and campylobacter numbers than internal contamination (5.0 vs. 4.5, 4.9 vs. 4.2, and 3.6 vs. 2.6, respectively). control carcass counts were significantly lower than external or internal carcass contamination counts for coliforms (3.7), e. coli (3.6), and campylobacter (2.2). external contamination resulted in higher numbers of bacteria after carcass washing, but carcasses with internal contamination still have higher numbers of bacteria after washing than carcasses without applied contamination.

TI  == aerobic and anaerobic microbiology of the immersion chilling procedure during poultry processing.
AB  == the development of treatments to reduce bacterial numbers on poultry carcasses is important for the overall hygienic quality of birds. the important washing effect of the immersion chilling procedure is discussed. systematic monitoring of fecal  bacterial indicators as well as some classic pathogens was performed at selected  critical points in a water chiller ecosystem. clostridium perfringens, fecal coliforms, enterococcus sp., and streptococcus sp. were found in all water chiller samples. the temperature of the chiller ecosystem varied according to location: escherichia coli and salmonella sp. were found at 16 degrees c, compared with the 4 degrees c location, where these species were found in lower numbers. moreover, the psychrotrophic bacterium pseudomonas was found only at this last location. the temperature of the water during the immersion chilling procedure was unfavorable for the growth of campylobacter sp., whose presence was always strictly associated with a ph close to 6. spore forms of c. perfringens were persistent in all locations and seemed to be a reliable indicator of contamination of the water chiller ecosystem.

TI  == microbiological safety of retail vacuum-packed and modified-atmosphere-packed cooked meats at end of shelf life.
AB  == a study of retail modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed cooked ready-to-eat meats was undertaken from september through mid-november 2003 to determine the microbiological quality at the end of shelf life and to establish any risk factors in the production, storage, and display of this product. examination of 2,981 samples using microbiological guidelines criteria revealed that 66% were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiology quality, 33% were of unsatisfactory quality mainly due to high aerobic colony counts and enterobacteriaceae concentrations, and 1% were of unacceptable quality due to the presence of listeria monocytogenes at 100 cfu/g or higher (27 samples; range of 10(2) to 106 cfu/g) and campylobacter jejuni (1 sample), indicating a risk to health. all samples at the end of the shelf life had satisfactory (<20 cfu/g) and/or acceptable (<102 cfu/g) levels of staphylococcus aureus and clostridium perfringens, four samples (<1%) had unsatisfactory levels of escherichia coli (range of 102 to 106 cfu/g) and 5.5% of the samples contained l. monocytogenes at <20 cfu/g (4.8%) or between 20 and 100 cfu/g (0.7%). more samples of chicken (45%; 224 of 495 samples), beef (43%; 160 of 371 samples), and turkey (41%; 219 of 523 samples) were of unsatisfactory or unacceptable quality compared with ham  (23%; 317 of 1,351 samples) or pork (32%; 67 of 206 samples). twelve different l. monocytogenes typing characters (serotype-amplified fragment length polymorphism  type-phage type) were evaluated for isolates recovered from samples of unacceptable quality, and the 1/2-ix-nt type was recovered from almost half (48%) of these samples. salmonella was not detected in any samples examined. risk factors identified for cooked meats that were microbiologically contaminated more frequently included vacuum packaging, packaging on retail premises, slicing, temperature not monitored in display units, and no hazard analysis system in place. results from this study also suggest that the shelf life assigned to some  modified-atmosphere-packed and vacuum-packed meats may not be appropriate.

TI  == flavodoxin:quinone reductase (fqrb): a redox partner of pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase that reversibly couples pyruvate oxidation to nadph production in  helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == pyruvate-dependent reduction of nadp has been demonstrated in cell extracts of the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori. however, nadp is not a substrate  of purified pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (pfor), suggesting that other redox active enzymes mediate this reaction. here we show that fqrb (hp1164), which is essential and highly conserved among the epsilonproteobacteria, exhibits nadph oxidoreductase activity. fqrb was purified by nickel interaction chromatography following overexpression in escherichia coli. the protein contained flavin adenine dinucleotide and exhibited nadph quinone reductase activity with menadione or benzoquinone and weak activity with cytochrome c, molecular oxygen, and 5,5'-dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid (dtnb). fqrb exhibited  a ping-pong catalytic mechanism, a k(cat) of 122 s(-1), and an apparent k(m) of 14 mum for menadione and 26 mum for nadph. fqrb also reduced flavodoxin (flda), the electron carrier of pfor. in coupled enzyme assays with purified pfor and flda, fqrb reduced nadp in a pyruvate- and reduced coenzyme a (coa)-dependent manner. moreover, in the presence of nadph, co(2), and acetyl-coa, the pfor:flda:fqrb complex generated pyruvate via co(2) fixation. pfor was the rate-limiting enzyme in the complex, and nitazoxanide, a specific inhibitor of pfor of h. pylori and campylobacter jejuni, also inhibited nadp reduction in cell-free lysates. these capnophilic (co(2)-requiring) organisms contain gaps in  pathways of central metabolism that would benefit substantially from pyruvate formation via co(2) fixation. thus, fqrb provides a novel function in pyruvate metabolism and, together with production of superoxide anions via quinone reduction under high oxygen tensions, contributes to the unique microaerobic lifestyle that defines the epsilonproteobacterial group.

TI  == detection by pcr of eight groups of enteric pathogens in 4,627 faecal samples: re-examination of the english case-control infectious intestinal disease study (1993-1996).
AB  == the english case-control infectious intestinal disease study (1993-1996) failed to detect an enteric pathogen or toxin in 49% of cases of gastroenteritis. in the present study, polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assays were applied to dna and cdna generated from 4,627 faecal samples from cases and controls archived during  the original study for the detection of norovirus, rotavirus, sapovirus, campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., enteroaggregative escherichia coli, cryptosporidium spp., and giardia spp. the percentage of archived samples from cases and from controls in which at least one agent (or toxin) was detected increased from 53% in the original study to 75% and from 19 to 42%, respectively, after the application of pcr assays. among cases, the following percentages of enteric pathogens were detected: norovirus 36%, rotavirus a 31%, sapovirus 4%, salmonella spp. 6%, campylobacter jejuni 13%, campylobacter coli 2%, other campylobacter spp. 8%, enteroaggregative e. coli 6%, giardia spp. 2%, and cryptosporidium spp. 2%. the present study provides additional insight into the aetiology of infectious intestinal disease in england and highlights the occurrence of viral infections in cases as well as in asymptomatic individuals. other notable findings include the frequent presence of campylobacter spp. other  than c. jejuni or c. coli, the high frequency of multiple agents in 41% of cases  and in 13% of controls, and the variation in the aetiology and rate of infection  found for different age groups. the results demonstrate the greater sensitivity of pcr-based methods compared to current conventional methods.

AB  == foodborne illnesses are a substantial health burden in the united states. the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) of cdc's emerging infections program collects data from 10 u.s. states regarding diseases caused by enteric pathogens transmitted commonly through food. foodnet quantifies and monitors the incidence of these infections by conducting active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-confirmed illnesses. this report describes preliminary surveillance data for 2006 and compares them with baseline data from  the period 1996-1998. incidence of infections caused by campylobacter, listeria,  shigella, and yersinia has declined since the baseline period. incidence of infections caused by shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli o157 (stec o157) and  salmonella, however, did not decrease significantly, and vibrio infections have increased, indicating that further measures are needed to prevent foodborne illness and achieve national health objectives.

AB  == in austria, a total of 606 food borne outbreaks, affecting 1,910 people altogether (including 368 hospitalized patients and 1 fatal outcome) were documented in 2005. salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. accounted for 99% of all reported outbreaks. fortysix (8%) of the 606 outbreaks were acquired abroad.  bacteria caused all but one of the 560 domestically acquired food borne outbreaks: 427 (76%) were due to salmonella spp., 128 (23%) due to campylobacter  spp. and two outbreaks each due to enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli and yersinia enterocolitica. norovirus caused an outbreak affecting 22 persons. the respective hospitalization rate for domestically acquired salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. infections was 20% and 16%. of those outbreaks where information as to the source was provided, eggs were implicated in 57%, meat products (especially poultry) in 30% and milk or dairy products (especially raw milk) in 4%. the ratio between family outbreaks and general outbreaks was 89% to  11%. for general outbreaks the following locations of exposure were given: commercial food suppliers (incl. restaurants, cafeterias) 34 x, family celebrations 14 x, nursery schools 4 x, festivities (e.g. fairs) 3 x, nursing homes twice and once a mixed outbreak involving commercial food suppliers plus homes (austria-wide s. enteritidis pt19 outbreak). in our opinion, the relatively high number of family outbreaks merely reflects the still insufficient quality of epidemiological outbreak investigation in austria, i.e. lack of consolidating individual clusters into larger food borne outbreaks which exceed district or provincial borders.

TI  == influence of thymol and a urease inhibitor on coliform bacteria, odor, urea, and  methane from a swine production manure pit.
AB  == pathogens, ammonia, odor, and greenhouse gas emissions are serious environmental  concerns associated with swine production. this study was conducted in two manure pits (33,000 l each) to determine the influence of 1.5 or 3.0 g thymol l(-1) and  80 mg l(-1) urease inhibitor amendments on urea accumulation, coliform bacteria,  odor, and methane emission. each experiment lasted 18 or 19 d, during which time  30 to 36 250-ml samples (six per day) were withdrawn from underneath each pit and analyzed for urea, thymol, volatile fatty acids, coliform bacteria, and campylobacter. at the end of each experiment, six 50-g samples from each pit were placed in serum bottles, and gas volume and composition were determined periodically for 28 d. compared with the control pit, volatile fatty acids production was reduced 64 and 100% for the thymol amendments of 1.5 and 3.0 g l(-1), respectively. viable coliform cells were reduced 4.68 and 5.88 log10 colony-forming units kg(-1) of slurry for the 1.5 and 3.0 g thymol l(-1), respectively, and escherichia coli were reduced 4.67 and 5.01 log10 colony-forming units kg(-1) of slurry, respectively. campylobacter was not detected in the pits treated with thymol, in contrast to 63% of the samples being positive for the untreated pit. urea accumulated in the treated pits from day 3 to 6. total gas production from serum bottles was reduced 65 and 76% for thymol amendments of 1.5 and 3.0 g l(-1), respectively, and methane was reduced 78 and 93%, respectively. these results suggest that thymol markedly reduces pathogens,  odor, and greenhouse gas emissions from a swine production facility. the urease inhibitor produced a temporary response in conserving urea.

TI  == detection of bacteroidales fecal indicators and the zoonotic pathogens e. coli 0157:h7, salmonella, and campylobacter in river water.
AB  == bacteroidales host-specific pcr offers a rapid method of diagnosing fecal pollution in water and identifying sources of input. to assess human health risks from exposure to fecal pathogens, however, bacteroidales markers should be detectable when pathogens are present. to determine if bacteroidales general, human-, ruminant-, and swine-specific markers correlate with certain fecal pathogens, we conducted a retrospective study on water samples for which the presence of e. coli o157:h7, salmonella spp., and campylobacter spp. had been determined. we found a positive relationship between detection of the bacteroidales general fecal marker and presence of the pathogens. detection of ruminant-specific markers predicted e. coli o157: h7 occurrence. there was a significant increase in the likelihood of detecting salmonella when a ruminant marker was present, and campylobacter spp. when human markers were present. for pathogens such as e. coli o157: h7 that are strongly associated with particular hosts, bacteroidales host-specific markers can estimate the likelihood of pathogen occurrence, enabling more accurate health risk assessments.

TI  == health risks in wastewater irrigation: comparing estimates from quantitative microbial risk analyses and epidemiological studies.
AB  == the combination of standard quantitative microbial risk analysis (qmra) techniques and 10,000-trial monte carlo risk simulations was used to estimate the human health risks associated with the use of wastewater for unrestricted and restricted crop irrigation. a risk of rotavirus infection of 10(-2) per person per year (pppy) was used as the reference level of acceptable risk. using the model scenario of involuntary soil ingestion for restricted irrigation, the risk  of rotavirus infection is approximately 10(-2) pppy when the wastewater contains  < or =10(6) escherichia coli per 100ml and when local agricultural practices are  highly mechanised. for labour-intensive agriculture the risk of rotavirus infection is approximately 10(-2) pppy when the wastewater contains < or = 10(5)  e. coli per 100ml; however, the wastewater quality should be < or = 10(4) e. coli per 100ml when children under 15 are exposed. with the model scenario of lettuce  consumption for unrestricted irrigation, the use of wastewaters containing < or =10(4) e. coli per 100ml results in a rotavirus infection risk of approximately 10(-2) pppy; however, again based on epidemiological evidence from mexico, the current who guideline level of < or =1,000 e. coli per 100ml should be retained for root crops eaten raw.

TI  == detection and identification of bacterial enteropathogens by polymerase chain reaction and conventional techniques in childhood acute gastroenteritis in gaza,  palestine.
AB  == background: acute gastroenteritis and diarrhea are common and costly problems that cause significant morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. in palestine, diarrhea is one of the major causes of outpatient visits and hospitalizations. methods: to improve knowledge on the etiology of gastroenteritis and diarrhea in our patient population, stool specimens from 150  children under 5 years of age suffering from acute gastroenteritis were investigated for various common bacterial enteropathogens by conventional and molecular techniques. results: bacterial enteropathogens were detected in 17.3% of the diarrheal samples. shigella spp was the most common bacterial pathogen (6.0%), followed by campylobacter coli/jejuni (4.7%), escherichia coli o157:h7 (4.7%), and salmonella spp (2.0%). shigella and salmonella isolates were tested for their susceptibility to common antimicrobial agents and most of the shigella  isolates were resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline and most of the salmonella isolates showed resistant to ampicillin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, doxycycline and nalidixic acid. conclusions: the results highlight the value of using a combination of traditional and molecular techniques (pcr) in the diagnosis of bacterial gastroenteritis. furthermore, this study demonstrated that e. coli o157:h7 and campylobacter, which are not screened for routinely in the gaza strip, were significant enteropathogens.

TI  == campylobacters as zoonotic pathogens: a food production perspective.
AB  == campylobacters remain highly important zoonotic pathogens worldwide which infect  an estimated 1% of the population of western europe each year. certain campylobacters are also important in infections of animals, particularly of the reproductive tract, and some are involved in periodontal disease. this paper focuses, however, on the two species which are most important in food-borne infections of humans, campylobacter (c.) jejuni and c. coli. infection with these campylobacters is serious in its own right but can also have long-term sequelae such as reactive arthritis and guillain-barre syndrome. the pathogens are ubiquitous in nature and in domestic animals and, as a consequence, are found frequently in the environment and on many raw foods, of both plant and animal origin and bacterial numbers can be very high on certain key foods like raw poultry meat. although all commercial poultry species can carry campylobacters, the risk is greater from chicken because of the high levels of consumption. campylobacters are relatively 'new' zoonotic pathogens as routine culture from clinical specimens only became possible in the late 1970s. as a consequence there is much that still needs to be understood about the behaviour and pathogenicity of these highly important bacteria. in particular, and from a food industry/food  safety perspective, it is important to better understand the behaviour of c. jejuni and c. coli in the food production environment, and how this affects their ability to survive certain food production processes. there is a belief that campylobacters are much more sensitive to hostile conditions than either salmonellas or escherichia coli. much of data to support this view have been derived from laboratory experiments and may not fully represent the natural situation. studies are showing that campylobacters may be more robust than previously thought and thus may represent a greater challenge to food safety. we  recommend that research is undertaken to better understand how campylobacters behave in the food chain and how responses to relevant conditions affect their ability to survive processing and their virulence. there is also a need to better understand the reasons why campylobacters are capable of frequent change, particularly in the expression of surface antigens.

TI  == comparison of the localization and post-translational modification of campylobacter coli cjac and its homolog from campylobacter jejuni, cj0734c/hisj.
AB  == campylobacter is an asaccharolytic microorganism which uses amino acids as a source of carbon and energy. cjac/hisj is a ligand-binding protein, a component of the abc transport system. campylobacter cjac/hisj is post-translationally modified by glycosylation. the number of glycosylation motifs present in the cjac protein is species-specific. c. coli cjac has two and c. jejuni one motif (e/dxnys/t) which serves as a glycan acceptor. although the two c. coli cjac motifs have identical amino-acid sequences they are not glycosylated with the same efficiency. the efficacy of cjac glycosylation in escherichia coli containing the campylobacter pgl locus is also rather low compared to that observed in the native host. the cjac localization is host-dependent. despite being a lipoprotein, cjac is recovered in e. coli from the periplasmic space whereas in campylobacter it is anchored to the inner membrane.

AB  == standard methods to identify microbial contaminants in the environment are slow,  laborious, and can require specialized expertise. this study investigated electrochemical detection of microbial contaminants using commercially available, hand-held instruments. electrochemical assays were developed for a red tide dinoflagellate (karenia brevis), fecal-indicating bacteria (enterococcus spp.), markers indicative of human sources of fecal pollution (human cluster bacteroides and the esp gene of enterococcus faecium), bacterial pathogens (escherichia coli  0157:h7, salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus), and a viral pathogen (adenovirus). for k. brevis, two assay formats (rapid pcr-detect and hybrid pcr-detect) were tested and both provided detection limits of 10 genome equivalents for dna isolated from k. brevis culture and amplified by pcr.  sensitivity with coastal water samples was sufficient to detect k. brevis that was "present" (<or=1000 cells/l) without yielding false positive results and the  electrochemical signal was significantly different than for samples containing cells at "medium" concentrations (100,000 to<10(6)cells/l). detection of k. brevis rna was also shown. multi-target capability was demonstrated with an 8-plex assay for bacterial and viral targets using isolated dna, natural beach water spiked with human feces, and water and sediments collected from new orleans, louisiana following hurricane katrina. furthermore, direct detection of  dinoflagellate and bacterial dna was achieved using lysed cells rather than extracted nucleic acids, allowing streamlining of the process. the methods presented can be used to rapidly (3-5h) screen environmental water samples for the presence of microbial contaminants and have the potential to be integrated into semi-automated detection platforms.

TI  == beta-lactam resistance and beta-lactamases in bacteria of animal origin.
AB  == beta-lactams are among the most clinically important antimicrobials in both human and veterinary medicine. bacterial resistance to beta-lactams has been increasingly observed in bacteria, including those of animal origin. the mechanisms of beta-lactam resistance include inaccessibility of the drugs to their target, target alterations and/or inactivation of the drugs by beta-lactamases. the latter contributes predominantly to beta-lactam resistance in gram-negative bacteria. a variety of beta-lactamases have been identified in bacteria derived from food-producing and companion animals and may further serve  as a reservoir for beta-lactamase-producing bacteria in humans. while this review mainly describes beta-lactamases from animal-derived escherichia coli and salmonella spp., beta-lactamases from animal-derived campylobacter spp., enterococcus spp., staphylococcus spp. and other pathogens are also discussed. of particular concern are the increasingly-isolated plasmid-encoded ampc-type cmy and extended-spectrum ctx-m beta-lactamases, which mediate acquired resistance to extended-spectrum beta-lactams. the genes encoding these enzymes often coexist with other antimicrobial resistance determinants and can also be associated with  transposons/integrons, increasing the potential enrichment of multidrug resistant bacteria by multiple antimicrobial agents as well as dissemination of the resistance determinants among bacterial species. characterization of beta-lactam-resistant animal-derived bacteria warrants further investigation of the type and distribution of beta-lactamases in bacteria of animal origin and their potential impact on human medicine.

TI  == [incomplete hemolytic uremic syndrome associated with partial factor h deficiency].
AB  == hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) consists of the association of hemolytic anemia,  thrombocytopenia and renal failure. most cases are related to toxins (verotoxins) produced by escherichia coli 0157:h7 and generally have good renal prognosis. atypical forms can occur, with a less favorable prognosis, and can be due to mutations in the gene codifying factor h, a protein that regulates activation of  the alternative complement pathway, among other causes. factor h deficiency produces continuous complement activation, causing injury to capillary endothelial cells. we report a case of incomplete (absence of thrombocytopenia and uremia), atypical hus in which hypocomplementemia secondary to partial factor h deficiency was detected, with favorable outcome. prior to symptom onset, the patient had a campylobacter infection, precipitating the symptoms. genetic analysis showed a heterozygous mutation (c846t) located in the scr4 domain, generating an amino acid change in the factor h molecule (pro240leu). this mutation may have been the cause of the partial factor h deficiency and the patient's symptoms on admission.

TI  == production, characterization, and application of antibodies against heat-labile type-i toxin for detection of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
AB  == strains of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are responsible for significant rates of morbidity and mortality among children, particularly in developing countries. the majority of clinical and public health laboratories are capable of isolating and identifying salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli o157:h7 from stool samples, but etec cannot be identified by routine methods. the method most often used to identify etec is polymerase chain  reaction for heat-stable and heat-labile enterotoxin genes, and subsequent serotyping, but most clinical and public health laboratories do not have the capacity or resources to perform these tests. in this study, polyclonal rabbit and monoclonal mouse igg2b antibodies against etec heat-labile toxin-i (lt) were  characterized and the potential applicability of a capture assay was analyzed. igg-enriched fractions from rabbit polyclonal and the igg2b monoclonal antibodies recognized lt in a conformational shape and they were excellent tools for detection of lt-producing strains. these findings indicate that the capture immunoassay could be used as a diagnostic assay of etec lt-producing strains in routine diagnosis and in epidemiological studies of diarrhea in developing countries as enzyme linked immunosorbent assay techniques remain as effective and economical choice for the detection of specific pathogen antigens in cultures.

TI  == identification of putative zinc hydrolase genes of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == dna fragments encoding two putative zinc-dependent hydrolases, designated glx2-1  and glx2-2, from a clinical isolate of campylobacter jejuni, strain 012, were cloned and sequenced. glx2-1 was encoded by a sequence of 798 bp and glx2-2 by a  sequence of 597 bp. the amino acid sequences deduced from c. jejuni dna showed 99% and 100% identity, respectively, to putative zinc hydrolases reported from c. jejuni atcc strain 11168, and also shared identity (28-43%) with several hypothetical conserved proteins and known zinc-dependent hydrolases and metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily proteins. a strictly conserved motif, -h-x-h-x-d-, characteristic of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily of proteins, including class b metallo-beta-lactamases, was identified in both proteins. other conserved metal-binding ligands, characteristic of the metallo-beta-lactamase superfamily of proteins, were also identified. functional  beta-lactamase could not be expressed in either escherichia coli or campylobacter coli transformed with c. jejuni hydrolase-containing plasmids, suggesting that they do not function as metallo-beta-lactamases, although structurally they are consistent with the zinc metallo-hydrolase family of the beta-lactamase fold.

TI  == carriage of four bacterial pathogens by beef cattle in northern ireland at time of slaughter.
AB  == aims: to determine the prevalence of four bacterial zoonotic pathogens in beef cattle at time of slaughter in northern ireland (ni), in order to assess their potential for reducing beef safety. methods and results: faeces were collected postmortem from beef cattle (n =220) at seven eu registered abattoirs. standard enrichment culturing methods were employed, plus immunomagnetic enrichment in the case of escherichia coli o157:h7. campylobacter spp. were found in 52 samples (24.8%), listeria monocytogenes in 10 (4.8%), e. coli o157:h7 in 2 (0.9%) whilst  salmonella spp. were isolated from six out of 200 samples (3.0%). five salmonellas were salmonella chandans and one was salmonella liverpool. conclusions: campylobacter spp. were the most frequently isolated pathogen, despite being relatively rare in beef. genotyping showed the campylobacters to be very diverse, indicating cattle encounter campylobacters from many sources. the remaining three pathogens, which are associated with meats, occurred at relatively low frequencies, especially e. coli o157:h7. the salmonella serovars found rarely infect humans. significance and impact of the study: the low prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 in ni beef cattle was confirmed and the reasons for this merit further study. the four pathogens should have little impact on beef quality.

TI  == a waterborne outbreak of gastroenteritis with multiple etiologies among resort island visitors and residents: ohio, 2004.
AB  == background: the implementation of treated municipal water systems in the 20th century led to a dramatic decrease in waterborne disease in the united states. however, communities with deficient water systems still experience waterborne outbreaks. in august 2004, we investigated an outbreak of gastroenteritis on south bass island, ohio, an island of 900 residents that is visited by >500,000 persons each year. methods: to identify the source of illness, we conducted a case-control study and an environmental investigation. a case was defined as diarrhea in a person who traveled to the island during the period from may 1 through 30 september 2004 and became ill within 2 weeks after the visit. healthy  travel companions served as matched control subjects. we also performed an environmental assessment and extensive testing of island water sources. results:  among the 1450 persons reporting illness, campylobacter jejuni, norovirus, giardia intestinalis, and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium were identified in 16, 9, 3, and 1 persons, respectively. we interviewed 100 case patients and 117 matched control subjects. case patients were more likely to drink water on the island than control subjects (68% vs. 35%; matched odds ratio, 4.3; 95% confidence interval, 2.2-9.3). sampling of ground water wells indicated  contamination with multiple fecal microbes, including escherichia coli, c. jejuni, salmonella species, and giardia species. irregularities in sewage disposal practices that could have contaminated the underground aquifer were noted. conclusions: the combined epidemiological and environmental investigation  indicated that sewage-contaminated ground water was the likely source of this large outbreak. long-term changes to the island's water supply and sewage management infrastructure are needed.

TI  == zoonotic bacterial populations, gut fermentation characteristics and methane production in feedlot steers during oral nitroethane treatment and after the feeding of an experimental chlorate product.
AB  == nitroethane inhibits the growth of certain zoonotic pathogens such as campylobacter and salmonella spp., foodborne pathogens estimated to cause millions of human infections each year, and enhances the salmonella- and escherichia coli-killing effect of an experimental chlorate product being developed as a feed additive to kill these bacteria immediately pre-harvest. limited studies have shown that nitroethane inhibits ruminal methane production,  which represents a loss of 2-12% of the host's gross energy intake and contributes to global warming and destruction of the ozone layer. the present study was conducted to assess the effects of 14-day oral nitroethane administration, 0 (0x), 80 (1x) or 160 (2x)mg nitroethane/kg body weight per day  on ruminal and fecal e. coli and campylobacter, ruminal and fecal methane-producing and nitroethane-reducing activity, whole animal methane emissions, and ruminal and fecal fermentation balance in holstein steers (n=6 per treatment) averaging 403+/-26 (sd) kg bw. an experimental chlorate product was fed the day following the last nitroethane administration to determine effects on e. coli and campylobacter. the experimental chlorate product decreased (p<0.001)  fecal, but not ruminal (p>0.05) e. coli concentrations by 1000- and 10-fold by 24 and 48 h, respectively, after chlorate feeding when compared to pre-treatment concentrations (>5.7 log(10) colony forming units/g). no effects (p>0.05) of nitroethane or the experimental chlorate product were observed on fecal campylobacter concentrations; campylobacter were not recovered from ruminal contents. nitroethane treatment decreased (p<0.01) ruminal (8.46, 7.91 and 4.74+/-0.78 micromol/g/h) and fecal (3.90, 1.36 and 1.38+/-0.50 micromol/g/h) methane-producing activity for treatments 0x, 1x and 2x, respectively. administration of nitroethane increased (p<0.001) nitroethane-reducing activity in ruminal, but not fecal samples. day of study affected ruminal (p<0.0001) but not fecal (p>0.05) methane-producing and nitroethane-reducing activities (p<0.01); treatment by day interactions were not observed (p>0.05). ruminal accumulations of acetate decreased (p<0.05) in 2x-treated steers when compared with 0x- and 1x-treated steers, but no effect (p>0.05) of nitroethane was observed on propionate, butyrate or the acetate to propionate ratio. whole animal methane emissions, expressed as l/day or as a proportion of gross energy intake (%gei), were unaffected by nitroethane treatment (p>0.05), and were not correlated (p>0.05) with ruminal methane-producing activity. these results demonstrate that oral nitroethane administration reduces ruminal methane-producing activity but suggest that a microbial adaptation, likely due to an in situ enrichment of ruminal nitroethane-reducing bacteria, may cause depletion of nitroethane, at least at the 1x administration dose, to concentrations too low to be effective. further research is warranted to determine if the optimization of dosage of nitroethane or related nitrocompouds can maintain the enteropathogen control and anti-methanogen effect in fed steers.

TI  == engineering of a sialic acid synthesis pathway in transgenic plants by expression of bacterial neu5ac-synthesizing enzymes.
AB  == plants are a low-cost and contamination-free factory for the production of recombinant pharmaceutical proteins. however, plant-made pharmaceuticals differ from their mammalian homologues by the structure of their n-linked glycans. for instance, most mammalian glycoproteins harbour terminal sialic acids that control their half-life in the bloodstream. the absence of the whole sialylation machinery in plants is of major concern as non-sialylated plant-made pharmaceuticals may not perform at their full potential in humans, because of their removal from the circulation through the involvement of hepatic cell receptors. in this context, we have investigated the synthesis of n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac) in the cytosol of plants by either the re-routing of the endogenous 3-deoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (kdo) biosynthetic pathway or the expression of microbial neu5ac-synthesizing enzymes.  in this paper, we demonstrate that the plant kdo-8p synthase is not able to use n-acetyl d-mannosamine as a substrate, and thus re-routing of the kdo pathway for the synthesis of neu5ac is not possible. consequently, we expressed genes encoding neu5ac lyase from escherichia coli and neu5ac synthase (neub2) from campylobacter jejuni in plants. these resulted in the production of functional enzymes in the cytosol, which in turn can catalyse the synthesis of neu5ac in vitro. experiments were carried out on two models, bright yellow 2 (by2) tobacco  cells and medicago sativa (alfalfa), the perennial legume crop.

TI  == traveler's diarrhea in thailand: randomized, double-blind trial comparing single-dose and 3-day azithromycin-based regimens with a 3-day levofloxacin regimen.
AB  == background: traveler's diarrhea in thailand is frequently caused by campylobacter jejuni. rates of fluoroquinolone (fq) resistance in campylobacter organisms have  exceeded 85% in recent years, and reduced fluoroquinolone efficacy has been observed. methods: azithromycin regimens were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind trial of azithromycin, given as a single 1-g dose or a 3-day regimen (500 mg daily), versus a 3-day regimen of levofloxacin (500 mg daily) in military field clinics in thailand. outcomes included clinical end points (time to the last unformed stool [tlus] and cure rates) and microbiological end points (pathogen eradication). results: a total of 156 patients with acute diarrhea were enrolled in the trial. campylobacter organisms predominated (in 64% of patients), with levofloxacin resistance noted in 50% of campylobacter organisms and with no  azithromycin resistance noted. the cure rate at 72 h after treatment initiation was highest (96%) with single-dose azithromycin, compared with the cure rates of  85% noted with 3-day azithromycin and 71% noted with levofloxacin (p=.002). single-dose azithromycin was also associated with the shortest median tlus (35 h; p=.03, by log-rank test). levofloxacin's efficacy was inferior to azithromycin's  efficacy, except in patients with no pathogen identified during the first 24 h of treatment or in patients with levofloxacin-susceptible campylobacter isolates, in whom it appeared to be equal to azithromycin. the rate of microbiological eradication was significantly better with azithromycin-based regimens (96%-100%), compared with levofloxacin (38%) (p=.001); however, this finding was poorly correlated with clinical outcome. a higher rate of posttreatment nausea in the 30 min after receipt of the first dose (14% vs. <6%; p=.06) was observed as a mild,  self-limited complaint associated with single-dose azithromycin. conclusions: single-dose azithromycin is recommended for empirical therapy of traveler's diarrhea acquired in thailand and is a reasonable first-line option for empirical management in general.

TI  == low level nitrate or nitroethane preconditioning enhances the bactericidal effect of suboptimal experimental chlorate treatment against escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium but not campylobacter in swine.
AB  == an experimental chlorate product that targets the respiratory nitrate reductase enzyme of bacteria such as salmonella and escherichia coli has shown promising results in reducing concentrations of these bacteria in the gut of food animals.  because expression of the target enzyme is induced by nitrate, we administered short-duration, low level nitrate or nitroethane preconditioning treatments to finishing swine to see if these would enhance the ability of an experimental chlorate product to kill these bacteria. results from these studies showed that preconditioning the gut microflora of swine with low levels of nitrate or nitrocompounds enhanced (more than tenfold) the ability of the chlorate product to kill salmonella and e. coli, but not campylobacter. further studies are needed before these compounds can be fed as feed additives to animals, although it is likely that nitrate preconditioning may be more near to market than the nitrocompounds, which may require more comprehensive review by regulatory authorities.

TI  == the beta-defensin gallinacin-6 is expressed in the chicken digestive tract and has antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens.
AB  == food-borne pathogens are responsible for most cases of food poisoning in developed countries and are often associated with poultry products, including chicken. little is known about the role of beta-defensins in the chicken digestive tract and their efficacy. in this study, the expression of chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 (gal-6) and its antimicrobial activity against food-borne pathogens were investigated. reverse transcription-pcr analysis showed high expression of gal-6 mrna in the esophagus and crop, moderate expression in the glandular stomach, and low expression throughout the intestinal tract. putative transcription factor binding sites for nuclear factor kappa beta, activator protein 1, and nuclear factor interleukin-6 were found in the gal-6 gene upstream region, which suggests a possible inducible nature of the gal-6 gene. in colony-counting assays, strong bactericidal and fungicidal activity was  observed, including bactericidal activity against food-borne pathogens campylobacter jejuni, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, clostridium perfringens, and escherichia coli. treatment with 16 mug/ml synthetic gal-6 resulted in a 3 log unit reduction in clostridium perfringens survival within 60  min, indicating fast killing kinetics. transmission electron microscopy examination of synthetic-gal-6-treated clostridium perfringens cells showed dose-dependent changes in morphology after 30 min, including intracellular granulation, cytoplasm retraction, irregular septum formation in dividing cells,  and cell lysis. the high expression in the proximal digestive tract and broad antimicrobial activity suggest that chicken beta-defensin gallinacin-6 plays an important role in chicken innate host defense.

TI  == susceptibility of bacteria isolated from pigs to tiamulin and enrofloxacin metabolites.
AB  == susceptibilities to metabolites of tiamulin (tia) and enrofloxacin (enr) were tested using selected bacteria with previously defined minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic). the tia metabolites tested were: n-deethyl-tiamulin (dtia), 2beta-hydroxy-tiamulin (2beta-htia) and 8alpha-hydroxy-tiamulin (8alpha-htia), and the enr metabolites were: ciprofloxacin (cip) and enrofloxacin n-oxide (enr-n). bacteria, all of porcine origin, were selected as representatives of bacterial infections (staphylococcus hyicus and actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae), zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter coli) and indicator bacteria (escherichia coli and enterococci). furthermore the effects of these compounds were tested on the microbial community of active sludge to test any negative effect on colony forming units (cfu). dtia had a potency of 12.5-50% of the potency of tia. 2beta-htia and 8alpha-htia had potencies less than 1% of the potency of tia. enr-n had a potency of 0.75-1.5% of the potency of enr, while cip and enr had similar potencies. results obtained here indicate that cip and dtia could contribute to the selective pressure for upholding antimicrobial resistant bacteria in animals under enr or tia treatment. the most potent metabolites cip and dtia showed considerable potencies against activated sludge bacteria compared to the parent compounds. ec(50) (microg/ml) for enr, cip, tia and dtia were 0.018 [95% ci: 0.028-0.149], 0.064 [95% ci: 0.007-0.046], 6.0 [95% ci: 3.6-9.8], and 9.7 [95% ci: 5.8-16.3], respectively. this indicates that the compounds can change the bacterial population in the sludge, and hereby alter the properties of the sludge.

TI  == norepinephrine increases the pathogenic potential of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == background: campylobacter jejuni can cause a spectrum of diseases in humans, ranging from enteritis and diarrhoea to severe inflammation, profuse bloody diarrhoea and chronic relapsing infection. norepinephrine (ne) levels in the intestine increase under conditions of stress and trauma, and are thought to result in spill over of ne into the intestinal lumen. ne is known to stimulate the growth of a range of bacterial species, and to increase the pathogenicity of  escherichia coli. aim: to determine the effects of ne on the pathogenic potential of c jejuni in a model system. methods: c jejuni was grown in iron-replete and iron-limited media in the presence and absence of 100 microm ne. several virulence-associated characteristics, including motility and cell invasion, were  measured. results: when c jejuni was grown in iron-limited media in the presence  of ne, growth rate, motility and invasion of cultured epithelial cells were increased compared with cultures grown in the absence of ne. bacteria exposed to  ne during growth also caused greater subsequent disruption of cultured epithelial cell monolayers, inducing widespread breakdown of tight junctions. conclusion: exposure to ne causes an increase in the virulence-associated properties of campylobacter. stress and concomitant infection could therefore be contributory factors to the variable presentation of this disease.

TI  == oxygen reactivity of both respiratory oxidases in campylobacter jejuni: the cydab genes encode a cyanide-resistant, low-affinity oxidase that is not of the cytochrome bd type.
AB  == the microaerophilic bacterium campylobacter jejuni is a significant food-borne pathogen and is predicted to possess two terminal respiratory oxidases with unknown properties. inspection of the genome reveals an operon (cydab) apparently encoding a cytochrome bd-like oxidase homologous to oxidases in escherichia coli  and azotobacter vinelandii. however, c. jejuni cells lacked all spectral signals  characteristic of the high-spin hemes b and d of these oxidases. mutation of the  cydab operon of c. jejuni did not have a significant effect on growth, but the mutation reduced formate respiration and the viability of cells cultured in 5% oxygen. since cyanide resistance of respiration was diminished in the mutant, we  propose that c. jejuni cydab be renamed cioab (cyanide-insensitive oxidase), as in pseudomonas aeruginosa. we measured the oxygen affinity of each oxidase, using a highly sensitive assay that exploits globin deoxygenation during respiration-catalyzed oxygen uptake. the cioab-type oxidase exhibited a relatively low affinity for oxygen (k(m) = 0.8 microm) and a v(max) of >20 nmol/mg/s. expression of cioab was elevated fivefold in cells grown at higher rates of oxygen provision. the alternative, cconoqp-encoded cyanide-sensitive oxidase, expected to encode a cytochrome cb'-type enzyme, plays a major role in the microaerobic respiration of c. jejuni, since it appeared to be essential for  viability and exhibited a much higher oxygen affinity, with a k(m) value of 40 nm and a v(max) of 6 to 9 nmol/mg/s. low-temperature photodissociation spectrophotometry revealed that neither oxidase has ligand-binding activity typical of the heme-copper oxidase family. these data are consistent with cytochrome oxidation during photolysis at low temperatures.

TI  == antiparasitic drug nitazoxanide inhibits the pyruvate oxidoreductases of helicobacter pylori, selected anaerobic bacteria and parasites, and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == nitazoxanide (ntz) exhibits broad-spectrum activity against anaerobic bacteria and parasites and the ulcer-causing pathogen helicobacter pylori. here we show that ntz is a noncompetitive inhibitor (k(i), 2 to 10 microm) of the pyruvate:ferredoxin/flavodoxin oxidoreductases (pfors) of trichomonas vaginalis,  entamoeba histolytica, giardia intestinalis, clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, h. pylori, and campylobacter jejuni and is weakly active against the pyruvate dehydrogenase of escherichia coli. to further mechanistic studies, the pfor operon of h. pylori was cloned and overexpressed in e. coli, and the multisubunit complex was purified by ion-exchange chromatography. pyruvate-dependent pfor activity with ntz, as measured by a decrease in absorbance at 418 nm (spectral shift from 418 to 351 nm), unlike the reduction of viologen dyes, did not result in the accumulation of products (acetyl coenzyme a  and co(2)) and pyruvate was not consumed in the reaction. ntz did not displace the thiamine pyrophosphate (tpp) cofactor of pfor, and the 351-nm absorbing form  of ntz was inactive. optical scans and (1)h nuclear magnetic resonance analyses determined that the spectral shift (a(418) to a(351)) of ntz was due to protonation of the anion (ntz(-)) of the 2-amino group of the thiazole ring which could be generated with the pure compound under acidic solutions (pk(a) = 6.18).  we propose that ntz(-) intercepts pfor at an early step in the formation of the lactyl-tpp transition intermediate, resulting in the reversal of pyruvate binding prior to decarboxylation and in coordination with proton transfer to ntz. thus, ntz might be the first example of an antimicrobial that targets the "activated cofactor" of an enzymatic reaction rather than its substrate or catalytic sites,  a novel mechanism that may escape mutation-based drug resistance.

AB  == the effects of the application of steam at atmospheric pressure for times up to 20 s on the numbers of inoculated campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli on whole chicken carcasses were investigated in a pilot steam cabinet. steam treatments reduced the numbers of c. jejuni ar6 by ca. 1.8, 2.6 and 3.3 log(10) cfu cm(-2) in 10, 12 and 20 s, respectively. corresponding reductions in numbers  of e. coli k12 were 1.7, 2.3 and 2.8 log(10) cfu cm(-2). however, such treatments caused the skin to shrink and change colour. the optimum treatment for maximum reductions of c. jejuni and e. coli, least skin shrinkage and change of colour was concluded to be <12 s. further work was carried out to determine whether a modified air chilling system in combination with steam or hot water decontamination treatments could be used to reduce numbers of pathogens, particularly campylobacters, on the surface of poultry carcasses. whole chicken carcasses inoculated with c. jejuni and e. coli were either not treated, treated  with steam at atmospheric pressure for up to 10 s or treated with hot water at 80 degrees c for up to 20 s, then either chilled by crust freezing, chilled at 0 degrees c, or chilled at 15 degrees c, in a pilot chilling chamber. the optimum combination was treatment with water at 80 degrees c for 20 s followed by crust freezing, which reduced the numbers of c. jejuni and e. coli by ca. 2.9 and 3.2 log(10) cfu cm(-2), respectively, without extensive degradation of carcass appearance.

TI  == study of salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli contamination in raw food available in factories, schools, and hospital canteens in hanoi, vietnam.
AB  == this study on the contamination rates of raw foods available in factory, school,  and hospital canteens in hanoi, vietnam, with the bacteria of salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli (e. coli) was carried out between 2003 and 2004. a total of 177 raw food samples of vegetables, meat (beef and pork), fish,  and poultry were examined to provide baseline data for evaluation of microbiological risks in general, and identification of potential vehicles for pathogenic cross-contamination in canteens. the study confirmed that unprocessed  fish and poultry are likely to be contaminated with salmonella and in the absence of proper kitchen hygiene and may contaminate processed foods. raw poultry samples were highly contaminated with e. coli (45%), campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni) (28.3%), and salmonella (8.3%) and classified as high-risk food. e. coli  was also detected in raw meat, fish, and vegetables with the rate of 21.3%, 6.6%, and 18.5%, respectively. this article confirmed the importance of hygienic working practices when preparing food.

TI  == the contribution of cytolethal distending toxin to bacterial pathogenesis.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) is a bacterial toxin that initiates a eukaryotic cell cycle block at the g2 stage prior to mitosis. cdt is produced by  a number of bacterial pathogens including: campylobacter species, escherichia coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhi, shigella dystenteriae, enterohepatic helicobacter species, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans (the cause of aggressive periodontitis), and haemophilus ducreyi (the cause of chancroid). the  functional toxin is composed of three proteins; cdtb potentiates a cascade leading to cell cycle block, and cdta and cdtc function as dimeric subunits, which bind cdtb and delivers it to the mammalian cell interior. once inside the cell, cdtb enters the nucleus and exhibits a dnase i-like activity that results in dna double-strand breaks. the eukaryotic cell responds to the dna double-strand breaks by initiating a regulatory cascade that results in cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and cell death. mutations in cdtabc that cause any of the three subunits to lose function prevent the bacterial cell from inducing cytotoxicity. the result of cdt activity can differ somewhat depending on the eukaryotic cell types affected. epithelial cells, endothelial cells, and keratinocytes undergo g2 cell cycle arrest, cellular distension, and death; fibroblasts undergo g1 and g2 arrest, cellular distension, and death; and immune  cells undergo g2 arrest followed by apoptosis. cdt contributes to pathogenesis by inhibiting both cellular and humoral immunity via apoptosis of immune response cells, and by generating necrosis of epithelial-type cells and fibroblasts involved in the repair of lesions produced by pathogens resulting in slow healing and production of disease symptoms. thus, cdt may function as a virulence factor  in pathogens that produce the toxin.

TI  == a microbial diagnostic microarray technique for the sensitive detection and identification of pathogenic bacteria in a background of nonpathogens.
AB  == a major challenge in microbial diagnostics is the parallel detection and identification of low-bundance pathogens within a complex microbial community. in addition, a high specificity providing robust, reliable identification at least at the species level is required. a microbial diagnostic microarray approach, using single nucleotide extension labeling with gyrb as the marker gene, was developed. we present a novel concept applying competitive oligonucleotide probes to improve the specificity of the assay. our approach enabled the sensitive and specific detection of a broad range of pathogenic bacteria. the approach was tested with a set of 35 oligonucleotide probes targeting escherichia coli, shigella spp., salmonella spp., aeromonas hydrophila, vibrio cholerae, mycobacterium avium, mycobacterium tuberculosis, helicobacter pylori, proteus mirabilis, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter jejuni. the introduction of competitive oligonucleotides in the labeling reaction successfully suppressed cross-reaction by closely related sequences, significantly improving the performance of the assay. environmental applicability was tested with environmental and veterinary samples harboring complex microbial communities. detection sensitivity in the range of 0.1% has been demonstrated, far below the 5% detection limit of traditional microbial diagnostic microarrays.

TI  == burden and causes of foodborne disease in australia: annual report of the ozfoodnet network, 2005.
AB  == in 2005, ozfoodnet sites recorded 25,779 notifications of seven potentially foodborne diseases, which was 12.5 per cent higher than the mean for the previous five years. diseases with significant increases in 2005, when compared to historical reports include: shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, shigellosis,  haemolytic uraemic syndrome, salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis. the most significant increases were those due to salmonella (13.1%) and campylobacter (5.1%) because of the frequency of these infections. reports of listeriosis were  lower than previous years and there were only four materno-foetal infections compared to seven in 2004. sites reported 624 outbreaks of gastroenteritis and foodborne disease in 2005. one hundred and two of these were foodborne and affected 1,926 persons, hospitalised 187 and caused four deaths. among foodborne  outbreaks, salmonella typhimurium was the most common pathogen and restaurants were the most common place where food implicated in outbreaks was prepared. outbreaks associated with fish, poultry meat, and mixed meat dishes were common.  there were several large outbreaks of salmonellosis, including one associated with dips at a turkish restaurant, one with alfalfa sprouts, and two due to egg-based dishes. in addition, there were several multi-state investigations of salmonella infection during 2005, including one large outbreak of s. typhimurium  135 implicating poultry meat from retail supermarkets. sites identified a source  of infection for 39 per cent (41/104) of investigations into clusters of salmonellosis. overall, 97.4 per cent of salmonella notifications on state and territory surveillance databases recorded complete information about serotype and phage type. this report highlights the considerable burden of disease from food sources in australia and the need to continue to improve food safety.

TI  == n-linked glycosylation of folded proteins by the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase.
AB  == n-linked protein glycosylation is found in all domains of life. in eukaryotes, it is the most abundant protein modification of secretory and membrane proteins, and the process is coupled to protein translocation and folding. we found that in bacteria, n-glycosylation can occur independently of the protein translocation machinery. in an in vitro assay, bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase glycosylated a folded endogenous substrate protein with high efficiency and folded bovine ribonuclease a with low efficiency. unfolding the eukaryotic substrate greatly increased glycosylation. we propose that in the bacterial system, glycosylation sites are located in flexible parts of folded proteins, whereas the eukaryotic cotranslational glycosylation evolved to a mechanism presenting the substrate in  a flexible form before folding.

TI  == the effect of lemon, orange and bergamot essential oils and their components on the survival of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus and staphylococcus aureus in vitro and in food systems.
AB  == aims: to investigate the effectiveness of oils and vapours of lemon (citrus limon), sweet orange (citrus sinensis) and bergamot (citrus bergamia) and their components against a number of common foodborne pathogens. methods and results: the disc diffusion method was used to screen the oils and vapours against listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, escherichia coli  o157 and campylobacter jejuni. the survival of each species, demonstrated to be susceptible in the in vitro studies, was tested on cabbage leaf for 60 s by direct contact and on chicken skin for 10 min by direct contact and 24 h by vapour. the results indicate that bergamot was the most inhibitory essential oil  (eo) and citral and linalool mimicked its effect (p > 0.001). citral and linalool vapours produced 6 log reductions in l. monocytogenes, staph. aureus and b. cereus populations on cabbage leaf after 8-10 h exposure but bergamot vapour exposure, while producing a similar reduction in l. monocytogenes and b. cereus populations, had no effect on staph. aureus. conclusions: bergamot was the most effective of the oils tested and linalool the most effective anti-bacterial component. gram-positive bacteria were more susceptible than gram-negative bacteria in vitro, although camp. jejuni and e. coli o157 were inhibited by bergamot and linalool oils and by linalool vapour. all bacteria tested were less  susceptible in food systems than in vitro. of the gram-positive bacteria tested staph. aureus was the least susceptible to both the oils and the components tested. significance and impact of the study: results suggest the possibility that citrus eos, particularly bergamot, could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning.

TI  == use of a combination of brushing technique and the loop-mediated isothermal amplification method as a novel, rapid, and safe system for detection of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == gastric mucosal biopsy is widely used in the detection of helicobacter pylori but is associated with a number of problems, including false-negative results due to  sampling error and massive bleeding after biopsy. given the extended period required to culture h. pylori, detection would be further improved by the use of  rapid detection methods such as pcr. here, we developed a rapid, safe, and convenient method for collecting h. pylori which combines endoscopic brushing with the loop-mediated isothermal amplification (lamp) method. the specificity and sensitivity of lamp were examined using nine urease-generating non-h. pylori  bacterial species, escherichia coli, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, helicobacter hepaticus, and 51 h. pylori strains. results showed that h.  pylori-specific lamp primers amplified h. pylori dna only and that the lowest detection limit of the lamp reaction was 10(2) cfu. brushing and biopsy samples taken from 200 patients with peptic ulcer at nagoya university hospital and a regional health care center were subjected to both lamp and culturing. no adverse effects such as severe bleeding or penetration occurred during the procedure. by  lamp assay, 123 patients were confirmed as h. pylori positive when brushing technique samples were assayed, whereas only 100 were positive when biopsy samples were assayed. culture assay detected h. pylori in 117 patients when it was combined with the brushing technique and in 96 when it was combined with biopsy. combination of the endoscopic brushing technique with lamp is considered  a useful and safe system for identifying h. pylori infection.

AB  == goals: to determine the incidence of renal function deterioration in adult patients with salmonella infection. background: renal impairment has been described during severe salmonella infection and is mainly due to shock, dehydration, or rhabdomyolysis. however, it is unclear whether less severe salmonella infection also has an impact on kidney function. study: we retrospectively reviewed over a 2-year period the data of all hospitalized adult  patients with microbiologically proven gastrointestinal infection. different biologic parameters were compared between patients infected with salmonella and patients with other gastrointestinal infections. results: one hundred and seven patients with positive stool cultures were identified; 44 of them had proven salmonella infection. renal dysfunction, defined as an increase in serum creatinine above 1.5 mg/dl in men and above 1.3 mg/dl in women, was observed in 16 (36%) patients infected by salmonella but only in 3 (5%) comparators (p<0.0001). hydration status and creatine kinase levels were not different in patients affected by salmonella as compared with other pathogens. kidney function recovered in all but 1 patient. conclusions: salmonella gastroenteritis in adults is frequently accompanied by renal dysfunction that is caused by mechanisms other than dehydration or rhabdomyolysis.

TI  == rapid separation and concentration of food-borne pathogens in food samples prior  to quantification by viable-cell counting and real-time pcr.
AB  == buoyant density gradient centrifugation has been used to separate bacteria from complex food matrices, as well as to remove compounds that inhibit rapid detection methods, such as pcr, and to prevent false-positive results due to dna  originating from dead cells. applying a principle of buoyant density gradient centrifugation, we developed a method for rapid separation and concentration following filtration and low- and high-speed centrifugation, as well as flotation and sedimentation buoyant density centrifugation, for 12 food-borne pathogens (salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae o139, vibrio parahaemolyticus o3k6, vibrio vulnificus, providencia alcalifaciens, aeromonas hydrophila, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus  aureus, and clostridium perfringens) in 13 different food homogenates. this method can be used prior to real-time quantitative pcr (rti-qpcr) and viable-cell counting. using this combined method, the target organisms in the food samples theoretically could be concentrated 250-fold and detected at cell concentrations  as low as 10(1) to 10(3) cfu/g using the rti-qpcr assay, and amounts as small as  10(0) to 10(1) cfu/g could be isolated using plate counting. the combined separation and concentration methods and rti-qpcr confirmed within 3 h the presence of 10(1) to 10(2) cfu/g of salmonella and c. jejuni directly in naturally contaminated chicken and the presence of s. aureus directly in remaining food items in a poisoning outbreak. these results illustrated the feasibility of using these assays for rapid inspection of bacterial food contamination during a real-world outbreak.

TI  == efficacy and food safety considerations of poultry competitive exclusion products.
AB  == competitive exclusion (ce) products are anaerobic cultures of bacteria that are applied to poultry hatchlings to establish a protective enteric microbiota that excludes intestinal colonization by human food-borne pathogens. for safety of the poultry flock and human consumers, the identities of bacteria in ce products need to be known. a ce product is a culture of intestinal contents from adult chickens. it may be microbiologically defined by analysis of bacteria isolated from the culture, but many bacteria are hard to reliably isolate, identify, and characterize with conventional techniques. sequence analysis of 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) genes may be more reliable than conventional techniques to identify ce bacteria. bacteria in ce products may contain antimicrobial drug resistance and virulence mechanisms that could be transferred to the enteric bacteria of the food animal and to the human consumer. detection methods for specific antimicrobial drug resistance and virulence genes and the integrase genes of conjugative transposons, mostly utilizing pcr technology, are being developed that can be applied to assess these risks in ce bacteria. with improvements in efficacy, bacterial identification, and detection and control of the possible risks of gene transfer, ce product technology can be made a more effective food safety tool.

TI  == bacterial aetiology of diarrhoea in young children: high prevalence of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) not belonging to the classical epec serogroups.
AB  == diarrhoeal disease continues to be one of the most common causes of admittance in children hospital emergency. the aim of the present study was to investigate the  relative contribution of enteropathogenic and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli  (epec and ehec, respectively) as a cause of infectious bacterial diarrhoea in children from the region of toulouse. we analysed 280 samples of stools from 280  children (<2 years) with diarrhoea admitted in the "hopital des enfants" from january to august 2005. classic pathogens (salmonella, campylobacter, yersinia, shigella, aeromonas and vibrio) were detected by standard culture methods. enterotoxigenic clostridium difficile were identified after culture by immuno-enzyme assay (iea). virulence genes of epec and ehec were detected by using pcr. shiga-toxin production of ehec strains was confirmed with an iea test. potential enteric pathogens were identified in 55 patients. epec was the most frequently identified agent (30 patients), followed by campylobacter (9 cases: 7  c. jejuni and 2 c. coli) and c. difficile (8 patients), then ehec (5 patients) and salmonella (3 patients). no shigella, yersinia, aeromonas or other pathogenic bacteria were detected during this period in that class of children. epec not belonging to the classical epec serogroups were highly prevalent (24 versus 6). ehec possessed different genotypes and serogroups: o26 (2 strains), o157 (2 strains) and one un-typable strain. this study demonstrates the importance of epec (55 % of positive cases) and of ehec (more frequent than salmonella) in the  aetiology of diarrhoeal diseases of young children. we confirm the usefulness of  the pcr methodology: it allows the detection of virulent e. coli and thus increases by two fold the diagnosis of bacterial diarrhoea.

AB  == the specific aim of this study was to assess the faecal shedding of zoonotic enteropathogens by semi-domesticated reindeer (rangifer tarandus tarandus) to deduce the potential risk to human health through modern reindeer herding. in total, 2,243 faecal samples of reindeer from northern regions of finland and norway were examined for potentially enteropathogenic bacteria (campylobacter species, enterococcus species, escherichia coli, salmonella species and yersinia  species) and parasites (cryptosporidium species) in accordance with standard procedures. escherichia coli were isolated in 94.7%, enterococcus species in 92.9%, yersinia species in 4.8% of the samples and campylobacter species in one sample only (0.04%). analysis for virulence factors in e. coli and yersinia species revealed no pathogenic strains. neither salmonella species nor cryptosporidium oocysts were detected. the public health risk due to reindeer husbandry concerning zoonotic diseases included in this study has to be considered as very low at present but a putative epidemiological threat may arise when herding conditions are changed with respect to intensification and crowding.

TI  == investigation for possible source(s) of contamination of ready-to-eat meat products with listeria spp. and other pathogens in a meat processing plant in trinidad.
AB  == in 2003, there was a recall of three processed (chicken franks, spice ham and turkey ham ready-to-eat (rte) meat products by a large processing plant in trinidad as a result of contamination by listeria monocytogenes. the study was conducted to investigate the possible source(s) of listeria contamination of recalled rte meat products and to determine the prevalence of listeria spp., salmonella spp., escherichia coli and campylobacter spp. in the products and air  within the plant. raw and processed meat products, as well as food contact surfaces were also tested for salmonella spp., listeria spp. and campylobacter spp. initially after thorough clean-up and close-down of the plant. faecal and effluent samples from the piggery, in close proximity to the plant, were tested for the presence of salmonella spp., listeria spp. and campylobacter spp. air samples and food contact surfaces were negative for the tested organisms. ten (58.8%) of the 17 effluent samples and 4 (11.8%) of the 34 faecal samples were positive for campylobacter coli. of the 11 raw meat products tested, 10 (90.9%) were positive for e. coli and listeria spp. either singly or in combination. of the 32 processed rte products tested, 11 (34.4%) were positive for e. coli, salmonella spp., listeria spp. and campylobacter spp. in combination or singly. eleven (61.1%) of 18 processed products contained unacceptable levels of aerobic  bacteria using international standards. four months later, following the implementation of recommended cleaning, sanitizing and hygienic practices at the  plant, pre- and post-processed products were sampled and listeria spp. were identified in 4 (80.0%) of the 5 raw products and in 1 of the 5 (20.0%) finished  products. two (40.0%) of the finished products contained unacceptable microbial levels. it was concluded that the close proximity of the piggery to the processing plant was not the probable source of listeria contamination of the recalled meat products. the data suggested that improved sanitary practices on food contact surfaces and during handling of products, reduced the risk of listeria spp. and other pathogens studied. the problem at the plant can therefore, be inferred to be due to lapses in good sanitary practices, inadequate heat treatments or the presence of pathogens particularly listeria in biofilms on different surfaces continuously or occasionally contaminating finished products.

TI  == diarrhea etiology in a children's hospital emergency department: a prospective cohort study.
AB  == background: we evaluated the frequency of recovery of pathogens from children with diarrhea who presented to a pediatric emergency department and characterized the associated illnesses, to develop guidelines for performing a bacterial enteric culture. methods: we conducted a prospective cohort study of all patients with diarrhea who presented to a large regional pediatric emergency department during the period from november 1998 through october 2001. a thorough microbiologic evaluation was performed on stool specimens, and the findings were  correlated with case, physician, and laboratory data. results: a total of 1626 stool specimens were studied to detect diarrheagenic bacteria and, if there was a sufficient amount of stool, clostridium difficile toxin (688 specimens), parasites (656 specimens), and viruses (417 specimens). one hundred seventy-six (47%) of 372 specimens that underwent complete testing yielded a bacterial pathogen (shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, 39 specimens [of which 28 were  serotype o157:h7]; salmonella species, 39; campylobacter species, 25; shigella species, 14; and yersinia enterocolitica, 2), a viral pathogen (rotavirus, 85 specimens; astrovirus, 27; adenovirus, 18; or rotavirus and astrovirus, 8), a diarrheagenic parasite (5 specimens); or c. difficile toxin (46 specimens). samples from 2 patients yielded both bacterial and viral pathogens. a model to identify predictors of bacterial infection found that international travel, fever, and the passing of >10 stools in the prior 24 h were associated with the presence of a bacterial pathogen. physician judgment regarding the need to perform a stool culture was almost as accurate as the model in predicting bacterial pathogens. conclusions: nearly one-half of the patients who presented to the emergency department with diarrhea had a definite or plausible pathogen in their stool specimens. we were unable to develop a model that was substantially better than physician judgment in identifying patients for whom bacterial culture would yield positive results. the unexpectedly high rate of c. difficile toxin warrants further examination.

TI  == inactivation of escherichia coli by ozone under bench-scale plug flow and full-scale hydraulic conditions.
AB  == to determine the disinfection efficacy of ozonation, water companies can apply several disinfection calculation methods. the goal of this study was to evaluate  the use of the t10 and continuous stirred tank reactor (cstr) method to extrapolate inactivation rates of ozone sensitive microorganisms observed in laboratory tests to full-scale ozonation in drinking water treatment. the inactivation efficacy of the ozonation at the amsterdam water treatment works was assessed by determining escherichia coli concentrations in large volume samples before and after ozonation over a period of 1 year. the inactivation of dosed e.  coli wr1 was tested in a bench-scale dissolved ozone plug flow reactor (dopfr) on the same feed water as the full-scale ozonation in which a concentrated ozone solution in milli-q water was dosed. applying the t10 method on the inactivation  rates observed in the dopfr strongly overestimated the inactivation capacity of the full-scale ozonation. the expected inactivation based on the cstr method (lt2eswtr) approached the observed inactivation at full-scale. therefore, the cstr method should be preferred to calculate inactivation of ozone sensitive organisms such as e. coli, viruses, giardia and campylobacter by full-scale ozonation.

TI  == hydrologic modeling of pathogen fate and transport.
AB  == a watershed-scale fate and transport model has been developed for escherichia coli and several waterborne pathogens: cryptosporidiumspp., giardiaspp., campylobacter spp, and e. coli o157:h7. the objectives were to determine the primary sources of pathogenic contamination in a watershed used for drinking water supply and to gain a greater understanding of the factors that most influence their survival and transport. to predict the levels of indicator bacteria and pathogens in surface water, an existing hydrologic model, watflood,  was augmented for pathogen transport and tested on a watershed in southwestern ontario, canada. the pathogen model considered transport as a result of overland  flow, subsurface flow to tile drainage systems, and in-stream routing. the model  predicted that most microorganisms entering the stream from land-based sources enter the stream from tile drainage systems rather than overland transport. although the model predicted overland transport to be rare, when it occurred, it  corresponded to the highest observed and modeled microbial concentrations. furthermore, rapid increases in measured e. coli concentrations during storm events suggested that the resuspension of microorganisms from stream sediments may be of equal or greater importance than land-based sources of pathogens.

TI  == non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs have bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity against helicobacter pylori.
AB  == background: helicobacter pylori infection and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) are each associated with gastrointestinal mucosal damage, but the  extent and direction of their interactions remain controversial. therefore, the purpose of the present paper was to examine whether specific nsaids inhibit the growth of helicobacter pylori in vitro. methods: sodium salicylate, ibuprofen, indomethacin, the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor ns-398 and two derivatives of sulindac sulfoxide were tested against two laboratory strains of h. pylori, the mouse-adapted sydney strain, and against seven fresh clinical isolates of helicobacter pylori. possible effects on campylobacter jejuni, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and shigella boydii were also examined. results: certain nsaids possess antibacterial activity against helicobacter pylori at therapeutically achievable doses; an effect that appears to be independent of cyclooxygenase enzymes inhibition. for helicobacter pylori,  >90% growth inhibition and bactericidal activity were observed consistently for sulindac sulfide at < or =70 microg/ml and sulindac sulfone at < or =175 microg/ml. the minimal inhibitory concentration against helicobacter pylori was 125 microg/ml for ibuprofen, 100 microg/ml for indomethacin and 300 microg/ml for ns-398 but much higher concentration of sodium salicylate (4000 microg/ml) and sulindac sulfoxide (> or =1250 microg/ml) were required to inhibit the growth of  helicobacter pylori. conclusions: the decreased prevalence of helicobacter pylori in specimens from some nsaid users and the chemopreventive effects of nsaids in gastric cancer may be related to inhibition of helicobacter pylori growth.

TI  == influence of genotype and diet on steer performance, manure odor, and carriage of pathogenic and other fecal bacteria. ii. pathogenic and other fecal bacteria.
AB  == this study assessed the influence of cattle genotype and diet on the carriage and shedding of zoonotic bacterial pathogens and levels of generic escherichia coli in feces and ruminal contents of beef cattle during the growing and finishing periods. fifty-one steers of varying proportions of brahman and marc iii [0 (15), 1/4 (20), 1/2 (7), and 3/4 brahman (9)] genotypes were divided among 8 pens, such that each breed type was represented in each pen. four pens each were assigned to 1 of 2 diets [100% chopped bromegrass hay or a diet composed primarily of corn silage (87%)] that were individually fed for a 119-d growing period, at which time the steers were switched to the same high-concentrate, corn-based finishing  diet and fed to a target weight of 560 kg. feces or ruminal fluid were collected  and analyzed at alternating intervals of 14 d or less. generic e. coli concentrations in feces or ruminal fluid did not differ (p > 0.10) by genotype or by growing diet in the growing or finishing periods. however, the concentrations  in both feces and ruminal fluid increased in all cattle when switched to the same high-corn diet in the finishing period. there was no effect (p > 0.25) of diet or genotype during either period on e. coli o157 shedding in feces. forty-one percent of the steers were positive for campylobacter spp. at least once during the study, and repeated isolations of campylobacter spp. from the same steer were common. these repeated isolations from the same animals may be responsible for the apparent diet (p = 0.05) and genotype effects (p = 0.02) on campylobacter in  feces in the finishing period. cells bearing stx genes were detected frequently in both feces (22.5%) and ruminal fluid (19.6%). the number of stx-positive fecal samples was greater (p < 0.05) for 1/2 brahman steers (42.9%) than for 1/4 brahman (25.0%) or 3/4 brahman steers (22.2%), but were not different compared with marc iii steers (38.3%). the greater feed consumption of 1/2 brahman and marc iii steers may have resulted in greater starch passage into the colon, accompanied by an increase in fecal bacterial populations, which may have further improved the ability to detect stx genes in these cattle. there was no correlation between either adg or daily dmi and the number of positive samples of e. coli o157, campylobacter spp., or stx genes, which agrees with our current understanding that these microorganisms occur commonly in, and with no measurable detriment to, healthy cattle.

TI  == salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens, and plesiomonas shigelloides in marine and freshwater invertebrates from coastal california ecosystems.
AB  == the coastal ecosystems of california are highly utilized by humans and animals, but the ecology of fecal bacteria at the land-sea interface is not well understood. this study evaluated the distribution of potentially pathogenic bacteria in invertebrates from linked marine, estuarine, and freshwater ecosystems in central california. a variety of filter-feeding clams, mussels, worms, and crab tissues were selectively cultured for salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., escherichia coli-o157, clostridium perfringens, plesiomonas shigelloides, and vibrio spp. a longitudinal study assessed environmental risk factors for detecting these bacterial species in sentinel mussel batches. putative risk factors included mussel collection near higher risk areas for livestock or human sewage exposure, adjacent human population density, season, recent precipitation, water temperature, water type, bivalve type, and freshwater outflow exposure. bacteria detected in invertebrates included salmonella spp., c. perfringens, p. shigelloides, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, and vibrio alginolyticus. overall, 80% of mussel batches were culture positive for at least one of the bacterial species, although the pathogens campylobacter, e. coli-o157, and salmonella were not detected. many of the same bacterial species were also cultured from upstream estuarine and riverine invertebrates. exposure to human sewage sources, recent precipitation, and water temperature were significant risk factors for bacterial detection in sentinel mussel batches. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that filter-feeding invertebrates along the coast concentrate fecal bacteria flowing from land to sea and show that the relationships between anthropogenic effects on coastal ecosystems and the environmental niches of fecal bacteria are complex and dynamic.

TI  == incidence and epidemiology of irritable bowel syndrome after a large waterborne outbreak of bacterial dysentery.
AB  == background & aims: postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome (pi-ibs) is a common clinical phenomenon. to better define its incidence and epidemiology, a large cohort study was initiated after the contamination of a municipal water supply led to a large outbreak of acute escherichia coli 0157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni gastroenteritis. methods: local residents were invited to undergo structured assessments at research clinics established 2 years after the outbreak. permanent adult residents with no prior history of inflammatory bowel disease or ibs were eligible. standardized questionnaires defined past and current health. the cohort was divided into controls without gastroenteritis, subjects with clinically suspected gastroenteritis, and subjects with only self-reported gastroenteritis that could not be substantiated by another source.  a modified bowel disease questionnaire identified ibs according to rome criteria. the incidence and epidemiology of pi-ibs was characterized. risk factors were assessed using multiple logistic regression. results: there were 2069 eligible study participants. rome i criteria were met by 71 of 701 controls (10.1%) vs 249 of 904 subjects with self-reported gastroenteritis (27.5%) and 168 of 464 subjects with clinically suspected gastroenteritis (36.2%) (all comparisons, p <  001). independent risk factors for pi-ibs included younger age, female sex, bloody stools, abdominal cramps, weight loss, and prolonged diarrhea. pi-ibs was  more likely than sporadic ibs to show diarrhea-predominant features. conclusions: pi-ibs is common after gastroenteritis from water contamination and often is diarrhea-predominant. characteristics of the acute illness identify patients at increased risk for pi-ibs.

TI  == mixed culture fermentation studies on the effects of synbiotics on the human intestinal pathogens campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli.
AB  == batch and continuous culture anaerobic fermentation systems, inoculated with human faeces, were utilised to investigate the antimicrobial actions of two probiotics, lactobacillus plantarum 0407, combined with oligofructose and bifidobacterium bifidum bb12, combined with a mixture of oligofructose and xylo-oligosaccharides (50:50 w/w) against e. coli and campylobacter jejuni. in batch fermenters, both e. coli and c. jejuni were inhibited by the synbiotics, even when the culture ph was maintained at around neutral. in continuous culture  c. jejuni was inhibited but the synbiotic failed to inhibit e. coli. although no  definitive answer in addressing the mechanisms underlying antimicrobial activity  was derived, results suggested that acetate and lactate directly were conferring  antagonistic action, rather than as a result of lowering culture ph. in the course of the study culturing and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (fish) methodologies for the enumeration of bacterial populations were compared. bifidobacterial populations were underestimated using plating techniques, suggesting the non-culturability of certain bifidobacterial species.

TI  == a bayesian approach to acute infectious diarrhea in adults.
AB  == acute infectious diarrhea is a yearly occurrence for most americans, and is associated with 1 million hospitalizations and about 6000 deaths in the united states annually. up to 80% of acute infectious diarrhea is caused by noroviruses, which produce a clinically mild illness with a predictable short course and good  outcome that make laboratory testing and antimicrobial treatment unnecessary. most diarrhea-causing bacteria and protozoa can cause a clinical illness "like norovirus"; when they do so in healthy adults neither specialized testing nor antimicrobials is required. the presence or absence of epidemiologic evidence (such as travel, hospitalization, antibiotic use, other exposures)and clinical evidence (such as diarrhea frequency and duration, severity of abdominal pain and fever, character of stool, presence of chronic illness or immune deficiency) can  change the probability of "not norovirus" from as low as 8% to as high as 100%. such probabilities guide the use of laboratory testing and antimicrobial therapy  in patients who have acute infectious diarrhea.

AB  == previous studies have reported beta-lactamase-mediated penicillin resistance in fusobacterium nucleatum, but no beta-lactamase gene has yet been identified in this species. an f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum strain resistant to penicillin and amoxicillin was isolated from a human periodontitis sample. dna cloning and sequencing revealed a 765-bp open reading frame encoding a new class d beta-lactamase named fus-1 (oxa-85). a recombinant escherichia coli strain carrying the bla(fus-1) gene exhibited resistance to amoxicillin with a moderate  decrease in the mics with clavulanic acid. the bla(fus-1) gene was found in two additional clonally unrelated f. nucleatum subsp. polymorphum isolates. it was located on the chromosome in a peculiar genetic environment where a gene encoding a putative transposase-like protein is found, suggesting a possible acquisition of this class d beta-lactamase gene. the fus-1 enzyme showed the closest ancestral relationship with oxa-63 from brachyspira pilosicoli (53% identity) and with putative chromosomal beta-lactamases of campylobacter spp. (40 to 42% identity). fus-1 presents all of the conserved structural motifs of class d beta-lactamases. kinetic analysis revealed that fus-1 exhibits a narrow substrate profile, efficiently hydrolyzing benzylpenicillin and oxacillin. fus-1 was poorly inactivated by clavulanate and nacl. fus-1 is the first example of a class d beta-lactamase produced by a gram-negative, anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium to be characterized.

TI  == microbial drug efflux proteins of the major facilitator superfamily.
AB  == drug efflux proteins are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens.  they can contribute to both natural insensitivity to antibiotics and to emerging  antibiotic resistance and so are potential targets for the development of new antibacterial drugs. the design of such drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these transport proteins, which are poorly understood, because of the difficulties of obtaining crystals of quality. we describe a structural genomics approach for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of prokaryotic drug efflux proteins of the 'major facilitator superfamily' (mfs) of transport proteins from helicobacter pylori, staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus  subtilis, brucella melitensis, campylobacter jejuni, neisseria meningitides and streptomyces coelicolor. the h. pylori putative drug resistance protein, hp1092,  and the s. aureus qaca proteins are used as detailed examples. this strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination.

TI  == surveillance for bacterial diarrhea and antimicrobial resistance in rural western kenya, 1997-2003.
AB  == background: diarrhea is a major cause of preventable illness in sub-saharan africa. although most cases of bacterial gastroenteritis do not require antimicrobial treatment, antimicrobial use is widespread. we examined the bacterial causes of diarrhea and monitored antimicrobial susceptibilities of isolates through clinic-based surveillance in a rural kenyan community. methods:  from may 1997 through april 2003, diarrheal stool samples from persons presenting to 4 sentinel health centers were cultured by standard techniques for routine bacterial enteric pathogens, for which antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined. a random subset of specimens was also evaluated for diarrheagenic escherichia coli. results: among stool specimens from 3445 persons, 1092 (32%) yielded at least 1 bacterial pathogen. shigella species was most commonly isolated (responsible for 16% of all illnesses; 54% of isolates were shigella flexneri). campylobacter species and diarrheagenic e. coli predominated among children aged <5 years and were progressively replaced by shigella species with increasing age. with the exception of campylobacter species, susceptibility to the antimicrobials used most widely in the community was low: <40% for all isolates tested and <25% for shigella species. most persons were treated with an  antimicrobial to which their isolate was resistant. susceptibility to specific antimicrobials was inversely proportional to the frequency with which they were prescribed. conclusions: the utility of available antimicrobials for treating bacterial diarrhea in rural western kenya is substantially limited by reduced susceptibility. more judicious use of appropriate antimicrobials is warranted. efforts to prevent illness through provision of clean water, improved hygiene, and vaccine development should be strengthened.

TI  == cladophora (chlorophyta) spp. harbor human bacterial pathogens in nearshore water of lake michigan.
AB  == cladophora glomerata, a macrophytic green alga, is commonly found in the great lakes, and significant accumulations occur along shorelines during the summer months. recently, cladophora has been shown to harbor high densities of the fecal indicator bacteria escherichia coli and enterococci. cladophora may also harbor human pathogens; however, until now, no studies to address this question have been performed. in the present study, we determined whether attached cladophora,  obtained from the lake michigan and burns ditch (little calumet river, indiana) sides of a breakwater during the summers of 2004 and 2005, harbored the bacterial pathogens shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), salmonella, shigella, and campylobacter. the presence of potential pathogens and numbers of organisms were determined by using cultural methods and by using conventional pcr, most-probable-number pcr (mpn-pcr), and quantitative pcr (qpcr) performed with genus- and toxin-specific primers and probes. while shigella and stec were detected in 100% and 25%, respectively, of the algal samples obtained near burns  ditch in 2004, the same pathogens were not detected in samples collected in 2005. mpn-pcr and qpcr allowed enumeration of salmonella in 40 to 80% of the ditch- and lakeside samples, respectively, and the densities were up to 1.6 x 10(3) cells per g cladophora. similarly, these pcr methods allowed enumeration of up to 5.4 x 10(2) campylobacter cells/g cladophora in 60 to 100% of lake- and ditchside samples. the campylobacter densities were significantly higher (p < 0.05) in the  lakeside cladophora samples than in the ditchside cladophora samples. dna fingerprint analyses indicated that genotypically identical salmonella isolates were associated with geographically and temporally distinct cladophora samples. however, campylobacter isolates were genetically diverse. since animal hosts are  thought to be the primary habitat for campylobacter and salmonella species, our results suggest that cladophora is a likely secondary habitat for pathogenic bacteria in lake michigan and that the association of these bacteria with cladophora warrants additional studies to assess the potential health impact on beach users.

TI  == berry phenolics: antimicrobial properties and mechanisms of action against severe human pathogens.
AB  == antimicrobial activity and mechanisms of phenolic extracts of 12 nordic berries were studied against selected human pathogenic microbes. the most sensitive bacteria on berry phenolics were helicobacter pylori and bacillus cereus. campylobacter jejuni and candida albicans were inhibited only with phenolic extracts of cloudberry, raspberry, and strawberry, which all were rich in ellagitannins. cloudberry extract gave strong microbicidic effects on the basis of plate count with all studied strains. however, fluorescence staining of liquid cultures of virulent salmonella showed viable cells not detectable by plate count adhering to cloudberry extract, whereas staphylococcus aureus cells adhered to berry extracts were dead on the basis of their fluorescence and plate count. phenolic extracts of cloudberry and raspberry disintegrated the outer membrane of examined salmonella strains as indicated by 1-n-phenylnaphthylamine (npn) uptake  increase and analysis of liberation of [14c]galactose- lipopolysaccharide. gallic acid effectively permeabilized the tested salmonella strains, and significant increase in the npn uptake was recorded. the stability of berry phenolics and their antimicrobial activity in berries stored frozen for a year were examined using escherichia coli and nonvirulent salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium. the amount of phenolic compounds decreased in all berries, but their antimicrobial activity was not influenced accordingly. cloudberry, in particular, showed constantly strong antimicrobial activity during the storage.

AB  == the incidence of aetiology-specific diarrhoea and the pathogenicity of infectious agents in a birth cohort (n=252) in rural bangladesh were determined. stool specimens or rectal swabs were collected from diarrhoeal cases over two years and routinely on a monthly basis. stool samples from children with diarrhoea were compared with stool samples from children without diarrhoea to calculate rates of isolation and pathogenicity of agents. in total, 1750 stool specimens from diarrhoea patients and 5679 stool specimens from children without diarrhoea were  tested. an infectious agent was identified in 58% of the stool specimens from diarrhoea patients and 21.6% of the stool specimens from children without diarrhoea. the most commonly-isolated pathogens from all specimens were enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), enteroadherent e. coli, shigella, campylobacter jejuni, giardia, and rotavirus. etec (st and lt-st toxin), enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, shigella, and rotavirus were associated more with disease than with asymptomatic infections. aetiology-specific infections were associated with acute episodes. the isolated enteropathogens were essentially the same as those found in other tropical rural settings. enterotoxigenic b. fragilis was also identified as a pathogen. ongoing vaccine efforts focusing on shigella, rotavirus, and etec would be useful.

AB  == eighty steers with a mean body weight of 319 kg were used in a study to evaluate  the effect of a growth-promoting implant (trenbolone acetate plus estradiol benzoate), monensin, and oxytetracycline on the steer performance and shedding of some foodborne pathogens. the steers were allotted to one of eight treatment combinations according to a randomized complete block design with 16 pens of five animals. rectal fecal samples were collected before treatment commenced and over  a period of more than 24 weeks to study the influence of treatments on the intestinal microbiology of the animals. results supported the beneficial effect of the hormonal implant on the performance of feedlot steers (average daily gain, feed efficiency, and fat thickness), on carcass characteristics (hot carcass weight, lean yield), and economic value of the carcasses (p < 0.01). the levels of escherichia coli in feces were not affected by treatments but remained high throughout the study period. antibiotic-resistant isolates of e. coli were more frequently found as the study progressed but were not associated with any specific treatment. also independently of treatment, we observed a reduction over time in the shedding of campylobacter and yersinia during the feeding period, whereas the shedding of enterococcus was increased. the results of this study confirmed the beneficial economic effect of growth-promoting agents in beef production and showed that the agents tested did not specifically affect the overall microbial evolution of the animal gut. however, the study also showed, independently of the growth promoter used, the shedding of campylobacter, yersinia, and antibiotic-resistant e. coli in the feedlot environment. these bacteria also may be found in the colonic tissue of steers at slaughter and might be a source of carcasses contamination.

TI  == [present situation of national surveillance of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from farm animals in japan and correspondence to the issue].
AB  == the japanese veterinary antimicrobial resistance monitoring system (jvarm) was formed in 1999 in response to international concerns about the impact of antimicrobial resistance on public health. the aim of the present investigation was to provide insight into the occurrence of antimicrobial resistance among bacterial strains isolated from cattle, swine and poultry on farms across japan.  in this paper, we summarize a nationwide investigation (1999-2003) on antimicrobial susceptibility of the targeted bacterial species for the jvarm, namely salmonella, campylobacter, enterococcus and escherichia coli, isolated from the feces of healthy domestic animals. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of 10-18 antimicrobial agents including the major generic groups were determined using an agar dilution method according to the international nccls guideline in principle. the outline of present results is as follows: (1) a total of 307 salmonella, 3,225 escherichia coli, 2,822 enterococcus and 1,122 campylobacter were isolated from healthy domestic animals and examined for antimicrobial susceptibility. (2) the isolates of all targeted bacterial species  represent high rates of antimicrobial resistance to both oxytetracycline (otc) and dihydrostreptomycin (dsm). (3) among the isolates of campylobacter and e. coli, the frequency of isolation of resistance to fluoroquinolones ranged from 14 to 24% and 2 to 3%, respectively. (4) resistance to fluoroquinolones was not observed among the isolates of salmonella or enterococcus. continious investigation at the nation level of antimicrobial resistance among the isolates  from healthy domestic animals remains a high priority for the jvarm program. furthermore, appropriate and prudent use of antimicrobials for diseased animals should be considered essential.

AB  == several foodborne pathogens, including salmonella species and campylobacters, are common contaminants in poultry and livestock. typically, these pathogens are carried in the animal's intestinal tract asymptomatically; however, they can be shed in feces in large populations and be transmitted by other vectors from feces to animals, produce, or humans. a wide array of interventions has been developed  to reduce the carriage of foodborne pathogens in poultry and livestock, including genetic selection of animals resistant to colonization, treatments to prevent vertical transmission of enteric pathogens, sanitation practices to prevent contamination on the farm and during transportation, elimination of pathogens from feed and water, feed and water additives that create an adverse environment  for colonization by the pathogen, and biological treatments that directly or indirectly inactivate the pathogen within the host. to successfully reduce the carriage of foodborne pathogens, it is likely that a combination of intervention  strategies will be required.

TI  == a survey of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk and raw milk consumption among  farm families in pennsylvania.
AB  == a 2-part study was conducted to determine the risk of exposure to human pathogens from raw milk. the first part of the study focused on determining raw milk consumption habits of dairy producers. a total of 248 dairy producers from 16 counties in pennsylvania were surveyed. overall, 105 (42.3%) of the 248 dairy producers consumed raw milk and 170 (68.5%) of the 248 dairy producers were aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk. dairy producers who were not aware of foodborne pathogens in raw milk were 2-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with dairy producers who were aware of foodborne pathogens. the majority of dairy producers who consumed raw milk indicated that taste (72%) and convenience (60%) were the primary factors for consuming raw milk. dairy producers who resided on the dairy farm were nearly 3-fold more likely to consume raw milk compared with those who lived elsewhere. in the second part of the study, bulk tank milk from the 248 participating dairy herds was examined for foodborne pathogens. campylobacter jejuni (2%), shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (2.4%), listeria monocytogenes (2.8%), salmonella (6%), and yersinia enterocolitica (1.2%) were detected in the milk samples. salmonella isolates were identified as s. enterica serotype typhimurium (n = 10) and s. enterica serotype  newport (n = 5). of the 248 bulk tank milk samples, 32 (13%) contained > or = 1 species of bacterial pathogens. the findings of the study could assist in developing farm community-based educational programs on the risks of consuming raw milk.

TI  == comparison of escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni transport in saturated porous media.
AB  == due to the difficulties in testing for specific pathogens, water samples are tested for the presence of nonpathogenic indicator organisms to determine whether a water supply has been contaminated by fecal material. an implicit assumption in this approach is that where pathogenic microorganisms are present fecal indicator organisms are present as well; yet surprisingly few studies have been conducted that directly compare the transport of indicator organisms with pathogenic organisms in ground water environments. in this study we compared the cell properties and transport of escherichia coli, a commonly used indicator organism, and campylobacter jejuni, an important enteropathogen commonly found in agricultural wastes, through saturated porous media. differences in cell properties were determined by measuring cell geometry, hydrophobicity, and electrophoretic mobility. transport differences were determined by conducting miscible displacement experiments in laboratory columns. under the experimental conditions tested, c. jejuni was much more negatively charged and more hydrophobic than e. coli. in addition, c. jejuni cells were slightly longer, narrower, and less spherical than e. coli. the variations in cell properties, primarily surface charge, resulted in significant differences in transport between these two microorganisms, with the transport of c. jejuni exceeding that  of e. coli when conditions favored low attachment rates, thus calling into question the usefulness of using e. coli as an indicator organism for this important pathogen.

TI  == macrolide resistance in campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli.
AB  == infection with campylobacter jejuni is now considered to be the most common cause of acute bacterial gastroenteritis in humans worldwide. it occurs more frequently than infections caused by salmonella species, shigella species, or escherichia coli o157:h7. although c. jejuni is also recognized for its association with serious post-infection neurological complications, most patients with c. jejuni infections have a self-limited illness. nevertheless, a substantial proportion of these infections are treated with antibiotics. these include severe and prolonged cases of enteritis, infections in immune-suppressed patients, septicaemia and other extra-intestinal infections. under these circumstances, erythromycin is often recommended as the drug of first choice. however, erythromycin-resistant campylobacter have emerged during therapy with macrolides. moreover, the widespread use of macrolides, including erythromycin, in veterinary medicine has  accelerated this resistance trend. several countries including canada, japan and  finland have reported c. jejuni isolates with low and stable rates of macrolide resistance. in contrast, the increasing level of macrolide resistance in c. jejuni is becoming a major public health concern in other parts of the world such as the united states, europe and taiwan. macrolide resistance in campylobacter is mainly associated with point mutation(s) occurring in the peptidyl-encoding region in domain v of the 23s rrna gene, the target of macrolides. several rapid  and practical techniques have recently been developed for the identification of macrolide-resistant isolates of c. jejuni. the aim of this mini-review is to give an overview of the worldwide distribution of macrolide resistance in c. jejuni and campylobacter coli as well as its possible association with the massive use of these agents in food animals. mechanisms implicated in macrolide resistance in c. jejuni and also techniques that have been developed for the efficient detection of macrolide-associated mutation(s) will be discussed in detail.

TI  == prevalence of selected bacterial infections associated with the use of animal waste in louisiana.
AB  == human health is a major concern when considering the disposal of large quantities of animal waste. health concerns could arise from exposure to pathogens and excess nitrogen associated with this form of pollution. the objective was to collect and analyze health data related to selected bacterial infections associated with the use of animal waste in louisiana. an analysis of adverse health effects has been conducted based on the incidence/prevalence rates of campylobacteriosis, e. coli o157:h7 infection, salmonellosis and shigellosis. the number of reported cases increased during the summer months. analysis of health data showed that reported disease cases of e. coli o157:h7 were highest among caucasian infants in the 0-4 year old age category and in caucasian children in the 5-9 year old age category. fatalities resulting from salmonellosis are low and increases sharply with age. the number of reported cases of shigellosis was found to be higher in african american males and females than in caucasians. the  high rate of identification in the younger population may result from the prompt  seeking of medical care, as well as the frequent ordering of stool examination when symptoms become evident among this group of the population. the association  with increasing age and fatality due to salmonellosis could be attributed to declining health and weaker immune systems often found in the older population. it is concluded that both animal waste and non-point source pollution may have a  significant impact on human health.

AB  == background & aims: we have developed a therapeutic strategy based on molecular mimicry of host receptors for bacterial toxins on the surface of harmless gut bacteria. in the present study, this has been applied to the development of a recombinant probiotic for treatment and prevention of cholera, caused by vibrio cholerae. methods: we expressed glycosyltransferase genes from neisseria gonorrhoeae and campylobacter jejuni in a harmless escherichia coli strain, resulting in production of a chimeric lipopolysaccharide terminating in a mimic of the ganglioside gm(1). results: the recombinant bacterium was capable of binding cholera toxin, a sine qua non of virulence, with high avidity; when tested with purified cholera toxin, it was capable of adsorbing >5% of its own weight of toxin in vitro. administration of the gm(1)-expressing probiotic also protected infant mice against challenge with virulent v cholerae, even when treatment was delayed until after establishment of infection. when treatment commenced 1 hour after challenge, 12 of 12 mice given the probiotic survived, compared with only 1 of 12 for control mice (p < .00001). conclusions: toxin-binding probiotics such as that described here have considerable potential  for prophylaxis and treatment of cholera in humans.

TI  == substrate specificity of bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase suggests a common transfer mechanism for the bacterial and eukaryotic systems.
AB  == the pglb oligosaccharyltransferase (otase) of campylobacter jejuni can be functionally expressed in escherichia coli, and its relaxed oligosaccharide substrate specificity allows the transfer of different glycans from the lipid carrier undecaprenyl pyrophosphate to an acceptor protein. to investigate the substrate specificity of pglb, we tested the transfer of a set of lipid-linked polysaccharides in e. coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. a hexose  linked to the c-6 of the monosaccharide at the reducing end did not inhibit the transfer of the o antigen to the acceptor protein. however, pglb required an acetamido group at the c-2. a model for the mechanism of pglb involving this functional group was proposed. previous experiments have shown that eukaryotic otases have the same requirement, suggesting that eukaryotic and prokaryotic otases catalyze the transfer of oligosaccharides by a conserved mechanism. moreover, we demonstrated the functional transfer of the c. jejuni glycosylation  system into s. enterica. the elucidation of the mechanism of action and the substrate specificity of pglb represents the foundation for engineering glycoproteins that will have an impact on biotechnology.

TI  == expression and purification of native and truncated forms of cadf, an outer membrane protein of campylobacter.
AB  == campylobacter is now recognized as the most common bacterial agent of gastroenteritis. the adhesion of bacteria to intestinal cells is a major step in  human colonization. the binding of campylobacter jejuni cells to fibronectin (fn), a component of the extra cellular matrix, is mediated by a 37,000 outer membrane protein termed cadf for campylobacter adhesion to fn. cadf protein is very hard to purify from campylobacter membranes. in order to study the conformation of this protein, we set out to clone, express, purify, and re-fold the cadf protein. the nucleotide sequence encoding the n-terminal domain of the cadf protein was cloned in a pet-based expression vector. the recombinant protein was further produced in escherichia coli, purified from inclusion bodies, and refolded. more specifically, the purification experiments were set-up as follows: (i) protein aggregates were collected from cell-lysates, solubilized in urea and  enriched by ion-exchange chromatography; (ii) refolding was achieved by drop-by-drop dilution method in detergent containing buffer and monitored by cd measurements; (iii) the protein was finally purified to homogeneity by gel filtration chromatography. in spite of our success in purifying the n-terminal domain of the cadf protein, repeated attempts to express and purify the entire cadf gene in e. coli failed. using a novel approach, we found it possible to express the entire cadf gene fused to a hexa-histidine encoding nucleotide sequence in c. jejuni. this allowed the expression, synthesis, and purification of the recombinant cadf-his tagged protein from c. jejuni by nickel affinity chromatography followed by gel filtration chromatography. in summary, we developed a novel strategy to produce significant quantities of a recombinant n-terminal portion of the cadf protein (46.5 microg/mg of bacterial dry weight) and of the native cadf protein (3.5 microg/mg of bacterial dry weight) for further studies.

TI  == definition of the bacterial n-glycosylation site consensus sequence.
AB  == the campylobacter jejuni pgl locus encodes an n-linked protein glycosylation machinery that can be functionally transferred into escherichia coli. in this system, we analyzed the elements in the c. jejuni n-glycoprotein acra required for accepting an n-glycan. we found that the eukaryotic primary consensus sequence for n-glycosylation is n terminally extended to d/e-y-n-x-s/t (y, x not  equalp) for recognition by the bacterial oligosaccharyltransferase (ost) pglb. however, not all consensus sequences were n-glycosylated when they were either artificially introduced or when they were present in non-c. jejuni proteins. we were able to produce recombinant glycoproteins with engineered n-glycosylation sites and confirmed the requirement for a negatively charged side chain at position -2 in c. jejuni n-glycoproteins. n-glycosylation of acra by the eukaryotic ost in saccharomyces cerevisiae occurred independent of the acidic residue at the -2 position. thus, bacterial n-glycosylation site selection is more specific than the eukaryotic equivalent with respect to the polypeptide acceptor sequence.

TI  == direct biochemical evidence for the utilization of udp-bacillosamine by pglc, an  essential glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase in the campylobacter jejuni n-linked glycosylation pathway.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni has a general n-linked glycosylation pathway, encoded by the pgl gene cluster. in c. jejuni, a heptasaccharide is transferred from an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate donor [galnac-alpha1,4-galnac-alpha1,4-(glcbeta1,3)-galnac-alpha1,4-galnac-alpha1,4-gal nac-alpha1,3-bac-alpha1-pp-undecaprenyl, where bac is bacillosamine (2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyglucose)] to the asparagine side chain of target proteins at the asn-x-ser/thr motif. in this study, we have cloned, overexpressed in escherichia coli, and purified pglc, the glycosyl-1-phosphate transferase responsible for the first step in the biosynthesis of the undecaprenyl-linked heptasaccharide donor. in addition, we report the first synthetic route to uridine 5'-diphosphobacillosamine. using the uridine 5'-diphosphobacillosamine and undecaprenyl phosphate, we demonstrate the ability of pglc to produce undecaprenyl pyrophosphate bacillosamine using radiolabeled hplc and mass spectral analysis. in addition, we revealed that pglc does not accept uridine 5'-diphospho-n-acetylglucosamine or uridine 5'-diphospho-n-acetylgalactosamine as substrates but will accept uridine 5'-diphospho-6-hydroxybacillosamine, an analogue of bacillosamine that retains the c-6 hydroxyl functionality from the biosynthetic precursor. the in vitro characterization of pglc as a bacillosamine  1-phosphoryl transferase provides direct evidence for the early steps in the c. jejuni n-linked glycosylation pathway, and the coupling of pglc with the latter glycosyltransferases (pgla, pglj, pglh, and pgli) allows for the "one-pot" chemoenzymatic synthesis of the undecaprenyl pyrophosphate heptasaccharide donor.

TI  == a time series analysis of the relationship of ambient temperature and common bacterial enteric infections in two canadian provinces.
AB  == the incidence of enteric infections in the canadian population varies seasonally, and may be expected to be change in response to global climate changes. to better understand any potential impact of warmer temperature on enteric infections in canada, we investigated the relationship between ambient temperature and weekly reports of confirmed cases of three pathogens in canada: salmonella, pathogenic escherichia coli and campylobacter, between 1992 and 2000 in two canadian provinces. we used generalized linear models (glms) and generalized additive models (gams) to estimate the effect of seasonal adjustments on the estimated models. we found a strong non-linear association between ambient temperature and  the occurrence of all three enteric pathogens in alberta, canada, and of campylobacter in newfoundland-labrador. threshold models were used to quantify the relationship of disease and temperature with thresholds chosen from 0 to -10  degrees c depending on the pathogen modeled. for alberta, the log relative risk of salmonella weekly case counts increased by 1.2%, campylobacter weekly case counts increased by 2.2%, and e. coli weekly case counts increased by 6.0% for every degree increase in weekly mean temperature. for newfoundland-labrador the log relative risk increased by 4.5% for campylobacter for every degree increase in weekly mean temperature.

AB  == objective: a municipal water system became contaminated with escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter spp. beginning 2 years after an outbreak, all residents from the region were invited to participate in a cohort study assessing the risk  of long-term sequelae. we aimed to develop a method to grade the accuracy and severity of self-reported acute symptoms. study design and setting: we corroborated participant survey responses with health records at the time of the  outbreak. of the 4,135 participants, 1,388 were asymptomatic during the outbreak, 1,752 had symptoms of acute self-limited gastroenteritis that could neither be confirmed nor refuted by prior health records, and 995 had symptoms that necessitated medical attention (and thus were confirmed by prior health records). results: the gradient related to the severity of acute symptoms. compared to those with unconfirmed gastroenteritis, participants with confirmed gastroenteritis were more likely to describe fever, bloody diarrhea, and prolonged diarrhea (all p < .03). the gradient also correlated with long-term plausible outcomes, including chronic gastrointestinal symptoms, chronic symptoms of arthritis or depression, and the avoidance of municipal water ingestion after  the outbreak (p for trend consistently < .03). conversely, for the outcome of chronic tinnitus, an association was neither expected nor observed (p for trend = .26). conclusion: we successfully characterized a gradient to be used in future primary analyses assessing the risk of long-term health sequelae after an outbreak.

TI  == absence of substrate channeling between active sites in the agrobacterium tumefaciens ispdf and ispe enzymes of the methyl erythritol phosphate pathway.
AB  == the conversion of 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate (mep) to 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate (cmedp) in the mep entry into the isoprenoid biosynthetic pathway occurs in three consecutive steps catalyzed by the ispd, ispe, and ispf enzymes, respectively. in agrobacterium tumefaciens the  ispd and ispf genes are fused to encode a bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the  first (synthesis of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2-c-methyl d-erythritol) and third (synthesis of 2-c-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate) steps. sedimentation  velocity experiments indicate that the bifunctional ispdf enzyme and the ispe protein associate in solution, raising the possibility of substrate channeling among the active sites in these two proteins. kinetic evidence for substrate channeling was sought by measuring the time courses for product formation during  incubations of mep, ctp, and atp with the ispdf and ispe proteins with and without an excess of the inactive ispe(d152a) mutant in the presence or absence of 30% (v/v) glycerol. the time dependencies indicate that the enzyme-generated intermediates are not transferred from the ispd active site in ispdf to the active site of ispe or from the active site in ispe to the active site of the ispf module of ispdf.

TI  == effects of lactoferrin supplementation on ileal and total tract nutrient digestibility, gastrointestinal microbial populations, and immune characteristics of ileal cannulated, healthy, adult dogs.
AB  == orally supplemented lactoferrin derived from bovine milk is purported to have beneficial effects on gut health of animals. bovine lactoferrin (0, 60, or 120 mg/d) was fed to ileal cannulated, adult dogs in a replicated 3 x 3 latin square  design with 14 d periods. control dogs tended (p = 0.06) to have higher fecal dm  concentrations compared with dogs supplemented with 120 mg/d lactoferrin (34.5 vs. 32.9%). fecal scores ranged from 3.0 - 3.3, suggesting that feces of all dogs was near the desired consistency, with dogs supplemented with 120 mg/d lactoferrin tending (p = 0.08) to have higher fecal scores. ileal azoreductase activity tended (p < 0.10) to be higher in dogs supplemented with 60 or 120 mg/d  lactoferrin (609 vs. 592 nmol/h per g ileal dm, respectively) as compared with unsupplemented dogs (272 nmol/h per g ileal dm). the following bacterial groups were measured: bifidobacteria, campylobacter spp., clostridium spp., eubacteria,  escherichia coli, lactobacillus spp., staphylococcus spp., and streptococcus spp. fecal streptococci concentrations were lower (p < 0.05) for dogs receiving 60 mg/d lactoferrin (8.60 log10 cfu/g fecal dm) as compared with unsupplemented dogs (9.19 log10 cfu/g fecal dm) or dogs receiving 120mg lactoferrin/d (9.43 log10 cfu/g fecal dm). dogs supplemented with 120mg/d lactoferrin tended (p = 0.08) to  have higher fecal indole concentrations as compared to unsupplemented dogs (1.80  vs. 1.46 micromol/g fecal dm). because most bacterial groups measured were unaffected, it appears that lactoferrin did not exhibit prebiotic activity, and based on the data collected, lactoferrin also did not appear to have major effects on indices of health in the dog.

TI  == travellers' diarrhoea: contemporary approaches to therapy and prevention.
AB  == travellers' diarrhoea remains a major public health problem, contributing to significant morbidity and disability. because bacterial enteropathogens cause a majority of this form of diarrhoea, antibacterial drugs are effective when used in chemoprophylaxis or for empirical treatment.a review of the medline listings for travellers' diarrhoea for the past 4 years was conducted; a library of >1,000 scientific articles on the topic was also considered in developing this review. persons who travel from industrialised countries to developing countries of the tropical and semi-tropical world are the individuals who experience travellers' diarrhoea. while diarrhoea occurs with reduced frequency among persons travelling to low-risk areas from other low- or other high-risk areas, and there remain areas of intermediate risk, this review looks primarily at the illness occurring  in persons from industrialised regions visiting high-risk regions of latin america, africa and southern asia. the material reviewed deals with the high frequency of acquiring diarrhoea during international travel to high-risk areas,  seen in approximately 40%, and the expected bacterial causes of illness, of which diarrhoeagenic escherichia coli is the most important. the host risk factors associated with increased susceptibility to diarrhoea include young age, lack of  previous travel to high-risk regions in the past 6 months, indiscriminate food and beverage selection patterns, and host genetics. it appears feasible to decrease the rate of illness among the travelling public by careful food and beverage selection or through chemoprophylaxis with nonabsorbed rifaximin. chemoprophylaxis with rifaximin should help to reduce the occurrence of travellers' diarrhoea and hopefully prevent post-diarrhoea complications, including irritable bowel syndrome. early empirical therapy with antibacterial drugs, including rifaximin, a fluoroquinolone or azithromycin, will decrease the  duration of illness and return travellers more quickly to their planned activities.with collaboration between local governments and public health researchers, it may be possible to improve hygiene in areas to be visited, which  may translate into reduced rates of illness. more liberal use of rifaximin prophylaxis is likely to reduce the occurrence of illness and complications of disease. vaccines and immunoprophylactic products may be beneficial for prevention of a subset of individuals otherwise developing diarrhoea.

TI  == recovery of bacteria from broiler carcasses rinsed zero and twenty-four hours after immersion chilling.
AB  == microbiological sampling of processed broiler carcasses often relies on the technique of whole-carcass rinsing; however, the rinse sampling is sometimes done immediately after immersion chilling and sometimes as long as 24 h after immersion chilling. to test whether carcass rinses done immediately after chilling can be compared with rinses 24 h after chilling, 20 whole broiler carcasses exiting the chiller of a broiler processing plant were sampled on each  of 3 d. all carcasses were bagged aseptically and rinsed for 1 min in 400 ml of sterile water. recovered rinse liquid was poured into a sterile container, and rinsed carcasses were placed in clean plastic bags; all materials were held overnight at 4 degrees c. on the following day, all carcasses were rinsed again in 400 ml of sterile water as before, and all rinse samples were cultured by standard methods to enumerate coliforms, escherichia coli, and campylobacter and  to determine incidence of salmonella. statistical analysis used paired comparisons between the same carcasses rinsed at 0 and 24 h after chilling; numbers of bacteria were expressed as log cfu/ml of rinse. in 2 of 3 replications, significantly higher numbers of coliforms and e. coli were found in the rinse samples taken immediately after chilling vs. rinse samples done at 24 h. there were no differences in numbers of campylobacter or incidence of salmonella between rinses taken at 0 and 24 h. more study is required to determine whether whole-carcass rinse samples performed at 0 and 24 h after chilling are microbiologically equivalent.

TI  == is the enthesitis-related arthritis subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis a form of chronic reactive arthritis?
AB  == objective: enteric organisms are known to trigger reactive arthritis. the enthesitis-related arthritis (era) form of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (jia) clinically resembles reactive arthritis. therefore, we looked for a role of enteric bacteria in era. methods: synovial fluid (sf) was obtained from 26 patients with era and 10 patients with rheumatoid arthritis (ra). blood specimens were also obtained from patients with era and from 10 normal individuals. lymphocyte proliferation assays were done on whole blood and sf mononuclear cells using as antigens crude lysates of the enteric bacteria salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella flexneri and campylobacter jejuni. crude lysate of escherichia coli was used as a control antigen. hla-b27 typing was done using  the polymerase chain reaction. homing of gut-specific t cells (cd103+) to the synovial compartment was studied using tri-colour flow cytometry. the antigen-specific cytokine profile was determined by flow cytometry. results: antigen-specific lymphoproliferative responses were observed in 14 of 26 patients. among these patients, 12 showed a response in sf (four each to s. typhimurium and c. jejuni, and in two each to s. flexneri and y. enterocolitica), and two patients in blood (s. typhimurium in both). none of the healthy controls  showed a response in the blood. lymphoproliferative responses in sf were more frequent in patients with jia (12/26) than in controls with ra (1/10, p < 0.05).  patients with an antigen-specific response had a higher ratio of sf/blood cd103+  t cells compared with those with no antigen-specific response (p < 0.01). antigen-specific as well as mitogen-stimulated cytokine production showed a th1 bias. conclusion: enteric bacteria may have a role in exacerbation of disease in  patients with era. the immune response in patients with era is th1-dominant.

TI  == two distinct but interchangeable mechanisms for flipping of lipid-linked oligosaccharides.
AB  == translocation of lipid-linked oligosaccharide (llo) intermediates across membranes is an essential but poorly understood process in eukaryotic and bacterial glycosylation pathways. membrane proteins defined as translocases or flippases are implicated to mediate the translocation reaction. the membrane protein wzx has been proposed to mediate the translocation across the plasma membrane of lipopolysaccharide (lps) o antigen subunits, which are assembled on an undecaprenyl pyrophosphate lipid carrier. similarly, pglk (formerly wlab) is a campylobacter jejuni-encoded abc-type transporter proposed to mediate the translocation of the undecaprenylpyrophosphate-linked heptasaccharide intermediate involved in the recently identified bacterial n-linked protein glycosylation pathway. a combination of genetic and carbohydrate structural analyses defined and characterized flippase activities in the c. jejuni n-linked  protein glycosylation and the escherichia coli lps o antigen biosynthesis. pglk displayed relaxed substrate specificity with respect to the oligosaccharide structure of the llo intermediate and complemented a wzx deficiency in e. coli o-antigen biosynthesis. our experiments provide strong genetic evidence that llo  translocation across membranes can be catalyzed by two distinct proteins that do  not share any sequence similarity.

TI  == prevalence and numbers of bacteria in broiler crop and gizzard contents.
AB  == crops or gizzards in broiler carcasses are frequently damaged during processing.  the contents from either organ, defined by the usda food safety and inspection service as ingesta, may contaminate the carcass. previous research has shown crop contents are a source of salmonella contamination on processed carcasses, although less information is available on gizzard contents. the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and numbers of total aerobic bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, and campylobacter in ingesta collected from the crop and gizzard. in each of 3 replicate trials, 10 uneviscerated broiler carcasses were obtained from a processor at the shackle transfer point just prior to evisceration. liquid crop contents and solid gizzard contents were aseptically collected from each carcass and quantitatively cultured. total aerobic bacteria,  coliforms, e. coli, and campylobacter were determined for contents from both organs. crop contents (log cfu/ml), compared with gizzard contents (log cfu/g), contained significantly (p < 0.05) higher numbers of total aerobic bacteria (5.6  vs. 2.9), coliforms (4.2 vs. 2.3), e. coli (3.9 vs. 2.2), and campylobacter (4.6  vs. 2.2). escherichia coli prevalence was higher in crop samples (28 of 29) than  gizzard samples (19 of 30). campylobacter prevalence was also higher for crop vs. gizzard samples (29 of 29 vs. 12 of 30). an average of 2.4 g of crop contents and 8.4 g of gizzard contents were recovered. crop contents contain more bacteria than gizzard contents and contained a higher incidence of e. coli and campylobacter contamination. however, because of the numbers of bacteria and amount of material in the crop and gizzard, it is unlikely that ingesta contamination would increase overall bacterial counts of prechill broiler carcasses.

TI  == the group b streptococcal sialic acid o-acetyltransferase is encoded by neud, a conserved component of bacterial sialic acid biosynthetic gene clusters.
AB  == nearly two dozen microbial pathogens have surface polysaccharides or lipo-oligosaccharides that contain sialic acid (sia), and several sia-dependent virulence mechanisms are known to enhance bacterial survival or result in host tissue injury. some pathogens are also known to o-acetylate their sias, although  the role of this modification in pathogenesis remains unclear. we report that neud, a gene located within the group b streptococcus (gbs) sia biosynthetic gene cluster, encodes a sia o-acetyltransferase that is itself required for capsular polysaccharide (cps) sialylation. homology modeling and site-directed mutagenesis identified lys-123 as a critical residue for sia o-acetyltransferase activity. moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism in neud can determine whether gbs displays a "high" or "low" sia o-acetylation phenotype. complementation analysis  revealed that escherichia coli k1 neud also functions as a sia o-acetyltransferase in gbs. in fact, neud homologs are commonly found within sia  biosynthetic gene clusters. a bioinformatic approach identified 18 bacterial species with a sia biosynthetic gene cluster that included neud. included in this list are the sialylated human pathogens legionella pneumophila, vibrio parahemeolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and campylobacter jejuni, as well as an additional 12 bacterial species never before analyzed for sia expression. phylogenetic analysis shows that neud homologs of sialylated pathogens share a common evolutionary lineage distinct from the poly-sia o-acetyltransferase of e.  coli k1. these studies define a molecular genetic approach for the selective elimination of gbs sia o-acetylation without concurrent loss of sialylation, a key to further studies addressing the role(s) of this modification in bacterial virulence.

TI  == a review of vaccine research and development: human enteric infections.
AB  == worldwide, enteric infections rank third among all causes of disease burden, being responsible for some 1.7-2.5 million deaths per year, mostly in young children and infants in developing countries. the main infectious agents responsible for human enteric infections include several viruses (enteric adenoviruses, astroviruses, human caliciviruses (hucv), rotaviruses (rv)) and several bacterial agents, such as campylobacter jejuni, a variety of pathogenic escherichia coli strains including enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec), several shigella species, various salmonella strains including s. typhi and s. paratyphi, the agents of typhoid fever, and vibrio cholerae, the agent of cholera. while effective vaccines are available at present against typhoid fever and cholera, no vaccine is available against illnesses caused by hucv, campylobacter, etec or the shigellae. rotavirus vaccines have had more success, although rv disease prevention suffered a major setback in 1999 with the withdrawal of a live simian-human reassortant rv vaccine less than a year after its introduction. new  live oral rv vaccines have now been developed and are or should presently be ready for licensure. this article reviews the state of the art in vaccine r&d against human viral and bacterial enteric infections of public health importance.

TI  == identification of a sialate o-acetyltransferase from campylobacter jejuni: demonstration of direct transfer to the c-9 position of terminalalpha-2, 8-linked sialic acid.
AB  == we have identified a sialate o-acetyltransferase in the lipo-oligosaccharide biosynthesis locus of campylobacter jejuni. strains possessing this locus are known to produce sialylated outer core structures that mimic host gangliosides, and have been implicated in triggering the onset of guillain-barre syndrome. the  acetyltransferase, which was cloned and expressed as a fusion construct in escherichia coli, is soluble and homologous with members of the nodl-laca-cyse family of o-acetyltransferases. this enzyme catalyzes the transfer of o-acetyl groups onto oligosaccharide-bound sialic acid, with a high specificity for terminal alpha2,8-linked residues. the modification is directed to c-9 and not c-7 as is believed to occur more commonly in other organisms. despite their wide  prevalence and importance in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, this is the first report to describe the characterization of a purified sialate o-acetyltransferase.

AB  == serotype 4b strains of the food-borne pathogen listeria monocytogenes are responsible for a large portion of sporadic listeric infections and all major food-borne listeriosis outbreaks in humans. hybridomas were produced from three fusions with lymphocytes of nd4 mice immunized either with the insoluble antigens of l. monocytogenes serotype 4b or with formalin-killed bacterial cells and screened for monoclonal antibodies (mabs) reactive to l. monocytogenes serotype 4b. a set of 35 mabs was identified by elisa as having reactivity with both the insoluble antigen fraction and the whole-cell antigens. thirteen of these mabs belonged to immunoglobulin subclass g1 (igg1), fifteen were igg2a and seven mabs  were igm. only 20 out of the 35 mabs were capable of detecting protein bands of various sizes ranging from 20 to 88 kda in western blots. two of these mabs, m2365 and m2367, were capable of binding to cell-surface antigens of live l. monocytogenes serotype 4b, as demonstrated by immunofluorescence microscopy and immunogold transmission electron microscopy. immunofluorescence microscopy showed that m2365 and m2367 failed to bind to the cell surfaces of escherichia coli o157 : h7, salmonella enterica (serotype typhimurium dt104) or campylobacter jejuni. evaluation of the cross-reactions of all 35 mabs with whole-cell antigens of e. coli o157 : h7, s. typhimurium, c. jejuni and listeria innocua by elisa indicated that the majority of the mabs, including m2365 and m2367, did not cross-react with e. coli o157 : h7, s. typhimurium or c. jejuni and showed no or a very weak  reaction with l. innocua. furthermore, m2365 and m2367 showed no reaction with whole-cell antigens derived from l. monocytogenes serotypes 1/2a, 1/2b and 3a, and from listeria grayi, listeria ivanovii and listeria seeligeri, in an elisa. collectively, these data suggest that m2365 and m2367 have potential use in the development of immunological methods of laboratory diagnosis for l. monocytogenes serotype 4b in clinical or food samples.

TI  == prevalence of zoonotic agents in dogs visiting hospitalized people in ontario: implications for infection control.
AB  == visitation of hospitalized people by dogs is becoming commonplace, but little is  known about the potential health risks of introducing dogs to healthcare settings. this cross-sectional study evaluated the prevalence of zoonotic agents  in a group of 102 visitation dogs from a variety of sources across ontario. between may and july 2004, owners were interviewed by a standardized questionnaire while dogs underwent a standardized physical examination. one specimen of faeces, hair-coat brushings and one rectal, aural, nasal, oral and pharyngeal swab were collected from each dog and tested for 18 specific pathogens. all dogs were judged to be in good health. zoonotic agents were isolated from 80 out of 102 (80%) dogs. the primary pathogen was clostridium difficile, which was isolated from 58 (58%) faecal specimens. seventy-one percent (41/58) of these isolates were toxigenic. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase escherichia coli was isolated from one (1%) dog, extended-spectrum cephalosporinase e. coli was isolated from three (3%) dogs, and organisms of the  genus salmonella were isolated from three (3%) dogs. pasteurella multocida or pasteurella canis was isolated from 29 (29%) oral swabs, and malassezia pachydermatis was isolated from eight (8%) aural swabs. giardia antigen was present in the faeces of seven (7%) dogs, while toxocara canis and ancylostoma caninum were detected in two (2%) dogs and one (1%) dog, respectively. methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, campylobacter spp., microsporum canis, group a streptococci, pseudomonas aeruginosa and cryptosporidium spp. were not detected. further information is needed before the full implications of these findings for infection control can be assessed properly.

TI  == use of water spray and extended drying time to lower bacterial numbers on soiled  flooring from broiler transport coops.
AB  == broiler transport coops soiled with campylobacter-positive feces have been shown  to facilitate cross-contamination of broilers. washing and sanitizing coop surfaces do not always effectively eliminate bacteria. the objective of this study was to examine drying as a means of lowering bacterial numbers on transport coop flooring. small squares (5 x 5 cm) of fiberglass flooring from transport coops were intentionally contaminated with 1 g of campylobacter-positive broiler  gut contents. soiled floor squares were sprayed with water and allowed to dry for 15 min, 24 h, or 48 h. unsprayed squares were examined at each time period as controls. all squares were sampled by cotton-tipped applicators that were cultured for campylobacter, coliforms, and escherichia coli. sampling of unsprayed squares at 15 min yielded 7.3 log cfu of campylobacter, 6.2 log cfu of  coliforms and 5.9 log cfu of e. coli per floor square. water spray alone resulted in a significantly lower number of organisms recovered: 4.1 log cfu campylobacter, 3.6 log cfu coliform, and 3.2 log cfu e. coli per floor square. when water spray was followed by a 24-hour drying period, no campylobacter, coliforms, or e. coli were detected on the floor surface. however, allowing unsprayed soiled flooring to simply dry for 24 or 48 h also resulted in no recovery of campylobacter and very low numbers of coliforms and e. coli. a 24- or 48-hour drying period for fecal matter on broiler transport cage flooring may be  a viable method to lower bacterial numbers on these surfaces.

TI  == quantifying the impact of runoff events on microbiological contaminant concentrations entering surface drinking source waters.
AB  == concentrations of microbiological contaminants in streams increase during rainfall-induced higher flow 'event' periods as compared to 'baseflow' conditions. if the stream feeds a drinking water reservoir, such periods of heightened pathogen loads may pose a challenge to the water treatment plant and subsequently a health concern to water consumers downstream. in order to manage this risk, it is desirable to first quantify the differences in surface water quality between baseflow and event conditions. the event mean concentration (emc) is a flow-weighted average concentration of a contaminant over the duration of a  single event, proposed here as a standard parameter for quantifying the net effect of events on microbial water quality. application of the emc concept was assessed using flow and quality data for several events from an urbanised catchment. expected mean emcs were significantly larger than expected mean baseflow concentrations (p-value< or =0.012) for three microbial agents - escherichia coil (13,000 [n = 7] v. 610 [n = 16] mpn/100 ml), cryptosporidium (234 [n = 6] v. 51 [n = 16] oocysts/10 litres) and campylobacter (48 [n = 5] v. 2.1 [n = 16] mpn/100ml). these parameter estimates were complemented by estimating data variability and uncertainty in the form of second-order random variables. as such the results are in a format appropriate for potential use as components in probabilistic risk assessments evaluating the effect runoff events  have on drinking water quality.

TI  == cytolethal distending toxin generates cell death by inducing a bottleneck in the  cell cycle.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) is a bacterial protein that is widely distributed among gram-negative bacteria including escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., enterohepatic helicobacter spp., actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus ducreyi. in vitro studies demonstrated that it is able to stop proliferation of various cell lines. the toxin is composed of  three subunits designated cdts a, b and c. the b subunit targets the eukaryotic dna and triggers a signalling pathway involving different protein kinases which results in a cell block before entering into mitosis. to date, the individual role of the a and c subunits has not been totally elucidated. there are indications that the cdt is also produced in vivo. its exact role in pathogenesis is not yet clear, but possible actions include inhibition of epithelial cell proliferation, apoptosis of immune cells and inhibition of a fibrotic response.

TI  == foodborne bacterial infection and hospitalization: a registry-based study.
AB  == background: foodborne bacterial gastrointestinal infections are important causes  of morbidity and mortality worldwide, and despite successful control programs in  some developed countries, these infections continue to have a major impact on public health and economy. methods: on the basis of data from 3 national registries, we determined short- and long-term risks of hospitalization due to gastroenteritis, short-term complications, and long-term sequelae after infections with nontyphoid salmonella enterica, campylobacter species, yersinia enterocolitica, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, and shigella species. results: among 52,121 patients, 7524 (14.4%) were hospitalized with a diagnosis of gastroenteritis within 90 days after microbiological diagnosis. a total of 4941 patients (17.7%) with infections due to s. enterica and 1937 (10.8%) with infections due to campylobacter species were admitted to the hospital. complications, such as gastrointestinal perforation and invasive illness, occurred in 647 patients (1.2%). the risk of invasive illness was > 6-fold higher in patients with infections due to s. enterica (odds ratio [or] compared with the general population, 30.3; 95% confidence interval [ci], 26.2-35.1) than in those  with infections due to campylobacter species (or, 4.9; 95% ci, 3.5-6.8) (p < .001). long-term sequelae were seen in 865 patients (1.7%). among 1000 patients with infections due to s. enterica, 1820 days of hospital stay were attributable  to gastroenteritis, complications, and long-term sequelae. the corresponding figure for campylobacter infections was 714 days. conclusions: infections with bacteria that are usually foodborne cause considerable morbidity, in terms of severe gastroenteritis that requires admission to hospital, as well as complications and long-term sequelae. the risk of complications and sequelae depends on bacterial species, and nontyphoid salmonella is particularly associated with a burden of severe morbidity.

AB  == to identify enteropathogens for vaccine development, we implemented clinic-based  surveillance for severe pediatric diarrhea in egypt's nile river delta. over 2 years, a physician clinically evaluated and obtained stool samples for microbiology from patients with diarrhea and less than 6 years of age. in the first (n = 714) and second clinic (n = 561), respectively, 36% (n = 254) and 46%  (n = 260) of children were infected with rotavirus, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), campylobacter, or shigella. when excluding mixed rotavirus-bacterial infections, for the first and second clinic, 23% and 10% had rotavirus-associated diarrhea, and 14% and 17% had etec-associated diarrhea, respectively. campylobacter-associated diarrhea was 1% and 3%, and shigella-associated diarrhea was 2% and 1%, respectively, for the two clinics. rotavirus-associated diarrhea peaked in late summer to early winter, while bacterial agents were prevalent during summer. rotavirus-associated cases presented with dehydration, vomiting, and were often hospitalized. children with shigella- or campylobacter-associated  diarrhea reported as watery diarrhea and rarely dysentery. etec did not have any  clinically distinct characteristics. for vaccine development and/or deployment, our study suggests that rotavirus is of principle concern, followed by etec, shigella, and campylobacter.

TI  == stable concentrated emulsions of the 1-monoglyceride of capric acid (monocaprin)  with microbicidal activities against the food-borne bacteria campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., and escherichia coli.
AB  == of 11 fatty acids and monoglycerides tested against campylobacter jejuni, the 1-monoglyceride of capric acid (monocaprin) was the most active in killing the bacterium. various monocaprin-in-water emulsions were prepared which were stable  after storage at room temperature for many months and which retained their microbicidal activity. a procedure was developed to manufacture up to 500 ml of 200 mm preconcentrated emulsions of monocaprin in tap water. the concentrates were clear and remained stable for at least 12 months. they were active against c. jejuni upon 160- to 200-fold dilution in tap water and caused a >6- to 7-log(10) reduction in viable bacterial count in 1 min at room temperature. the addition of 0.8% tween 40 to the concentrates as an emulsifying agent did not change the microbicidal activity. emulsions of monocaprin killed a variety of campylobacter isolates from humans and poultry and also killed strains of campylobacter coli and campylobacter lari, indicating a broad anticampylobacter activity. emulsions of 1.25 mm monocaprin in citrate-lactate buffer at ph 4 to 5  caused a >6- to 7-log(10) reduction in viable bacterial counts of salmonella spp. and escherichia coli in 10 min. c. jejuni was also more susceptible to monocaprin emulsions at low ph. the addition of 5 and 10 mm monocaprin emulsions to campylobacter-spiked chicken feed significantly reduced the bacterial contamination. these results are discussed in view of the possible utilization of monocaprin emulsions in controlling the spread of food-borne bacteria from poultry to humans.

AB  == in this study we analyzed the symptoms of gastroenteritis or food-borne disease caused by the 10 most prevalent pathogens: norovirus, salmonella, vibrio parahaemolyticus, campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec), shigella sonnei/flexneri (shigella), staphylococcus aureus, and emetic-type bacillus cereus. the symptoms diarrhea, vomiting, fever, abdominal pain, and headache, and the incubation period in 646 cases in 10 districts of kyushu between january 2000 and december 2004 were recorded. the pathogen with the shortest mean incubation period was b. cereus (0.8 h), and was followed by s. aureus (3.3 h), c. perfringens (10.7 h) and v. parahaemolyticus (16.4 h). all the patients infected  with b. cereus and s. aureus developed symptoms within 6 hours, and those infected with v. parahaemolyticus and c. perfringens developed symptoms within 24 hours. bloody diarrhea was associated with stec and shigella, but rare with other pathogens. vomiting was associated with almost all cases of s. aureus and b. cereus infection, and occurred in 71.5% of the norovirus cases and 56.1% of the v. parahaemolyticus cases. vomiting was less common in the c. perfringens (22.0%) and the etec and stec (both about 5%). bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain, and vomiting were statistically significantly more common with stec 0157 infection than with stec non-0157 infection. since the cases analyzed in this study included all degrees of illness, mild to severe, and a wide range of ages, the information obtained will serve as a good reference material for administrative and laboratory work when an outbreak takes place.

TI  == chemoenzymatic synthesis of glycopeptides with pglb, a bacterial oligosaccharyl transferase from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the gram-negative bacterium campylobacter jejuni has a general n-linked glycosylation pathway encoded by the pgl gene cluster. one of the proteins in this cluster, pgib, is thought to be the oligosaccharyl transferase due to its significant homology to stt3p, a subunit of the yeast oligosaccharyl transferase  complex. pgib has been shown to be involved in catalyzing the transfer of an undecaprenyl-linked heptasaccharide to the asparagine side chain of proteins at the asn-x-ser/thr motif. using a synthetic disaccharide glycan donor (gainac-alpha1,3-bacillosamine-pyrophosphate-undecaprenyl) and a peptide acceptor substrate (kdfnvska), we can observe the oligosaccharyl transferase activity of pgib in vitro. furthermore, the preparation of additional undecaprenyl-linked glycan variants reveals the ability of pgib to transfer a wide variety of saccharides. with the demonstration of pgib activity in vitro, fundamental questions surrounding the mechanism of n-linked glycosylation can now be addressed.

TI  == evaluation of detection methods for screening meat and poultry products for the presence of foodborne pathogens.
AB  == rapid and molecular technologies such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa), pcr, and lateral flow immunoprecipitation can reduce the time and labor  involved in screening food products for the presence of pathogens. these technologies were compared with conventional culture methodology for the detection of salmonella, campylobacter, listeria, and escherichia coli o157:h7 inoculated in raw and processed meat and poultry products. recommended protocols  were modified so that the same enrichment broths used in the culture methods were also used in the elisa, pcr, and lateral flow immunoprecipitation assays. the percent agreement between the rapid technologies and culture methods ranged from  80 to 100% depending on the pathogen detected and the method used. elisa, pcr, and lateral flow immunoprecipitation all performed well, with no statistical difference, compared with the culture method for the detection of e. coli o157:h7. elisa performed better for the detection of salmonella, with sensitivity and specificity rates of 100%. pcr performed better for the detection of campylobacter jejuni, with 100% agreement to the culture method. pcr was highly sensitive for the detection of all the foodborne pathogens tested except listeria monocytogenes. although the lateral flow immunoprecipitation tests were statistically different from the culture methods for salmonella and listeria because of false-positive results, the tests did not produce any false negatives, indicating that this method would be suitable for screening meat and poultry products for these pathogens.

AB  == a study was conducted to investigate the microbiological impact of spray washing  broiler carcasses with chlorinated water (0 or 50 ppm) at different temperatures  (21.1, 43.3, or 54.4 degrees c). a whole carcass rinse (wcr) was performed on each carcass before (control) and after spray washing (final). after the control  wcr, carcasses were inoculated with 0.1 g of cecal material containing 2 x 10(5)  cells per gram of campylobacter and 2 x 10(5) cells per gram of nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella. carcasses were held at room temperature for 12 min before washing in an inside-outside bird washer (80 psi for 5 s). chlorine level  and water temperature had no effect on total aerobic bacteria, escherichia coli,  or campylobacter numbers recovered from the final wcr. levels of bacteria found on carcasses before and after washing were 4.6, 3.6, and 3.5 log10 cfu/ml rinse for total aerobic bacteria, e. coli, and campylobacter, respectively. average counts for nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella after washing were 3.1 log10 cfu/  ml rinse irrespective of water temperature or chlorine level (p < 0.05). in addition, chlorine level and water temperature had no effect on the breast skin color, with average values of l* = 66.6; a* = -0.09; b* = -0.05 (p < 0.05). under the conditions outlined in the present study, adding chlorine and/or elevating the water temperature during spray washing in an inside-outside bird washer did not enhance the removal of bacteria from broiler carcasses and had no effect on carcass skin color.

TI  == signature-tagged transposon mutagenesis studies demonstrate the dynamic nature of cecal colonization of 2-week-old chickens by campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we have constructed plasmids to be used for in vitro signature-tagged mutagenesis (stm) of campylobacter jejuni and used these to generate stm libraries in three different strains. statistical analysis of the transposon insertion sites in the  c. jejuni nctc 11168 chromosome and the plasmids of strain 81-176 indicated that  their distribution was not uniform. visual inspection of the distribution suggested that deviation from uniformity was not due to preferential integration  of the transposon into a limited number of hot spots but rather that there was a  bias towards insertions around the origin. we screened pools of mutants from the  stm libraries for their ability to colonize the ceca of 2-week-old chickens harboring a standardized gut flora. we observed high-frequency random loss of colonization proficient mutants. when cohoused birds were individually inoculated with different tagged mutants, random loss of colonization-proficient mutants was similarly observed, as was extensive bird-to-bird transmission of mutants. this indicates that the nature of campylobacter colonization in chickens is complex and dynamic, and we hypothesize that bottlenecks in the colonization process and  between-bird transmission account for these observations.

AB  == the hippurate hydrolase enzyme of campylobacter jejuni was expressed in escherichia coli as a six-histidine-tagged fusion protein. the purified recombinant enzyme was characterized to gain an understanding of the structure and activity of the hippurate hydrolase. the recombinant enzyme had a native molecular mass of 193+/- 11 kda a reduced molecular mass of 42.4+/- 0.8 kda, and  possessed 1.98+/- 0.68 molecules of zinc per enzyme subunit molecule, suggesting  that it was a homotetramer with two associated zinc ions. the enzyme was a metallocarboxypeptidase that was sensitive to silver, copper and ferrous ions, and displayed optimal activity at ph 7.5 and 50 degrees c. it hydrolyzed carboxypeptidase substrates in vitro, displaying its highest activity against n-benzoyl-linked small aliphatic amino acids. a high proportion of the enzyme structure consisted of highly ordered alpha-helix and beta-sheet sequences. an alignment of the amino acid sequence of the hippurate hydrolase enzyme with those of related enzymes with similar activities revealed several conserved amino acids, which might be involved in enzyme catalysis or metal ion binding for the enzyme. site-directed mutagenesis of the recombinant enzyme demonstrated that the asp(76), aps(104), glu(134), glu(135), his(161) and his(356) positions were important for the catalytic activity of the enzyme.

TI  == characterization of heterologous hemoglobin and flavohemoglobin promoter regulation in escherichia coli.
AB  == bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins have been used to improve cell growth  and productivity in biotechnological applications. the expression of globin genes can be induced by reducing the oxygen supply or applying external stressors, which provide a simple and inexpensive mechanism for induction of heterologous protein production. it is in the interest of the biotechnological industry to seek new promoters, which are non-patented, cheap and simple to induce. therefore, new globin gene promoters have been isolated from campylobacter jejuni, bacillus subtilis, deinococcus radiodurans, streptomyces coelicolor, and  salmonella typhi. the goal was to obtain insights about the regulation mechanisms of these promoters in escherichia coli using in silico and experimental methods.  the recognition of these promoters by the e. coli transcriptional machinery was first analyzed by computational methods. computer analysis revealed that all the  promoters, except the promoter of s. coelicolor, should be functional in e. coli  and most of them also contain putative binding sites for arca, crp, and fnr global regulators. furthermore, the expression profiles of the promoters fused to the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene were analyzed under various conditions using e. coli mutants devoid of regulatory molecules. in vivo regulation studies of globin promoters mainly verified the in silico predictions.

TI  == pathogens causing community gastroenteritis in australia.
AB  == background and aim: many individuals with gastrointestinal symptoms do not seek medical attention and so there is little known about the pathogens involved in most cases of community gastroenteritis. we aimed to identify the pathogens responsible for community gastroenteritis and to examine the associated symptoms. methods: in a prospective study of 2811 subjects over 15 months, fecal pathogens  were examined following highly credible gastroenteritis (hcg) events. the population consisted of family units of at least two children (< or =15 years-old) and two adults each. fecal samples were tested for a range of bacterial, viral and protozoal pathogens. gastroenteric episode duration and symptoms such as vomiting, nausea and diarrhea were measured. results: one or more pathogens were identified in 198 of a total 791 specimens collected. pathogens detected most often were norovirus virus (10.7%), pathogenic e. coli (6.7%), campylobacter spp. (3.0%) and giardia sp. (2.5%). children were more prone than adults to all the pathogens tested, except e. coli. children infected  with campylobacter were 8.3 times more likely (95% ci: 2.7-25.4) to have a longer duration of diarrhea than children with norovirus (p < 0.001). similarly, children infected with e. coli had increased persistence of diarrhea compared to  norovirus (or = 3.5; 95% ci: 1.3-9.5; p = 0.02). infection with norovirus in children meant greater persistence of vomiting symptoms than infection with campylobacter (p = 0.005), e. coli (p = 0.03), or if no pathogen was identified (p = 0.004). adults usually vomited for fewer days than children while duration of diarrhea was similar to children. conclusions: many of the pathogens responsible for cases of gastroenteritis in the australian community are likely to go undetected by current surveillance systems and routine clinical practice.

AB  == feathered and featherless (scaleless) sibling broilers were reared and processed  together to evaluate the influence of feathers and feather follicles on carcass bacteria recovery after chilling. in each experiment, broilers were inoculated 1  wk prior to processing by oral gavage with a suspension of salmonellae or campylobacter at 106 cells/ml. broilers were stunned and bled, and carcasses were single-tank or triple-tank scalded, defeathered, eviscerated, and washed. carcasses were chilled for 45 min in ice and water immersion chillers with or without 20 mg of chlorine/l added. postchill carcass rinsates were evaluated for  escherichia coli, coliforms, total aerobes, and salmonellae or campylobacter. following processing and immersion chilling, genetically featherless carcasses had slightly higher counts (by log10 0.35 cfu/100 ml of carcass rinsate) for e. coli, coliforms, and total aerobes than feathered carcasses. however, there were  no significant differences in the prevalence of salmonellae (25%) or campylobacter (93%) between feathered and featherless carcasses. recovery of e. coli, coliforms, and total aerobic bacteria were lower for carcasses that were single-tank scalded, and following enrichment, salmonellae were recovered from fewer carcasses subjected to the single-tank (71%) than triple-tank (86%) scalding. addition of chlorine to chiller water significantly decreased carcass bacteria recovery (by log10 0.43 cfu/100 ml of carcass rinsate) for e. coli, coliforms, total aerobes, and campylobacter but did not affect salmonellae recovery. the presence of feathers and feather follicles during processing and immersion chilling appears to have minimal influence on the recovery of salmonellae or campylobacter from carcasses sampled after immersion chilling.

TI  == effects of orally administered tetracycline on the intestinal community structure of chickens and on tet determinant carriage by commensal bacteria and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == there is a growing concern that antibiotic usage in animal production has selected for resistant food-borne bacteria. since tetracyclines are common therapeutic antibiotics used in poultry production, we sought to evaluate the effects of oral administration on the resistance of poultry commensal bacteria and the intestinal bacterial community structure. the diversity indices calculated from terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (t-rflp) analysis of 16s rrna amplicons did not indicate significant changes in the cecal  bacterial community in response to oxytetracycline. to evaluate its effects on cultivable commensals, enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, and campylobacter spp. were isolated from the cecal droppings of broiler chickens. enterococcus spp. and e. coli expressed tetracycline mics of >8 microg/ml and harbored a variety of tet resistance determinants regardless of the tetracycline exposure history of the birds. the enterococcal isolates possessed tetm (61%), tetl (25.4%), and tetk (1.3%), as well as teto (52.5%), the determinant known to confer a tetracycline resistance phenotype in campylobacter jejuni. e. coli isolates harbored teta (32.2%) or tetb (30.5%). tetracycline mics remained at <2  microg/ml for campylobacter isolates before and after tetracycline treatment of the chickens, even though isolates expressing mics of >16 mug/ml were commonly cultured from flocks that did not receive oxytetracycline. the results imply that complex ecological and genetic factors contribute to the prevalence of antibiotic resistance arising from resistance gene transfer in the production environment.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni has a general n-linked glycosylation pathway (encoded by the pgl gene cluster), which culminates in the transfer of a heptasaccharide: galnac-alpha1,4-galnac-alpha1,4-(glcbeta1,3)-galnac-alpha1,4-galnac-alpha1,4-galn ac-alpha1,3-bac [where bac is bacillosamine (2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxyglucose)] from a membrane-anchored undecaprenylpyrophosphate (und-pp)-linked donor to the asparagine side chain of proteins at the asn-x-ser/thr motif. herein we report, the cloning, overexpression, and purification of four of the glycosyltransferases (pgla, pglh, pgli, and pglj) responsible for the biosynthesis of the und-pp-linked heptasaccharide. starting with chemically synthesized und-pp-linked bac and various combinations of enzymes, we have deduced the precise functions of these glycosyltransferases. pgla and pglj add the first two galnac residues on to the isoprenoid-linked bac carrier, respectively. elongation of the trisaccharide with pglh results in a hexasaccharide revealing the polymerase activity of pglh. the final branching glucose is then added by pgli, which prefers native lipids for optimal activity. the sequential activities of the glycosyl transferases in the pathway can be reconstituted in vitro. this pathway represents an ideal venue for investigating the integrated functions of a series of enzymatic processes that occur at a membrane interface.

TI  == a survey of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary referral hospital in the united arab emirates.
AB  == published data on antimicrobial resistance are lacking for the united arab emirates (uae). knowledge of local patterns of resistance is essential to optimize guidelines for empirical antimicrobial treatment. awareness of susceptibility patterns in other parts of the world may be important for determining empirical antimicrobial therapy for travelers or patients transferred from abroad. antibiograms from unique isolates of common hospital and community bacteria are described in a tertiary referral hospital in the uae, which had no antimicrobial restrictions and limited resources. antimicrobial resistance rates  were unpredictable and were high for gram-negative organisms, such as escherichia coli, shigella sonnei, campylobacter spp, and also streptococcus pneumoniae. in contrast, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) comprised less than  5% of s. aureus isolates and glycopeptide-resistant enterococci (gre) were not detected during the surveillance period. our results provide data on antimicrobial resistance for the uae and highlight the need for resources for surveillance of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == carbohydrate phenotyping of human and animal milk glycoproteins.
AB  == breast-milk has a well-known anti-microbial effect, which is in part due to the many different carbohydrate structures expressed. this renders it a position as a potential therapeutic for treatment of infection by different pathogens, thus avoiding the drawbacks of many antibiotics. the plethora of carbohydrate epitopes in breast-milk is known to differ between species, with human milk expressing the most complex one. we have investigated the expression of protein-bound carbohydrate epitopes in milk from man, cow, goat, sheep, pig, horse, dromedary and rabbit. proteins were separated by sds-page and the presence of carbohydrate  epitopes on milk proteins were analysed by western blotting using different lectins and carbohydrate-specific antibodies. we show that abh, lewis (le)x, sialyl-lex, lea, sialyl-lea and leb carbohydrate epitopes are expressed mainly on man, pig and horse milk proteins. the blood group precursor structure h type 1 is expressed in all species investigated, while only pig, dromedary and rabbit milk  proteins carry h type 2 epitopes. these epitopes are receptors for helicobacter pylori (leb and sialyl-lex), enteropathogenic (h type 1, lea and lex) and enterotoxic escherichia coli (heat-stable toxin; h type 1 and 2), and campylobacter jejuni (h type 2). thus, milk from these animals or their genetically modified descendants could have a therapeutic effect by inhibiting pathogen colonization and infection.

TI  == post-harvest interventions to reduce/eliminate pathogens in beef.
AB  == in 1999 the foodborne pathogens salmonella, listeria, campylobacter, and escherichia coli (both o157 and non-o157) were estimated to cause more than 6 million illnesses and approximately 9000 deaths each year. however, the most recent centers for disease control and prevention report on the sources and incidence of foodborne disease, released in 2004, has shown a dramatic decrease in e. coli o157:h7 infections. since raw beef products are the most frequently foodborne sources of these pathogens, the results of this report demonstrate that the microbiological quality of raw beef has improved greatly. during the intervening years, post-harvest interventions have continually improved, with new attention to hide decontamination and innovative treatments of carcasses. in addition, a system to hold and test beef trim or ground beef for e. coli o157:h7  before its release into commerce has provided an even greater level of safety. in this paper, we review the latest information on the prevalence of e. coli o157:h7 and other pathogens on beef, the evidence identifying the hide as the primary source of pathogens on beef carcasses, the efficacy of various hide and carcass interventions, and other developments that have led or have the potential to lead to even greater improvements in the microbial quality of beef.

TI  == estimating foodborne gastroenteritis, australia.
AB  == we estimated for australia the number of cases, hospitalizations, and deaths due  to foodborne gastroenteritis in a typical year, circa 2000. the total amount of infectious gastroenteritis was measured by using a national telephone survey. the foodborne proportion was estimated from australian data on each of 16 pathogens.  to account for uncertainty, we used simulation techniques to calculate 95% credibility intervals (cri). the estimate of incidence of gastroenteritis in australia is 17.2 million (95% confidence interval 14.5-19.9 million) cases per year. we estimate that 32% (95% cri 24%-40%) are foodborne, which equals 0.3 (95% cri 0.2-0.4) episodes per person, or 5.4 million (95% cri 4.0-6.9 million) cases  annually in australia. norovirus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., and salmonella spp. cause the most illnesses. in addition, foodborne gastroenteritis causes approximately 15,000 (95% cri 11,000-18,000) hospitalizations and 80 (95% cri 40-120) deaths annually. this study highlights global public health concerns about foodborne diseases and the need for standardized methods, including assessment of uncertainty, for international comparison.

TI  == elevated levels of igm and iga antibodies to proteus mirabilis and igm antibodies to escherichia coli are associated with early rheumatoid factor (rf)-positive rheumatoid arthritis.
AB  == objective: antibodies to proteus mirabilis were previously detected in patients with established rheumatoid arthritis (ra). we examined the prevalence of antibodies to p. mirabilis and their associations with ra in early synovitis patients. methods: two hundred and forty-six patients with inflammatory arthritis for less than 1 yr were prospectively evaluated for 1 yr. of these patients, 30%  had rheumatoid factor (rf)-positive ra, 16% rf-negative ra, 17% a spondyloarthropathy and 37% undifferentiated arthritis. serum antibodies to p. mirabilis, escherichia coli and other potentially arthritogenic organisms (chlamydia, salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, yersinia and parvovirus b19) and for antibodies specific for immunoglobulin (ig) g damaged with advanced glycation end-products (anti-igg-age) were measured. results: igm and iga anti-proteus antibodies were significantly higher in patients with rf-positive ra compared with all other patient groups (p < 0.0005 and p < 0.005). anti-p. mirabilis igg,  and igg, iga, and igm antibodies to other potentially arthritogenic pathogens did not differ in the patient groups. igm antibodies to e. coli were elevated in rf-positive ra patients. anti-p. mirabilis igm and iga results were not explained by false-positive reactions, because after absorption of rf there was no decrease in antibodies to proteus in 10 of 12 patients. proteus and e. coli antibodies were highest in patients positive for both rf and anti-igg-age antibodies (p<0.001). patients with erosions tended to have higher iga anti-proteus titres,  but no association with the shared hla epitope or treatment was detected. conclusion: anti-p. mirabilis igm and iga and anti-e. coli igm antibody elevations are associated with early seropositive ra and the presence of anti-igg-age antibodies. the role that p. mirabilis or e. coli plays in early rf-positive ra requires further investigation.

TI  == detection of pathogenic bacteria in food samples using highly-dispersed carbon particles.
AB  == there is an unmet need for detection methods that can rapidly and sensitively detect food borne pathogens. a flow through immunoassay system utilizing highly dispersed carbon particles and an amperometric technique has been developed and optimized. a sandwich immunoassay format was utilized in which pathogenic cells were captured by antibodies immobilized onto activated carbon particles, and labeled with horseradish peroxidase (hrp) conjugated antibodies. flow of the peroxidase substrates resulted in an amperometric signal that is proportional to  the number of captured cells. factors influencing the analytical performance of the system, such as the quantity of carbon particles and concentrations of capture antibody, enzyme labeled antibody, and enzyme substrates, were investigated and optimized. detection and quantification of escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni were demonstrated with low detection limits of 50, 10, and 50 cells/ml, respectively, and an overall assay time of 30 min. milk and chicken extract samples were spiked with various concentrations of these pathogens and were used to challenge the system. the system design is flexible enough to allow its application to the detection of viruses and proteins.

TI  == microbiological quality of ready-to-eat foods: results from a long-term surveillance program (1995 through 2003).
AB  == the coordination of food sampling activities across wales, a part of the united kingdom with a population of approximately 3 million, led to the establishment in 1995 of a coordinated food-sampling program designed to monitor on a long-term basis the microbiological quality and safety of specific ready-to-eat products. this surveillance system has been ongoing for 9 years and has generated a database of microbiological and associated demographic results for 15,228 ready-to-eat food samples. the food types that had the poorest overall results were sliced meats, unsliced poultry, sandwiches made without salad, and cakes made without dairy cream. for all food types, the overall unsatisfactory rate was 17% for aerobic colony counts, 1.6% for escherichia coli, and 0.5% for listeria spp. overall unsatisfactory or unacceptable rates for pathogens such as clostridium perfringens, listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, and staphylococcus aureus were all below 0.5%. no campylobacter-positive samples and  only one salmonella-positive sample were found. the analysis of the results show  that the ready-to-eat food types sampled over the 9 years of the program were generally of good microbiological quality when compared with current united kingdom guidelines. the information contained in the database provides a baseline measurement of the microbial quality of a variety of ready-to-eat foods and allows environmental health officers and food microbiologists to generate hypotheses for targeted surveys or research work.

TI  == nssr, a member of the crp-fnr superfamily from campylobacter jejuni, regulates a  nitrosative stress-responsive regulon that includes both a single-domain and a truncated haemoglobin.
AB  == consistent with its role as a nitric oxide (no)-detoxifying globin in campylobacter jejuni, cgb (campylobacter globin) expression is strongly and specifically induced following exposure to nitrosative stress, suggesting a previously unrecognized capacity for no-related stress sensing in this food-borne pathogen. in this study, fur and perr have been eliminated as major regulators of cgb, and nssr (cj0466), a member of the crp-fnr superfamily, has been identified  as the major positive regulatory factor that controls nitrosative stress-responsive expression of this gene. accordingly, disruption of nssr resulted in the abolition of inducible cgb expression, which was restored by a complementing chromosomal insertion of the wild-type gene with its indigenous promoter at a second location. the nssr-deficient mutant was more sensitive to no-related stress than a cgb mutant and this phenotype most likely arises from the failure of these cells to induce other no-responsive components in addition to cgb. indeed, analysis of global gene expression, by microarray and confirmatory real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in the wild type and nssr  mutant, not only confirmed the dependence of inducible cgb expression on nssr, but also revealed for the first time a novel nssr-dependent nitrosative stress-responsive regulon. this regulon of at least four genes includes cj0465c,  a truncated globin. consistent with nssr being a crp-fnr superfamily member, an fnr-like binding sequence (ttaac-n(4)-gttaa) was found upstream of each gene at locations -40.5 to -42.5 relative to the centre of the binding sites and the transcription start point. site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that this cis-acting motif mediates the nitrosative stress-inducible expression of cgb.

AB  == aims: to determine the possible effects of inclusion of dried skim milk (dsm) in  swine diets on indigenous lactobacillus spp. and escherichia coli, and its potential for controlling pathogen shedding and affect animal growth in growing-finishing swine. methods and results: animals were fed over three dietary phases to match production needs from age 10-14 weeks, 14-18 weeks and 18-22 weeks. for each feeding phase, diets were formulated to contain 0 or 10% dsm (balanced for metabolizable energy and true ileal digestible amino acids). animals were weighed every 2 weeks and faecal samples were collected from 40 animals (20 with dsm and 20 without dsm) at week 10 (d 0 on diets), 14, 18 and 22 of age, and were analysed for lactobacillus spp., enterobacteriaceae, coliforms,  e. coli, salmonella, campylobacter and e. coli o157:h7. at the start of the study (week 10), faecal bacterial counts (log10 cfu g(-1) faeces) were 9.55, 7.26, 7.01 and 6.93 for lactobacillus, enterobacteriaceae, coliforms and e. coli populations respectively. the enterobacteriaceae, coliform and e. coli populations decreased  through week 14 and 18, but were higher in animals fed with the dsm diet compared with the basal diet without dsm. the lactobacillus populations at weeks 14 and 18 were lower in the animals fed the diet without dsm, whereas feeding dsm maintained the lactobacillus counts from week 10. at week 22, populations of enterobacteriaceae, coliforms and e. coli were >week 18 for the animals fed the diet without dsm, less change was observed with the feeding of dsm, and no differences between the diets were observed at week 22. however, in week 22 the animal gain was positively correlated with lactobacillus numbers and negatively correlated with e. coli numbers. subtraction of the e. coli population (log10) from the lactobacillus population (log10) yielded a positive value termed 'effective'lactobacillus that correlated well with animal gain and may better define a beneficial function in the intestine. salmonella were detected in over 60% of the animals at week 10 and 14, and <20% at week 18 and 22. campylobacter were detected rarely at weeks 10, 14 and 18, but were found in 25% of the animals at week 22. the dsm did not affect salmonella or campylobacter shedding, but examination of individual animals over the entire experiment indicated that fewer recurring incidences of salmonella shedding occurred in animals that maintained higher lactobacillus. in addition, at week 22, salmonella and campylobacter shedding was associated with lower levels of effective lactobacillus and lower animal weight gains. conclusions: the dsm did not directly affect the animal performance or pathogen shedding via the lactobacillus spp. population at any phase of production. however, analysis of data from all animals revealed that faecal lactobacillus affected salmonella shedding and in the finishing phase, animal growth and pathogen shedding also were affected, as reflected by the 'effective'lactobacillus-associated observations. significance and impact of the  study: in the swine intestine, any benefits from gastrointestinal lactobacillus may be compromized by the e. coli population, and this antagonism may explain responses observed with prebiotics or probiotics in some swine.

AB  == the objectives of this study were to examine domestic food safety knowledge levels of consumers, establish the levels and incidence of bacterial contamination and operational temperatures in domestic refrigerators, and identify areas in which consumer food safety education is necessary in ireland. a food safety knowledge questionnaire applied to a representative sample of households (n = 1,020) throughout the island of ireland found the gaps in consumer food safety knowledge. analysis of swab samples (n = 900) recovered from the domestic refrigerators in these households showed average total viable counts of 7.1 log cfu/cm2 and average total coliform counts of 4.0 log cfu/cm2. analysis of swab samples also detected the incidence of staphylococcus aureus (41%), escherichia coli (6%), salmonella enterica (7%), listeria monocytogenes (6%), and yersinia enterocolitica (2%). campylobacter jejuni and e. coli o157:h7 were not detected in domestic refrigerators. the temperature profiles of a subset of the sampled refrigerators (100) were monitored for 72 h, and 59% were found to operate, on average, at temperatures above the recommended 5 degrees c. knowledge and temperature survey results varied considerably, but consumers who scored better in terms of basic food safety knowledge had reduced levels of bacterial contamination in their refrigerators and reported a reduced incidence of food-associated illnesses. this study confirms the effect of basic food hygiene knowledge on hygienic practice and identifies specific areasfor emphasis in the development and delivery of effective food safety risk communication messages to  consumers.

TI  == effect of fecal contamination and cross-contamination on numbers of coliform, escherichia coli, campylobacter, and salmonella on immersion-chilled broiler carcasses.
AB  == the effect of prechill fecal contamination on numbers of bacteria on immersion-chilled carcasses was tested in each of three replicate trials. for each trial, 16 eviscerated broiler carcasses were split into 32 halves and assigned to one of two groups. cecal contents (0.1 g inoculated with campylobacter and nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella) were applied to each of eight halves in one group (direct contamination) that were placed into one paddle chiller (contaminated), whereas the other paired halves were placed into another  chiller (control). from the second group of eight split birds, one of each paired half was placed in the contaminated chiller (to determine cross-contamination) and the other half was placed in the control chiller. postchill carcass halves were sampled by a 1-min rinse in sterile water, which was collected and cultured. bacterial counts were reported as log cfu per milliliter of rinsate. there were no significant statistical differences (paired t test, p < 0.05) from direct contamination for coliforms (mean 3.0 log cfu) and escherichia coli (mean 2.7 log cfu), although campylobacter numbers significantly increased from control values  because of direct contamination (1.5 versus 2.1 log cfu), and the incidence increased from 79 to 100%. there was no significant effect of cross-contamination on coliform (mean 2.9 log cfu) or e. coli (mean 2.6 log cfu) numbers. nevertheless, campylobacter levels were significantly higher after exposure to cross-contamination (1.6 versus 2.0 log cfu), and the incidence of this bacterium increased from 75 to 100%. salmonella-positive halves increased from 0 to 42% postchill because of direct contamination and from 0 to 25% as a result of cross-contamination after chilling. water samples and surface swabs taken postchill from the contaminated chiller were higher for campylobacter than those  taken from the control chiller. immersion chilling equilibrated bacterial numbers between contaminated and control halves subjected to either direct contamination  or cross-contamination for coliforms and e. coli. campylobacter numbers, campylobacter incidence, and salmonella incidence increased because of both direct contamination and cross-contamination in the chiller. postchill e. coli numbers did not indicate which carcass halves were contaminated with feces before chilling.

TI  == rapid decay of salmonella flagella antibodies during human gastroenteritis: a follow up study.
AB  == an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) based on salmonella re-polymerized flagella was employed to measure levels of immunoglobulin (ig) g,  igm and iga antibodies in sera from 303 danish patients diagnosed with either salmonella enteritidis or salmonella typhimurium. the antibody-levels were assessed at one, three and six months after onset of salmonellosis, and sera from a control-group of 170 healthy blood donors were additionally analysed in order to establish cut-off values for the analysis. cross-reactions to other salmonella serotypes, as well as to escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli and helicobacter pylori were observed. at one month after onset of symptoms, 70% of the patients recovering from a s. enteritidis infection carried detectable levels of anti-flagella antibodies, as did 77% of the patients recovering from s. typhimurium infection. three months after onset of symptoms these detection rates had decreased to 46% and 40%; and six months after onset of symptoms the detection rates were 34% and 38%. this rapid decrease in the serum levels of flagella antibodies is in conflict with the "common knowledge" statement of a long-lasting anti-flagella immunoresponse. the present  study suggests that such a tenacious statement is (or may be) inaccurate.

TI  == development and application of an insertional system for gene delivery and expression in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the genetic investigation of campylobacter jejuni, an important gastrointestinal  pathogen, has been hampered by the lack of an efficient system for introduction of exogenous genetic information, as commonly used vectors designed for escherichia coli and other bacteria cannot be maintained in campylobacter cells.  additionally, gene expression in campylobacter requires the presence of species-specific promoters. in this study we exploited the availability of several conserved copies of rrna gene clusters for insertion of various genes into the chromosome by homologous recombination. the high conservation of the rrna sequences means that the procedure can be applied to other campylobacter strains. the presence of a campylobacter-derived promoter in this vector ensures  expression of exogenous genes in target cells. the efficiency of the procedure was demonstrated by complementation of mutations in two strains of campylobacter. in addition, we applied the system for introduction and expression of a green fluorescent protein (gfp). gfp-expressing campylobacter allowed visualization of  sessile bacteria attached to a glass surface in stationary liquid culture. the study demonstrated that the attached bacteria contained an assemblage of coccoid  and spiral forms with liquid channels preserving viable highly motile cells. we demonstrate a novel universal procedure for gene delivery and expression that can be used as an efficient tool to study this poorly understood pathogen. the principles developed in this study could be more widely applied for the manipulation of other bacteria that are refractory to genetic analysis.

TI  == the comparative importance of e. coli antigen in granulomatous colitis of boxer dogs.
AB  == granulomatous colitis of boxer dogs is characterized by mucosal and submucosal infiltration by abundant large macrophages and lymphocytes and plasma cells. involved intestine is thickened, corrugated and ulcerated. the macrophages that occur in colon, cecum and regional lymph nodes are pas-positive, lipid-rich, contain cholesterol, and some of the time can be seen to hold bacteria. paraffin  tissue blocks of formalin-fixed colon and colic lymph nodes from 10 cases were cut at 5 microm and immunostained by a streptavidin-biotin immunoperoxidase technique, employing primary antibodies against escherichia coli, e. coli 0157: 2, campylobacter, c. jejuni-coli, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, salmonella, shigella, pseudomonas and lawsonia intracellularis. the macrophages in the lamina propria and submucosa, as well as those in aggregates in regional lymph nodes, showed immunoreactivity with polyclonal e. coli antibody in all 10 cases. tissues lacking granulomas were negative, as were those reacted with the other eight antibodies, with the exception that there was rare focal staining for campylobacter, lawsonia and salmonella in a few dogs. we believe these results identify the causative agent of this granulomatous disease of boxer dogs, a disease with great histologic and etiologic similarity to granulomatous leptomeningitis of beagle dogs, and malacoplakia and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis of man. macrophages that are immunopositive for e. coli antigen occur in crohn's disease as well, where their significance is less well understood.

TI  == detection of sorbitol-negative and sorbitol-positive shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, and salmonella spp. in dairy farm environmental samples.
AB  == six visits were conducted to four dairy farms to collect swab, liquid, and solid  dairy farm environmental samples (165 to 180/farm; 15 sample types). the objective of the study was to determine on-farm sources of campylobacter jejuni,  salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec), which might serve as reservoirs for transmission of pathogens. samples were analyzed using mostly u.s. food and drug administration's bacteriological analytical manual protocols; however, salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes and stec were co-enriched in universal pre-enrichment broth. campylobacter jejuni were enriched in bolton broth containing bolton broth supplement. pathogens were isolated on agar media, typed biochemically, and confirmed using multiplex polymerase chain reaction protocols. campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., l. monocytogenes, sorbitol-negative (sn)-stec o157:h7, and sorbitol-positive (sp)-stec, respectively, were isolated from 5.06%, 3.76%, 6.51%, 0.72%, and 17.3% of samples evaluated. whereas other pathogens were isolated from all four farms, sn-stec o157:h7 were isolated from only two farms.  diverse serotypes of sp-stec including o157:h7, o26:h11, o111, and o103 were isolated. none of the five pathogen groups studied were isolated from bulk tank milk (btm). most pathogens (44.2%) were isolated directly from fecal samples. bovine fecal samples, lagoon water, bedding, bird droppings, and rat intestinal contents constituted areas of major concern on dairy farms. although in-line milk filters from two farms tested positive for salmonella or l. monocytogenes, none of the pathogens were detected in the corresponding btm samples. good manure management practices, including control of feral animals, are critical in assuring dairy farm hygiene. identification of on-farm pathogen reservoirs could  aid with implementation of farm-specific pathogen reduction programs.

TI  == a real-time pcr assay for the detection and quantitation of campylobacter jejuni  using sybr green i and the lightcycler.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is recognized as a leading human food-borne pathogen. traditional biochemical identification for c. jejuni is not reliable due to special growth requirements and the possibility that this bacterium can enter a viable but nonculturable (vnc) state. nucleic acid-based tests have emerged as a  useful alternative to traditional testing. in this article, we present fluorescent quantitative pcr assay for quantitative detection of c. jejuni, the assay was carried out using a lightcycler instrument and product formation was monitored continuously with the fluorescent double-stranded dna binding dye sybr  green i. when this assay was applied, the assay positive for all of the isolates  of c. jejuni tested (11 isolates, including type strain atcc33560) and negative for all other campylobacter spp. (three isolates) and several other bacteria (five species tested). the total assay could be completed in 60 min with a detection limit of approximately 1 cfu, and a correlation coefficient was 1.000.  result indicated that fluorescent quantitative detection methods provided a special, sensitive, rapid, reproducible and accurate method for quantitative detection of c. jejuni.

TI  == macrolide resistance in campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli: molecular mechanism and stability of the resistance phenotype.
AB  == a collection of 23 macrolide-resistant campylobacter isolates from different geographic areas was investigated to determine the mechanism and stability of macrolide resistance. the isolates were identified as campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter coli based on the results of the hippurate biochemical test in addition to five pcr-based genotypic methods. three point mutations at two positions within the peptidyl transferase region in domain v of the 23s rrna gene were identified. about 78% of the resistant isolates exhibited an a-->g transition at escherichia coli equivalent base 2059 of the 23s rrna gene. the isolates possessing this mutation showed a wide range of erythromycin and clarithromycin mics. thus, this mutation may incur a greater probability of treatment failure in populations infected by resistant campylobacter isolates. another macrolide-associated mutation (a-->c transversion), at e. coli equivalent base 2058, was detected in about 13% of the isolates. an a-->g transition at a position cognate with e. coli 23s rrna base 2058, which is homologous to the a2142g mutation commonly described in helicobacter pylori, was also identified in one of the c. jejuni isolates examined. in the majority of c. jejuni isolates, the mutations in the 23s rrna gene were homozygous except in two cases where the  mutation was found in two of the three copies of the target gene. natural transformation demonstrated the transfer of the macrolide resistance phenotype from a resistant campylobacter isolate to a susceptible campylobacter isolate. growth rates of the resulting transformants containing a-2058-->c or a-2059-->g mutations were similar to that of the parental isolate. the erythromycin resistance of six of seven representative isolates was found to be stable after successive subculturing in the absence of erythromycin selection pressure regardless of the resistance level, the position of the mutation, or the number of the mutated copies of the target gene. one c. jejuni isolate showing an a-2058-->g mutation, however, reverted to erythromycin and clarithromycin susceptibility after 55 subcultures on erythromycin-free medium. investigation of ribosomal proteins l4 and l22 by sequence analysis in five representative isolates of c. jejuni and c. coli demonstrated no significant macrolide resistance-associated alterations in either the l4 or the l22 protein that might  explain either macrolide resistance or enhancement of the resistance level.

TI  == declines of zoonotic agents in liquid livestock wastes stored in batches on-farm.
AB  == aim: to measure the decline rates of zoonotic agents introduced into liquid livestock wastes in on-farm storage tanks. methods and results: salmonella spp.,  escherichia coli o157, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes and cryptosporidium parvum, propagated in laboratory-controlled conditions, were inoculated into 35,000-l volumes of fresh livestock wastes (pig slurries, cattle  slurries and dirty waters). d-values for bacteria were six to 44 days, and for c. parvum were 133 to 345 days. campylobacter jejuni declined significantly more rapidly than the other bacterial pathogens, while e. coli o157 declined significantly more slowly. on average, bacterial declines were not affected by the season of waste deposition and storage or by the dry matter content of the wastes, but were more rapid in dirty waters than in pig slurries. the physiciochemical composition of wastes in each category varied significantly. conclusions: zoonotic agents can survive for several months during storage of liquid livestock wastes. livestock wastes should be batch-stored and not subjected to continuous additions. significance and impact of the study: this study indicates that batches of liquid livestock waste, if contaminated with bacterial pathogens, should be stored for 6 months to reduce contamination levels. alternative strategies for reducing c. parvum levels in liquid livestock  wastes should be explored.

AB  == acute diarrhea affects millions of persons who travel to developing countries each year. food and water contaminated with fecal matter are the main sources of  infection. bacteria such as enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, campylobacter, salmonella, and shigella are common causes of traveler's  diarrhea. parasites and viruses are less common etiologies. travel destination is the most significant risk factor for traveler's diarrhea. the efficacy of pretravel counseling and dietary precautions in reducing the incidence of diarrhea is unproven. empiric treatment of traveler's diarrhea with antibiotics and loperamide is effective and often limits symptoms to one day. rifaximin, a recently approved antibiotic, can be used for the treatment of traveler's diarrhea in regions where noninvasive e. coli is the predominant pathogen. in areas where invasive organisms such as campylobacter and shigella are common, fluoroquinolones remain the drug of choice. azithromycin is recommended in areas  with quinolone-resistant campylobacter and for the treatment of children and pregnant women.

TI  == fecal bacteria and sex hormones in soil and runoff from cropped watersheds amended with poultry litter.
AB  == the application of poultry litter to agricultural fields can provide plant nutrients for crops and forage production, but fecal bacteria and the sex hormones estradiol and testosterone are components of litter that can be detrimental to the environment. our objective was to determine if applications of poultry litter to small watersheds would contribute to the load of fecal bacteria and sex hormones to soil and runoff. we, therefore, investigated the fate and transport of fecal bacteria, estradiol and testosterone from surface applied poultry litter to four small watersheds. poultry litter was applied to meet the nitrogen requirements of pearl millet (pennisetum glaucum l.) in 2000 and grain sorghum [sorgham bicolor (l.) moench] in 2001. neither salmonella nor campylobacter were detected in the litter but the fecal indicator bacteria were.  the average load of total coliforms,escherichia coli, and fecal enterococci applied with the litter was 12.2, 11.9, and 12.7 log10 cells ha(-1), respectively. the average load of estradiol and testosterone was 3.1 and 0.09 mg  ha(-1), respectively.runoff events first occurred seven months after the first litter application in 2000, and three weeks after the second application in 2001.only for the 25 july 2001 runoff event three weeks after the second litter application, were the concentrations of total coliforms, e. coli,and fecal enterococci in runoff greater than background concentrations which were on average 5.2, 1.1, and 2.9 log10 mpn 100 ml(-1),respectively [corrected]. average  background levels of total coliforms, fecal enterococci,and e. coli in surface soil were 8.2, 7.9, and 3.5 log (10) cells kg(-1) soil. at the rate of litter application the concentrations of estradiol and testosterone in the litter did not appear to impact the background levels in the soil and runoff. because concentrations of sex hormones in litter from other broiler operations are known  to be greater than in the litter we applied, further study on the connection between concentrations of sex hormones in poultry litter and operational practices is recommended.

TI  == risk of hypertension and reduced kidney function after acute gastroenteritis from bacteria-contaminated drinking water.
AB  == background: the long-term health consequences of acute bacterial gastroenteritis  remain uncertain. we studied the risk of hypertension and reduced kidney function after an outbreak of acute gastroenteritis due to contamination of a regional drinking water supply with escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter species. methods: a total of 1958 adults with no known history of hypertension or kidney disease before the outbreak participated in a long-term follow-up study. of the participants, 675 had been asymptomatic during the outbreak, 909 had had moderate symptoms of acute self-limited gastroenteritis, and 374 had had severe symptoms that necessitated medical attention. the outcomes of interest were a diagnosis of hypertension or the presence of reduced kidney function and albuminuria during the follow-up period. results: after a mean follow-up of 3.7 years after the outbreak, hypertension was diagnosed in 27.0% of participants who had been asymptomatic during the outbreak and in 32.3% and 35.9% of those who had had moderate and severe symptoms of acute gastroenteritis respectively (trend p = 0.009). compared with the asymptomatic participants, those with moderate and severe symptoms of gastroenteritis had an adjusted relative risk of hypertension  of 1.15 (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.97-1.35) and 1.28 (95% ci 1.04-1.56) respectively. a similar graded association was seen for reduced kidney function,  defined as the presence of an estimated glomerular filtration rate below 60 ml/min per 1.73 m2 (trend p = 0.03). no association was observed between gastroenteritis and the subsequent risk of albuminuria. interpretation: acute bacterial gastroenteritis necessitating medical attention was associated with an  increased risk of hypertension and reduced kidney function 4 years after infection. maintaining safe drinking water remains essential to human health, as  transient bacterial contaminations may have implications well beyond a period of  acute self-limited illness.

AB  == fecal samples were collected from cases and controls as part of the infectious intestinal disease (iid) study in england and were stored as frozen suspensions for 8 to 12 years. the purpose of this study was to apply pcr-based procedures to assess the stability of pathogen-specific nucleic acid sequences present in this  archive. samples from which cryptosporidium, giardia, salmonella, campylobacter,  enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec), enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens, rotaviruses, noroviruses, or sapoviruses had been previously detected during the iid study using conventional methods were selected from the archive. a generic nucleic acid extraction method to recover rna or dna was used. complementary dna was generated from rna by reverse transcription with random priming. block-based and real-time pcr assays were used to amplify and detect gene fragments from each of these pathogens. the percentage reconfirmation of target was as follows: giardia duodenalis 68%, cryptosporidium 96%, campylobacter 98%, salmonella 98%, enterotoxigenic c perfringens 34%, eaggec 93.3%, rotavirus 95%, norovirus 73%, and sapovirus 85%. this study has shown that nucleic acid can be extracted and specific sequences amplified and detected from archived fecal samples. the iid archive therefore represents a valuable resource for further studies, especially the investigation of the samples from which no pathogens had  previously been detected.

TI  == bacteriophage control of foodborne bacteriat.
AB  == bacteriophages are measurable components of the natural microflora in the food production continuum from the farm to the retail outlet. phages are remarkably stable in these environments and are readily recovered from soil, sewage, water,  farm and processing plant effluents, feces, and retail foods. purified high-titer phage lysates have been used for the species-specific control of bacteria during  the pre- and postharvest phases of food production and storage. for example, the  inhibition of the phytopathogens erwinia amylovara and xanthomonas campestris has reduced the incidence of diseases such as fire blight in apples and bacterial spot of tomato and peaches. research on preslaughter treatment of food animals has demonstrated phage control of salmonellosis in chickens, enteropathogenic escherichia coli infections in calves, piglets, and lambs, and e. coli o157:h7 shedding by beef cattle. phages have also been applied to control the growth of pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, and campylobacter jejuni in a variety of refrigerated foods such as fruit, dairy products, poultry, and red meats. phage control of spoilage bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas spp. and brochothrix thermosphacta) in raw chilled meats can result in a significant extension of storage life. phage biocontrol strategies for food preservation have the advantages of being self-perpetuating, highly discriminatory, natural, and cost-effective. some of the drawbacks of biopreservation with phages are a limited host range, the requirement for threshold numbers of the bacterial targets, phage-resistant mutants, and the potential for the transduction of undesirable characteristics from one bacterial strain to another. most research to date has involved experimentally infected plants and animals or artificially inoculated foods. this technology must be transferred to the field and to commercial environments to assess the possibility of controlling natural contaminants under more realistic production and processing conditions.

AB  == preharvest management factors are predicted to impact the prevalence of foodborne pathogens in cattle sent to slaughter. we simultaneously examined the prevalence  and antibiotic resistance patterns of campylobacter jejuni, salmonella, and escherichia coli o157:h7 isolated from cull dairy cattle at two livestock auctions in northeastern ohio. between april and september 2002, a total of 1,026 fecal samples were collected. c. jejuni was isolated from 48 of 686 (7%) fecal samples, salmonella was isolated from 39 of 585 (6.7%) samples, and e. coli o157:h7 was isolated from 21 of 1,026 (2.1%) samples. of the 585 samples tested for all three pathogens, at least one pathogen was identified in 86 of 585 (15%)  samples. one sample was positive for both e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni, and five samples yielded both c. jejuni and salmonella. size of herd of origin could be traced for 75 to 85% of samples collected. salmonella was isolated at higher frequencies from herds larger than 60 cattle than from smaller herds (9.0 versus  3.5%, p = 0.02). in contrast, size of herd of origin did not significantly affect the e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni prevalence. approximately 90% of salmonella and e. coli o157:h7 isolates were pansensitive to a panel of 16 antibiotics. thirty-six percent of c. jejuni isolates were resistant to tetracycline. in this  study, antibiotic resistance among the foodborne pathogens isolated from cull diary cattle was rare. although size of dairy herd of origin was positively associated with salmonella prevalence, herd size was not strongly associated with e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni prevalence in market dairy cattle. these results can be used to assess the food safety risks associated with the slaughter of cull dairy cattle.

TI  == recombinant probiotics for treatment and prevention of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli diarrhea.
AB  == background & aims: we have developed a therapeutic strategy for gastrointestinal  infections that is based on molecular mimicry of host receptors for bacterial toxins on the surface of harmless gut bacteria. the aim of this study was to apply this to the development of a recombinant probiotic for treatment and prevention of diarrheal disease caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli strains that produce heat-labile enterotoxin. methods: this was achieved by expressing glycosyltransferase genes from neisseria meningitidis or campylobacter jejuni in a harmless escherichia coli strain (cwg308), resulting in the production of a chimeric lipopolysaccharide capable of binding heat-labile enterotoxin with high avidity. results: the strongest heat-labile enterotoxin binding was achieved with a construct (cwg308:plnt) that expresses a mimic of lacto-n-neotetraose, which neutralized > or = 93.8% of the heat-labile enterotoxin activity in culture lysates of diverse enterotoxigenic escherichia coli strains of both human and porcine origin. when tested with purified heat-labile enterotoxin, it was capable of adsorbing approximately 5% of its own  weight of toxin. weaker toxin neutralization was achieved with a construct that mimicked the ganglioside gm2. preabsorption with, or coadministration of, cwg308:plnt also resulted in significant in vivo protection from heat-labile enterotoxin-induced fluid secretion in rabbit ligated ileal loops. conclusions: toxin-binding probiotics such as those described here have considerable potential for prophylaxis and treatment of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli-induced travelers' diarrhea.

TI  == pora protein of campylobacter jejuni is not a cytotoxin mediating inflammatory diarrhoea.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a major food-borne pathogen and a leading cause of diarrhoea. a cytotoxin is most likely involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diarrhoea due to c. jejuni. a 45-kda outer membrane protein encoded  by the pora gene was reported to exhibit cytotoxic activity for cultured mammalian cells in vitro. we cloned and expressed the pora gene in escherichia coli bl21 codon plus ril strain using the fusion vector pgex-4t-1. the fusion protein solubilised in urea in denatured form or solubilised in empigen bb in native form or their thrombin-cleaved products did not exhibit cytotoxic activity for chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. the urea-solubilised fusion protein did not induce fluid accumulation in the rabbit ileal loop assay. all 76 clinical isolates of campylobacter spp. tested were positive for pora by pcr, but only 13  isolates were positive for cytotoxin on cho cells. both cytotoxin-positive as well as cytotoxin-negative strains expressed pora as determined by immunoblot analysis. these findings show that the pora gene product of c. jejuni is not a cytotoxin mediating inflammatory diarrhoea.

TI  == use of the oxford multilocus sequence typing protocol and sequencing of the flagellin short variable region to characterize isolates from a large outbreak of waterborne campylobacter sp. strains in walkerton, ontario, canada.
AB  == the walkerton (ontario, canada) outbreak of waterborne escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni was quite limited in both space and time, making it a good model for exploring the utility of different typing and subtyping methods for the characterization of relationships among isolates of these organisms. we have extended previous work with these organisms through analysis by the oxford multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and the flagellin short variable region (fla-svr) sequencing methods. additional isolates not epidemiologically related to the walkerton outbreak have also been included. both sequencing methods identified and differentiated between walkerton outbreak strains 1 and 2. when these strains were compared with isolates that were not part of the outbreak, the information produced by the fla-svr method more often correlated with epidemiological findings than that produced by mlst, though both methods were required for optimal discrimination. the mlst data were more relevant in terms of the overall population structure of the organisms. both mutation and recombination appeared to be responsible for generating diversity among the isolates tested.

TI  == human-milk glycans that inhibit pathogen binding protect breast-feeding infants against infectious diarrhea.
AB  == breast-feeding is a highly effective strategy for preventing morbidity and mortality in infancy. the human-milk glycans, which include oligosaccharides in their free and conjugated forms, constitute a major and an innate immunologic mechanism by which human milk protects breast-fed infants against infections. the glycans found in human milk function as soluble receptors that inhibit pathogens  from adhering to their target receptors on the mucosal surface of the host gastrointestinal tract. the alpha1,2-linked fucosylated glycans, which require the secretor gene for expression in human milk, are the dominant glycan structure found in the milk of secretor mothers, who constitute the majority ( approximately 80%) of mothers worldwide. in vitro and in vivo binding studies have demonstrated that alpha1,2-linked fucosylated glycans inhibit binding by campylobacter, stable toxin of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and major strains of caliciviruses to their target host cell receptors. consistent with these findings, recently published epidemiologic data demonstrate that higher relative concentrations of alpha1,2-linked fucosylated glycans in human milk are  associated with protection of breast-fed infants against diarrhea caused by campylobacter, caliciviruses, and stable toxin of enterotoxigenic e. coli, and moderate-to-severe diarrhea of all causes. these novel data open the potential for translational research to develop the human-milk glycans as a new class of antimicrobial agents that prevent infection by acting as pathogen anti-adhesion agents.

TI  == novel plasmids for gene expression analysis and for genetic manipulation in the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori.
AB  == to facilitate gene expression analysis in the human gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori, we constructed the plasmids phplac-kan and phplac-cat containing a promoterless escherichia coli lacz gene located upstream from the antibiotic resistance genes apha-3 or cat, respectively. the suitability of the plasmids for h. pylori mutagenesis and gene expression analysis was evaluated by plasmid integration into the genome of h. pylori strain 1061 by single homologous recombination, using the rpl9 gene encoding ribosomal protein l9 as target. by monitoring beta-galactosidase production from the resulting rpl9::lacz fusion, it was demonstrated that h. pylori rpl9 displays the classical growth phase-dependent regulation of components of the protein synthesis machinery, as beta-galactosidase production dropped fivefold in the stationary growth phase. the plasmids described in this study extend our methodological repertoire for genetic modification and molecular analysis of h. pylori, and may also be of use  for other bacteria, as the resistance cassettes and the lacz gene are active in the related campylobacter species.

TI  == long-term health sequelae following e. coli and campylobacter contamination of municipal water. population sampling and assessing non-participation biases.
AB  == background: following bacterial contamination of a municipal water system in the  rural town of walkerton, ontario, over 2,300 cases of acute gastroenteritis were  documented. the walkerton health study is currently underway to assess for long-term health sequelae among consenting inhabitants of walkerton, related to the original outbreak. we explored whether the association between the acute exposure and preliminary long-term health outcomes may have been biased through differences between early- and late-recruited study participants. methods: using  multiple data sources, including the 1996 and 2001 canadian census, and records from the regional health unit, hospital and walkerton health study, we determined both sample representativeness and the anticipated effects of intensifying study  participant recruitment. selection bias was assessed by examining for differences between initial and late participants, and their subsequent risk of having hypertension, proteinuria and reduced renal clearance. results: of the 4,315 participants, 2,756 were permanent residents of walkerton, representing 55% of the town's total population. the sample was demographically similar to the population of interest, although statistically women were more likely to participate than men (55% of sample were women compared to 52% of population, p<0.01), and the proportion of both young and very elderly adults was smaller than expected (13% of sample were > or = 65 years of age compared to 18% of population, p<0.01). comparing the initial 3,959 participants to the 356 persons  additionally recruited with substantial effort, the latter were more likely to be free of symptoms during the outbreak (21% vs. 7%, p<0.001), but were otherwise similar in terms of age, sex, the use of medical care resources and underlying health state predating the outbreak. the risk of long-term hypertension or renal  sequelae did not significantly differ between initial and late study recruits. conclusions: participants in the walkerton health study represent the population  of interest, and comprise those who were acutely ill during the infected water outbreak. the available study sample should provide reasonably unbiased estimates of the associated risk between acute bacterial gastroenteritis and long-term health sequelae.

TI  == novel preharvest strategies involving the use of experimental chlorate preparations and nitro-based compounds to prevent colonization of food-producing  animals by foodborne pathogens.
AB  == foodborne diseases caused by enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, salmonella, and  campylobacter species are of public health and economic significance. shedding of these pathogens during production and slaughter are risks for contamination of products for human consumption. consequently, strategies are sought to prevent or reduce the carriage of these pathogens in food animals before slaughter. experimental products containing chlorate salts have been proven efficacious in reducing concentrations of e. coli and salmonella typhimurium in the gut of cattle, sheep, swine, and poultry when administered as feed or water additives. mechanistically, chlorate selectively targets bacteria expressing respiratory nitrate reductase activity, such as most members of the family enterobacteriaceae, as this enzyme catalyzes the reduction of chlorate to lethal  chlorite. most beneficial gut bacteria lack respiratory nitrate reductase activity, and thus the technology appears compatible with many bacteria exhibiting competitive exclusion capabilities. more recently, select nitrocompounds have been investigated as potential feed additives, and although these nitrocompounds significantly reduce pathogens on their own, evidence indicates that they may most effectively be used to complement the bactericidal activity of chlorate. a particularly attractive aspect of the nitrocompound technology is that, as potent inhibitors of ruminal methanogenesis, they may allow producers the opportunity to recoup costs associated with their use. at present, neither chlorate nor the nitrocompounds have been approved as feed additives by the us food and drug administration, and consequently they are not yet available for commercial use.

TI  == considerations for development of whole cell bacterial vaccines to prevent diarrheal diseases in children in developing countries.
AB  == enteric pathogens constitute a major pediatric threat in the developing world through their impact on morbidity and mortality, physical and cognitive development and cause and effect relationship with malnutrition. although many bacterial pathogens can cause diarrheal diseases, a group of less than 10 including shigella spp., enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), vibrio cholerae, and possibly, campylobacter jejuni account for a significant percentage of these diseases in developing countries. rotavirus is also a major cause of diarrheal diseases. vaccines against these agents offer a potentially effective control measure against these diseases, but safe, practical, and effective vaccines for many of these agents have yet to be realized. many vaccine development approaches are under investigation, but the one that is currently most advanced and that has been most widely applied to enteric pathogens is the use of orally administered live or killed whole pathogen preparations. if inactivated, these vaccines will probably be administered as multiple doses with  approximately 10(10) to 10(11) total particles per dose, but they are relatively  safe for oral administration. further, they may not require a buffer for delivery and can be stored in liquid formulations. fewer doses may be required for some live attenuated pathogen vaccines, but a buffer will most likely be required for  oral delivery and the product must be stored in a dried formulation. also, safety becomes more of a concern with live pathogens depending on the degree of attenuation, host immunocompetence, and the total number and kinds of attenuated  pathogens which may be present in a combined agent vaccine. both live and killed  whole pathogen vaccines can be immunogenic and have the possibility to serve as vectors for other antigens. although many organisms and serotypes are clinically  important, by exploiting antigenic cross reactivity and using some pathogen components as vectors for cloned antigens of other pathogens, it could be possible to induce immunity against major enteric pathogens/serotypes with <10 whole pathogen components in a multi-agent vaccine. safe and effective mucosal adjuvants may in the future be useful in whole pathogen vaccines, but they do not seem to be essential for immunization. further, dietary supplements such as zinc, mixed routes of delivery and new regimens are under study which may in the future enhance further the effectiveness of the whole pathogen vaccines which now seem realizable in the near term. for this to happen, however, a coordinated and committed effort is necessary now to address the immunologic, regulatory, manufacturing, testing and implementation issues which will be involved in the realization of this important product to benefit children's health worldwide.

AB  == foodborne illnesses are a substantial health burden in the united states. the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet) of cdc's emerging infections program collects data from 10 u.s. sites on diseases caused by enteric pathogens transmitted commonly through food. foodnet quantifies and monitors the  incidence of these infections by conducting active, population-based surveillance for laboratory-diagnosed illness. this report describes preliminary surveillance  data for 2004 and compares them with baseline data from the period 1996-1998. the 2004 data indicate declines in the incidence of infections caused by campylobacter, cryptosporidium, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) o157, listeria, salmonella, and yersinia. declines in campylobacter and listeria  incidence are approaching national health objectives (objectives 10-1a through 1d); for the first time, the incidence of stec o157 infections in foodnet is below the 2010 target. however, further efforts are needed to sustain these declines and to improve prevention of foodborne infections; efforts should be enhanced to reduce pathogens in food animal reservoirs and to prevent contamination of produce.

TI  == frequency and characteristics of selected enteropathogens in fecal and rectal specimens from childhood diarrhea in trinidad, 1998-2000.
AB  == objective: to determine the prevalence and characteristics of selected enteric pathogens in diarrheic children in six counties of the island of trinidad. methods: this cross-sectional study was conducted from april 1998 through march 2000. fecal or rectal swab specimens from children (<12 years) were collected and then processed, using standard methods, to detect salmonella spp., shigella spp., enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., cryptosporidium parvum, and parasite ova. the antibiograms of the enteropathogens were determined using the disk diffusion method. results: a total of 236 samples  were processed; 86 samples originated directly from 17 heath centers in two counties (st. george east and st. george west), while 150 samples were obtained from the trinidad public health laboratory, having been submitted by private practitioners and personnel from six counties in trinidad. of the 236 samples, 33 (14.0%) were positive for shigella, 4 (1.7%) for salmonella, and 1 (0.4%) for epec. two of the samples (0.8%) were positive for campylobacter jejuni, while 1 sample (0.4%) was positive for hookworm ova. all the samples were negative for cryptosporidium parvum and yersinia spp. with the 86 samples collected directly from the health centers, in st. george east county the frequency of shigella was  20.0% (12 of 60), compared with 26.9% (7 of 26) for samples from st. george west  county, but the difference was not statistically significant (p>0.05 with the chi-square test). for the 150 samples from the six counties that had been submitted directly to the trinidad public health laboratory, 14 of them (9.3%) were positive for shigella, a figure statistically significantly lower than that  found with the samples sampled directly from the health centers (p<0.05 with the  chi-square test). sh. sonnei was the predominant serotype detected, accounting for 28 of the 33 shigella isolates (84.8%) recovered from the 236 samples. overall, the frequency of detection of enteropathogens had no seasonal pattern nor relationship to the county of origin. of the 37 isolates of salmonella and shigella tested for antimicrobial sensitivity, all of them were sensitive to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and cefotaxime. in terms of resistance, 3 of the 37 isolates (8.1%) exhibited resistance to ampicillin, 1 (2.7%) to chloramphenicol,  and 1 (2.7%) to sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim. conclusion: of the enteropathogens for which assays were done, shigella sonnei was the most prevalent, and it has the highest probability of being an important etiological agent of childhood diarrhea in trinidad.

TI  == a millennium update on pediatric diarrheal illness in the developing world.
AB  == more than one billion diarrhea episodes occur every year among children younger than 5 years of age in socioeconomically developing countries causing 2 to 2.5 million deaths. more than twenty viral, bacterial, and parasitic enteropathogens  are currently associated with acute diarrhea. rotavirus and diarrheagenic escherichia coli are the most common pathogens responsible for acute diarrhea episodes in children; shigella spp., salmonella spp, campylobacter jejuni/coli, vibrio cholerae, aeromonas spp, and plesiomonas spp. occur more commonly in poorer areas and infections caused by protozoa and helminthes occur mainly in areas where environmental sanitation is significantly deteriorated. initial clinical assessment of a child with diarrhea should focus on obtaining an accurate evaluation of hydration and nutritional status. assessment of stool characteristics (e.g., liquid non-bloody stools vs. dysenteric or bloody stools)  is a key feature in determining potential pathogens causing an acute diarrhea episode. diagnostic guidelines are discussed in the article. the major therapeutic intervention for all individuals with diarrhea consists of fluid and  electrolyte therapy. when antimicrobial therapy is appropriate, selection of a specific agent should be made based upon susceptibility patterns of the pathogen  or information on local susceptibility patterns. current guidelines for administering appropriate antimicrobial treatment are provided in the article. preventive measures include careful personal hygiene, especially promotion of hand washing. immunizations currently or soon to be available for salmonella serotype typhi, cholera prevention, and rotavirus are discussed.

TI  == prevalence and genetic diversity of campylobacter spp. in environmental water samples from a 100-square-kilometer predominantly dairy farming area.
AB  == water samples were taken systematically from a 100-km2 area of mainly dairy farmland in northwestern england and examined for campylobacter spp. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis-restriction fragment length polymorphism (pfge-rflp) and flaa strain typing of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli isolates were done.  data on the water source and the adjacent environment were recorded and examined  as explanatory variables. campylobacter spp. were isolated from 40.5% (n = 119) of the water samples tested. c. jejuni was isolated from 14.3%, c. coli was isolated from 18.5%, and campylobacter lari was isolated from 4.2% of the samples. campylobacter hyointestinalis was not isolated from any water source. the difference in prevalence between water types (trough, running, and standing)  was significant (p = 0.001). c. jejuni was the species most commonly isolated from trough-water and running-water sources, while c. coli was the most frequently isolated from standing water (p < 0.001). no association was found between the presence of escherichia coli and that of campylobacter spp. the final multivariable logistic regression model for campylobacter spp. included the following variables: water source, soil type, aspect, and amount of cattle fecal  material in the environment (fecal pat count). strain typing demonstrated a diverse population of c. jejuni and the presence of a common c. coli flaa type that was widely distributed throughout the area. most of the isolates within the  common flaa type were discriminated by pfge-rflp. these findings suggest a possible role for environmental water in the epidemiology of campylobacter spp. in a farming environment.

TI  == extracellular secretion of polypeptides using a modified escherichia coli flagellar secretion apparatus.
AB  == we developed a modified flagellar type iii secretion apparatus to secrete heterologous polypeptides into the growth medium of escherichia coli. the secretion was facilitated by fusing the 173-bp untranslated dna fragment upstream of the gene flic (encoding flagellin) as well as a transcriptional terminator from flic, into the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest. the polypeptides secreted into the growth medium at concentrations ranging from 1 to 15 mg/l were  from campylobacter jejuni (262 residues in length), streptococcus pneumoniae (434 residues), staphylococcus aureus (115 residues), and n-terminal flic hybrid proteins, for example, the eukaryotic green fluorescent protein (238 residues). the expressed proteins represented >50% of total secreted protein. previously reported protein yields from extracellular secretion of foreign proteins in e. coli have been low, approximately 100 microg/l. the strengths of our method are the concentration and purity of the secreted proteins and its versatility with regard to the proteins' length and origin.

TI  == biochemical characterization of the campylobacter jejuni cj1294, a novel udp-4-keto-6-deoxy-glcnac aminotransferase that generates udp-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-galnac.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni produces multiple glycoproteins whose glycans contain 4-amino 6-deoxy sugars or their derivatives, such as diacetamidobacillosamine or  pseudaminic acid. because the proteoglycans contribute to bacterial virulence and their constitutive sugars are not commonly found in humans, inhibitors developed  against the enzymes that are responsible for their biosynthesis could be novel therapeutic targets to fight this important food-borne pathogen. the biosynthesis of diacetamidobacillosamine is anticipated to involve a sugar nucleotide c6 dehydratase, a c4 aminotransferase and an acetyltransferase. we have identified a set of genes (cj1293, cj1294, and cj1298) potentially encoding one of each enzymatic activity, and demonstrated earlier that cj1293 was a udp-glcnac-specific c6 dehydratase. others have shown that cj1293 was involved in protein glycosylation. here, we report on our investigation of the potential activity of cj1294 as a sugar nucleotide c4 aminotransferase. our biochemical characterization of overexpressed and purified protein shows that cj1294 is a pyridoxal phosphate-dependent aminotransferase specific for udp-4-keto-6-deoxy-glcnac that uses preferentially glutamic acid as an amino donor. a detailed physicokinetic study of cj1294 was performed to determine the k(m) of 1.28 +/- 0.2 mm and k(cat) of 11.5 +/- 1.3 min(-1). also, two residues essential for protein stability and activity, arg(228) and lys(181), respectively, were identified by site-directed mutagenesis. finally, we demonstrated by nmr analysis of purified reaction product that cj1294 produces udp-4-amino-4,6-dideoxy-galnac. these results indicate that cj1294 is involved in the biosynthesis of diacetamidofucosamine, a c4 epimer of diacetamidobacillosamine not yet described in c. jejuni proteoglycans, suggesting that the composition of c. jejuni proteoglycans is more variable than anticipated.

TI  == prevalence of campylobacter, salmonella, and escherichia coli on the external packaging of raw meat.
AB  == during september and october 2002, 3,662 prepackaged raw meat samples were collected to evaluate the extent and nature of microbiological contamination on external surfaces of the packaging, which could potentially cross-contaminate ready-to-eat foods during and after purchase. salmonella was detected on two (<1%) samples of external packaging (both from raw chicken), and campylobacter was detected on 41 (1.1%) samples of external packaging. the external packaging of game fowl exhibited the highest campylobacter contamination (3.6%), followed by raw chicken (3.0%), lamb (1.6%), turkey (0.8%), pork (0.2%), and beef (0.1%);  campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli accounted for 59% (24 of 41) and 24%  (10 of 41) of the contaminating campylobacter species, respectively. c. coli isolates from the external packaging were more multiresistant to antimicrobial drugs, including quinolones such as ciprofloxacin, than was c. jejuni. escherichia coli (an indicator of fecal contamination) was isolated from the external packaging on 4% of the raw meat samples at levels of 40 to 10(5) cfu per swab. the external packaging of raw meats is a vehicle for potential cross-contamination by campylobacter, salmonella, and e. coli in retail premises  and consumers' homes. the external surface of heat-sealed packaging was less frequently contaminated with campylobacter and e. coli compared with other types  of packaging (e.g., overwrapping, bag, and tie tape) (p < 0.0001 to 0.01). in addition, external packaging of raw meats was contaminated less frequently with campylobacter and e. coli when packaging was intact, packaging and display areas  were visually clean, display temperatures were below 8 degrees c, and hazard analysis systems were in place.

TI  == functional analysis of the campylobacter jejuni n-linked protein glycosylation pathway.
AB  == we describe in this report the characterization of the recently discovered n-linked glycosylation locus of the human bacterial pathogen campylobacter jejuni, the first such system found in a species from the domain bacteria. we exploited the ability of this locus to function in escherichia coli to demonstrate through mutational and structural analyses that variant glycan structures can be transferred onto protein indicating the relaxed specificity of  the putative oligosaccharyltransferase pglb. structural data derived from these variant glycans allowed us to infer the role of five individual glycosyltransferases in the biosynthesis of the n-linked heptasaccharide. furthermore, we show that c. jejuni- and e. coli-derived pathways can interact in the biosynthesis of n-linked glycoproteins. in particular, the e. coli encoded weca protein, a udp-glcnac: undecaprenylphosphate glcnac-1-phosphate transferase  involved in glycolipid biosynthesis, provides for an alternative n-linked heptasaccharide biosynthetic pathway bypassing the requirement for the c. jejuni-derived glycosyltransferase pglc. this is the first experimental evidence  that biosynthesis of the n-linked glycan occurs on a lipid-linked precursor prior to transfer onto protein. these findings provide a framework for understanding the process of n-linked protein glycosylation in bacteria and for devising strategies to exploit this system for glycoengineering.

TI  == ligand binding properties of bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins.
AB  == bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins share a common globin fold but differ  otherwise in structural and functional aspects. the bases of these differences were investigated through kinetic studies on oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric  oxide binding. the novel bacterial hemoglobins from clostridium perfringens and campylobacter jejuni and the flavohemoglobins from bacillus subtilis and salmonella enterica serovar typhi have been analyzed. examination of the biochemical and ligand binding properties of these proteins shows a clear distinction between the two groups. flavohemoglobins show a much greater tendency to autoxidation compared to bacterial hemoglobins. the differences in affinity for oxygen, carbon monoxide, and nitric oxide between bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins are mainly due to differences in the association rate constants. the second-order rate constants for oxygen and carbon monoxide binding to bacterial hemoglobins are severalfold higher than those for flavohemoglobins. a similar trend is observed for no association with the oxidized iron(iii) form of  the proteins. no major differences are observed among the values obtained for the dissociation rate constants for the two groups of bacterial proteins studied, and these constants are all rather similar to those for myoglobin. taken together, our data suggest that differences exist between the mechanisms of ligand binding  to bacterial hemoglobins and flavohemoglobins, suggesting different functions in  the cell.

AB  == survey results describing the levels and prevalences of zoonotic agents in 1,549  livestock waste samples were analyzed for significance with livestock husbandry and farm waste management practices. statistical analyses of survey data showed that livestock groups containing calves of <3 months of age, piglets, or lambs had higher prevalences and levels of campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli o157 in their wastes. younger calves that were still receiving milk, however, had significantly lower levels and prevalence of e. coli o157. furthermore, when wastes contained any form of bedding, they had lowered prevalences and levels of  both pathogenic listeria spp. and campylobacter spp. livestock wastes generated by stock consuming a diet composed principally of grass were less likely to harbor e. coli o157 or salmonella spp. stocking density did not appear to influence either the levels or prevalences of bacterial pathogens. significant seasonal differences in prevalences were detected in cattle wastes; listeria spp. were more likely to be isolated in march to june, and e. coli o157 was more likely to be found in may and june. factors such as livestock diet and age also had significant influence on the levels and prevalences of some zoonotic agents in livestock wastes. a number of the correlations identified could be used as the basis of a best-practice disposal document for farmers, thereby lowering the microbiological risks associated with applying manures of contaminated livestock  to land.

TI  == vaccination against salmonella, enterohaemorrhagic e. coli and campylobacter in food-producing animals.
AB  == the threat of zoonotic infection with food-poisoning enteric pathogens remains a  major threat to public health throughout the world. control of enteric pathogens  within food-producing animals remains an obvious strategy to prevent the introduction of these pathogens into the human food chain. vaccines are currently available for the control of salmonella; however such vaccines vary in their efficacy and acceptability to the food production industries and consumers. vaccines for the control of enterohaemorrhagic e. coli and campylobacter are currently unavailable. understanding the molecular basis of how these organisms colonise the intestines and cause disease is essential for the development of effective multivalent vaccines. the mechanisms by which these organisms colonise  the gut will be reviewed. bacterial type three secretion systems (ttss) have been shown to be major virulence factors influencing the colonisation and pathogenicity of salmonella and enterohaemorrhagic e. coli in some but not all animal species. thus, understanding the specific nature of host/pathogen interactions is crucial in the development of cross-species vaccines. ttsss act by delivering effector proteins into intestinal epithelial cells, which act to modify signalling events in host cells causing cytoskeletal and pathophysiological changes to the benefit of the pathogen. disruption of ttsss and/or related secreted effector proteins can be adopted as a strategy for the attenuation of live vaccine strains. furthermore secreted effector proteins have  the potential to be incorporated into sub-unit vaccines. as many of such effector proteins are conserved between different serotypes, such vaccines offer the hope  of cross-serotype protective immune responses. novel experimental vaccines are currently being developed to exploit these and other recent discoveries in bacterial virulence mechanisms. the potential of such vaccines to control zoonotic pathogens will be discussed.

TI  == rifaximin: a nonabsorbed oral antibiotic.
AB  == rifaximin is a rifamycin analogue with a broad spectrum of activity similar to that of rifampin; however, because it is poorly absorbed in the gastrointestinal  tract, the focus of its development has been on intestinal infections and diseases. this agent has proven to be as effective as ciprofloxacin in treating travelers' diarrhea due to escherichia coli, although it is ineffective in treating infections due to campylobacter jejuni. other potential uses for rifaximin in gastroenterologic disorders include treatment of hepatic encephalopathy, intestinal gas and gas-related symptoms, diverticular disease, intestinal bacterial overgrowth, pouchitis, ulcerative colitis, and active crohn's disease. this article highlights several studies demonstrating the efficacy of rifaximin in treating travelers' diarrhea as well as other gastrointestinal diseases and discusses the drug's pharmacokinetics, indications, contraindications, warnings, precautions, adverse reactions, and dosing.

TI  == effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of antimicrobial resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig.
AB  == aim: to assess the effect of the growth promoter avilamycin on emergence and persistence of resistance in enteric bacteria in the pig. methods and results: pigs (treated with avilamycin for 3 months and controls) were challenged with multi-resistant salmonella typhimurium dt104 and faecal counts were performed for enterococci, escherichia coli, s. typhimurium and campylobacter (before, during and 5 weeks post-treatment). representative isolates were tested for antibiotic resistance and for the presence of resistance genes. avilamycin-resistant enterococci faecalis (speciated by pcr) were isolated from the treated pigs and continued to be detected for the first week after treatment had ceased. the avilamycin-resistance gene was characterized by pcr as the emta gene and speciation by pcr. mic profiling confirmed that more than one strain of ent. faecalis carried this gene. there was no evidence of increased antimicrobial resistance in the e. coli, salmonella and campylobacter populations, although there was a higher incidence of tetb positive e. coli in the treated pigs than the controls. conclusion: although avilamycin selects for resistance in the native enterococci population of the pig, no resistant isolates were detected beyond 1 week post-treatment. this suggests that resistant isolates were unable to persist once selective pressure was removed and were out-competed by the sensitive microflora. significance and impact of the study: our data suggest the  risk of resistant isolates becoming carcass contaminants and infecting humans could be minimized by introducing a withdrawal period after using avilamycin and  prior to slaughter.

TI  == engineering n-linked protein glycosylation with diverse o antigen lipopolysaccharide structures in escherichia coli.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni has a general n-linked protein glycosylation system that can be functionally transferred to escherichia coli. in this study, we engineered e.  coli cells in a way that two different pathways, protein n-glycosylation and lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis, converge at the step in which pglb, the key enzyme of the c. jejuni n-glycosylation system, transfers o polysaccharide from a lipid carrier (undecaprenyl pyrophosphate) to an acceptor protein. pglb was the only protein of the bacterial n-glycosylation machinery both necessary and sufficient for the transfer. the relaxed specificity of the pglb oligosaccharyltransferase toward the glycan structure was exploited to create novel n-glycan structures containing two distinct e. coli or pseudomonas aeruginosa o antigens. pglb-mediated transfer of polysaccharides might be valuable for in vivo production of o polysaccharides-protein conjugates for use as antibacterial vaccines.

TI  == emerging food-borne zoonoses.
AB  == diarrhoeal diseases, almost all of which are caused by food-borne or waterborne microbial pathogens, are leading causes of illness and death in less developed countries, killing an estimated 1.9 million people annually at the global level.  even in developed countries, it is estimated that up to one third of the population are affected by microbiological food-borne diseases each year. the majority of the pathogens causing this significant disease burden are now considered to be zoonotic. the occurrence of some of these zoonotic pathogens seems to have increased significantly over recent years. the factors involved in  such increases have not been well studied, but they are generally agreed to include changes in animal production systems and in the food production chain. both types of changes can cause corresponding changes in patterns of exposure to  the pathogens and the susceptibility pattern of the human population. this paper  will not attempt a more in-depth analysis of such factors. the authors briefly describe five of the most important emerging food-borne zoonotic pathogens: salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli, toxoplasma gondii and cryptosporidium parvum. the paper does not include a full description of all important emerging food-borne pathogens but instead provides a description of the present situation, as regards these globally more important pathogens. in addition, the authors describe each pathogen according to the new framework of a food and agriculture organization (fao)/world health organization  (who) microbiological risk assessment, which consists of hazard identification and characterisation, exposure assessment and risk characterisation. moreover, the authors provide a brief account of attempts at risk mitigation, as well as suggestions for risk management for some of these pathogens, based on thorough international fao/who risk assessments. the authors emphasise the importance of science-based programmes for the continued reduction of pathogens at relevant points of the 'farm-to-fork' food production chain, as this is the only sustainable basis for further reducing risks to human health in the area of preventable food-borne diseases.

TI  == foodborne enteric infections.
AB  == foodborne infections are estimated to affect one in four americans each year. most these (67%) are caused by the norwalk-like viruses, but campylobacter and nontyphoidal salmonellae together account for about one fourth of cases of illness in which a pathogen can be detected. less common bacterial infections, such as with listeria monocytogenes and the shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, cause fewer infections but are important because of their severe complications or high mortality rate, or both. this review describes the recent development of a national surveillance system for foodborne illness, newer methods for molecular characterization of organisms for epidemiologic studies, and individual etiologic agents in the order of frequency of occurrence. methods  for decreasing the disease burden are discussed, including education of health care professionals and the public, modification of food-handling behaviors, the use of food irradiation, and the application of probiotics to foods.

TI  == diversity within the campylobacter jejuni type i restriction-modification loci.
AB  == the type i restriction-modification (hsd) systems of 73 campylobacter jejuni strains were characterized according to their dna and amino acid sequences, and/or gene organization. a number of new genes were identified which are not present in the sequenced strain nctc 11168. the closely related organism helicobacter pylori has three type i systems; however, no evidence was found that c. jejuni strains contain multiple type i systems, although hsd loci are present  in at least two different chromosomal locations. also, unlike h. pylori, intervening orfs are present, in some strains, between hsdr and hsds and between  hsds and hsdm. no definitive function can be ascribed to these orfs, designated here as rloa-h (r-linked orf) and mloa-b (m-linked orf). based on parsimony analysis of amino acid sequences to assess character relatedness, the c. jejuni type i r-m systems are assigned to one of three families: 'iab', 'ic' or 'if'. this study confirms that hsdm proteins within a family are highly conserved but share little homology with hsdm proteins from other families. the 'ic' hsd loci are >99 % identical at the nucleotide level, as are the 'if' hsd loci. additionally, whereas the nucleotide sequences of the 'iab' hsdr and hsdm genes show a high degree of similarity, the nucleotide sequences of the 'iab' hsds and  rlo genes vary considerably. this diversity suggests that recombination between 'iab' hsd loci would lead not only to new hsds alleles but also to the exchange of rlo genes; five c. jejuni hsd loci are presumably the result of such recombination. the importance of these findings with regard to the evolution of c. jejuni type i r-m systems is discussed.

TI  == fate of pathogens present in livestock wastes spread onto fescue plots.
AB  == fecal wastes from a variety of farmed livestock were inoculated with livestock isolates of escherichia coli o157, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, campylobacter jejuni, and cryptosporidium parvum oocysts at levels representative of the levels found in naturally contaminated wastes. the wastes were subsequently spread onto a grass pasture, and the decline of each of the zoonotic agents was monitored over time. there were no significant differences among the decimal reduction times for the bacterial pathogens. the mean bacterial decimal reduction time was 1.94 days. a range of times between 8 and 31 days for a 1-log  reduction in c. parvum levels was obtained, demonstrating that the protozoans were significantly more hardy than the bacteria. oocyst recovery was more efficient from wastes with lower dry matter contents. the levels of most of the zoonotic agents had declined to below detectable levels by 64 days. however, for  some waste types, 128 days was required for the complete decline of l. monocytogenes levels. we were unable to find significant differences between the  rates of pathogen decline in liquid (slurry) and solid (farmyard manure) wastes,  although concerns have been raised that increased slurry generation as a consequence of more intensive farming practices could lead to increased survival  of zoonotic agents in the environment.

TI  == incidence and mechanism of ciprofloxacin resistance in campylobacter spp. isolated from commercial poultry flocks in the united kingdom before, during, and after fluoroquinolone treatment.
AB  == five commercial broiler flocks were treated with a fluoroquinolone for a clinically relevant infection. fresh feces from individual chickens and environmental samples were cultured for campylobacters before, during, and weekly posttreatment until slaughter. both campylobacter jejuni and c. coli were isolated during all treatment phases. an increased proportion of quinolone-resistant strains was seen during treatment, and these strains persisted posttreatment. one quinolone-resistant isolate of each species, each serotype, and each phage type from each sample at all treatment phases was examined for its phenotype and mechanism of resistance. two resistant phenotypes  were isolated: nal(r) cip(r) and nal(r) cip(s). the majority (269 of 290) of fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates, whether they were c. jejuni or c. coli, had a mutation in gyra that resulted in the substitution thr-86-->ile. the other gyra mutations detected were thr-86-->ala (n = 17) and asp-90-->asn (n = 10). the genotypic variation, based on the silent mutations in gyra identified by the denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography pattern and dna sequencing, was used to supplement typing data and provided evidence for both the spread of preexisting resistant strains and the selection of spontaneous resistant mutants  in treated flocks. multidrug resistance was significantly (p < 0.01) associated with resistance to ciprofloxacin. twenty-five percent (73 of 290) of ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates but only 13% (24 of 179) of susceptible isolates were resistant to three or more unrelated antimicrobial agents. in conclusion, quinolone-resistant campylobacters were isolated from commercial chicken flocks in high numbers following therapy with a veterinary fluoroquinolone. most ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates had the gyra substitution thr-86-->ile. resistant isolates were isolated from the feces of some flocks up to the point of slaughter, which may have consequences for public health.

TI  == prevalence and subtypes of ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacter spp. in commercial poultry flocks before, during, and after treatment with fluoroquinolones.
AB  == five commercial broiler chicken flocks were treated with either difloxacin or enrofloxacin for a clinically relevant infection, as instructed by a veterinarian. campylobacters were isolated from individual fecal samples and from samples associated with the broiler environment before, during, and after treatment. ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacter jejuni and/or c. coli strains were detected pretreatment in four flocks, but they constituted a very small proportion of the campylobacters present. when the broilers were treated with a fluoroquinolone, a rapid increase in the proportion of ciprofloxacin-resistant campylobacters was observed. during treatment nearly 100% of campylobacters were  resistant, and in some flocks a high proportion of resistant strains persisted for up to 4 weeks after treatment. prior to treatment a variety of campylobacter  subtypes were present. during and after treatment considerable changes in both species and subtype prevalence were observed, but no single fluoroquinolone-resistant clone became dominant. instead, resistant c. coli strains or a mixture of resistant c. coli and c. jejuni strains became dominant,  whereas susceptible c. jejuni strains had usually been dominant prior to treatment. the resistant subtypes which emerged and became dominant were not always the same as those detected pretreatment. the persistence of resistant strains for up to 4 weeks posttreatment has important implications for any strategy designed to avoid the introduction of such strains into the food chain.

TI  == nitric oxide and nitrosative stress tolerance in bacteria.
AB  == nitric oxide is not only an obligatory intermediate in denitrification, but also  a signalling and defence molecule of major importance. however, the basis of resistance to no and rns (reactive nitrogen species) is poorly understood in many microbes. the cellular targets of no and rns [e.g. metalloproteins, thiols in proteins, glutathione and hcy (homocysteine)] may themselves serve as signal transducers, sensing no and rns, and resulting in altered gene expression and synthesis of protective enzymes. the properties of a number of such protective mechanisms are outlined here, including globins, flavorubredoxin, diverse enzymes with no- or s-nitrosothiol-reducing properties and other redox proteins with poorly defined roles in protection from nitrosative stresses. however, the most fully understood mechanism for no detoxification involves the enterobacterial flavohaemoglobin (hmp). aerobically, hmp detoxifies no by acting as an no denitrosylase or 'oxygenase' and thus affords inducible protection of growth and  respiration, and aids survival in macrophages. the flavohaemoglobin-encoding gene of escherichia coli, hmp, responds to the presence of no and rns in an soxrs-independent manner. nitrosating agents, such as s-nitrosoglutathione, deplete cellular hcy and consequently modulate activity of the metr regulator that binds the hmp promoter. regulation of hmp synthesis under anoxic conditions  involves nitrosylation of 4fe-4s clusters in the global transcriptional regulator, fnr. the foodborne microaerophilic pathogen, campylobacter jejuni, also expresses a haemoglobin, cgb, but it does not possess the reductase domain of hmp. a cgb-deficient mutant of c. jejuni is hypersensitive to rns, whereas cgb expression and holoprotein synthesis are specifically increased on exposure to rns, resulting in no-insensitive respiration. a 'systems biology' approach, integrating the methodologies of bacterial molecular genetics and physiology with post-genomic technologies, promises considerable advances in our understanding of bacterial no tolerance mechanisms in pathogenesis.

TI  == use of molecular hydrogen as an energy substrate by human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == molecular hydrogen is produced as a fermentation by-product in the large intestine of animals and its production can be correlated with the digestibility  of the carbohydrates consumed. pathogenic helicobacter species (helicobacter pylori and h. hepaticus) have the ability to use h(2) through a respiratory hydrogenase, and it was demonstrated that the gas is present in the tissues colonized by these pathogens (the stomach and the liver respectively of live animals). mutant strains of h. pylori unable to use h(2) are deficient in colonizing mice compared with the parent strain. on the basis of available annotated gene sequence information, the enteric pathogen salmonella, like other  enteric bacteria, contains three putative membrane-associated h(2)-using hydrogenase enzymes. from the analysis of gene-targeted mutants it is concluded that each of the three membrane-bound hydrogenases of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium are coupled with an h(2)-oxidizing respiratory pathway. from microelectrode probe measurements on live mice, h(2) could be detected at approx. 50 mum levels within the tissues (liver and spleen), which are colonized by salmonella. the half-saturation affinity of whole cells of these pathogens for h(2) is much less than this, so it is expected that the (h(2)-utilizing) hydrogenase enzymes be saturated with the reducing substrate in vivo. all three enteric nife hydrogenase enzymes contribute to virulence of the bacterium in a typhoid fever-mouse model, and the combined removal of all three hydrogenases resulted in a strain that is avirulent and (in contrast with the parent strain) one that is not able to pass the intestinal tract to invade liver or spleen tissue. it is proposed that h(2) utilization and specifically its oxidation, coupled with a respiratory pathway, is required for energy production to permit growth and maintain efficient virulence of a number of pathogenic bacteria during infection of animals. these would be expected to include the campylobacter jejuni, a bacterium closely related to helicobacter, as well as many enteric bacteria (escherichia coli, shigella and yersinia species).

TI  == anion-independent iron coordination by the campylobacter jejuni ferric binding protein.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, the leading cause of human gastroenteritis, expresses a ferric binding protein (cfbpa) that in many pathogenic bacteria functions to acquire iron as part of their virulence repertoire. recombinant cfbpa is isolated with ferric iron bound from escherichia coli. the crystal structure of cfbpa reveals unprecedented iron coordination by only five protein ligands. the histidine and one tyrosine are derived from the n-terminal domain, whereas the three remaining tyrosine ligands are from the c-terminal domain. surprisingly, a  synergistic anion present in all other characterized ferric transport proteins is not observed in the cfbpa iron-binding site, suggesting a novel role for this protein in iron uptake. furthermore, cfbpa is shown to bind iron with high affinity similar to neisserial fbpa and exhibits an unusual preference for ferrous iron (oxidized subsequently to the ferric form) or ferric iron chelated by oxalate. sequence and structure analyses reveal that cfbpa is a member of a new class of ferric binding proteins that includes homologs from invasive and intracellular bacteria as well as cyanobacteria. overall, six classes are defined based on clustering within the tree and by their putative iron coordination. the  absence of a synergistic anion in the iron coordination sphere of cfbpa also suggests an alternative model of evolution for fbpa homologs involving an early iron-binding ancestor instead of a requirement for a preexisting anion-binding ancestor.

AB  == we describe a multiplex pcr assay to identify and discriminate between isolates of campylobacter coli, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter lari, and campylobacter upsaliensis. the c. jejuni isolate f38011 lpxa gene, encoding a udp-n-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase, was identified by sequence analysis of an expression plasmid that restored wild-type lipopolysaccharide levels in escherichia coli strain sm105 [lpxa(ts)]. with oligonucleotide primers developed  to the c. jejuni lpxa gene, nearly full-length lpxa amplicons were amplified from an additional 11 isolates of c. jejuni, 20 isolates of c. coli, 16 isolates of c. lari, and five isolates of c. upsaliensis. the nucleotide sequence of each amplicon was determined, and sequence alignment revealed a high level of species  discrimination. oligonucleotide primers were constructed to exploit species differences, and a multiplex pcr assay was developed to positively identify isolates of c. coli, c. jejuni, c. lari, and c. upsaliensis. we characterized an  additional set of 41 thermotolerant isolates by partial nucleotide sequence analysis to further demonstrate the uniqueness of each species-specific region. the multiplex pcr assay was validated with 105 genetically defined isolates of c. coli, c. jejuni, c. lari, and c. upsaliensis, 34 strains representing 12 additional campylobacter species, and 24 strains representing 19 non-campylobacter species. application of the multiplex pcr method to whole-cell  lysates obtained from 108 clinical and environmental thermotolerant campylobacter isolates resulted in 100% correlation with biochemical typing methods.

TI  == characterization of lactobacillus coryniformis dsm 20001t surface protein cpf mediating coaggregation with and aggregation among pathogens.
AB  == phenotypic characterization of aggregation phenotypes of lactobacillus coryniformis revealed that strain dsm 20001t coaggregated with escherichia coli k88, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter jejuni but not with other human pathogens. in addition, cells of these pathogens aggregated in the presence of the spent culture supernatant (scs) of strain dsm 20001t. cells of e. coli k88 remained viable in the coaggregates and aggregates for up to 24 h. both coaggregation and aggregation (co/aggregation) occurred at ph 3.5 to 7.5 and was  sensitive to heat (85 degrees c for 15 min) and proteinase k. the co/aggregation-promoting factor (cpf) was purified, and the gene was identified by pcr with degenerate primers derived from internal amino acid sequences. the cpf gene encoded a 19.9-kda preprotein with a sec-dependent leader and an isoelectric point of 4.4. the amino acid sequence had no significant similarity to proteins with known functions. northern analysis revealed not only major transcription from the promoter of cpf but also major transcription from the promoter of the preceding insertion element, islco1 belonging to the is3 family.  recombinant cpf produced in e. coli mediated aggregation of pathogens comparable  to the aggregation obtained with purified cpf or scs of strain dsm 20001t. cpf could be removed from cells of strain dsm 20001t by treatment with 5 m licl and could be subsequently reattached to the cell surface by using scs or recombinant  cpf, which resulted in restoration of the co/aggregation property. these results  together with those of the amino acid sequence analysis suggest that cpf is a novel surface protein of l. coryniformis that mediates co/aggregation of some pathogens.

TI  == the n-x-s/t consensus sequence is required but not sufficient for bacterial n-linked protein glycosylation.
AB  == in the gram-negative bacterium campylobacter jejuni there is a pgl (protein glycosylation) locus-dependent general n-glycosylation system of proteins. one of the proteins encoded by pgl locus, pglb, a homolog of the eukaryotic oligosaccharyltransferase component stt3p, is proposed to function as an oligosaccharyltransferase in this prokaryotic system. the sequence requirements of the acceptor polypeptide for n-glycosylation were analyzed by reverse genetics using the reconstituted glycosylation of the model protein acra in escherichia coli. as in eukaryotes, the n-x-s/t sequon is an essential but not a sufficient determinant for n-linked protein glycosylation. this conclusion was supported by  the analysis of a novel c. jejuni glycoprotein, hisj. export of the polypeptide to the periplasm was required for glycosylation. our data support the hypothesis  that eukaryotic and bacterial n-linked protein glycosylation are homologous processes.

TI  == bacterial flora of free-living double-crested cormorant (phalacrocorax auritus) chicks on prince edward island, canada, with reference to enteric bacteria and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == cloacal and pharyngeal swabs from 100 tree-nesting double-crested cormorant (dcc) chicks were examined by culture for commensal and potentially pathogenic bacteria. no salmonella or erysipelothrix were isolated from the cloacal swabs. twenty-two cloacal swabs were positive for campylobacter, of which 14 were c. jejuni, c. coli, and 1 c. lari. none belonged to common serotypes isolated from humans or animals in recent years in canada. tests for antimicrobial drug resistance among 187 commensal escherichia coli isolates from the cloacal swabs indicated that < or =5% were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. this  contrasts with the frequently high resistance rates among e. coli isolates from poultry. pharyngeal swabs from dcc were negative for pasteurella multocida. culture of cloacal swabs from 100 ground-nesting dcc chicks resulted in the recovery of 19 salmonella isolates, all of which were s. enterica serotype typhimurium. none of these isolates were resistant to any of the 12 antibiotics tested. altogether, these findings suggest that dcc from this region are not being colonized with commensal or potentially pathogenic enteric bacteria from agricultural or human sources and that enteric bacteria isolated from these birds are unlikely to contribute to a gene pool of antimicrobial drug resistance.

AB  == aims: the microbiota of the human intestinal tract constitutes a complex ecosystem. we report the design and optimization of an extensive set of 16s rdna-targeted species- and group-specific primers for more accurate quantification of bacteria from faecal samples with real-time pcr. methods and results: a linear range of quantification between 0.1-10 pg and 10 ng of specific target genome was obtained, which corresponds to detection of ca 30-4500 to 1.9 x 10(6)-6.0 x 10(6) target bacterial genomes. functionality of the assays was confirmed by quantification of target bacterial dna from faecal dna preparations  of healthy volunteers and irritable bowel syndrome (ibs) patients. additionally,  spiking of faecal preparations with helicobacter pylori, clostridium difficile or campylobacter jejuni was used to confirm the accurate and sensitive quantification. conclusions: real-time pcr is a very sensitive and precise technique for an extensive quantitative evaluation of gut microbiota and is feasible for detection of human pathogens from faecal samples. significance and impact of the study: to design and optimize an extensive set of real-time pcr assays targeting a large group of predominant and pathogenic gi microbial species for further use in updating the current knowledge of the putative role of gut microbiota in health and disease.

TI  == studies on calf diarrhoea in mozambique: prevalence of bacterial pathogens.
AB  == the prevalence of diarrhoea in calves was investigated in 8 dairy farms in mozambique at 4 occasions during 2 consecutive years. a total of 1241 calves up to 6 months of age were reared in the farms, and 63 (5%) of them had signs of diarrhoea. two farms had an overall higher prevalence (13% and 21%) of diarrhoea. faecal samples were collected from all diarrhoeal calves (n = 63) and from 330 healthy calves and analysed for salmonella species, campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec). salmonella spp. was isolated in only 2%  of all calves. campylobacter was isolated in 11% of all calves, irrespective of health condition, and was more frequent (25%) in one of the 2 diarrhoeal farms (p = 0.001). 80% of the isolates were identified as c. jejuni. no etec strains were  detected among the 55 tested strains from diarrhoeal calves, but 22/55 (40%) strains from diarrhoeal calves and 14/88 (16%) strains from healthy calves carried the k99 adhesin (p = 0.001). 6,757 e. coli isolates were typed with a biochemical fingerprinting method (the pheneplate) giving the same e. coli diversity in healthy and diarrhoeal calves. thus it was concluded: i) the overall prevalence of diarrhoea was low, but 2 farms had a higher prevalence that could be due to an outbreak situation, ii) salmonella did not seem to be associated with diarrhoea, iii) campylobacter jejuni was common at one of the 2 diarrhoeal farms and iv) etec strains were not found, but k99 antigen was more prevalent in  e. coli strains from diarrhoeal calves than from healthy, as well as more prevalent in one diarrhoeal farm.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance profile of five major food-borne pathogens isolated from beef, pork and poultry.
AB  == this study was performed to evaluate the resistance rate against antimicrobials of food isolates of the five major food-borne pathogens to compare these and to possibly distinguish a pattern. a total of 922 samples of the major meat species  (pork, beef and poultry) were analysed for thermophilic campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica, pathogenic escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes. isolates were subjected to antimicrobial resistance testing by the disc diffusion method. roughly the same overall rate of resistance was identified for thermophilic campylobacter, salmonella and pathogenic e. coli. resistance to  quinolones and tetracycline was determined most frequently. in contrast, food isolates of y. enterocolitica and l. monocytogenes were rarely tested resistant.  the significance of our findings is that resistance rates in enteric bacteria seem to be much higher than in pathogens found in a variety of environments, closely associated to the host environment.

TI  == evidence of an association between use of anti-microbial agents in food animals and anti-microbial resistance among bacteria isolated from humans and the human health consequences of such resistance.
AB  == several lines of evidence indicate that the use of anti-microbial agents in food  animals is associated with anti-microbial resistance among bacteria isolated from humans. the use of anti-microbial agents in food animals is most clearly associated with anti-microbial resistance among salmonella and campylobacter isolated from humans, but also appears likely among enterococci, escherichia coli and other bacteria. evidence is also accumulating that the anti-microbial resistance among bacteria isolated from humans could be the result of using anti-microbial agents in food animals and is leading to human health consequences. these human health consequences include: (i) infections that would  not have otherwise occurred and (ii) increased frequency of treatment failures and increased severity of infection. increased severity of infection includes longer duration of illness, increased frequency of bloodstream infections, increased hospitalization and increased mortality. continued work and research efforts will provide more evidence to explain the connection between the use of anti-microbial agents in food animals and anti-microbial-resistant infections in  humans. one particular focus, which would solidify this connection, is to understand the factors that dictate spread of resistance determinants, especially resistant genes. with continued efforts on the part of the medical, veterinary and public health community, such research may contribute to more precise guidelines on the use of anti-microbials in food animals.

TI  == veterinary use of antimicrobials and emergence of resistance in zoonotic and sentinel bacteria in the eu.
AB  == antimicrobials are essential for treatment of sick animals, but even if used correctly, may eventually lead to antimicrobial resistance. while this represents a potential hazard to humans, the great majority of resistant human pathogens, especially the more important ones, are unrelated to animal sources. a survey of  informed medical opinion suggested that of the human antimicrobial resistance problem, <4% was seen as potentially linked to animal sources. this proportion related largely to zoonotic bacteria which by definition have the capacity to carry resistance between species, although the evidence for resulting harm remains limited. a recent study compared resistance among chicken, pig and cattle isolates of salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli from a series of eu countries. when tested against antimicrobial agents, this survey showed variation of resistance between countries, between hosts and between organisms. such variation may give insight into preferred methods of antimicrobial administration or disease control, but it is clear that the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance induction and dissemination in animals remains complex and is yet to be fully understood.

TI  == effects of postchill application of acidified sodium chlorite to control campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli on commercial broiler carcasses.
AB  == experiments were performed to assess the reduction of campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli in commercial broiler carcasses by postchill dip applications of acidified sodium chlorite. carcass rinses were collected before the inside-outside-bird washer (iobw), post-iobw, postchill, and after the postchill  application of acidified sodium chlorite. prevalence and counts of campylobacter  spp. and e. coli were determined. the mean values for campylobacter spp. and e. coli counts differed significantly at sampling sites. the iobw reduced the bacterial counts significantly in only one experiment. the chiller reduced campylobacter counts significantly in both experiments but failed to significantly reduce the counts of e. coli in one experiment. no major reduction  in the prevalence after enrichment for campylobacter spp. was detected post-iobw  or postchill. however, a significant reduction in campylobacter spp. and in e. coli counts and campylobacter spp. prevalence was seen after the postchill application of acidified sodium chlorite. these results demonstrate that the antimicrobial effect of acidified sodium chlorite applied postchill may be used to significantly reduce campylobacter spp. and e. coli in commercial broiler carcasses. postchill systems may eventually be used in different applications, such as mist, spray, or bath, which could be applied closer to the final stages in processing.

TI  == hexameric assembly of the bifunctional methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase and protein-protein associations in the deoxy-xylulose-dependent pathway of isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis.
AB  == the bifunctional methylerythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase methylerythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase (ispdf) is unusual in that it catalyzes nonconsecutive reactions in the 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate (doxp) pathway of isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis. the crystal structure of ispdf from the bacterial pathogen campylobacter jejuni reveals an elongated hexamer with d3  symmetry compatible with the dimeric 2c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase and trimeric 2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase monofunctional enzymes. complex formation of ispdf with 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol kinase (ispe), the intervening enzyme activity in the pathway, has been observed in solution for the enzymes from c. jejuni and agrobacterium tumefaciens. the monofunctional enzymes (2c-methyl-d-erythritol-4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase, ispe, and 2c-methyl-d-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate synthase) involved in the doxp biosynthetic pathway of escherichia coli also show physical associations. we propose that complex formation of the three enzymes at the core of the doxp pathway can produce an assembly localizing 18 catalytic centers for the early stages of isoprenoid biosynthesis.

TI  == nonimmunized egg yolk powder can suppress the colonization of salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, and campylobacter jejuni in laying hens.
AB  == if colonized, poultry shed enteric pathogens in the feces. of those that colonize poultry salmonella spp., campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni), and escherichia coli (e. coli) o157:h7 are the most concern to the industry. the authors previously discovered that the introduction of 5% dried nonimmunized egg yolk powder in the  regular feed could eliminate and prevent salmonella enteritidis intestinal colonization of laying hens. hence, the efficacy of nonimmunized dried egg yolk powder supplement in controlling the colonization of laying hens with salmonella  typhimurium (s. typhimurium), c. jejuni, and e. coli o157:h7 was investigated in  this study. the 10% (wt/ wt) egg yolk powder eliminated s. typhimurium after 2 wk of feeding and the 5 and 7.5% (wt/wt) supplements significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the frequency of colonization. similarly, 7.5 and 10% egg yolk powder reduced the colonization of c. jejuni and e. coli o157:h7 significantly (p < 0.05) after 1 wk of feeding. in the prevention trial, pathogen-free chickens were fed supplemented feed (10% egg yolk powder) for 4 wk and were then infected. s. typhimurium was prevented from colonizing the intestine throughout the 4-wk test, and e. coli o157:h7 colonization was delayed for 2 wk. c. jejuni and e. coli o157:h7 populations in the intestine were significantly (p < 0.05) suppressed by  egg yolk powder supplementation throughout the test. none of the supplement concentrations affected bw or the mean weight and number of the eggs laid per hen. at the end of the study, the organisms were absent or significantly (p < 0.05) reduced in the intestine, ovary, oviduct, and spleen of hens fed the egg yolk powder treatment. this study indicates that nonimmunized egg yolk powder is  able to reduce the frequency of colonization of foodborne pathogens and prevent these organisms from colonizing the intestinal tract. addition of egg yolk powder to the regular feed at a concentration of 7.5 to 10% (wt/wt) may be a simple means of reducing or inhibiting s. typhimurium, c. jejuni, and e. coli o157:h7 colonization in laying hens.

AB  == objective: to study antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria isolated from food animals in different countries using uniform methodology. methods: samples were taken at slaughter from chickens, pigs and cattle in four eu countries per host. escherichia coli (indicator organism; n = 2118), salmonella spp. (n = 271)  and campylobacter spp. (n = 1325) were isolated in national laboratories and mics tested in a central laboratory against, where appropriate, ampicillin, cefepime,  cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, gentamicin, nalidixic acid, streptomycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. results: isolation rates were high for e. coli, low for salmonella and intermediate for campylobacter. mic results showed resistance prevalence varied among compounds, hosts and countries. for e. coli and salmonella, resistance to newer compounds (cefepime, cefotaxime, ciprofloxacin) was absent or low, but to older compounds (except gentamicin), resistance was variable and higher. e. coli isolates from sweden showed low resistance, whereas among isolates from spain (pigs), resistance to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, tetracycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole was higher; the uk, france, the netherlands, germany, italy and denmark were intermediate. for campylobacter spp. isolates from chickens, nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin resistance was >30% in france and the netherlands, >6% in the uk and zero in sweden. nalidixic acid resistance was  high in cattle (20%-64%), whereas ciprofloxacin resistance was markedly lower in  cattle, variable in pigs (3%-21%) and highest in sweden. generally, campylobacter coli was more resistant than campylobacter jejuni. conclusion: antimicrobial resistance among enteric organisms in food animals varied among countries, particularly for older antimicrobials, but resistance to newer compounds used to  treat disease in humans was generally low.

TI  == heavy rainfall and waterborne disease outbreaks: the walkerton example.
AB  == recent research indicates that excessive rainfall has been a significant contributor to historical waterborne disease outbreaks. the meteorological service of canada, environment canada, provided an analysis and testimony to the  walkerton inquiry on the excessive rainfall events, including an assessment of the historical significance and expected return periods of the rainfall amounts.  while the onset of the majority of the walkerton, ontario, escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter outbreak occurred several days after a heavy rainfall on may 12, the accumulated 5-d rainfall amounts from 8-12 may were particularly significant. these 5-d accumulations could, on average, only be expected once every 60 yr or more in walkerton and once every 100 yr or so in the heaviest rainfall area to the south of walkerton. the significant link between excess rainfall and waterborne disease outbreaks, in conjunction with other multiple risk factors, indicates that meteorological and climatological conditions need to be considered by water managers, public health officials, and private citizens as a significant risk factor for water contamination. a system to identify and project the impacts of such challenging or extreme weather conditions on water supply systems could be developed using a combination of weather/climate monitoring information and weather prediction or quantitative precipitation forecast information. the use of weather monitoring and forecast information or a "wellhead alert system" could alert water system and water supply managers on the potential response of their systems to challenging weather conditions and additional requirements to protect health. similar approaches have recently been  used by beach managers in parts of the united states to predict day-to-day water  quality for beach advisories.

TI  == the crystal structure of a complex of campylobacter jejuni dutpase with substrate analogue sheds light on the mechanism and suggests the "basic module" for dimeric d(c/u)tpases.
AB  == the crystal structure of the dutpase from the important gastric pathogen campylobacter jejuni has been solved at 1.65 a spacing. this essential bacterial  enzyme is the second representative of the new family of dimeric dutpases to be structurally characterised. members of this family have a novel all-alpha fold and are unrelated to the all-beta dutpases of the majority of organisms including eukaryotes such as humans, bacteria such as escherichia coli, archaea like methanococcus jannaschii and animal viruses. therefore, dimeric dutpases can be considered as candidate drug targets. the x-ray structure of the c.jejuni dutpase in complex with the non-hydrolysable substrate analogue dupnhp allows us to define the positions of three catalytically significant phosphate-binding magnesium ions and provides a starting point for a detailed understanding of the  mechanism of dutp/dudp hydrolysis by dimeric dutpases. indeed, a water molecule present in the structure is ideally situated to act as the attacking nucleophile  during hydrolysis. a comparison of the dutpases from c.jejuni and trypanosoma cruzi reveals a common fold with certain distinct features, both in the rigid and mobile domains as defined in the t.cruzi structure. homologues of the c.jejuni dutpase have been identified in several other bacteria and bacteriophages, including the dctpase of phage t4. sequence comparisons of these proteins define  a new superfamily of d(c/u)tpases that includes three distinct enzyme families: (1) dutpases in trypanosomatides, c.jejuni and several other gram-negative bacteria, (2) predicted dutpases in various gram-positive bacteria and their phages, and (3) dctp/dutpases in enterobacterial t4-like phages. all these enzymes share a basic module that consists of two alpha-helices from the rigid domain, two helices from the mobile domain and connecting loops. these results in concert with a number of conserved residues responsible for interdomain cross-talk provide valuable insight towards rational drug design.

AB  == in response to reports that the contamination of food can occur during the on-farm primary phase of food production, we report data that describes a possible cost-effective intervention measure. the effect of time before soil incorporation of livestock wastes spread to land on the rate of decline of zoonotic agents present in the waste was investigated. fresh livestock wastes were inoculated with laboratory-cultured salmonella, listeria, and campylobacter  spp. and escherichia coli o157 before they were spread onto soil. incorporation of the spread wastes was either immediate, delayed for 1 week, or did not occur at all. bacterial decline was monitored over time and found to be significantly more rapid for all waste types when they were left on the soil surface. there were no significant differences in initial bacterial decline rates when wastes were spread in summer or winter. our results indicate that not incorporating contaminated livestock wastes into soil is a potential intervention measure that  may help to limit the spread of zoonotic agents further up the food chain. the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to current advice for livestock waste disposal.

TI  == impact of feathers and feather follicles on broiler carcass bacteria.
AB  == genetically featherless and feathered broiler siblings were used to test the contribution of feathers and feather follicles to the numbers of aerobic bacteria, escherichia coli, and campylobacter in whole-carcass rinse samples taken immediately after carcasses were defeathered for 30 or 60 s. numbers of spoilage bacteria were counted after the same fully processed carcasses were stored for 1 wk at 2 degrees c. in each of 3 replications, twenty-eight 11-wk-old, mixed-sex, genetically featherless or feathered broilers were processed in a laboratory processing facility. immediately after individual defeathering in a mechanical picker, carcasses were sampled using a carcass rinse technique. carcasses were eviscerated, immersion chilled at 2 degrees c for 30 min, individually bagged, and stored for 1 wk at 2 degrees c, after which all carcasses were rinsed again, and spoilage bacteria in the rinsate were enumerated. there were no significant differences (p < or = 0.05) between the featherless and feathered broilers in numbers of aerobic bacteria, e. coli, and campylobacter in rinse samples taken immediately after defeathering and no differences between carcasses picked for 30 or 60 s. there were no differences in numbers of spoilage bacteria after 1 wk of refrigeration for any of the feather presence-picking length combinations. although the defeathering step in poultry processing has been identified as an opportunity for bacterial contamination from the intestinal tract and cross-contamination between carcasses, the presence of feathers and feather follicles does not make a significant difference in carcass  bacterial contamination immediately after defeathering or in spoilage bacteria after 1 wk of refrigeration.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in campylobacter spp., escherichia coli and enterococci  associated with pigs in australia.
AB  == the major influences on the amplification and spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are the therapeutic use of antibiotics in human medicine and their use in livestock for therapy, prophylaxis and growth promotion. the use of veterinary antibiotics has many benefits to the livestock industries ensuring animal health  and welfare, but use at subtherapeutic levels also exerts great selective pressure on emergence of resistant bacteria. the possible effect on human health  is a problem of current debate. this study involved sampling pig carcasses, pig meat and assessing the level of resistance in zoonotic enteric bacteria of concern to human health. in south australian pigs, thermophilic campylobacter species showed widespread resistance (60-100%) to tylosin, erythromycin, lincomycin, ampicillin and tetracycline. no resistance was seen to ciprofloxacin. the enterococci demonstrated little resistance (0-30%) to vancomycin or virginiamycin, but the overall results from the antibiotic sensitivity testing of the enterococci have demonstrated how widespread their resistance has become. escherichia coli strains showed widespread resistance to tetracycline and moderately common resistance (30-60%) to ampicillin and sulphadiazine. resistance to more than one antibiotic was common. pigs from new south wales were also sampled and differences in resistance patterns were noted, perhaps reflecting different antibiotic use regimens in that state.

TI  == incidence of antibiotic resistance in campylobacter jejuni isolated in alberta, canada, from 1999 to 2002, with special reference to tet(o)-mediated tetracycline resistance.
AB  == of 203 human clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni from alberta, canada (1999 to 2002), 101 isolates (50%) were resistant to at least 64 microg of tetracycline/ml, with four isolates exhibiting higher levels of tetracycline resistance (512 microg/ml). in total, the mics for 37% of tetracycline-resistant  isolates (256 to 512 microg/ml) were higher than those previously reported in c.  jejuni (64 to 128 microg/ml). in the tetracycline-resistant clinical isolates, 67% contained plasmids and all contained the tet(o) gene. four isolates resistant to high levels of tetracycline (mic = 512 microg/ml) contained plasmids carrying  the tet(o) gene, which could be transferred to other isolates of c. jejuni. the tetracycline mics for transconjugants were comparable to those of the donors. cloning of tet(o) from the four high-level tetracycline-resistant isolates conferred an mic of 32 microg/ml for escherichia coli dh5alpha. in contrast, transfer to a strain of c. jejuni by using mobilization conferred an mic of 128 microg/ml. dna sequence analysis determined that the tet(o) genes encoding lower  mics (64 to 128 microg/ml) were identical to one other, although the tet(o) genes encoding a 512-microg/ml mic demonstrated several nucleotide substitutions. the quinolone resistance determining region of four ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates  (2%) was analyzed, and resistance was associated with a chromosomal mutation in the gyra gene resulting in a thr-86-ile substitution. in addition, six kanamycin-resistant isolates contained large plasmids that carry the apha-3 marker coding for 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase. resistance to erythromycin was not detected in 203 isolates. in general, resistance to most antibiotics in c. jejuni remains low, except for resistance to tetracycline, which has increased from about 8 to 50% over the past 20 years.

TI  == elimination of viruses, bacteria and protozoan oocysts by slow sand filtration.
AB  == the decimal elimination capacity (dec) of slow sand filters (ssf) for viruses, bacteria and oocysts of cryptosporidium has been assessed from full-scale data and pilot plant and laboratory experiments. dec for viruses calculated from experimental data with ms2-bacteriophages in the pilot plant filters was 1.5-2 log10. e. coli and thermotolerant coliforms (coli44) were removed at full-scale and in the pilot plant with 2-3 log10. at full-scale, campylobacter bacteria removal was 1 log10 more than removal of coli44, which indicated that coli44 was  a conservative surrogate for these pathogenic bacteria. laboratory experiments with sand columns showed 2-3 and >5-6 log10 removal of spiked spores of sulphite-reducing clostridia (ssrc; c. perfringens) and oocysts of cryptosporidium respectively. consequently, ssrc was not a good surrogate to quantify oocyst removal by ssf. removal of indigenous ssrc by full-scale filters  was less efficient than observed in the laboratory columns, probably due to continuous loading of these filter beds with spores, accumulation and retarded transport. it remains to be investigated if this also applies to oocyst removal by ssf. the results additionally showed that the schmutzdecke and accumulation of (in)organic charged compounds in the sand increased the elimination of microorganisms. removal of the schmutzdecke reduced dec for bacteria by +/-2 log10, but did not affect removal of phages. this clearly indicated that, besides biological activity, both straining and adsorption were important removal mechanisms in the filter bed for microorganisms larger than viruses.

TI  == implant therapy following liver transplantation: clinical and microbiological results after 10 years.
AB  == background: the number of immunocompromised patients is increasing as a consequence of successful organ transplantation. placing dental implants in these patients has been questioned because of their increased risk for infections. the  10-year follow-up data of a 71-year-old liver transplant recipient with long-term immunosuppressive therapy is reported. six months after liver transplantation, two interforaminal implants were inserted in the edentulous mandible, and an overdenture using non-rigid telescopic attachments was fabricated 3 months later. methods: oral clinical parameters included the modified plaque index, sulcus fluid flow rate, modified bleeding index, probing depth, distance implant mucosa, attachment level, width of the keratinized mucosa and mobility values. the distance implant bone (dib) was determined on digital panoramic radiographs. the  levels of eight periodontal marker organisms were established using dna probe technology. additionally, swabs of the edentulous oral mucosa were taken for microbiological culture and antimicrobial resistance testing. results: the peri-implant parameters were within normal ranges indicating a stable osseointegration with moderate vertical bone loss. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, tannerella forsythensis, campylobacter rectus, and treponema denticola were not detected. low levels of porphyromonas gingivalis, fusobacterium nucleatum, and eikenella corrodens were found. prevotella intermedia was the only bacterium with a level higher than 10(4). the mucosal swabs indicated the presence of an abundant normal oral flora, including escherichia coli and candida albicans. the antibiogram revealed multiple resistance to antibiotics. conclusion: this case report suggests that immunocompromised patients can be successfully rehabilitated with dental implants.

TI  == microflora ecology of the chicken intestine using 16s ribosomal dna primers.
AB  == the microflora in the gastrointestinal tract of broiler chickens influences digestion, health, and wellbeing. analysis of chicken gut microflora has been mainly by culture-based methods. studies using these techniques have been useful  for identification and analysis of specific groups of bacteria, however, the use  of enrichment medium precludes even relative quantitation of bacterial species. recent advances in ribosomal dna-based molecular techniques make it possible to identify different bacterial populations in environmental samples without cultivation. in this study, the intestinal microflora was examined using 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) targeted probes from bacterial dna isolated from intestinal  and cecal contents of chickens at 4, 14, and 25 d of age. the ribosomal gene sequence was amplified using pcr with universal primers to determine total bacterial dna and specific primers directed at 6 bacterial species: lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli, and  clostridium. the use of universal primers extends these methods to allow determination of relative proportions of different bacterial species. the results indicated that in young chicks the major species present in the small intestines  and ceca was lactobacilli, with a bifidobacteria population becoming more dominant in the ceca at older age. clostridium was detected in some segments of the small intestine in young chicks. in older chickens, salmonella, campylobacter, and e. coli species were found in the ceca. this study has demonstrated the use of molecular techniques for determining relative proportions of bacterial species and monitoring pathogens in the chick gastrointestinal tract.

TI  == chemotaxis-guided movements in bacteria.
AB  == motile bacteria often use sophisticated chemotaxis signaling systems to direct their movements. in general, bacterial chemotactic signal transduction pathways have three basic elements: (1) signal reception by bacterial chemoreceptors located on the membrane; (2) signal transduction to relay the signals from membrane receptors to the motor; and (3) signal adaptation to desensitize the initial signal input. the chemotaxis proteins involved in these signal transduction pathways have been identified and extensively studied, especially in the enterobacteria escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.  chemotaxis-guided bacterial movements enable bacteria to adapt better to their natural habitats via moving toward favorable conditions and away from hostile surroundings. a variety of oral microbes exhibits motility and chemotaxis, behaviors that may play important roles in bacterial survival and pathogenesis in the oral cavity.

TI  == application of oligonucleotide array technology for the rapid detection of pathogenic bacteria of foodborne infections.
AB  == a rapid and accurate method for detection for common pathogenic bacteria in foodborne infections was established by using oligonucleotide array technology. nylon membrane was used as the array support. a mutation region of the 23s rrna gene was selected as the discrimination target from 14 species (genera) of bacteria causing foodborne infections and two unrelated bacterial species. a pair of universal primers was designed for pcr amplification of the 23s rrna gene. twenty-one species (genera)-specific oligonucleotide detection probes were synthesized and spotted onto the nylon membranes. the 23s rrna gene amplification products of 14 species of pathogenic bacteria were hybridized to the oligonucleotide array. hybridization results were analyzed with digoxigenin-linked enzyme reaction. results indicated that nine species of pathogenic bacteria (escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, shigella dysenteriae, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, proteus vulgaris, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium botulinum) showed high sensitivity and specificity for the oligonucleotide array. two other species (salmonella enterica and yersinia enterocolitica) gave weak cross-reaction with e. coli, but  the reaction did not affect their detection. after redesigning the probes, positive hybridization results were obtained with staphylococcus aureus, but not  with clostridium perfringens and streptococcus pyogenes. the oligonucleotide array can also be applied to samples collected in clinical settings of foodborne  infections. the superiority of oligonucleotide array over other tests lies on its rapidity, accuracy and efficiency in the diagnosis, treatment and control of foodborne infections.

AB  == a total of 254 isolates of campylobacter jejuni and three isolates of campylobacter coli, isolated from sweden, canada, and egypt, were screened for kanamycin resistance. eight strains of c. jejuni contained large plasmids that carried the apha-3 kanamycin-resistance marker. in six plasmids, the apha-3 gene  was located downstream of an apparent insertion sequence, designated is607*, which showed a considerable similarity to is607, characterized on the chromosome  of some helicobacter pylori strains. in contrast, the other plasmids carried the  apha-3 gene as a part of a resistance cluster. this included three resistance markers encoding 6'-adenylyltransferase (aade), streptothricin acetyltransferase  (sat), and 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type iii (apha-3). the genetic organization of this resistance cluster suggests that it has been acquired by c.  jejuni from a gram-positive organism. the is607* element was also observed in kanamycin-susceptible strains of c. jejuni on plasmids mediating tetracycline resistance. the kanamycin-resistance phenotype transferred along with tetracycline resistance by conjugation from four representative c. jejuni strains to a recipient strain of c. jejuni. the kanamycin-resistance determinant (apha-3) was stably transferred from one of the four c. jejuni strains to a recipient strain of escherichia coli. however, the c. jejuni plasmid, which also carries the teto gene, was not maintained in e. coli. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed the integration of approximately 50 kb of the plasmid into the chromosome of the e. coli recipient.

AB  == in the nonmevalonate pathway of isoprenoid biosynthesis, the conversion of 2c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate into its cyclic diphosphate proceeds via nucleotidyl intermediates and is catalyzed by the products of the ispd, ispe and  ispf genes. an open reading frame of campylobacter jejuni with similarity to the  ispd and ispf genes of escherichia coli was cloned into an expression vector directing the formation of a 42 kda protein in a recombinant e. coli strain. the  purified protein was shown to catalyze the transformation of 2c-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate into 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol and the conversion of 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol 2-phosphate into  2c-methyl-d-erythritol 2,4-cyclodiphosphate at catalytic rates of 19 micro mol x  mg(-1) x min(-1) and 7 micro mol x mg(-1) x min(-1), respectively. both enzyme-catalyzed reactions require divalent metal ions. the c. jejuni enzyme does not catalyze the formation of 2c-methyl-d-erythritol 3,4-cyclophosphate from 4-diphosphocytidyl-2c-methyl-d-erythritol, a side reaction catalyzed in vitro by  the ispf proteins of e. coli and plasmodium falciparum. comparative genomic analysis show that all sequenced alpha- and epsilon-proteobacteria have fused ispdf genes. these bifunctional proteins are potential drug targets in several human pathogens (e.g. helicobacter pylori, c. jejuni and treponema pallidum).

TI  == helicobacter pylori flgr is an enhancer-independent activator of sigma54-rna polymerase holoenzyme.
AB  == helicobacter pylori flgr activates transcription with sigma54-rna polymerase holoenzyme (sigma54-holoenzyme) from at least five flagellar operons. activators  of sigma54-holoenzyme generally bind enhancer sequences located >70 bp upstream of the promoter and contact sigma54-holoenzyme bound at the promoter through dna  looping to activate transcription. h. pylori flgr lacks the carboxy-terminal dna-binding domain present in most sigma54-dependent activators. as little as 42  bp of dna upstream of the flab promoter and 26 bp of dna sequence downstream of the transcriptional start site were sufficient for efficient flgr-mediated expression from a flab'-'xyle reporter gene in h. pylori, indicating that flgr does not use an enhancer to activate transcription. other examples of sigma54-dependent activators that lack a dna-binding domain include chlamydia trachomatis ctcc and activators from the other chlamydia spp. whose genomes have  been sequenced. flgr from helicobacter hepaticus and campylobacter jejuni, which  are closely related to h. pylori, appear to have carboxy-terminal dna-binding domains, suggesting that the loss of the dna-binding domain from h. pylori flgr occurred after the divergence of these bacterial species. removal of the amino-terminal regulatory domain of flgr resulted in a constitutively active form of the protein that activated transcription from sigma54-dependent genes in escherichia coli. the truncated flgr protein also activated transcription with e. coli sigma54-holoenzyme in an in vitro transcription assay.

TI  == effects of helicobacter pylori on endothelial cell proliferation and chemotaxis.

AB  == aims: in escherichia coli, increased expression of efflux pumps and/or decreased  expression of porins can confer multiple antibiotic resistance (mar), causing resistance to at least three unrelated classes of antibiotics, detergents and dyes. it was hypothesized that in campylobacter jejuni, the efflux systems cmeabc, cmedef and the major outer membrane porin protein, momp (encoded by pora) could confer mar. methods: the expression of cmeb, cmef and pora in 32 mar c. jejuni isolated from humans or poultry was determined by comparative (c)-reverse  transcriptase (rt)-pcr and denaturing dhplc. a further 13 ethidium bromide-resistant isolates and three control strains were also investigated. accumulation of ciprofloxacin+/-carbonyl cyanide-m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (cccp)  was also determined for all strains. results: although resistance to ethidium bromide has been associated with mar, expression of all three genes was similar in the ethidium bromide-resistant isolates. these data indicate that cmeb, cmef and momp play no role in resistance to this agent in c. jejuni. six mar isolates  over-expressed cmeb, 3/32 over-expressed cmeb and cmef. no isolates over-expressed cmef alone. expression of pora was similar in all isolates. all nine isolates that over-expressed cmeb contained a mutation in cmer, substituting glycine 86 with alanine. all cmeb over-expressing isolates also accumulated low concentrations of ciprofloxacin, which were restored to wild-type levels in the presence of cccp. conclusions: these data indicate that over-expression of cmeb is associated with mar in isolates of c. jejuni. however, as cmeb was over-expressed by only one-third (9/32) of mar isolates, these data also indicate other mechanisms of mar in c. jejuni.

TI  == characterization of n-acetylneuraminic acid synthase isoenzyme 1 from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == escherichia coli neunac (n-acetylneuraminic acid) synthase catalyses the condensation of pep (phosphoenolpyruvate) and mannac (n-acetylmannosamine) to form neunac and is encoded by the neub gene. campylobacter jejuni has three neub  genes, one of which is very similar to the e. coli neub gene. we have characterized the c. jejuni neuraminic acid synthase with respect to acylamino sugar specificity and stereochemistry of the pep condensation. we determined the  specificity of c. jejuni neunac synthase for n-acetylmannosamine, n-butanoylmannosamine, n-propionoylmannosamine and n-pentanoylmannosamine. we find that, although this enzyme exhibits similar k(m) values for n-acylmannosamine molecules with different n-acyl groups, the kcat/k(m) values decreased with increasing chain length. neunac synthase is a member of a pep-utilizing family of enzymes that form oxo acids from pep and a monosaccharide. this family includes kdo 8-p (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate) synthase and dah 7-p (2-keto-3-deoxy-d-arabino-heptulosonate 7-phosphate) synthase. both enzymes catalyse the condensation of the re face of the aldehyde group of the monosaccharide with the si face of the pep molecule. the c. jejuni neunac synthase catalysed the condensation of z- and e-[3-2h]pep with mannac, yielding (3s)-3-deutero-neunac and (3r)-3-deutero-neunac respectively. the condensation of z-[3-f]pep and mannac yielded (3s)-3-fluoro-neunac. results of our studies suggest that the c. jejuni neunac synthase, similar to kdo 8-p synthase and dah 7-p synthase, catalyses the condensation of the si face of pep with the aldehyde sugar. the present study is  the first stereochemical analysis of the reaction catalysed by a bacterial neunac synthase.

AB  == aims: to determine the level and mechanism(s) of antimicrobial resistance in campylobacter isolates obtained from human and environmental sources from south canterbury, new zealand. methods and results: a total of 251 campylobacter isolates were tested for susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline using disc diffusion assays. five pig offal isolates were observed to be highly erythromycin resistant, with minimal inhibitory concentrations determined to be >/=256 microg ml(-1). nucleotide sequencing of the 23s ribosomal dna (rdna) in these resistant isolates identified an a --> g change at escherichia coli position 2059 that has been previously implicated in erythromycin resistance in campylobacter coli. macrorestriction profiling using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed these isolates were nonclonal. conclusions: the majority of campylobacter isolates from south canterbury remain  sensitive to the most clinically relevant antimicrobial agents. our results support other reports showing that specific variations in the 23s rdna contribute to erythromycin resistance. significance and impacts of the study: this study defines the baseline frequency of antimicrobial resistance associated with campylobacter isolates from south canterbury, and discusses the likely molecular  mechanisms conferring erythromycin resistance in this organism. resistance to erythromycin in these isolates is not linked to a dominant campylobacter clone and has likely arisen independently in different genetic lines exposed to selective antimicrobial pressure.

TI  == antimicrobial use in agriculture: controlling the transfer of antimicrobial resistance to humans.
AB  == salmonella and campylobacter infections occur commonly in children. some of these infections are severe, requiring treatment with antimicrobial agents. many classes of antimicrobial agents that are used in humans also are used in food animals for growth promotion, disease prevention, and therapy. the use of such antimicrobial agents in food animals increases the likelihood that human bacterial pathogens that have food animal reservoirs, such as salmonella or campylobacter, will develop cross-resistance to drugs approved for use in human medicine. resistance determinants also may be transmitted from food animals to humans through the food supply with bacteria that usually are commensal, such as  escherichia coli and enterococci. clinicians should be aware that antimicrobial resistance is increasing in food-borne pathogens and that patients who are taking antimicrobial agents for any reason are at increased risk for acquiring antimicrobial-resistant food-borne infections. several european countries have demonstrated that restricting the use of antimicrobial agents in food animals can be followed by a decrease in antimicrobial resistance in humans without compromising animal health or significantly increasing the cost of production. appropriate use of antimicrobial agents in humans and food animals is an important factor in maintaining their effectiveness.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among enteric pathogens.
AB  == diarrhea is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in infants and children worldwide. use of antimicrobial therapy in children with bacterial diarrhea involves consideration of advantages and limitations of use of appropriate agents in the general population and in specific hosts. antimicrobial agents for bacterial diarrhea should be prescribed with an appreciation of limitations including antimicrobial resistance. studies from many countries have reported resistance to campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, shigella species, salmonella species, and shiga toxin producing escherichia coli. in many geographic areas of the world including the united states, resistance patterns have demonstrated a consistent increase over the course of time, with resistance  occurring to several classes of antimicrobial agents. resistance patterns are influenced by geographic location, year isolates were obtained, classes of antimicrobial agents, pressure exerted by antimicrobial use, and source of the isolate. because antimicrobial resistance among enteric pathogens is a common finding, has increased over time, and varies by geographic location, constant monitoring of susceptibility patterns is necessary for selection of appropriate antimicrobial agents for therapy when indicated.

TI  == improvement in the detection rate of diarrhoeagenic bacteria in human stool specimens by a rapid real-time pcr assay.
AB  == a rapid laboratory system has been developed and evaluated that can simultaneously identify major diarrhoeagenic bacteria, including salmonella enterica, vibrio parahaemolyticus, campylobacter jejuni and shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, in stool specimens by real-time pcr. specific identification was achieved by using selective taqman probes, detecting two targets in each pathogen. a positive result was scored only when both targets of a pathogen were  amplified and the difference between threshold cycles for detection was less than five. diagnosis of enteric bacterial infections using this highly sensitive method, including dna extraction and real-time pcr, requires only 3 h. forty stool specimens related to suspected food poisoning outbreaks were analysed: 16 (40%) of these samples were found to be positive for diarrhoeagenic bacteria using a conventional culture method; 28 (70%) were positive using the real-time pcr assay. of the 12 pcr-positive but culture-negative cases, 11 patients had consumed pathogen-contaminated or high-risk food. analysis of faecal samples from 105 outpatients who complained of diarrhoea and/or abdominal pain identified 19 (18%) patients as being positive for diarrhoeagenic bacteria using the culture method. an additional six (6%) patients were found to be positive by pcr analysis.

TI  == pathogen-specific risk factors and protective factors for acute diarrheal illness in children aged 12-59 months in sao paulo, brazil.
AB  == diarrheal diseases are a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality in latin america. most studies have focused on infants but not on older children. we enrolled 505 children (age, 12-59 months) with diarrhea and age-matched controls  in a case-control study in sao paulo, brazil. independent risk factors for diarrhea included another household member with diarrhea (matched odds ratio [mor], 8.1; attributable fraction [af], 0.17; p<.001) and consumption of homemade juice (mor, 1.8; af, 0.10; p=.01); protective factors included boiling of the baby bottle or nipple (mor, 0.60; af, 0.19; p=.026), childcare at home (mor, 0.58; af, 0.12; p=.004), and piped sewage (mor, 0.58; af, 0.05; p=.047). hand washing by the caretaker after helping the child defecate protected against shigella infection (mor, 0.35; p<.05). preparation of rice, beans, or soup in the morning and serving it to children after noon were associated with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli infection (mor, 8.0; p<.05). in these poor households, 28% of cases of diarrhea in 1-4-year-old children was attributable to easily modifiable exposures.

TI  == molecular-based identification and typing of campylobacter jejuni and c. coli.
AB  == thermophilic campylobacter spp., mainly campylobacter jejuni and to a lesser extent c. coli are recognized as the most common bacteriological causes of gastroenteritis in humans. as enteric infection with campylobacter organisms cannot be distinguished from that caused by other enteric pathogens, a definitive diagnosis can only be made by isolating or detecting the organism from the feces. the epidemiology of campylobacter enteritis has been complicated by the ubiquitous nature of the organism (commonly found as a commensal in the intestines of domestic animals, in milk, and in water). furthermore, identification is carried out only to genus level by most clinical laboratories.  because of the biochemical similarity known to exist between c. jejuni and c. coli, the hippurate hydrolysis test is often used as the only phenotypic test capable of differentiating the two species. this test, however, has some acknowledged technical limitations and is dependent on inoculum size; results can be difficult to interpret accurately. furthermore, almost all c. jejuni isolates  possess the hippuricase gene, fewer c. jejuni isolates express the hippuricase gene. for this reason, certain polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-based species identification methods, for both c. jejuni and c. coli, and for the other thermophilic species, provide more reliable identification; they also help to highlight mixed species cultures, should they occur. however, even with these methods, false negatives or nonspecifically amplified product(s) can occur in a minority of isolates tested owing to genomic anomalies. thus a second molecular identification method may be required in these circumstances. gonzalez et al. developed a species-specific pcr assay for the identification of c. jejuni and c. coli based on the ceue gene, which is involved in siderophore transport. using this method two primer sets are employed in separate pcr amplification reactions. another method, developed by eyers et al., performs pcr amplification of 23s rrna gene fragments, based on regions specific for c. jejuni, c. coli, c. lari, and c. upsaliensis. in addition, hani and chan developed a pcr assay that detected and amplified the hippuricase gene. this molecular approach may offer a more reliable means of identifying c. jejuni strains compared with the phenotypic hippurate hydrolysis test alone.

TI  == microbial contamination of drinking water and disease outcomes in developing regions.
AB  == drinking water is a major source of microbial pathogens in developing regions, although poor sanitation and food sources are integral to enteric pathogen exposure. gastrointestinal disease outcomes are also more severe, due to under-nutrition and lack of intervention strategies in these regions. poor water  quality, sanitation and hygiene account for some 1.7 million deaths a year world-wide (3.1% of all deaths and 3.7% of all daly's), mainly through infectious diarrhoea. nine out of 10 such deaths are in children and virtually all of the deaths are in developing countries. major enteric pathogens in these children include: rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp. and vibrio cholerae o1, and possibly enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp. v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile and cryptosporidium parvum. all except the latter are easily control by chlorination of water, but recontamination of treated water is  a huge problem. emerging environmental pathogens, such as helicobacter pylori and burkholderia pseudomallei, may well be of significance in some regions. in adults, much less is understood of various sequellae such as myocarditis, diabetes, reactive arthritis and cancers some months-years after initial infections. so in addition to the traditional pathogens (helminths, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia hepatitis a and e) various enteroviruses, c. jejuni  and h. pylori are emerging issues in adults.

TI  == molecular characterization of class 1 integrons from irish thermophilic campylobacter spp.
AB  == objectives: in this study a large random collection (n = 378) of irish thermophilic campylobacter isolates were investigated for the presence of integrons, genetic elements associated with the dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. methods: purified genomic dna from each isolate was analysed by pcr for the presence of class 1 integrons. four gene cassette-associated amplicons were completely characterized. results: sixty-two of the isolates possessed a complete class 1 integron with a recombined gene cassette located within a 1.0 kb amplicon containing an aada2 gene. this cassette was present in both campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli isolates and following sequence analysis was shown to be similar to sequences recently reported in salmonella enterica hadar and on an 85 kb plasmid conferring quinolone resistance in escherichia coli. conclusions: aminoglycoside aada2-encoding class 1 integrons were identified among unrelated campylobacter spp. amino acid sequence comparisons revealed identical structures in both salmonella and e. coli. the presence of class 1 integrons in campylobacter spp. may be significant should these organisms enter the food chain and especially when antimicrobial treatment  for severe infections is being considered.

TI  == helicobacter pylori interacts with the human single-domain trefoil protein tff1.
AB  == why helicobacter pylori colonizes only gastric tissue is unknown. it is found on  gastric mucus-secreting cells and in the overlying gastric mucus but not deep in  gastric glands. this localization mirrors the expression of trefoil factor 1, tff1. we hypothesized that h. pylori interacting with tff1 could explain the tropism of this bacteria for gastric tissue. recombinant human tff1 expressed in  escherichia coli was purified by affinity chromatography, ion-exchange chromatography, and gel filtration. binding of h. pylori was assessed by using flow cytometry and the biacore system, which allows real-time monitoring of molecular interactions. in flow cytometry, h. pylori bound to the tff1 dimer, but campylobacter jejuni strains and the laboratory strain of e. coli, hb101, did not bind. when the biacore system was used, h. pylori bound strongly to tff1-coated dextran chips compared with uncoated chips. binding was inhibited by a tff1 monoclonal antibody and by soluble tff1. h. pylori bound to porcine gastric mucin only if it was pretreated with tff1. in conclusion, h. pylori interacts avidly with the dimeric form of tff1, and this interaction enables binding to gastric mucin, suggesting that tff1 may act as a receptor for the organism in vivo. this  interaction may underline the previously unexplained tropism of this organism for gastric tissue and its colocalization with the gastric mucin muc5ac.

TI  == microbiological and metal contamination of watercress in the wellington region, new zealand--2000 survey.
AB  == objectives: to investigate potential microbiological and metal contamination of watercress and to assess the public health risks associated with harvesting and consumption of watercress. method: during march and april 2000, samples were taken from 11 known or potential watercress collection sites in the wellington region. microbiological testing included bacterial counts for presumptive and faecal coliforms (watercress); total coliforms (growing water); and escherichia coli (e. coli) and presence/absence tests for campylobacter species (growing water and watercress). watercress concentrations of a range of metals were also measured. results: all of the sites showed significant levels of e. coli in samples of both watercress and water. the e. coli levels in water were well above recommended freshwater recreational contact safety guidelines at most sites. campylobacter was detected in the growing waters at all sites (80% of the samples) and in 11% of the watercress samples. mean metal concentrations in watercress did not exceed the nz food regulations (1984) levels at any of the sites. however, lead concentrations at the urban sites and one of the semi-urban  sites would have exceeded the new australia new zealand food standards code maximum levels (2003). conclusions and implications: the consumption of raw watercress contaminated with enteric pathogens could potentially cause serious gastrointestinal illness (e.g. campylobacteriosis) and people gathering watercress could also be at risk of infection from contact with contaminated surface waters.

TI  == relationship of campylobacter isolated from poultry and from darkling beetles in  new zealand.
AB  == campylobacter, a foodborne pathogen closely associated with poultry, is considered to be an important agent of human gastroenteritis in new zealand. the  pathways involved in the contamination of poultry flocks remain unclear; however, many vectors, such as insects, rodents, and wild birds, have been implicated. infestation of poultry houses by insects, particularly darkling beetles (alphitobius diaperinus), is difficult to control. furthermore, darkling beetles  are known vectors for a variety of pathogens that include salmonella, infectious  bursal disease virus, aspergillus, escherichia coli, and marek's disease virus. in this investigation, the relationship between darkling beetles and campylobacter contamination of poultry flocks was investigated. a new zealand breeder flock and four of its progeny broiler flocks were included in the study.  samples of beetles and of intestinal excreta of the birds were cultured for the presence of campylobacter spp. a subset of the recovered isolates was subsequently genotyped using flaa short variable region (svr) dna sequence analysis. a large number of campylobacter subtypes were isolated, indicating that campylobacter colonization of poultry is likely to arise from a number of different reservoirs. however, a set of genetically distinct isolates were found  to be common to the broiler flocks and to the beetles. this research provides data that indicates that alphitobius diaperinus may serve as a source of campylobacter contamination of poultry. a more thorough understanding of the relationship between beetle infestation and the campylobacter status of poultry flocks should enable progress in further development of biosecurity control measures.

AB  == anti-gm(1) antibodies of the immunoglobulin m (igm) isotype are normal components of the antibody repertoire of adult human serum. using a sensitive high-performance thin-layer chromatography (hptlc) immunostaining assay, we found that these antibodies were absent in the umbilical vein and children <1 month of  age but could be detected after 1 month of age. although most of the children older than 6 months of age were positive, there were still a few negative children. the appearance of anti-gm(1) igm antibodies showed a perfect concordance with two well-characterized antibacterial antibodies, anti-forssman and anti-blood group a, which indicates a similar origin. we also studied igm reactivity with lipopolysaccharides (lpss) from gram-negative bacteria isolated from stool samples from healthy babies and from escherichia coli hb101 in serum from individuals of different ages. we found a positive reaction with both lpss in all the children more than 1 month of age analyzed, even in those that were negative for anti-gm(1) antibodies. anti-gm(1) igm antibodies were purified from  adult serum by affinity chromatography and tested for the ability to bind lpss from different bacteria. this highly specific preparation showed reactivity only  with lps from a strain of campylobacter jejuni isolated from a patient with diarrhea. we conclude that normally occurring igm antibodies are generated after  birth, probably during the immune defense against specific bacterial strains.

AB  == recent reports have contained conflicting results on the relationship between antecedent haemophilus influenzae infection and guillain-barre syndrome (gbs). to investigate the prevalence of h. influenzae infection in gbs patients in a british population, we carried out a retrospective study with 62 consecutive gbs  patients and 63 normal controls of similar age and sex. whole bacteria of both encapsulated and nonencapsulated strains of h. influenzae were employed as antigens in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) for anti-h. influenzae igg, igm and iga antibodies. elevated antibodies of two or three classes were found in one gbs patient and none in the normal controls. six gbs patients had igg antibodies against nonencapsulated h. influenzae compared with only one in the normal control group (p=0.06). western blot for igg antibody showed that all  the sera with igg antibodies recognized the lipopolysaccharide (lps) of both strains of h. influenzae. antiganglioside gm1 antibody was not associated with anti-h. influenzae antibody in our study. absorption with encapsulated or nonencapsulated h. influenzae, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli before testing on western blot showed that only nonencapsulated h. influenzae absorbed the anti-lps antibodies. in conclusion, there is a possible but rare association  of gbs with nonencapsulated h. influenzae in the uk.

TI  == construction of replicative and integrative plasmids for setting up the in vivo expression technology in helicobacter pylori.
AB  == some pathogenic factors of helicobacter pylori, a bacterium involved in peptic ulcer and gastric cancer, have already been identified using either global or particular approach, but there are still some orphan genes and unidentified pathogenic factors. one of the methods used successfully for the identification of virulence genes of many pathogens is the in vivo expression technology. we describe here the construction and sequences of three different plasmids, one integrative and two replicatives, for the identification of virulence genes by using in vivo expression technology in h. pylori, and of potential use in other bacteria such as campylobacter spp. moreover, the use of the green fluorescent protein could allow to classify the genes according to the strength of their expression and to identify those which are repressed upon interaction with gastric mucosa.

TI  == die-off of enteric bacterial pathogens during mesophilic anaerobic digestion.
AB  == conventionally treated sewage sludge may contain high concentrations of potentially pathogenic microorganisms and additional treatment is required to minimise the risks to health if it is to be recycled to agricultural land. mesophilic anaerobic digestion (mad) is the most widely used process in the uk for stabilising sludge prior to agricultural recycling, but little is known about the fate of a number of enteric pathogens as the sludge passes through the treatment processes. the aim of this study was to determine the efficiency of mad in removing the bacterial enteric pathogens, salmonella senftenberg, listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni which were added as a spike to the digester feedstock, together with the die-off of indigenous escherichia coli already present in the sludge. the primary sludge digestion stage of mad was found to achieve a log removal of 1.66 for e. coli, 2.23 for l. monocytogenes and 2.23 for s. senftenberg. however, the extent of die-off was a function of the numbers of pathogens in the feed and as these increased the log removal also increased. the numbers of c. jejuni were not affected by primary sludge digestion. additional die-off was provided by secondary sludge digestion with log removals of 1.70 for e. coli, 2.10 for s. senftenberg and 0.36 for c. jejuni.

TI  == detection of pcr amplicons from bacterial pathogens using microsphere agglutination.
AB  == for rapid and inexpensive detection of polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplicons, a novel microsphere agglutination assay has been developed. pcr is carried out using biotinylated forward and reverse primers, and the amplified dna fragments are able to agglutinate streptavidin-coated microspheres (5.7 microm in diameter). purification of pcr amplicons is unnecessary when initial primer concentrations are 250 nm. agglutination can be identified visually within 2 min  without any additional equipment or reagents. using listeriolysin (lisa)-specific biotinylated primers, we have successfully detected and identified listeria monocytogenes lisa+ cells among salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157:h7 cells. the simplicity of this protocol considerably reduces the time and cost of diagnostic pcr experiments. this procedure is potentially useful for various studies and field applications.

TI  == emergence of variants with altered survival properties in stationary phase cultures of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == during the stationary phase of campylobacter jejuni nctc 11351 viable numbers fluctuate in a characteristic fashion. after reaching the maximum cell count (ca. 2 x 10(9) cfu/ml) in early stationary phase (denoted phase 1), viable numbers subsequently decrease to about 10(6) cfu/ml after 48 h and then increase again to about 10(8) cfu/ml (denoted phase 2) before decreasing once more to a value intermediate between the previous maximum and minimum values. to investigate whether the increase in viable numbers following the initial decline was due to the emergence of a new strain with a growth advantage in stationary phase analogous to the 'gasp' phenotype described in escherichia coli [science 259 (1993) 1757], we conducted mixed culture experiments with cells from the original culture and antibiotic-resistant marked organisms isolated from the re-growth phase. in many experiments of this type, strains isolated from phase 2 failed to  out-compete the original strain and we have thus been unable to demonstrate a convincing gasp phenotype. however, strains isolated from phase 2 showed a much lower rate of viability loss in early stationary phase and a small increase in resistance to aeration, peroxide challenge and heat, indicating that the emergent strain was different from the parent. these results support the view that dynamic population changes occur during the stationary phase of c. jejuni that may play a role in the survival of this organism.

AB  == a total of 407 samples of bulk-tank milk (344 of goat's milk and 63 of ewe's milk) collected from 403 different farms throughout switzerland, was examined. the number of farms investigated in this study represents 8% of the country's dairy-goat and 15% of its dairy-sheep farms. standard plate counts and enterobacteriaceae counts were performed on each sample. furthermore, the prevalence of staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter spp., shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, salmonella spp., and mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis  was studied. the median standard plate count for bulk-tank milk from small ruminants was 4.70 log cfu/ml (4.69 log cfu/ml for goat's milk and 4.78 log cfu/ml for ewe's milk), with a minimum of 2.00 log cfu/ml and a maximum of 8.64 log cfu/ml. enterobacteriaceae were detected in 212 (61.6%) goat's milk and 45 (71.4%) ewe's milk samples, whereas s. aureus was detected in 109 (31.7%) samples of goat's milk and 21 (33.3%) samples of ewe's milk. campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. were not isolated from any of the samples. however, 16.3% of the  goat's milk and 12.7% of the ewe's milk samples were polymerase chain reaction (pcr)-positive for shiga toxin-producing e. coli. seventy-nine (23.0%) goat's tank-milk and 15 (23.8%) ewe's tank-milk samples were pcr-positive for insertion  sequence 900, providing presumptive evidence for the presence of m. avium ssp. paratuberculosis. these results form the basis for determining the microbiological quality standards for goat's and ewe's milk. moreover, the data presented form part of the risk assessment program for raw milk from small ruminants in switzerland.

TI  == feob is not required for ferrous iron uptake in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == among strains of campylobacter jejuni, levels of ferrous iron (fe2+) uptake was comparable. however, c. jejuni showed a lower level of ferrous iron uptake than escherichia coli. consistent with studies of e. coli, fe2+ uptake in c. jejuni was significantly enhanced by low mg2+ concentration. the c. jejuni genome sequence contains a single known ferrous iron uptake gene, feob, whose product shares 50% amino acid identity to helicobacter pylori feob and 29% identity to e. coli feob. however, fe2+ uptake could not be attributed to feob for several reasons. site-directed mutations in feob caused no defect in 55fe2+ uptake. among c. jejuni strains, various nucleotide alterations were found in feob, indicating  that some c. jejuni feob genes are defective. in addition, uptake could not be attributed to the magnesium transporter cora, since no reduction in 55fe2+ uptake was observed in the presence of a cora-specific inhibitor.

TI  == presence of campylobacter inthe respiratory tract of broiler carcasses before and after commercial scalding.
AB  == campylobacter could be detected in the thoraco-abdominal cavity of broiler carcasses even if they were carefully eviscerated by hand with no evidence of intestinal rupture or leakage. if campylobacter is present in the air sacs, which are unavoidably torn during evisceration, it could contaminate the thoraco-abdominal cavity of the eviscerated carcass. this study was done to determine if campylobacter contamination is present in the respiratory tract of broilers prior to evisceration. whole carcass rinses and respiratory tract washes were done on broiler carcasses collected at a commercial processing plant just before and just after scalding. samples were cultured for presence and numbers of campylobacter, escherichia coli, coliforms, and total aerobic bacteria. campylobacter isolates were subtyped by sequencing the short variable region of the flaa gene. the same subtypes of campylobacter were detected in whole carcass  rinse samples as in respiratory tract wash samples from individual broilers. furthermore, the same numbers and subtypes of campylobacter were recovered from respiratory tracts of carcasses collected before scalding and those collected after scalding. however, respiratory tracts of carcasses after scalding had higher numbers of e. coli, coliforms, and total aerobic bacteria than those tested before scalding. although some bacterial counts were higher in the respiratory tracts of carcasses after scalding, campylobacter counts were not. it appears that campylobacter is present in the respiratory tracts of broilers as they enter processing, and contamination may be due to airborne bacteria during production or transport.

TI  == serotypes, virulence genes, and intimin types of shiga toxin (verotoxin)-producing escherichia coli isolates from human patients: prevalence in lugo, spain, from 1992 through 1999.
AB  == we have analyzed the prevalence of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec)  in stool specimens of patients with diarrhea or other gastrointestinal alterations from the xeral-calde hospital of lugo city (spain). stec strains were detected in 126 (2.5%) of 5,054 cases investigated, with a progressive increase in the incidence from 0% in 1992 to 4.4% in 1999. stec o157:h7 was isolated in 24 cases (0.5%), whereas non-o157 stec strains were isolated from 87 patients (1.7%). stec strains were (after salmonella and campylobacter strains) the third  most frequently recovered enteropathogenic bacteria. a total of 126 human stec isolates were characterized in this study. pcr showed that 43 (34%) isolates carried stx(1) genes, 45 (36%) possessed stx(2) genes and 38 (30%) carried both stx(1) and stx(2). a total of 88 (70%) isolates carried an ehxa enterohemolysin gene, and 70 (56%) isolates possessed an eae intimin gene (27 isolates with type  gamma1, 20 with type beta1, 8 with type zeta, 5 with type gamma2, and 3 with type epsilon). stec isolates belonged to 41 o serogroups and 66 o:h serotypes, including 21 serotypes associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome and 30 new serotypes not previously reported among human stec strains in other studies. although the 126 stec isolates belonged to 81 different seropathotypes (associations between serotypes and virulence genes), only four accounted for 31% of isolates. seropathotype o157:h7 stx(1) stx(2) eae-gamma1 ehxa was the most common (13 isolates) followed by o157:h7 stx(2) eae-gamma1 ehxa (11 isolates), o26:h11 stx(1) eae-beta1 ehxa (11 isolates), and o111:h- stx(1) stx(2) eae-gamma2 ehxa (4 isolates). our results suggest that stec strains are a significant cause  of human infections in spain and confirm that in continental europe, infections caused by stec non-o157 strains are more common than those caused by o157:h7 isolates. the high prevalence of stec strains (both o157:h7 and non-o157 strains) in human patients, and their association with serious complications, strongly supports the utilization of protocols for detection of all serotypes of stec in spanish clinical microbiology laboratories.

AB  == the multianalyte array biosensor (maab) is a rapid analysis instrument capable of detecting multiple analytes simultaneously. rapid (15-min), single-analyte sandwich immunoassays were developed for the detection of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, with a detection limit of 8 x 10(4) cfu/ml; the limit of detection was improved 10-fold by lengthening the assay protocol to 1 h. s. enterica serovar typhimurium was also detected in the following spiked foodstuffs, with minimal sample preparation: sausage, cantaloupe, whole liquid egg, alfalfa sprouts, and chicken carcass rinse. cross-reactivity tests were performed with escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni. to determine whether the maab has potential as a screening tool for the diagnosis of asymptomatic salmonella infection of poultry, chicken excretal samples from a private, noncommercial farm and from university poultry facilities were tested. while the  private farm excreta gave rise to signals significantly above the buffer blanks,  none of the university samples tested positive for s. enterica serovar typhimurium without spiking; dose-response curves of spiked excretal samples from university-raised poultry gave limits of detection of 8 x 10(3) cfu/g.

AB  == in this study, we describe the isolation of laribacter hongkongensis, a recently  described genus and species of bacterium, in pure culture on charcoal cefoperazone deoxycholate agar from the stool of six patients with diarrhea. three patients were residents of hong kong, and three of switzerland. in none of  the stool samples obtained from these six patients was salmonella, shigella, enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, vibrio, aeromonas, plesiomonas, or campylobacter recovered. rotavirus antigen detection, electron microscopic examination for viruses, and microscopic examinations for ova and cysts were all  negative for the stool samples obtained from the three patients in hong kong. enterotoxigenic e. coli was recovered from one of the patients in hong kong. unlike l. hongkongensis type strain hku1, all the six strains were motile with bipolar flagellae. sequencing of the 16s ribosomal rna genes of the six strains showed that they all had sequences with only 0-2 base differences to that of the  type strain. pulsed field gel electrophoresis of the spei digested genomic dna of the six isolates and that of the type strain revealed that the seven isolates were genotypically unrelated strains. more extensive epidemiologic studies should be carried out to ascertain the causative association between l. hongkongensis and diarrhea and to define the reservoir and modes of transmission of l. hongkongensis.

TI  == [acute diarrhea in children less than 3 years of age: enteropathogens isolated in patient's stools, compared with a control group]
AB  == objectives: to observe the occurrence of different etiological agents of acute diarrhea (ad) in stool specimens of patients and children in a control group. material and methods: 100 children less than three years of age with ad were studied as well as 100 controls, between november 1993 and may 1994. stool specimens were collected in both groups and the following enteropathogens were searched for: rotavirus, escherichia coli (epec, etec, eiec, ehec), salmonella sp, shigella sp, campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium sp, giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica. statistical analysis using the exact fisher test (at significance level p<0,05) was done. the mean age was 12,5 months, with more cases in patients less than 6 months (35%). children were seen at the emergency section on an average fifth day after the start of the diarrhea. most came from homes with basical sanitary conditions. watery diarrhea was more frequent than bloody diarrhea with mucus, at a proportion of 4:1. results: rotavirus was the most frequent agent: 21% in the ad group and 3% in the control group (p= 0,0001). shigella sp was isolated in 7%  of the ad group and none of the control group (p= 0,0140). epec was detected in 13% of ad cases and 7% in the control group (p= 0,2381) but the classical subgroups o55, o111, o119 were only isolated from the patients with ad. the other enteropathogens were infrequently detected or in equal proportion in both groups. rotavirus and epec were the more frequently isolated agents in watery diarrhea, while shigella sp was the predominant agent found in bloody stools with mucus. conclusions: rotavirus was the most common causative agent in ad. the detection of rotavirus and shigella sp nearly exclusively in patients with ad confirms the  high patogenicity of these etiological agents when compared to the others. escherichia coli (epec) diagnosed by polyvalent sera does not confirm its respective diarrheogenic property due to isolation in the same proportion among patients with ad and controls. monovalent antisera made possible the detection of classical subgroups of epec o111, o119, o55 isolated only from ad patients, confirming the already known high patogenicity of these strains.

TI  == antagonistic activities of several bacteria on in vitro growth of 10 strains of campylobacter jejuni/coli.
AB  == chicken meat contaminated with campylobacter jejuni can be the source of human enteritis. to decrease the risk of human infection, campylobacter should be controlled at farm levels. orally given probiotic bacteria could prevent colonisation of chicken with pathogenic bacteria like campylobacter. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of different bacteria on campylobacter growth. our results demonstrated that bacteria isolated from conventional chicken had potential inhibitory activities against campylobacter. other bacteria not isolated from chickens but with known antagonistic capacities, e.g. enterococcus  (56 strains) and escherichia coli (20 strains), did not show any negative effect  on campylobacter. interestingly, one lactobacillus (p93) strain isolated from the chicken gut showed bactericidal activity against all tested campylobacter. the bactericidal effect was characterised as the production of organic acids in combination with probably production of an anti-campylobacter protein. in a co-culture study of campylobacter and lactobacillus (p93), the culturability of campylobacter was under the detection limit after 48 h of incubation. a chicken experiment is needed to further evaluate the effect of the promising probiotic bacteria against campylobacter colonisation in chicken.

TI  == functional refolding of the campylobacter jejuni momp (major outer membrane protein) porin by groel from the same species.
AB  == functional and structural studies of outer membrane proteins from gram-negative bacteria are frequently carried out using refolded proteins. recombinant proteins are produced in escherichia coli as inclusion bodies and then tediously refolded  by dilution in buffered detergent solutions. in the present work, we obtained the refolding of momp (major outer membrane protein) from campylobacter assisted by the molecular chaperone groel. refolded momp recovered its native pore-forming activity when reconstituted in planar lipid bilayers. both proteins were purified from the campylobacter jejuni strain 85h. the purity of groel was assessed by silver staining and ms. its native ultrastructure was observed by the use of transmission electron microscopy. denaturation of momp was performed in urea at 65 degrees c followed by dialysis against 100 mm acetic acid, and was assessed by cd analysis. momp refolding reached a maximum efficiency in the presence of groel (at a momp/groel molar ratio of 9:1) and atp. under these conditions, 95% of denatured momp was refolded after a 15 min incubation. this approach represents an alternative method in studies of membrane protein refolding.

TI  == does the use of antibiotics in food animals pose a risk to human health? a critical review of published data.
AB  == the use of antibiotics in food animals selects for bacteria resistant to antibiotics used in humans, and these might spread via the food to humans and cause human infection, hence the banning of growth-promoters. the actual danger seems small, and there might be disadvantages to human and to animal health. the  low dosages used for growth promotion are an unquantified hazard. although some antibiotics are used both in animals and humans, most of the resistance problem in humans has arisen from human use. resistance can be selected in food animals,  and resistant bacteria can contaminate animal-derived food, but adequate cooking  destroys them. how often they colonize the human gut, and transfer resistance genes is not known. in zoonotic salmonellosis, resistance may arise in animals or humans, but human cross-infection is common. the case of campylobacter infection  is less clear. the normal human faecal flora can contain resistant enterococci, but indistinguishable strains in animals and man are uncommon, possibly because most animal enterococci do not establish themselves in the human intestine. there is no correlation between the carriage of resistant enterococci of possible animal origin and human infection with resistant strains. commensal escherichia coli also exhibits host-animal preferences. anti-gram-positive growth promoters would be expected to have little effect on most gram-negative organisms. even if  resistant pathogens do reach man, the clinical consequences of resistance may be  small. the application of the 'precautionary principle' is a non-scientific approach that assumes that risk assessments will be carried out.

TI  == effects of replacement finisher feed and length of feed withdrawal on broiler carcass yield and bacteria recovery.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the effects of a replacement finisher feed (rf) on carcass yield and carcass bacteria recovery. rf is a commercial formulation of a d-glucose polymer (maltodextrin) with added salts and vitamins.  commercial male broilers (41 d of age) were given either rf or control-feed (traditional starter feed) for 8 h, followed by feed withdrawal for 0, 4, 8, or 12 h before processing. during processing, whole carcass rinses (wcr) of pre-eviscerated (feathers, feet, and heads removed) and eviscerated carcasses were analyzed for recovery of bacteria. body weight at initiation of feed withdrawal (catch weight) or at slaughter (dock weight) did not differ significantly due to type of feed. live shrink, as a percentage of live weight, increased significantly with time off feed. birds fed rf exhibited significantly  lower live shrink than the birds fed the control feed at 8 and 12 h after feed withdrawal. this difference between types of feed, rf or control, was approximately 0.1% per hour of feed withdrawal. type of feed or length of feed withdrawal did not affect campylobacter, coliform, or escherichia coli counts recovered from wcr of pre-eviscerated or eviscerated carcasses. these data demonstrate that feeding rf to broilers for 8 h before initiation of feed withdrawal may reduce live shrink without affecting carcass campylobacter, coliforms, or e. coli recovered.

AB  == the epidemiology, clinical features, nutritional status, and causative agents of  diarrhea were studied in 289 bangladeshi children (147 boys and 142 girls) 2-5 years old. the use of improved diagnostic tests for amebiasis enabled for the first time analysis of the contribution of entamoeba histolytica to total diarrheal illness in this community setting. the average incidence rate of diarrhea was 1.8/child-year, and the average number of diarrheal days was 3.7 days/child-year over an average observation period of 2.8 years/child. seventy-five percent of the diarrheal episodes were < or = 2 days in duration. persistent diarrhea was relatively uncommon (0.2% of the children) and chronic diarrhea was observed in only one episode. compared with malnourished and/or stunted children, better-nourished children experienced significantly fewer diarrheal episodes. the diarrheal incidence rate for children with blood group a  was significantly less that that of the children with blood groups o and ab. the  most frequent bacterial enteropathogens isolated from diarrheal stool specimens were enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (9%) and aeromonas species (9%), followed by plesimonas shigelloides (4%) and shigella flexneri (3.8%). rotavirus was the most common viral agent isolated from diarrheal stool samples (5%). giardia lamblia, cryptosporidium parvum, and e. histolytica were identified in 11%, 8.4%, and 8%, respectively, of the diarrheal stool specimens. dysentery was observed in 7.7% of all diarrheal episodes. the most common pathogens isolated from dysenteric stool were s. flexneri (11.6%), aeromonas sp. (10%), e. histolytica (8.7%), campylobacter jejunii (5.8%), p. shigelloides (4.3%), and a. caviae (4.3%). the overall incidence rate of e. histolytica-associated diarrhea was 0.08/child-year. visible blood and hemoccult test-detected blood loss was found in 7% and 25%, respectively, of cases of e. histolytica-associated diarrhea. children who had recovered from a diarrheal episode with e. histolytica, but not  e. dispar, had half the chance of developing subsequent e. histolytica-associated diarrhea, consistent with the development of species-specific acquired immunity.  in conclusion, the use of modern diagnostic tests demonstrated that e. histolytica contributed to overall morbidity from diarrheal illness. understanding the etiology, frequency, and consequences of acute diarrhea in children from a developing country should aid in the design of interventions to improve child health.

TI  == cost-effectiveness of a targeted disinfection program in household kitchens to prevent foodborne illnesses in the united states, canada, and the united kingdom.
AB  == foodborne illnesses impose a substantial economic and quality-of-life burden on society by way of acute morbidity and chronic sequelae. we developed an economic  model to evaluate the potential cost-effectiveness of a disinfection program that targets high-risk food preparation activities in household kitchens. for the united states, canada, and the united kingdom, we used published literature and expert opinion to estimate the cost of the program (excluding the educational component); the number of cases of salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli o157:h7 infections prevented; and the economic and quality-of-life outcomes. in our primary analysis, the model estimated that approximately 80,000 infections could be prevented annually in u.s. households, resulting in 138 million dollars  in direct medical cost savings (e.g., physician office visits and hospitalizations avoided), 15,845 quality-adjusted life-years (qalys) gained, 788 million dollars in program costs, and a favorable cost-effectiveness ratio of 41,021 dollars/qaly gained. results were similar for households in canada and the united kingdom (21,950 dollars can/qaly gained and 86,341 pounds sterling/qaly gained, respectively). when we evaluated implementing the program only in u.s. households with high-risk members (those less than 5 years of age, greater than 65 years of age, or immunocompromised), the cost-effectiveness ratio was more favorable (10,163 dollars/qaly gained). results were similar for high-risk households in canada and the united kingdom (1,915 dollars can/qaly gained and 28,158 pounds sterling/qaly gained, respectively). implementing a targeted disinfection program in household kitchens in the united states, canada, and the  united kingdom appears to be a cost-effective strategy, falling within the range  generally considered to warrant adoption and diffusion (<100,000 dollars/qaly gained).

TI  == purification and properties of the formate dehydrogenase and characterization of  the fdha gene of sulfurospirillum multivorans.
AB  == the soluble periplasmic subunit of the formate dehydrogenase fdha of the tetrachloroethene-reducing anaerobe sulfurospirillum multivorans was purified to  apparent homogeneity and the gene ( fdha) was identified and sequenced. the purified enzyme catalyzed the oxidation of formate with oxidized methyl viologen  as electron acceptor at a specific activity of 1683 nkat/mg protein. the apparent molecular mass of the native enzyme was determined by gel filtration to be about  100 kda, which was confirmed by the fdha nucleotide sequence. fdha encodes for a  pre-protein that differs from the truncated mature protein by an n-terminal 35-amino-acid signal peptide containing a twin arginine motif. the amino acid sequence of fdha revealed high sequence similarities to the larger subunits of the formate dehydrogenases of campylobacter jejuni, wolinella succinogenes, escherichia coli (fdhn, fdhh, fdho), and methanobacterium formicicum. according to the nucleotide sequence, fdha harbors one fe(4)/s(4) cluster and a selenocysteine residue as well as conserved amino acids thought to be involved in the binding of a molybdopterin guanidine dinucleotide cofactor.

TI  == duplex real-time sybr green pcr assays for detection of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in stools.
AB  == a duplex real-time sybr green lightcycler pcr (lc-pcr) assay with dna extraction  using the qiaamp dna stool mini kit was evaluated with regard to detection of 8 of 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens in five stool specimens in 2 h or  less. the protocol used the same lc-pcr with 20 pairs of specific primers. the products formed were identified based on a melting point temperature (t(m)) curve analysis. the 17 species of food- or waterborne pathogens examined were enteroinvasive escherichia coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, salmonella spp., shigella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, vibrio parahaemolyticus, vibrio vulnificus, aeromonas spp., staphylococcus aureus, clostridium perfringens, and bacillus cereus. no interference with the lc-pcr assay was observed when stool specimens were artificially inoculated with each bacterial species. the detection levels were approximately 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of  stool. the protocol for processing stool specimens for less than 10(4) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g of stool requires an overnight enrichment step to achieve adequate sensitivity. however, the rapid amplification and reliable detection of specific genes of greater than 10(5) food- or waterborne pathogenic bacteria per g in samples should facilitate the diagnosis and management of food- or waterborne outbreaks.

TI  == bacterial recovery from breast skin of genetically feathered and featherless broiler carcasses immediately following scalding and picking.
AB  == genetically feathered and featherless sibling broilers selected for matched bw were killed, scalded, and defeathered to determine the consequences of feathers and empty feather follicles on the recovery of bacteria from carcass breast skin. in trial 1, the vents of all carcasses were plugged and sutured before scalding to prevent the expulsion of cloacal contents during picking. in trial 2, half of  the carcasses had their vents plugged and sutured. immediately after defeathering, breast skin was aseptically removed, and bacteria associated with it were enumerated. in trial 1, the levels of bacteria recovered did not differ between feathered and featherless carcasses: campylobacter log10 1.4 cfu/ml of rinse, coliform log10 1.8, escherichia coli log10 1.6, and total aerobic bacteria log10 3.1. in trial 2, the carcasses that had vents plugged and sutured had lower levels of all four types of bacteria (differences of campylobacter log10 0.7 cfu/ml, coliform log10 1.8, e. coli log10 1.7, and total aerobic bacteria log10 0.5) than those carcasses with open vents. the lower levels of bacteria recovered from carcasses with the vents plugged and sutured during picking enabled detection of small but significant differences between feathered and featherless  carcasses. the level of coliform and e. coli recovered was slightly higher by log10 0.7 cfu for feathered carcasses, but featherless carcasses had marginally higher levels of total aerobic bacteria by log10 0.4 cfu. feathered and featherless carcasses with open vents during picking did not differ in the levels of recovery of coliform, e. coli, and total aerobic bacteria from breast skin.

TI  == consumer food-handling behaviors associated with prevention of 13 foodborne illnesses.
AB  == to be effective in reducing the incidence of foodborne illness, consumers and food safety educators need information about behaviors that will decrease exposure to foodborne pathogens. a four-round delphi technique was used to survey nationally recognized experts in food microbiology, epidemiology, food safety education, and food safety policy with the aim of identifying and ranking food-handling and consumption behaviors associated with 13 major foodborne pathogens. the food safety experts ranked behaviors related to keeping foods at safe temperatures as of primary importance in preventing illness caused by bacillus cereus and clostridium perfringens and of secondary importance in preventing illness caused by staphylococcus aureus. the use of a thermometer to cook foods adequately was ranked as of primary importance for the prevention of illness caused by campylobacter jejuni, salmonella species, escherichia coli o157:h7, toxoplasma gondii, and yersinia enterocolitica, with the avoidance of cross-contamination being ranked as of secondary importance for most of these pathogens. hand washing was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of shigellosis. the avoidance of certain foods that are likely to be contaminated was the top-ranked behavior for the prevention of illnesses caused by listeria monocytogenes, noroviruses, and vibrio species. the expert panel's ranking of behaviors for the reduction of the risk of illness caused by major foodborne pathogens can enable consumers to make informed choices about food consumption and handling behaviors and can guide food safety educators in prioritizing their  educational efforts.

TI  == antibacterial activities of phenolic benzaldehydes and benzoic acids against campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica.
AB  == we evaluated the bactericidal activities of 35 benzaldehydes, 34 benzoic acids, and 1 benzoic acid methyl ester against campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, and salmonella enterica when these compounds were substituted on the benzene ring with 0, 1, 2, or 3 hydroxy (oh) and/or methoxy (och3) groups in a ph 7.0 buffer. dose-response plots were used to determine the percentage of the sample that induced a 50% decrease in cfu after 60 min (ba50). of the 70 compounds tested, 24 were found to be active against all four pathogens, and additional 4, 10, and 12 were found to be active against three, two, and one of the pathogens, respectively. c. jejuni was approximately 100 times as sensitive as the other three pathogens. the 10 compounds that were most active against the four pathogens (with average ba50 values ranging from 0.026 to 0.166) and are candidates for studies of activity in foods or for disinfections were 2,4,6-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-5-methoxybenzaldehyde, 2,3-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2-hydroxy-3-methoxybenzaldehyde, 4-hydroxy-2,6-dimethoxybenzaldehyde, 2,5-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, 2,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde. and 2-hydroxybenzaldehyde. comparison of the chemical  structures of the test compounds and their activities revealed that (i) the aldehyde (cho) group was more active than the carboxyl (cooh) group whether or not oh groups were present; (ii) compounds were most active with trisubstituted oh > disubstituted oh > monosubstituted oh; (iii) for disubstituted derivatives,  2-oh enhanced activities were exhibited by benzaldehyde but not by benzoic acid;  (iv) compounds were more active with oh than with och3, irrespective of the position of substitution on the benzene ring; (v) compounds with mixed oh and och3 groups exhibited variable results, i.e., in some cases och3 groups enhanced  activity and in other cases they did not; (vi) methoxybenzoic acids were largely  inactive; and (vii) gallic acid was 20 times as active against s. enterica at ph  7.0 as it was at ph 3.7, suggesting that the ionization of its oh groups may enhance bactericidal activity.

TI  == immobilized enzyme-linked dna-hybridization assay with electrochemical detection  for cryptosporidium parvum hsp70 mrna.
AB  == an electrochemical enzyme-linked immobilized dna-hybridization assay for the detection of cryptosporidium parvum in water has been developed. the target molecule was a 121-nucleotide sequence from the c. parvum heat shock protein 70 (hsp70 mrna from u71181 gene). this analyte offers the possibility of distinguishing dead from live oocysts. the assay involves covalent attachment of  a primary dna probe via its 5'-amine-terminus to self-assembled monolayers of mercaptoundecanoic acid to a gold surface. the primary dna probe was used to capture the target (sequence 1039-1082 of u71181 gene for the mrna), by hybridization to a 20-base complementary sequence on the target (at sequence 1063-1082). a secondary dna probe labeled with alkaline phosphatase (ap) was then hybridized to base sequence 1039-1062 on the target. p-aminophenol, which is enzymatically generated by the immobilized ap from p-aminophenyl phosphate (papp), is detected using electrochemistry. the peak current of cyclic voltammograms from a papp solution, in which gold-coated silicon wafer modified with the complete assembly of the assay components was incubated, is linear with  concentration of the target (5-50 microg/ml, where p1 and p2-ap concentrations are 50 microg/ml). a detection limit of 2 microg/ml (or 146 nm) of the dna target was obtained. cross-reactivity tests showed high selectivity for heat-shocked c.  parvum. no signal was obtained for either the synthetic dna for hsp70 of campylobacter lari, escherichia coli, giardia lamblia, salmonella typhimurium, and listeria monocytogenes or for the products of heat-shocked whole organisms of e. coli, g. lamblia, staphylococcus aureus, and cryptosporidium muris.

TI  == bacterial-associated diarrhea in the dog: a critical appraisal.
AB  == the clinical documentation of enteropathogenic bacteria causing diarrhea in dogs  is clouded by the presence of many of these organisms existing as normal constituents of the indigenous intestinal flora. the diagnosis of a putative bacterial enteropathogen(s) in dogs should be made based on a combination of parameters, including signalment and predisposing factors, clinical signs, serologic assays for toxins, fecal culture, and pcr. relying on results of fecal  culture alone is problematic, because c perfringens, c difficile, campylobacter spp, and pathogenic and non-pathogenic e coli are commonly isolated from apparently healthy dogs [10,13,33]. nevertheless, culture may be useful in procuring isolates for the application of molecular techniques, such as pcr, for  detection of specific toxin genes or molecular typing of isolated strains to establish clonality in suspected outbreaks. the oversimplistic attempt to characterize bacterially associated diarrhea by anatomic localization of clinical signs should be discouraged, because most of the previously mentioned bacteria have been associated with small and large intestinal diarrhea. accurate diagnosis of infections may require diagnostic laboratories to incorporate pcr-based assays using genus- and species-specific primers to facilitate detection of toxin genes  and differentiation of species that appear phenotypically and biochemically similar. there has been tremendous interest in the application of microarray technology for the simultaneous detection of thousands of genes or target dna sequences on one glass slide. this powerful tool could be used for detection of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in fecal specimens obtained from dogs in the future.

TI  == high prevalence of atypical enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) in norwegian children with diarrhoea.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to investigate the relative contribution of enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) as a cause of infectious diarrhoea in norwegian children. data from faecal specimens from children <2 years old with diarrhoea during the year 2001 were analysed. e. coli isolates with the attaching and effacing genotype (eae+) were examined for the presence of the bundle-forming pilus (bfpa) and shiga toxin genes by pcr, and for genetic relatedness by pfge. during the 1-year period, 598 specimens from 440 patients <2 years old were analysed. potential enteric pathogens were identified in 124 patients (28.2 %). epec was the most frequently identified agent (44 patients), followed by rotavirus (41 patients), campylobacter jejuni (17 patients) and adenovirus (17 patients). all other agents were detected in five patients or less. only one of the eae+ e. coli isolates was classified as typical epec (bfpa+). among the 43 isolates that were classified as atypical epec (bfpa-), eight strains belonged to epec serogroups, whereas the majority of strains (n = 35) were not agglutinated by epec antisera. none of the epec isolates were genetically related. this study  demonstrates that atypical epec of non-epec serogroups is highly prevalent among  norwegian children with diarrhoea.

TI  == using quantitative real-time pcr to determine the hygienic status of cattle manure.
AB  == we developed a suitable system of dna extraction and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) for the specific and sensitive quantification of pathogens and other relevant (indicator) organisms in recalcitrant material such  as cattle manure. pcr inhibition by coextraction of humic compounds was minimized in this system, resulting in detection sensitivity of one target dna copy per reaction well. data from qpcr analysis for escherichia coli agreed with cultivation based results, but orders of magnitude more fecal enterococci, enterobacteriaceae and campylobacter jejuni, were determined by qpcr than by cultivation. these bacteria may have been in a potentially hazardous active but non-cultivable state. the qpcr system is much less time consuming than conventional cultivation, highly specific, can detect non-cultivable organisms, provides high measurement throughput, and is cost attractive. it should be considered as an alternative in various application areas for (prescribed routine) cultivation based assays, e.g. for biosafety and hygiene monitoring.

AB  == information on lairages (regarding design, construction materials, and use of bedding and cleaning regimes) was collected for 21 commercial cattle and/or sheep abattoirs in southwest england. overall, roughened or grooved concrete was the most common lairage flooring material. straw bedding was used in the majority of  lairages and was changed between animal batches, daily, weekly, and monthly in roughly 5, 60, 15, and 10%, respectively, of the surveyed lairages. lairages were commonly washed with cold water with no detergents and/or disinfectants, and only about half the lairages were washed daily. also, a three-pathogen cocktail inoculum comprising escherichia coli o157 (nctc 12900), salmonella kedougou (vla  s488/01), and campylobacter jejuni (vla c4) (at 8, 8, and 7 log cfu/ml or 8, 8, and 7 log cfu/g, respectively) was suspended in either broth (for nonfecal contamination) or bovine feces (for fecal contamination). samples of the four most common substrates present in lairages (concrete, straw, metal, and hide) were contaminated in vitro with either fecal or nonfecal inocula and subsequently held in the laboratory at 10 or 25 degrees c for 1 week. bacterial counts for these samples were monitored daily and used to assess the number of days required for a 90% reduction of each pathogen population. in most cases, pathogens survived for >1 week, with survival rates being higher for straw or hide than for concrete or metal and higher for fecal contamination than for nonfecal contamination. overall, if survival rates for the three pathogens under practical lairage conditions were similar to the in vitro survival rates found in this study, contamination of lairages with pathogens could be carried over from one batch of animals to another and/or from one day to the next.

AB  == the number and functions of the low complexity (lc) proteins from four enteric bacterial pathogens escherichia coli o157, vibrio cholerae, helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni were compared. for this purpose the lc proteins were grouped into 3 categories for pairwise comparisons. these were common, variant and lc proteins with no homologues (lcnh). homologous lc proteins in both species in a given pairwise comparison were grouped as common. lc proteins of same function but not of low complexity in either of the species in a given pair were  grouped as variant. lc proteins without any homologues in either species were grouped as lcnh. conservation patterns were inferred by comparing them under 3 functional classes cellular processes (cp), transport and membrane associated (tm) and characteristic (ch). in the common category, highest similarity was found between e. coli o157 and v. cholerae on the one hand and h. pylori and c. jejuni on the other under the functional class cp. this parallels taxonomic classification in that e. coli and v. cholerae are classified under gamma subdivision of proteobacteria whereas h. pylori and c. jejuni are classified under the epsilon subdivision. the data from lcnh group, although more diffuse, was complementary the to pattern drawn from common category in that the numbers of lcnh in the pair [e. coli o157, v. cholerae] and in [h. pylori, c. jejuni] were lowest. no consistent patterns were observed in the variant category. these  observations indicate that although low complexity segments are thought to undergo variations, species patterns do exist in a limited set of low complexity  proteins that parallels taxonomic classification.

TI  == rapid selection of quinolone resistance in campylobacter jejuni but not in escherichia coli in individually housed broilers.
AB  == objective: to determine the within-host population dynamics of campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli in chickens during and after treatment with fluoroquinolones. materials and methods: total and resistant faecal counts were determined from cloacal swabs during and after treatment with enrofloxacin. chickens were housed individually to avoid confounding as a result of interaction between animals, and to be able to focus solely on the within-host dynamics. to determine the molecular basis of resistance, a number of isolates were checked for mutations in gyra. results: treatment with enrofloxacin at doses routinely prescribed (50 ppm) rapidly reduced the faecal counts of e. coli below the detection limit and did not induce resistance. in c. jejuni, on the other hand, treatment with enrofloxacin quickly selected for high frequencies of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains. in all phenotypically resistant isolates, resistance was traced to mutations in the gyra gene. conclusions: (1) a licensed  dosage (50 ppm) of enrofloxacin in drinking water of chickens is effective (i.e.  markedly reduced faecal counts) and is safe on a short time scale in e. coli (i.e. did not rapidly select for resistance), but is neither safe nor effective in c. jejuni. (2) the rapid emergence of resistance to quinolones in c. jejuni does not necessarily result from horizontal transmission of resistant strains among chickens, but could solely be the result of de novo selection of resistance in individual chickens.

TI  == the effect of airsacculitis on bird weights, uniformity, fecal contamination, processing errors, and populations of campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine if the presence of airsacculitis in broiler chickens contributes to loss of saleable yield, lack of uniformity, fecal contamination, processing errors, and increases in populations of pathogenic and  indicator bacteria. in a commercial processing facility, groups of carcasses from airsacculitis (as)-positive (asp) and airsacculitis-negative (asn) flocks were selected from the line and weighed, evaluated for cut or torn areas on the digestive tracts, and assessed for campylobacter and escherichia coli counts. additionally, fecal contamination was monitored and recorded. the presence of as  reduced (p < or = 0.05) carcass weight averages in two of five repetitions. although not significantly different in repetitions 1, 4, and 5, the means were higher for asn flocks. the net loss averaged over five repetitions was 84 g/carcass, equating to a loss of 14,686.9 k (32,379 lb) of chicken meat for one growout house per year as the result of as infection. asp carcasses had higher (p < or = 0.05) fecal contamination in four of five repetitions. the number of total digestive tract cuts or tears were much higher on asp carcasses at 42, 49, 37, 60, and 59% as compared to 14, 12, 17, 24, and 16% for asn carcasses in repetitions 1 to 5, respectively. in three of the five replications, the presence of as in the flocks increased (p < or = 0.05) the number of campylobacter recovered from broiler carcasses. hence, there appears to be a relationship between the presence of as and campylobacter-positive carcasses. escherichia coli counts for asp flocks were significantly higher than asn flocks in repetitions 1  and 3. in repetition 5, e. coli numbers were significantly lower for the as flock. these data differ from previous unpublished data from two separate pilot studies that demonstrated that e. coli counts for asp flocks are significantly higher than asn flocks. this difference may be attributed to the fact that in the pilot studies visibly infected carcasses were sampled, and in this study healthy  birds that had passed inspection were sampled within an asp flock. because flocks of chickens showing signs of as have lower weights, more fecal contamination, more processing errors, and higher levels of campylobacter spp., broiler companies should emphasize control of as in the flocks as a means of preventing subsequent food-borne bacterial infection.

AB  == aims: in view of recent findings that a multidrug efflux pump cmeabc exists in campylobacter jejuni, 391 c. jejuni and 52 campylobacter coli of human and animal origin were examined for a multidrug resistance phenotype. materials and methods: the mics of ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, kanamycin,  tetracycline, cetrimide, triclosan, acridine orange, paraquat and ethidium bromide were determined. resistance to organic solvents and the effect of salicylate (known inducer of the marrab operon in escherichia coli and salmonella) were also examined. results: two c. coli and 13 c. jejuni isolates, mainly from pigs or poultry, were resistant to three or more antibiotics and 12 of these strains had reduced susceptibility to acridine orange and/or ethidium bromide. strains (n = 20) that were less susceptible to acridine orange, ethidium bromide and triclosan were significantly more resistant (p < 0.05) to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, nalidixic acid and tetracycline, with two- to four-fold increases in mic values compared with strains (n = 20) most susceptible to acridine orange, ethidium bromide and triclosan. growth of strains with 1 mm salicylate caused a small (up to two-fold) but statistically significant (p < or = 0.005) increase in the mics of chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin and tetracycline. conclusions: these data indicate that multiple antibiotic resistant (mar)-like campylobacter strains occur and it  may be postulated that these may overexpress cmeabc or another efflux system.

TI  == diverse effects of ascorbic acid and palmitoyl ascorbate on helicobacter pylori survival and growth.
AB  == among many antioxidants used in the food, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries, ascorbic acid (aa) is one of the most important. aa has been suggested to decrease the risk of gastric disease (gastritis, duodenal ulcer, and carcinoma) by direct action on helicobacter pylori. however, there are limited studies on the possible role of aa and its derivatives such as palmitoyl ascorbate (pa) on the growth and survival of h. pylori. in the present study it was demonstrated in vitro that aa in the concentration range 10-20 mg x ml(-1) (50-100 mm) inhibited  h. pylori growth in liquid medium under microaerophilic conditions. in contrast,  under aerobic conditions aa in the concentration range 2-20 mg x ml(-1) (10-100 mm) significantly increased the survival of h. pylori presumably eliminating the  toxic effect of reactive oxygen species on bacterial cells. the hydrophobic derivative of aa, pa (a food antioxidant), demonstrated a strong antibacterial effect, under both aerobic and microaerophilic conditions in the concentration range 0.04-0.4 mg x ml(-1) (0.1-1.0 mm). this effect was also tested on other bacterial strains: escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, bacillus cereus, bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, clostridium sporogenes and campylobacter jejuni. among these bacterial strains, pa showed a similar inhibitory effect on b. cereus and b. subtilis as observed with h. pylori. the results suggest that pa may be considered an important aa derivative  in eradication of h. pylori in vitro and in vivo and to decrease the risk for gastric diseases.

TI  == survey of campylobacter species, vtec o157 and salmonella species in swedish wildlife.
AB  == samples collected from 791 wild animals (canada geese, roe deer, hares, moose, wild boar and gulls) shot during hunting were examined for verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) o157, and thermophilic campylobacter and salmonella species. with the exception of one positive isolate  from a wild boar, vtec o157 was not isolated from any of the animals. salmonella  species were isolated only from the gulls, of which 4 per cent were estimated to  be positive. thermophilic campylobacter species were commonly isolated from all the species except deer.

TI  == the survival of foodborne pathogens during domestic washing-up and subsequent transfer onto washing-up sponges, kitchen surfaces and food.
AB  == in this study, the survival of salmonella, campylobacter and escherichia coli o157: h7, when exposed to a range of constant temperatures (47-60 degrees c), in  hard or soft water, in the presence/absence of detergent (0-0.3%) and organic matter, and during drying, was investigated. further experiments used a washing-up process simulation, where soiled dishes contaminated with bacteria were washed in a bowl of warm water containing detergent. in addition, this study considered the risk of bacterial transfer onto (1) sterile dishes and sponges via contaminated water, (2) kitchen surfaces wiped with a contaminated sponge, (3) items placed in direct contact with a contaminated kitchen surface, (4) food placed on a contaminated dish or (5) dishes from contaminated food. a proportion  of dishes remained contaminated with all pathogen types after a typical washing-up. water hardness did not appear to affect survival. e. coli, and to a lesser extent salmonella, survived towel- or air-drying on dishes and after towel-drying the cloth became contaminated on every occasion, regardless of the test organism. a proportion of sterile dishes washed after contaminated dishes became contaminated with pathogens but transfer from dishes onto food was rare. washing-up sponges frequently became contaminated with pathogens. the results of  this study highlight the potential for survival and cross contamination of food borne pathogens in the kitchen environment.

TI  == characterization of the novel factor paa involved in the early steps of the adhesion mechanism of attaching and effacing escherichia coli.
AB  == nonenterotoxigenic porcine escherichia coli strains belonging to the serogroup o45 have been associated with postweaning diarrhea in swine and adhere to intestinal epithelial cells in a characteristic attaching and effacing (a/e) pattern. o45 porcine enteropathogenic e. coli (pepec) strain 86-1390 induces typical a/e lesions in a pig ileal explant model. using tnphoa transposon insertion mutagenesis on strain 86-1390, we found a mutant that did not induce a/e lesions. the insertion was identified in a gene designated paa (porcine a/e-associated gene). sequence analysis of paa revealed an open reading frame of  753 bp encoding a 27.6-kda protein which displayed 100, 51.8, and 49% homology with paa of enterohemorrhagic e. coli o157:h7 strains (edl933 and sakai), peb3 of campylobacter jejuni, and acfc of vibrio cholerae, respectively. chromosomal localization studies indicated that the region containing paa was inserted between the ycid and ycie genes at about 28.3 min of the e. coli k-12 chromosome. the presence of paa and eae sequences in the porcine o45 strains is highly correlated with the a/e phenotype. however, the observation that three eae-positive but paa-negative pepec o45 strains were a/e negative provides further evidence for the importance of the paa gene in the a/e activity of o45 strains. as well, the complementation of the paa mutant restored the a/e activity of the 86-1390 strain, showing the involvement of paa in pepec pathogenicity. these observations suggest that paa contributes to the early stages of a/e e. coli virulence.

TI  == small-fragment genomic libraries for the display of putative epitopes from clinically significant pathogens.
AB  == taking advantage of whole genome sequences of bacterial pathogens in many thriving diseases with global impact, we developed a comprehensive screening procedure for the identification of putative vaccine candidate antigens. importantly, this procedure relies on highly representative small-fragment genomic libraries that are expressed to display frame-selected epitope-size peptides on a bacterial cell surface and to interact directly with carefully selected disease-relevant high-titer sera. here we describe the generation of small-fragment genomic libraries of gram-positive and gram-negative clinically significant pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, and streptococcus  pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, helicobacter pylori, chlamydia pneumoniae, the enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni. large-scale sequencing revealed that the libraries, which provide an average of 20-fold coverage, were random and, as demonstrated with two s. aureus libraries, highly representative. consistent with the comprehensive nature of this approach is the  identification of epitopes that reside in both annotated and putatively novel open reading frames. the use of these libraries therefore allows for the rapid and direct identification of immunogenic epitopes with no apparent bias or difficulty that often associate with conventional expression methods.

TI  == [new foodborne infections].
AB  == the last 20 years have witnessed a profound reshaping of the spectrum of foodborne infections in industrialized countries. food products are overall very  safe, but the industrial scale and standardisation of food production have spawned spectacular epidemics, bringing into the light previously little known microorganisms such as listeria or escherichia coli o157:h7, the causative agent  of the "hamburger disease". the recent "mad cow disease" crisis is another illustration of a food industry gone astray under the pressure of underlying economic stakes. through unprecedented efforts from the countries involved--epitomized in france by the creation of the agence francaise de securite sannitaire des aliments in 1999--these diseases are about to be curtailed in their epidemic form. but new dangers emerge yet with campylobacter infections, norovirus gastroenteritis or the spread of multi-resistant bacteria.  issues mostly unknown to the general public that are likely to be strongly publicized in the future.

TI  == the emulsiv filter removes microbial contamination from propofol but is not a substitute for aseptic technique.
AB  == purpose: to evaluate the ability of the emulsiv filter (ef) to remove extrinsic microbial contaminants from propofol. methods: aliquots of staphylococcus aureus  (s. aureus), candida albicans (c. albicans), klebsiella pneumoniae (k. pneumoniae), moraxella osloensis (m. osloensis), enterobacter agglomerans (e. agglomerans), escherichia coli (e. coli), serratia marcescens (s. marcescens), moraxella catarrhalis (m. catarrhalis), haemophilus influenzae (h. influenzae) and campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni) were inoculated into vials containing 20 ml  of sterile propofol. the unfiltered inoculated propofol solutions served as controls. ten millilitres and 20 ml samples of the inoculated propofol were filtered through the ef. all solutions were then subplated onto three culture plates using a precision 1 micro l calibrated platinum loop and incubated. the number of colony forming units (cfu) were counted. data were analyzed using a one-sample t test, and a p value of less than 0.05 was selected as the level of statistical significance. results: the ef was able to completely remove cfu of s. aureus, c. albicans, k. pneumoniae, m. osloensis, e. agglomerans, e. coli, s. marcescens, and m. catarrhalis (p < 0.05). a small number of h. influenzae cfu were able to evade filtration in both the 10 ml and 20 ml samples. c. jejuni cfu  were able to evade filtration in only the 10 ml sample. conclusions: the ef removes the majority of microbial contaminates from propofol with the exception of h. influenzae and c. jejuni. although the ef is capable of removing most of the microbial contamination produced by h. influenzae and c. jejuni, a few cfu are capable of evading filtration. consequently, even the use of a filter capable of removing microbial contaminants is not a substitute for meticulous aseptic technique and prompt administration when propofol is used.

TI  == laboratory surveillance of bacterial gastroenteric pathogens in the netherlands,  1991-2001.
AB  == results of the dutch laboratory surveillance of bacterial gastroenteritis between 1991 and 2001 are presented and compared with recent findings in general practices and in the community. between 1996 and 2000 the mean annual number of stools screened by sentinel laboratories was about 1000 samples/100,000 inhabitants, which is 4% of the estimated annual incidence of gastroenteritis in  the dutch population. campylobacter (36/100,000 inhabitants) and salmonella (24/100,000 inhabitants) were the main pathogens isolated. since 1996, the incidence of laboratory confirmed salmonellosis decreased by 30%, predominantly among young children. the incidence of campylobacter was highest in urban areas and salmonella enteritidis emerged as the predominant serotype in urban areas. between 1991 and 2001, multi-resistant salmonella typhimurium dt104 emerged to comprise up to 15% of all salmonella isolates in 2001. reported rates of shigella spp. and yersinia spp. varied little, with average annual incidences of 3.2 and 1.2 cases/100,000 inhabitants, respectively. escherichia coli o157 (90% stec) was scarcely found (0.26/100,000).

TI  == infectious agent and immune response characteristics of chronic enterocolitis in  captive rhesus macaques.
AB  == chronic enterocolitis is the leading cause of morbidity in colonies of captive rhesus macaques (macaca mulatta). this study's aim was to identify the common enteric pathogens frequently associated with chronic enterocolitis in normal, immunocompetent rhesus monkeys and to elucidate the influence of this clinical syndrome on the host immune system. we analyzed the fecal specimens from 100 rhesus macaques with or without clinical symptoms of chronic diarrhea. retrospective analysis revealed an increased incidence of campylobacter spp. (campylobacter coli and campylobacter jejuni), shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, adenovirus, and strongyloides fulleborni in samples collected from animals with chronic diarrhea (p < 0.05). the presence of additional enteric pathogens, such as escherichia coli, carrying the eaea intimin or stx2c shiga toxin virulence genes, balantidium coli, giardia lamblia, enterocytozoon bieneusi, and trichuris trichiura was found in all animals regardless of whether  diarrhea was present. in addition, the upregulation of interleukin-1 alpha (il-1  alpha), il-3, and tumor necrosis factor alpha cytokine genes, accompanied by an increased presence of activated (cd4(+) cd69(+)) t lymphocytes was found in gut-associated lymphoid tissues collected from animals with chronic enterocolitis and diarrhea in comparison with clinically healthy controls (p < 0.05). these data indicate that chronic enterocolitis and diarrhea are associated, in part, with a variety of enteric pathogens and highlight the importance of defining the  microbiological status of nonhuman primates used for infectious disease studies.  the data also suggest that chronic colitis in rhesus macaques may have potential  as a model of inflammatory bowel disease in humans.

TI  == antibiotic resistance in animals.
AB  == there is currently no systematic surveillance or monitoring of antibiotic resistance in australian animals. registration of antibiotics for use in animals  is tightly controlled and has been very conservative. fluoroquinolones have not been registered for use in food producing animals and other products have been removed from the market because of human health concerns. in the late 1970s, the  animal health committee coordinated a survey of resistance in salmonella and escherichia coli isolates from cattle, pigs and poultry and in bovine staphylococcus aureus. some additional information is available from published case reports. in samples collected prior to the withdrawal of avoparcin from the  market, no vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium or enterococcus faecalis were detected in samples collected from pigs, whereas some vana enterococci, including e. faecium and e. faecalis, were found in chickens. no vanb enterococci were detected in either species. virginiamycin resistance was common in both pig  and poultry isolates. multiple resistance was common in e. coli and salmonellae isolates. no fluoroquinolone resistance was found in salmonellae, e. coli or campylobacter. beta-lactamase production is common in isolates from bovine mastitis, but no methicillin resistance has been detected. however, methicillin resistance has been reported in canine isolates of staphylococcus intermedius and extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing e. coli has been found in dogs.

TI  == reduction of bacteria on pork carcasses associated with chilling method.
AB  == in addition to reducing the temperature of pork carcasses immediately after slaughter and before fabrication, blast chilling (snap chill) or conventional chilling can reduce bacterial populations associated with fresh meats. however, there is little information on bacteria survival resulting from the freeze or chill injury of meat products. in this study, porcine fecal slurries with and without pathogens (listeria monocytogenes, salmonella typhimurium, and campylobacter coli) were inoculated onto skin-on and skin-off pork surfaces and subjected to industry-specific blast or conventional chilling conditions. a thin  agar layer method was used for the recovery of freeze- or chill-injured cells. test results indicated that there were no statistically significant (p > 0.05) differences between blast and conventional chilling treatments with respect to the reduction of high and low inoculation levels of mesophilic aerobic bacteria,  total coliforms, or escherichia coli on either skin-on or skin-off surfaces. chilling treatments did not differ significantly (p > 0.05) with respect to their ability to reduce low (3 log10 cfu/cm2) levels of l. monocytogenes and salmonella typhimurium. however, c. coli was reduced to undetectable levels, even after enrichment, on pork surfaces inoculated with low levels (3 log10 cfu/cm2) and subjected to blast chilling. blast and conventional chilling treatments were more effective against all pathogenic bacterial populations when pork surfaces where inoculated at high levels (5 log10 cfu/cm2). the effects of chilling techniques on microbial populations could provide pork processors with an additional intervention for pork slaughter or information to modify and/or improve the chilling process. the information obtained from this study has the potential to serve as a means of producing a microbiologically safer product.

TI  == enteric illness in ontario, canada, from 1997 to 2001.
AB  == enteric illness is a common problem worldwide. in ontario (population of 11.4 million, 2001 census of canada), laboratory-confirmed cases of "reportable" enteric diseases are reported to local health units. public health staff members  investigate these illnesses and subsequently report details to the ministry of health and long-term care through an electronic reporting system. from 1997 to 2001, 44,451 sporadic cases of illness attributable to eight enteric pathogens (campylobacter, salmonella, verotoxin-producing escherichia coli, yersinia, shigella, hepatitis a, listeria, and clostridium botulinum) were reported. this number was less than the 56,690 cases reported from 1992 to 1996. campylobacter accounted for the highest annual average incidence rate at 42.3 cases per 100,000 persons, with salmonella following at 22.6, verotoxin-producing e. coli at 3.7, yersinia at 3.0, shigella at 2.7, hepatitis a at 2.3, and listeria at 0.3. the 4  months from june to september accounted for almost half (46.5%) of all cases. for 74.0% of the outbreaks associated with these eight enteric pathogens, foodborne contamination was identified as the mode of transmission. poultry and other meat  items accounted for 68.4% of the food items when food was identified as the vehicle. admittedly, the "foods" and "modes of transmission" identified may have  been subject to investigator bias based on previous knowledge. the most common risk setting, which was reported in approximately half of the cases, was private  homes; travel-associated illness and restaurants were the second and third most frequently reported risk settings at 24.6 and 14.1%, respectively. findings from  this study suggest that public health efforts should be directed toward safe food handling in the home during the summer months.

TI  == prevalence of enteroaggregative escherichia coli among children with and without  diarrhea in switzerland.
AB  == in a prospective study between july 1999 and september 2000, stool specimens of children below the age of 16 years with (n = 187) and without (n = 137) diarrhea  were tested for the presence of enterovirulent bacteria by standard culture methods and by pcr. targets for the pcr were the plasmid pcvd432 for enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaec), the verotoxin 1 and verotoxin 2 genes  for enterohemorrhagic e. coli, ipah for enteroinvasive e. coli (eiec) and shigella spp., genes coding for heat-stable and heat-labile toxins for enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec), and the eaea gene for enteropathogenic e. coli. the following bacteria could be associated with diarrhea: salmonella enterica (p  = 0.001), campylobacter spp. (p = 0.036), etec (p = 0.012), and eaec (p = 0.006). the detection of eaec, etec, and s. enterica was strongly associated with a history of recent travel outside of switzerland. eaec isolates were found in the  specimens of 19 (10.2%) of 187 children with diarrhea and in those of 3 (2.2%) of 137 children without diarrhea (p = 0.006) and were the most frequently detected bacteria associated with diarrhea. among the children below the age of 5 years, the specimens of 18 (11.9%) of 151 with diarrhea were positive for eaec, while this agent was found in the specimens of 2 (2.2%) of 91 controls (p = 0.007). enteropathogenic e. coli isolates were found in the specimens of 30 (16.4%) of the patients and in those of 15 (10.9%) of the controls, with similar frequencies in all age groups (p > 0.05). we conclude that eaec bacteria are involved in a significant proportion of diarrhea cases among children. children younger than 5  years of age are more often affected by eaec than older children.

TI  == seasonal variation in bacterial pathogens isolated from stool samples in karachi, pakistan.
AB  == objective: to determine the seasonal variation of the commonly isolated bacterial pathogens in stool samples. material and methods: a retrospective descriptive study was undertaken of all the stool samples submitted from within karachi to the aga khan university hospital laboratory over a period of five years (january  1997- december 2001) in order to determine the commonly isolated bacterial pathogens and to predict their seasonal variation. results: a total of 16379 stool samples were included in this review. bacterial isolates were found in 6670 stool samples (culture detection rate=40.7%). the mean age at the time of culture of each sub-group was < or = 1 year group (6.58 +/- 3.1 months), 1-5 years (2.13  +/- 0.94 years), 5-14 years (8.3 +/- 2.6 yrs) and adults (43.2 +/- 18.5 years). male: female ratio was 1.2:1. vibrio cholera 01 ogawa (32.8%), campylobacter jejuni (17.3%), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (9.9%), salmonella paratyphi b  (6.6%) and shigella flexneri (6.2%) were the most common organisms isolated. these organisms show a distinct seasonal variation with summer predilection. conclusion: in contrast to the previous studies from south asia, which have identified e. coil, followed by vibrio cholerae as the most common enteric isolates, we found vibrio cholera 01 ogawa followed by campylobacter jejuni as the most common enteric pathogens isolated in an urban setting. it is important to consider seasonal variation when empirically treating diarrheal diseases in our region.

TI  == cloning, preliminary characterization and crystallization of nucleoside hydrolases from caenorhabditis elegans and campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the nucleoside hydrolases (nhs) are a family of nucleoside-modifying enzymes. they play an important role in the purine-salvage pathway of many pathogenic organisms which are unable to synthesize purines de novo. although well characterized in protozoan parasites, their precise function and mechanism remain unclear in other species. for the first time, nhs from caenorhabditis elegans and campylobacter jejuni, which are representatives of mesozoa and bacteria, respectively, have been cloned and purified. steady-state kinetics indicate a different substrate-specificity profile to previously described hydrolases. native diffraction data sets were collected from crystals of nh from each organism. the hexagonal crystals (space group p6(2)22 or p6(4)22) of nh from c. elegans diffracted to a resolution of 2.8 a, while the data set from the orthorhombic crystals (space group i222 or i2(1)2(1)2(1)) of nh from c. jejuni could be processed to 1.7 a resolution. the unit-cell parameters were a = b = 102.23, c = 117.27 a in the former case and a = 101.13, b = 100.13, c = 81.37 a in the latter.

TI  == development of a plating medium for selection of helicobacter pylori from water samples.
AB  == the goal of this study was to develop a simple plating medium to allow large-scale screening of water samples for the presence of helicobacter pylori. five conventional plating media (brain heart infusion, brucella agar, columbia blood agar base, campylobacter agar kit skirrow, and hpspa medium), each containing a commercial antibiotic supplement, were initially evaluated. eight strains selected as common waterborne organisms (acinetobacter, aeromonas, bacillus, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococcus, helicobacter pylori, and  pseudomonas strains) were individually plated onto each of these media. three organisms (acinetobacter, e. coli, and h. pylori) were able to grow on all five media. this growth was unacceptable since helicobacter grows very slowly and competing organisms must be inhibited for up to 7 days. therefore, a more selective medium (hp agar) containing a novel mixture of growth supplements plus  amphotericin b and polymyxin b was developed. this medium also included a phenol  red color indicator for urease production. aliquots of nonsterile well water that contained native flora (flavobacterium, serratia, citrobacter, pasteurella, ochrobactrum, rahnella, and unidentified molds) and were further adulterated with the eight strains listed above (10(6) cfu of each strain per 100 ml) were spiked  with h. pylori and were plated. in spite of the heavy mixed microbial load, only  h. pylori colonies grew during 7 days of incubation at 37 degrees c. the color indicator system allowed presumptive identification of h. pylori colonies sooner  (12 to 20 h) than the conventional media tested allowed. the hp formulation developed in this study provides a medium with superior selectivity for h. pylori from mixed microbial populations in water and reduces the time required to complete the assay.

TI  == enteric pathogens and soil: a short review.
AB  == it is known that soil is a recipient of solid wastes able to contain enteric pathogens in high concentrations. although the role of soil as a reservoir of certain bacterial pathogens is not in question, recent findings show that soil may have a larger role in the transmission of enteric diseases than previously thought. many of the diseases caused by agents from soil have been well characterized, although enteric diseases and their link to soil have not been so  well studied. gastrointestinal infections are the most common diseases caused by  enteric bacteria. some examples are salmonellosis ( salmonella sp.), cholera ( vibrio cholerae), dysentery ( shigella sp.) and other infections caused by campylobacter jejuni, yersinia sp. and escherichia coli o157:h7 and many other strains. viruses are the most hazardous and have some of the lowest infectious doses of any of the enteric pathogens. hepatitis a, hepatitis e, enteric adenoviruses, poliovirus types 1 and 2, multiple strains of echoviruses and coxsackievirus are enteric viruses associated with human wastewater. among the most commonly detected protozoa in sewage are entamoeba histolytica, giardia intestinalis and cryptosporidium parvum. this article reviews the existing literature of more than two decades on waste disposal practices that favor the entry of enteric pathogens to soil and the possible consequent role of the soil as a vector and reservoir of enteric pathogens.

TI  == acute gastroenteritis in children : what role for antibacterials?
AB  == the aim of this article is to define the currently accepted role of antibacterials in the treatment of acute gastroenteritis in children. most cases  of acute gastroenteritis in children are viral, self-limited, and need only supportive treatment. appropriate fluid and electrolyte therapy, with close attention to nutrition, remain central to therapy.antibacterial therapy serves as an adjunct, to shorten the clinical course, eradicate causative organisms, reduce transmission, and prevent invasive complications. selection of antibacterials to  use in acute bacterial gastroenteritis is based on clinical diagnosis of the likely pathogen prior to definitive laboratory results. antibacterial therapy should be restricted to specific bacterial pathogens and disease presentations. in general, infections with shigella spp. and vibrio cholera should usually be treated with antibacterials, while antibacterials are only used in severe unresponsive infections with salmonella, yersinia, aeromonas, campylobacter, plesiomonas spp., and clostridium difficile. antibacterials should be avoided in  enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli infection. however, empiric therapy may be appropriate in the presence of a severe illness with bloody diarrhea and stool leucocytes, particularly in infancy and the immunocompromised. the benefits and risks of adverse drug reactions should be weighed before prescribing antibacterials. moreover, a major concern is the emergence of antibacterial-resistant strains due to the widespread use of antibacterial agents.

AB  == the influence of zoonotic pathogens in animal manure on human health and well-being as a direct or indirect cause of human enteric illness is examined. available international data are considered, but the study is focused on the developing situation in western canada, where it is certain there will be further rapid growth in livestock numbers, particularly hogs. major pathogens considered  are escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, campylobacter, yersinia, cryptosporidium, and giardia. canada is now the leading exporter of pork internationally, but recent increases in production contrast with constant domestic levels of pork consumption and declining levels of foodborne illness caused by pork. effects of increased levels of manure production are not quantifiable in terms of effects on human health. the presence of major pathogens in manure and movement to human food sources and water are considered on the basis of available data. survival of the organisms in soil, manure, and water indicate significant variability in resistance to environmental challenge that are characteristic of the organisms themselves. generally, pathogens survived longer in environmental samples at cool temperatures but differences were seen in liquid and solid manure. based on actual data plus some data extrapolated from cattle manure environments, holding manure at 25 degrees c for 90 d will render it free from the pathogens considered above.

TI  == bayesian methods for estimating pathogen prevalence within groups of animals from faecal-pat sampling.
AB  == pathogens such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter spp. have been implicated in outbreaks of food poisoning in the uk and elsewhere. domestic animals and wildlife are important reservoirs for both of these agents, and cross-contamination from faeces is believed to be responsible for many human outbreaks. appropriate parameterisation of quantitative microbial-risk models requires representative data at all levels of the food chain. our focus in this paper is on the early stages of the food chain-specifically, sampling issues which arise at the farm level. we estimated animal-pathogen prevalence from faecal-pat samples using a bayesian method which reflected the uncertainties inherent in the animal-level prevalence estimates. (note that prevalence here refers to the percentage of animals shedding the bacteria of interest). the method offers more flexibility than traditional, classical approaches: it allows  the incorporation of prior belief, and permits the computation of a variety of distributional and numerical summaries, analogues of which often are not available through a classical framework. the bayesian technique is illustrated with a number of examples reflecting the effects of a diversity of assumptions about the underlying processes. the technique appears to be both robust and flexible, and is useful when defecation rates in infected and uninfected groups are unequal, where population size is uncertain, and also where the microbiological-test sensitivity is imperfect. we also investigated the determination of the sample size necessary for determining animal-level prevalence from pat samples to within a pre-specified degree of accuracy.

TI  == a 5-year study of the bacterial pathogens associated with acute diarrhoea on the  island of crete, greece, and their resistance to antibiotics.
AB  == during a 5-year period (1995-1999) a total of 7090 stool samples obtained from patients with acute diarrhoea, mostly community-acquired, were examined for bacterial pathogens, in the greek island of crete. one or more enteric pathogens  were isolated from 987 patients (14%). salmonella enterica were the most commonly isolated bacteria (6%), followed by campylobacter spp. (4.2%), and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) (1.8%). yersinia enterocolitica (0.6%),  shigella spp. (0.3%), and aeromonas hydrophila (0.04%), were less frequently isolated. clostridium difficile was isolated from 65 out of 451 diarrhoeal specimens examined (14.4%). toxin b was detected in all cases. no verotoxigenic e. coli strains were identified. resistance to ampicillin was observed in 31.5% of the salmonella, 58.3% of the shigella and 31.5% of the epec isolates. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed in 4.4% of the salmonella, 30.5% of the shigella, and 18.5% of the epec isolates. high percentages of resistance to quinolones (44.5% to norfloxacin, and 40.5% to ciprofloxacin), were found among campylobacter isolates, while resistance to erythromycin was observed in 14.9% of them. with the present study we continue the surveillance of bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoeal disease on the island of crete.

TI  == prevalence of cytolethal distending toxin production in periodontopathogenic bacteria.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) is a newly identified virulence factor produced by several pathogenic bacteria implicated in chronic infection. seventy three strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria were examined for the production of cdt  by a hela cell bioassay and for the presence of the cdt gene by pcr with degenerative oligonucleotide primers, which were designed based on various regions of the escherichia coli and campylobacter cdtb genes, which have been successfully used for the identification and cloning of cdtabc genes from actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans y4 (m. sugai et al., infect. immun. 66:5008-5019, 1998). cdt activity was found in culture supernatants of 40 of 45 tested a. actinomycetemcomintans strains, but the titer of the toxin varied considerably among these strains. pcr experiments indicated the presence of y4-type cdt sequences in these strains, but the rest of a. actinomycetemcomitans  were negative by pcr amplification and also by southern blot analysis for the cdtabc gene. in the 40 cdt-positive strains, southern hybridization with hindiii-digested genomic dna revealed that there are at least 6 restriction fragment length polymorphism types. this suggests that the cdtabc flanking region is highly polymorphic, which may partly explain the variability of the cdt activity in the culture supernatants. the rest of tested strains of periodontopathogenic bacteria did not have detectable cdt production by the hela  cell assay and for cdtb sequences by pcr analysis under our experimental conditions. these results strongly suggested that cdt is a unique toxin predominantly produced by a. actinomycetemcomitans among periodontopathogenic bacteria.

TI  == structure and genotypic plasticity of the campylobacter fetus sap locus.
AB  == the campylobacter fetus surface layer proteins (slps), encoded by five to nine sapa homologues, are major virulence factors. to characterize the sapa homologues further, a 65.9 kb c. fetus genomic region encompassing the sap locus from wild-type strain 23d was completely sequenced and analysed; 44 predicted open reading frames (orfs) were recognized. the 53.8 kb sap locus contained eight complete and one partial sapa homologues, varying from 2769 to 3879 bp, sharing conserved 553-2622 bp 5' regions, with partial sharing of 5' and 3' non-coding regions. all eight sapa homologues were expressed in escherichia coli as antigenic proteins and reattached to the surface of slp- strain 23b, indicating their conserved function. analysis of the sap homologues indicated three phylogenetic groups. promoter-specific polymerase chain reactions (pcrs) and sapa homologue-specific reverse transcription (rt)-pcrs showed that the unique sapa promoter can potentially express all eight sapa homologues. reciprocal dna recombination based on the 5' conserved regions can involve each of the eight sapa homologues, with frequencies from 10(-1) to 10(-3). intragenic recombination between sapa7 and sapap8, mediated by their conserved regions with a 10(-1)-10(-2) frequency, allows the formation of new sap homologues. as divergent slp c-termini possess multiple antigenic sites, their reciprocal recombination behind the unique sap promoter leads to continuing antigenic variation.

TI  == emerging water-borne pathogens.
AB  == emerging water-borne pathogens constitute a major health hazard in both developed and developing nations. a new dimension to the global epidemiology of cholera-an  ancient scourge-was provided by the emergence of vibrio cholerae o139. also, water-borne enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli ( e. coli o157:h7), although regarded as a problem of the industrialized west, has recently caused outbreaks in africa. outbreaks of chlorine-resistant cryptosporidium have motivated water authorities to reassess the adequacy of current water-quality regulations. of late, a host of other organisms, such as hepatitis viruses (including hepatitis e virus), campylobacter jejuni, microsporidia, cyclospora, yersinia enterocolitica, calciviruses and environmental bacteria like mycobacterium spp, aeromonads, legionella pneumophila and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa have been associated with water-borne illnesses. this review critically examines the potential of these as emerging water-borne pathogens. it also examines the possible reasons, such as an increase in the number of immunocompromised individuals, urbanization and horizontal gene transfer, that may underlie their emergence. further, measures required to face the challenge posed by these pathogens are also discussed.

TI  == quantitative, multiplexed detection of bacterial pathogens: dna and protein applications of the luminex labmap system.
AB  == escherichia coli, salmonella, listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter jejuni are bacterial pathogens commonly implicated in foodborne illnesses. generally used detection methods (i.e., culture, biochemical testing, elisa and nucleic acid amplification) can be laborious, time-consuming and require multiple tests to detect all of the pathogens. our objective was to develop rapid assays to simultaneously detect these four organisms through the presence of antigen or dna using the luminex labmap system. for nucleic acid detection, organism-specific capture probes corresponding to the 23s ribosomal rna gene (rrl) were coupled covalently to labmap microspheres. target molecules included synthetic complementary oligonucleotides and genomic dna isolated from atcc type strains or other well-characterized strains of each organism. universal pcr primers were designed to amplify variable regions of bacterial 23s ribosomal dna, yielding biotinylated amplicons of 86 to 109 bp in length. varying quantities of targets were hybridized to the combined microsphere sets, labeled with streptavidin-r-phycoerythrin and analyzed on the luminex(100) system. results of  nucleic acid detection assays, obtained in 30 to 40 min following amplification,  correctly and specifically identified each bacterial species with a detection sensitivity of 10(3) to 10(5) genome copies. capture-sandwich immunoassays were developed with organism-specific antibodies coupled to different microsphere sets. microspheres were incubated with organism-specific standards and reactivity was assessed with biotinylated detection antibodies and streptavidin-r-phycoerythrin. in the immunoassays, microsphere-associated fluorescence was organism concentration dependent with detectable response at < or = 1000 organisms/ml and with no apparent cross-reactivity. we have demonstrated that the luminex labmap system is a rapid, flexible platform capable of simultaneous, sensitive and specific detection of pathogens. the practical significance of this multiplexing approach would be to provide more timely, economical and comprehensive information than is available with conventional isolation and identification methodologies.

TI  == prevalence of bacterial faecal pathogens in separated and unseparated stored pig  slurry.
AB  == aims: to examine the prevalence and diversity of bacterial faecal pathogens in unseparated slurry, separated solids and liquid fractions from a commercial pig farm. methods: a total of 43 stored slurry specimens originating from a fattening house over the period february-april 2002 were analysed, consisting of unseparated (n = 14) slurry, separated solids (n = 16) and separated liquid (n =  13). specimens were examined for the presence of five bacterial pathogens including salmonella spp., shigella spp., campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157 and yersinia enterocolitica. selective enrichment and plating methods were employed for detection of salmonella spp. and campylobacter spp. and conventional selective plating techniques for the remaining genera. antibiogram profiles to 12 antibiotic agents were obtained for all salmonella isolates obtained. results: salmonella spp. were identified in all components of the slurry specimens, whereas campylobacter spp. was only recovered from the unseparated and separated  liquid fractions. in both cases, the separated liquid fraction had the highest prevalence of pathogens and the separated solid fraction had the lowest prevalence. none of the slurry specimens examined were positive for e. coli o157:h7, shigella spp. or y. enterocolitica. twenty-nine isolates of salmonella were recovered from the slurry specimens, comprising seven serovars, of which salmonella manhattan was the most prevalent, accounting for over half [15 of 29 (51.7%)] of all salmonella isolates. salmonella anatum, salm. derby, salm. give,  salm. heidelberg, salm. simi and salm. stanley serovars were also recovered. all  salmonella isolates were sensitive to ampicillin, augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanic acid), chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, kanamycin and trimethoprim, but has variable resistance to tetracycline (100%), sulphonamides (84.6%), furazolidone (38.5%), nalidixic acid (15.4%) and streptomycin (15.4%). the majority (57.7%) of isolates displayed antibiotic resistance to at least two antibiotic agents, followed by 34.6% of isolates being resistant to three agents and the remainder (7.7%) being resistant to four antibiotics. significance and impact of the study: this study demonstrated a marked reduction in the prevalence of campylobacter and salmonella in the solids  component of separated pig slurry. the adoption of control processes such as aeration of slurry prior to its spread onto agricultural land and newer approaches to pathogen reduction should be investigated, to reduce the transmission of pathogens from pig slurry to the environment.

TI  == bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis.
AB  == bacterial diarrhea can be classified into two clinical entities, noninflammatory  diarrhea and inflammatory diarrhea syndromes. the latter type of diarrhea is characterized by bloody and puruloid mucus stool, and is often accompanied by fever, tenesmus, and severe abdominal pain. pathogenic bacteria causing the inflammatory diarrhea syndrome include salmonella, vibrio, shigella, enteroinvasive and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli, campylobacter, yersinia, chlamydia, and clostridium difficile. the pathologic changes in the inflammatory  diarrhea syndrome range from a superficial exudative enterocolitis to a transmural enterocolitis with overt ulceration. this syndrome is also designated  as bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis because of its usual manifestation by bloody diarrhea. the diagnostic approach needs information on the patient's age,  travel history, epidemiological associations, sexual practice, and medical history, including usage of antibiotics. bacterial information can be obtained by microscopic study, culture, and the identification of specific bacterial toxins.  flexible colonoscopy with biopsy is useful for the differentiation of bacterial hemorrhagic enterocolitis from idiopathic ulcerative colitis and ischemic colitis. physicians should be familiar with the diagnostic modalities used to detect the specific pathogens causing hemorrhagic bacterial enterocolitis; namely, bacterial culture, serology, histology, and nucleic acid technologies.

TI  == a fatal waterborne disease epidemic in walkerton, ontario: comparison with other  waterborne outbreaks in the developed world.
AB  == an estimated 2,300 people became seriously ill and seven died from exposure to microbially contaminated drinking water in the town of walkerton, ontario, canada in may 2000. the severity of this drinking water disaster resulted in the government of ontario calling a public inquiry by mr. justice dennis o'connor to  address the cause of the outbreak, the role (if any) of government policies in contributing to this outbreak and, ultimately, the implications of this experience on the safety of drinking water across the province of ontario. the circumstances surrounding the walkerton tragedy are an important reference source for those concerned with providing safe drinking water. although some circumstances are obviously specific to this epidemic, others are uncomfortably reminiscent of waterborne outbreaks that have occurred elsewhere. these recurring themes suggested the need for attention to broad issues of drinking water security and they present the challenge for how drinking water safety can be managed to prevent such tragedies in the future.

TI  == drinking water contamination in walkerton, ontario: positive resolutions from a tragic event.
AB  == in may 2000, escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni contaminated the drinking water supply in walkerton, ontario. seven people died and over 2,000 were ill as a result. the ontario provincial government set up a judicial inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the outbreak and also moved quickly to introduce a new drinking water regulation that incorporated some significant requirements for drinking water providers. the inquiry itself was in three parts: (a) part 1 related to the events that occurred in walkerton and why the water contamination occurred; (b) part 1a related specifically to the role of the provincial government in the event; and (c) part 2 related to the future of drinking water safety in ontario with potential to influence regulation on a wider basis. a number of other actions were taken after walkerton. in august 2000, the ontario government, through the regulatory body, the ontario ministry of the environment (moe) (a) re-issued and revised the ontario drinking water objectives (odwo) as the ontario drinking water standards (odws) and (b) introduced new regulations governing drinking water in ontario--the ontario drinking water protection regulation. one of the key features of the drinking water protection regulation was the requirement to produce an independent engineers' report on all water systems. this paper provides a unique perspective  on the walkerton tragedy and its aftermath. the author was active in many aspects of the resulting activity (chair of the ontario water works association's (a section of the awwa) special committee involved in part 2 of the walkerton inquiry; author of several of the engineers' reports mandated by regulation; reviewer on behalf of the regulator of engineers' reports submitted by others). the engineers' reports were of interest because (1) the drinking water providers  (mostly municipalities) were mandated by regulation to complete the reports by specific dates and are paying for the reports, (2) the work had to be done by a registered professional engineer who is not an employee of the owner or the operator if a different entity and (3) the engineer had to sign a declaration that the regulator could rely on the accuracy of the report. in other words, the  municipality retained the engineer and paid them to produce the report--the engineer essentially carried the liability while the regulator had the final say  in the acceptability of the report, a sort of eternal triangle of responsibilities. the paper will outline how the drinking water profession in north america worked together to provide the walkerton inquiry with the benefit of its experience and knowledge of best practices to the benefit of consumers and the drinking water providers. it will also outline the procedures adopted to produce the independent engineers' reports and how the findings are being applied to further improve drinking water safety in ontario, across canada and in similar situations around the world.

AB  == a biosensor was evaluated with regard to its usefulness in the rapid detection of escherichia coli o157:h7 inoculated in ground beef, chicken carcass, and romaine  lettuce samples. the biosensor consisted of a chemiluminescence reaction cell, a  fiber-optic light guide, and a luminometer linked to a personal computer in conjunction with immunomagnetic separation. the samples inoculated with e. coli o157:h7 were first centrifuged and suspended in buffered peptone water and then incubated with anti-e. coli o157 antibody-coated magnetic beads and horseradish peroxidase (hrp)-labeled anti-e. coli o157 antibodies to form antibody-coated bead-bacterium-hrp-labeled antibody sandwich complexes. finally, the sandwich complexes were separated from the samples in a magnetic field and reacted with luminol in the reaction cell. the number of e. coli o157:h7 cells was determined  by collecting the hrp-catalyzed chemiluminescence signal from the bead surface through a fiber-optic light guide and measuring the signal with a luminometer. the chemiluminescence biosensor was specific for e. coli o157:h7 in samples containing other bacteria, including salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni, and listeria monocytogenes. the chemiluminescence signal was linear on a  log scale from 10(2) to 10(5) cfu of e. coli o157:h7 per ml in samples. detection could be completed within 1.5 h without any enrichment. the detection limits for  ground beef, chicken carcass, and lettuce samples were 3.2 x 10(2), 4.4 x 10(2),  and 5.5 x 10(2) cfu of e. coli o157:h7 per ml, respectively.

TI  == microbiological study of ready-to-eat salad vegetables from retail establishments uncovers a national outbreak of salmonellosis.
AB  == the increasing availability of bagged prepared salad vegetables reflects consumer demand for fresh, healthy, convenient, and additive-free foods that are safe and  nutritious. during may and june 2001 a study of retail bagged prepared ready-to-eat salad vegetables was undertaken to determine the microbiological quality of these vegetables. examination of the salad vegetables revealed that the vast majority (3,826 of 3,852 samples; 99.3%) were of satisfactory or acceptable microbiological quality according to public health laboratory service  microbiological guidelines, while 20 (0.5%) samples were of unsatisfactory microbiological quality. unsatisfactory quality was due to escherichia coli and listeria spp. (not listeria monocytogenes) levels in excess of 10(2) cfu/g. however, six (0.2%) samples were of unacceptable microbiological quality because  of the presence of salmonella (salmonella newport pt33 [one sample], salmonella umbilo [three samples], and salmonella durban [one sample]) or because of a l. monocytogenes level of 660 cfu/g, which indicates a health risk. in each case, the retailer involved and the uk food standards agency were immediately informed, and full investigations were undertaken. nineteen cases of salmonella newport pt33 infection were subsequently identified throughout england and wales. the outbreak strain of salmonella newport pt33 isolated from the salad and from humans had a unique plasmid profile. campylobacter spp. and e. coli o157 were not detected in any of the samples examined. the presence of salmonella, as well as high levels of l. monocytogenes, is unacceptable. however, minimally processed cut and packaged salad is exposed to a range of conditions during growth, harvest, preparation, and distribution, and it is possible that these conditions  may increase the potential for microbial contamination, highlighting the necessity for the implementation of good hygiene practices from farm to fork to prevent contamination and/or bacterial growth in these salad products.

TI  == detection and typing of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli and analysis  of indicator organisms in three waterborne outbreaks in finland.
AB  == waterborne outbreaks associated with contamination of drinking water by campylobacter jejuni are rather common in the nordic countries sweden, norway, and finland, where in sparsely populated districts groundwater is commonly used without disinfection. campylobacters, escherichia coli, or other coliforms have rarely been detected in potential sources. we studied three waterborne outbreaks  in finland caused by c. jejuni and used sample volumes of 4,000 to 20,000 ml for  analysis of campylobacters and sample volumes of 1 to 5,000 ml for analysis of coliforms and e. coli, depending on the sampling site. multiple samples obtained  from possible sources (water distribution systems and environmental water sources) and the use of large sample volumes (several liters) increased the chance of detecting the pathogen c. jejuni in water. filtration of a large volume (1,000 to 2,000 ml) also increased the rate of detection of coliforms and e. coli. to confirm the association between drinking water contamination and illness, a combination of penner serotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis  (digestion with smai and kpni) was found to be useful. this combination reliably  verified similarity or dissimilarity of c. jejuni isolates from patient samples,  from drinking water, and from other environmental sources, thus confirming the likely reservoir of an outbreak.

TI  == rpod promoters in campylobacter jejuni exhibit a strong periodic signal instead of a -35 box.
AB  == we have used a hidden markov model (hmm) to identify the consensus sequence of the rpod promoters in the genome of campylobacter jejuni. the identified promoter consensus sequence is unusual compared to other bacteria, in that the region upstream of the tata-box does not contain a conserved -35 region, but shows a very strong periodic variation in the at-content and semi-conserved t-stretches,  with a period of 10-11 nucleotides. the tata-box is in some, but not all cases, preceded by a tgx, similar to an extended -10 promoter. we predicted a total of 764 presumed rpod promoters in the c.jejuni genome, of which 654 were located upstream of annotated genes. a similar promoter was identified in helicobacter pylori, a close phylogenetic relative of campylobacter, but not in escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, or six other proteobacterial genomes, or in staphylococcus aureus. we used upstream regions of high confidence genes as training data (n=529, for the c.jejuni genome). we found it necessary to limit the training set to genes that are preceded by an intergenic region of >100bp or by a gene oriented in the opposite direction to be able to identify a conserved sequence motif, and ended up with a training set of 175 genes. this leads to the conclusion that the remaining genes (354) are more rarely preceded by a (rpod) promoter, and consequently that operon structure may be more widespread in c.jejuni than has been assumed by others. structural predictions of the regions upstream of the tata-box indicates a region of highly curved dna, and we assume that this facilitates the wrapping of the dna around the rna polymerase holoenzyme, and offsets the absence of a conserved -35 binding motif.

AB  == a study was conducted to determine effects of bird age at slaughter, feed withdrawal, and transportation on levels of coliforms, campylobacter, escherichia coli, and salmonella on carcasses before and after immersion chilling. broilers were processed at 42, 49, and 56 d of age after a 12-h feed withdrawal period or  a 0-h feed withdrawal period (full fed). at each age, broilers were processed from two commercial farms previously identified as campylobacter positive. one week before slaughter, broilers were gavaged with nalidixic acid-resistant salmonella. during bleeding, cotton plugs were inserted into the cloaca of each carcass. whole-carcass rinses (wcr) were performed before and after immersion chilling with 20 ppm sodium hypochlorite, and rinses were analyzed for coliforms, campylobacter, e. coli and salmonella. log10 counts for coliforms, campylobacter, and e. coli were (p < 0.05) affected by bird age at slaughter. feed withdrawal (fw) affected only campylobacter on carcasses of older broilers (56 d of age). chilling with sodium hypochlorite resulted in log10 reductions of 1.2, 1.3, 1.4,  and 0.5 for coliforms, campylobacter, e. coli, and salmonella, respectively. under the conditions of this experiment, it appears that contamination on the exterior of birds entering the processing facility is critical to carcass bacterial counts. moreover, carcass bacterial counts did not vary when microbial  counts of broilers were comparable. fw may increase prechill carcass counts for e. coli and campylobacter, but it appears to have no effect on postchill carcass  counts when sodium hypochlorite is used in the chilling operation.

AB  == very little is known about the microbial composition of animal bedding wastes, including poultry litter, and what is known has been deduced from standard culture methods, by which some fastidious organisms that exist in the environment may not be detected. we evaluated the bacterial composition of poultry litter by  using a combination of culture and molecular detection. total aerobic bacteria in poultry litter were detected by culture at 10(9) cfu/g of material. enteric bacteria such as enterococcus spp. and coliforms composed 0.1 and 0.01%, respectively, of the total aerobic cultivatable bacteria in poultry litter; no salmonella strains were detected by culture. in order to characterize the most abundant bacterial groups, we sequenced 16s ribosomal dna (rdna) genes amplified  by pcr with microbial community dna isolated from poultry litter as the template. from the 16s rdna library, 31 genera were identified. twelve families or groups were identified with lactobacilli and salinococcus spp. forming the most abundant groups. in fact, 82% of the total sequences were identified as gram-positive bacteria with 62% of total belonging to low g+c gram-positive groups. in addition to detection of 16s rdna sequences associated with the expected fecal bacteria present in manure, we detected many bacterial sequences for organisms, such as globicatella sulfidofaciens, corynebacterium ammoniagenes, corynebacterium urealyticum, clostridium aminovalericum, arthrobacter sp., and denitrobacter permanens, that may be involved in the degradation of wood and cycling of nitrogen and sulfur. several sequences were identified in the library for bacteria associated with disease in humans and poultry such as clostridia, staphylococci, and bordetella spp. however, specific pcr targeting other human and veterinary pathogens did not detect the presence of salmonella, pathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter spp., yersinia spp., listeria spp., or toxigenic  staphylococci. pcr and dna hybridization revealed the presence of class 1 integrons with gene cassettes that specify resistance to aminoglycosides and chloramphenicol. only from understanding the microbial community of animal wastes such as poultry litter can we manage animal disease and limit the impact of animal waste on the environment and human and animal health.

TI  == detection, isolation, and molecular subtyping of escherichia coli o157:h7 and campylobacter jejuni associated with a large waterborne outbreak.
AB  == the largest reported outbreak of waterborne escherichia coli o157:h7 in the united states occurred in upstate new york following a county fair in august 1999. culture methods were used to isolate e. coli o157:h7 from specimens from 128 of 775 patients with suspected infections. campylobacter jejuni was also isolated from stools of 44 persons who developed diarrheal illness after attending this fair. there was one case of a confirmed coinfection with e. coli o157:h7 and c. jejuni. molecular detection of stx(1) and stx(2) shiga toxin genes, immunomagnetic separation (ims), and selective culture enrichment were utilized to detect and isolate e. coli o157:h7 from an unchlorinated well and its distribution points, a dry well, and a nearby septic tank. pcr for stx(1) and stx(2) was shown to provide a useful screen for toxin-producing e. coli o157:h7,  and ims subculture improved recovery. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) was used to compare patient and environmental e. coli o157:h7 isolates. among patient isolates, 117 of 128 (91.5%) were type 1 or 1a (three or fewer bands different).  among the water distribution system isolates, 13 of 19 (68%) were type 1 or 1a. additionally, pfge of c. jejuni isolates revealed that 29 of 35 (83%) had indistinguishable pfge patterns. the pfge results implicated the water distribution system as the main source of the e. coli o157:h7 outbreak. this investigation demonstrates the potential for outbreaks involving more than one pathogen and the importance of analyzing isolates from multiple patients and environmental samples to develop a better understanding of bacterial transmission during an outbreak.

TI  == antioxidant and antimicrobial effects of four garlic-derived organosulfur compounds in ground beef.
AB  == the antioxidant and antimicrobial protection of diallyl sulfide (das), diallyl disulfide (dads), s-ethyl cysteine (sec), n-acetyl cysteine (nac) in ground beef  against discoloration, lipid oxidation and microbial contamination were studied.  the exogenous addition of these garlic-derived organosulfur compounds significantly delayed both oxymyoglobin and lipid oxidations (p<0.05). the antioxidant protection from these organosulfur compounds was dose-dependent (p<0.05), and showed significantly greater antioxidant activity than alpha-tocopherol (p<0.05). the presence of das and dads in ground beef significantly reduced total aerobes and inhibited the growth of five inoculated pathogenic bacteria, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, staphyllococcus aureus and campylobacter jejuni (p<0.05). these results suggested the application of these organosulfur compounds in meat or other food systems could enhance color, lipid and microbial safety.

TI  == an observational clinic-based study of diarrheal illness in deployed united states military personnel in thailand: presentation and outcome of campylobacter  infection.
AB  == campylobacter is a leading cause of traveler's diarrhea in thailand. since resistance to quinolones is high among campylobacter isolates, empiric therapy with quinolones for traveler's diarrhea may be ineffective in this region. we conducted an observational study among 169 u.s. military personnel with acute diarrhea and compared their microbiologic findings to those of 77 asymptomatic personnel deployed to thailand in may 1998. of 146 pathogenic bacterial isolates, the most common were nontyphoidal salmonella (n = 31), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (n = 24), and c. jejuni/coli (n = 23). campylobacter was strongly associated with disease (odds ratio = 5.9; 95% confidence interval = 1.3-37.3), with a more severe clinical presentation, and with a reduced functional ability at presentation (p = 0.02). in vitro resistance to ciprofloxacin was observed in 96% of the campylobacter isolates. sub-optimal treatment response to ciprofloxacin was observed in 17% of the cases of campylobacter infection versus 6% due to other causes. these results highlight the importance of campylobacter as a cause of severe traveler's diarrhea in thailand and illustrates the ongoing problem with antibiotic-resistant strains and associated treatment problems.

TI  == a strategy to retrieve the whole set of protein modules in microbial proteomes.
AB  == protein homology is often limited to long structural segments that we have previously called modules. we describe here a suite of programs used to catalog the whole set of modules present in microbial proteomes. first, the darwin allall program detects homologous segments using thresholds for evolutionary distance and alignment length, and another program classifies these modules. after assembling these homologous modules in families, we further group families which  are related by a chain of neighboring unrelated homologous modules. with the automatic analysis of these groups of families sharing homologous modules in independent multimodular proteins, one can split into their component parts many  fused modules and/or deduce by logic more distant modules. all detected and inferred modules are reassembled in refined families. these two last steps are made by a unique program. eventually, the soundness of the data obtained by this  experimental approach is checked using independent tests. to illustrate this modular approach, we compared four proteobacterial proteomes (campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, and helicobacter pylori). it appears that this method might retrieve from present-day proteins many of the modules which can help to trace back ancient events of gene duplication and/or fusion.

TI  == foodborne disease in the new millennium: out of the frying pan and into the fire?
AB  == about four million cases of foodborne infectious disease occur annually in australia; new foodborne pathogens, such as enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli,  are emerging. climate change, combined with changes in how we produce and distribute food and how we behave as consumers, have the potential to affect foodborne disease in the coming century. foodborne disease outbreaks are now more far-reaching (and sometimes global) due to modern mass food production and widespread food distribution. there are strong seasonal patterns for salmonella and campylobacter infection in australia. global warming may increase the incidence of infections, such as salmonellosis, and diseases caused by toxins, such as ciguatera.

TI  == n-linked glycosylation in campylobacter jejuni and its functional transfer into e. coli.
AB  == n-linked protein glycosylation is the most abundant posttranslation modification  of secretory proteins in eukaryotes. a wide range of functions are attributed to  glycan structures covalently linked to asparagine residues within the asparagine-x-serine/threonine consensus sequence (asn-xaa-ser/thr). we found an n-linked glycosylation system in the bacterium campylobacter jejuni and demonstrate that a functional n-linked glycosylation pathway could be transferred into escherichia coli. although the bacterial n-glycan differs structurally from  its eukaryotic counterparts, the cloning of a universal n-linked glycosylation cassette in e. coli opens up the possibility of engineering permutations of recombinant glycan structures for research and industrial applications.

TI  == impact and management of campylobacter in human medicine--us perspective.
AB  == viruses, enteric bacteria and parasites can all produce similar syndromes of acute enteritis, although the pathophysiology and molecular pathogenesis may vary widely. the severity of acute enteritis varies greatly, and only a small fraction of cases undergo medical evaluation. there are over 200 000 000 episodes of acute enteritis annually in the usa, of which approximately 75 000 000 are foodborne. fewer than 20% of estimated cases have a known etiology. nearly half of the more  than 4 000 000 cases of known foodborne bacterial enteritis are attributed to campylobacter infections. the foodnet active population-based surveillance system has demonstrated geographic variation in the incidence of campylobacter infection, and generally declining incidence since 1996. campylobacter jejuni infections vary in severity and duration. antimicrobial therapy, especially if administered early, may hasten clinical resolution by 2-3 days. therapy is generally restricted to individuals with moderate-to-severe disease and high-risk individuals (underlying immunodeficiency, chronic illness, extremes of age, etc.). approximately 10-15% of c. jejuni isolates are fluoroquinolone resistant,  although most strains are macrolide susceptible. several acute intra-abdominal as well as extraintestinal complications can occur following c jejuni enteritis, although bacteremia and metastatic infection are rare, except in high-risk patients. post-infectious syndromes include post-dysenteric bowel dysfunction, the less frequent but more severe reactive arthritis (1%), and guillain-barre syndrome (0.1%). the recent demonstration that antibiotic administration for escherichia coli o157:h7 hemorrhagic enteritis increases the risk of hemolytic-uremic syndrome 5-10-fold forces reconsideration of empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy for acute hemorrhagic enteritis, and supports narrow-spectrum erythromycin therapy for acute enteritis.

TI  == trends in indigenous foodborne disease and deaths, england and wales: 1992 to 2000.
AB  == background: commitment to food safety is evidenced by high profile governmental initiatives around the globe. to measure progress towards targets, policy makers  need to know the baseline from which they started. aim: to describe the burden (mortality, morbidity, new presentations to general practice, hospital admissions, and hospital occupancy) and trends of indigenous foodborne disease (ifd) in england and wales between 1992 and 2000. methods: routinely available surveillance data, special survey data, and hospital episode statistics were collated and arithmetic employed to estimate the burden and trends of ifd in england and wales. adjustments were made for underascertainment of disease through national surveillance and for foreign travel. the final estimates were compared with those from the usa. results: in 1995 there were an estimated 2,365,909 cases, 21,138 hospital admissions, and 718 deaths in england and wales  due to ifd. by 2000 this had fallen to 1,338,772 cases, 20,759 hospital admissions, and 480 deaths. in terms of disease burden the most important pathogens were campylobacters, salmonellas, clostridium perfringens, verocytotoxin producing escherichia coli (vtec) o157, and listeria monocytogenes. the ratio of food related illness in the usa to ifd in england and wales in 2000  was 57:1. taking into account population rates, this ratio fell to 11:1 and converged when aetiology and disease severity were considered. conclusion: reducing ifd in england and wales means tackling campylobacter. lowering mortality rates however also requires better control and prevention of salmonellas, cl perfringens, l monocytogenes, and vtec o157.

TI  == prediction, assessment and validation of protein interaction maps in bacteria.
AB  == high-throughput proteomics technologies, especially the yeast two-hybrid system,  produce large volumes of protein-protein interaction data organized in networks.  the complete sequencing of many genomes raises questions about the extent to which such networks can be transferred between organisms. we attempted to answer  this question using the experimentally derived helicobacter pylori interaction map and the recently described interacting domain profile pair (idpp) method to predict a virtual map for escherichia coli. the extensive literature concerning e.coli was used to assess all predicted interactions and to validate the idpp method, which clusters protein domains by sequence and connectivity similarities. the idpp method has a much better heuristic value than methods solely based on protein homology. the idpp method was further applied to campylobacter jejuni to  generate a virtual interaction map. an in-depth comparison of the chemotaxis pathways predicted in e.coli and c.jejuni led to the proposition of new functional assignments. finally, the prediction of protein-protein interaction maps across organisms enabled us to validate some of the interactions on the original experimental map.

TI  == trypanosomal dutpases as potential targets for drug design.
AB  == parasites of the trypanosomatidae family are responsible for diseases that afflict several million people worldwide. currently there is an urgent need for new drugs against these diseases and an approach to drug discovery is the study of biochemical and structural properties of a potential target and the subsequent design of specific compounds. trypanosomatid genes coding for enzymes which distinctively hydrolyze dutp have been isolated by genetic complementation in escherichia coli mutants defective in dutpase activity. an analysis of these sequences from leishmania major and trypanosoma cruzi showed that no significant  similarity could be established with the family of known dutpases and that the five consensus motifs were absent. however, limited similarity was identified for three motifs present in an enzyme related in function the dctpase-dutpase from t  phages and 35 percent identity with a putative dutpase identified in the eubacteria campylobacter jejuni. t. cruzi and l. major dutpases were highly similar and catalyzed in a specific fashion the hydrolysis of dutp. a detailed kinetic study of both enzymes revealed that dudp is also an efficient substrate of the enzyme while other nucleotides are poorly hydrolyzed. the enzyme is essential for viability in leishmania and is up-regulated by inhibitors of dtmp synthesis. thus, a new family of dutpases might exist in certain organisms that bear no sequence or structure similarity with eukaryotic enzymes accomplishing the same function and that may constitute potential drug targets for the development of specific inhibitors.

AB  == escherichia coli mg1655 cells expressing novel bacterial hemoglobin and flavohemoglobin genes from a medium-copy-number plasmid were grown in shake flask cultures under nitrosative and oxidative stress. e. coli cells expressing these proteins display enhanced resistance against the no(.) releaser sodium nitroprusside (snp) relative to that of the control strain bearing the parental plasmid. expression of bacterial hemoglobins originating from campylobacter jejuni (chb) and vitreoscilla sp. (vhb) conferred resistance on snp-challenged cells. in addition, it has been shown that no(.) detoxification is also a common  feature of flavohemoglobins originating from different taxonomic groups and can be transferred to a heterologous host. these observations have been confirmed in  a specific in vitro no(.) consumption assay. protein extracts isolated from e. coli strains overexpressing flavohemoglobins consumed authentic no(.) more readily than protein extracts from the wild-type strain. oxidative challenge to the cells evoked nonuniform responses from the various cell cultures. improved oxidative-stress-sustaining properties had also been observed when the flavohemoglobins from e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, deinococcus radiodurans, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were expressed in e. coli.

TI  == functional expression of enterobacterial o-polysaccharide biosynthesis enzymes in bacillus subtilis.
AB  == the expression of heterologous bacterial glycosyltransferases is of interest for  potential application in the emerging field of carbohydrate engineering in gram-positive organisms. to assess the feasibility of using enzymes from gram-negative bacteria, the functional expression of the genes wbap (formerly rfbp), weca (formerly rfe), and wbbo (formerly rfbf) from enterobacterial lipopolysaccharide o-polysaccharide biosynthesis pathways was examined in bacillus subtilis. wbap and weca are initiation enzymes for o-polysaccharide formation, catalyzing the transfer of galactosyl 1-phosphate from udp-galactose and n-acetylglucosaminyl 1-phosphate from udp-n-acetylglucosamine, respectively,  to undecaprenylphosphate. the weca product (undecaprenylpyrophosphoryl glcnac) is used as an acceptor to which the bifunctional wbbo gene product sequentially adds a galactopyranose and a galactofuranose residue from the corresponding udp sugars to form a lipid-linked trisaccharide. genes were cloned into the shuttle vectors  prb374 and paw10. in b. subtilis hosts, the genes were effectively transcribed under the vegii promoter control of prb374, but the plasmids were susceptible to  rearrangements and deletion. in contrast, paw10-based constructs, in which genes  were cloned downstream of the tet resistance cassette, were stable but yielded lower levels of enzyme activity. in vitro glycosyltransferase assays were performed in escherichia coli and b. subtilis, using membrane preparations as sources of enzymes and endogenous undecaprenylphosphate as an acceptor. incorporation of radioactivity from udp-alpha-d-(14)c-sugar into reaction products verified the functionality of wbap, weca, and wbbo in either host. enzyme activities in b. subtilis varied between 20 and 75% of those measured in e. coli.

TI  == evaluation of an immunochromatography strip assay for the detection of salmonella sp. from poultry.
AB  == the present study was conducted to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of an immunochromatography-based diagnostic kit for salmonella. the analytical sensitivity of the test when using pure colonies of different salmonella species  was in the range of 1 x 10(4) to 1 x 10(5) colony-forming units per milliliter. the strip detected 19 of 22 strains of salmonella spp. but failed to detect s. worthington, s. choleraesuis var. kunzendorf and s. johannesburg. the strip did not detect 27 different enteric bacteria, including escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, shigella sonnei, and vibrio parahaemolyticus. in direct testing of feces (n = 66) from chickens infected with salmonella typhimurium, the strip had a sensitivity of 12.3% and a specificity of 100%. evaluation of the strip assay (n = 510) after sample pre-enrichment in 2% buffered peptone water (bpw) yielded a sensitivity of 93.8% and specificity of 89% when compared to isolation and identification with xylose-lysine-tergitol 4 (xlt4) selective plating media. subsequent enrichment in hajna tetrathionate (tt) broth yielded a  higher sensitivity (94.7%) and specificity (96.8%). the agreement (kappa) between the strip test and isolation was 0.004 in direct fecal testing, 0.82 in bpw, and  0.89 in tt broth. the assay could detect salmonella sp. as early as 18-48 hours during pre-enrichment and enrichment compared to isolation on xlt4, which required an overnight incubation step for the presumptive isolation and identification of salmonella.

TI  == cxxs: fold-independent redox motif revealed by genome-wide searches for thiol/disulfide oxidoreductase function.
AB  == redox reactions involving thiol groups in proteins are major participants in cellular redox regulation and antioxidant defense. although mechanistically similar, thiol-dependent redox processes are catalyzed by structurally distinct families of enzymes, which are difficult to identify by available protein function prediction programs. herein, we identified a functional motif, cxxs (cysteine separated from serine by two other residues), that was often conserved  in redox enzymes, but rarely in other proteins. analyses of complete escherichia  coli, campylobacter jejuni, methanococcus jannaschii, and saccharomyces cerevisiae genomes revealed a high proportion of proteins known to use the cxxs motif for redox function. this allowed us to make predictions in regard to redox  function and identity of redox groups for several proteins whose function previously was not known. many proteins containing the cxxs motif had a thioredoxin fold, but other structural folds were also present, and cxxs was often located in these proteins upstream of an alpha-helix. thus, a conserved cxxs sequence followed by an alpha-helix is typically indicative of a redox function and corresponds to thiol-dependent redox sites in proteins. the data also indicate a general approach of genome-wide identification of redox proteins  by searching for simple conserved motifs within secondary structure patterns.

TI  == [ct evaluation of infectious colitis].
AB  == computed tomography (ct) is useful for evaluating the diagnosis of gastrointestinal disease, such as infectious colitis, in patients with severe pain and bloody diarrhea. during the 7 years between november 1993 and october 2000, 34 patients with infectious colitis (18 male, 16 female; mean age 42 +/- 19 yrs), received emergency ct and colonoscopy because of severe abdominal pain and  dysentery. the following organisms were isolated: pathogenic escherichia coli (12), 6 of which were o157:h7 (o-157), salmonella species (11), campylobacter species (5), vibrio parahaemolyticus (3), yersinia enterocolotica (2) and shigella species (1). thickening of the intestinal wall greater than 10 mm was seen in the ascending colon in the 6 cases with e. coli o 157, in 5/11 cases with salmonella, 4/5 with campylobacter and 1/6 with non-o157 pathogenic e. coli. marked intestinal wall thickening, greater than 20 mm, was seen in the ascending  colon of the 4 of the patients with an o-157 infection. in all patients with o-157 colitis, slight ascites was noted in the pelvic space. in additions, ascites was also seen in 3/13 patients with salmonella and 1/5 patients with campylobacter colitis. the ct findings, in the patients with infectious colitis,  are non-specific but knowledge and recognition of the findings will help in patient evaluation and proper treatment.

TI  == detection of escherichia coli o157:h7 using immunomagnetic separation and absorbance measurement.
AB  == an assay system for detection of escherichia coli o157:h7 was developed based on  immunomagnetic separation of the target pathogen from samples and absorbance measurement of p-nitrophenol at 400 nm from p-nitrophenyl phosphate hydrolysis by alkaline phosphatase (ec 3.1.3.1) on the "sandwich" structure complexes (antibodies coated onto micromagnetic beads--e. coli o157:h7-antibodies conjugated with the enzyme) formed on the microbead surface. the effects of immunoreaction time, phosphate buffer concentration, ph and temperature on the immunomagnetic separation of e. coli o157:h7 from samples were determined and the conditions used for the separation were 1-h reaction time, 1.0 x 10(-2) m pbs, ph 8.0 and 33 degrees c in this system. the effects of mgcl(2) concentration, tris buffer concentration, ph and temperature on the activity of alkaline phosphatase  conjugated on the immuno-"sandwich" structure complexes were investigated after immunomagnetic separation of the target pathogen and the conditions used for the  enzymatic amplification were 1.0 x 10(-4) m mgcl(2), 1.0 m tris buffer, ph 8.0, 28 degrees c and 30-min reaction time during the assay. the selectivity of the system was examined and no interference from the other pathogens including salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni and listeria monocytogenes was observed. its working range was from 3.2 x 10(2) to 3.2 x 10(4) cfu/ml, and the relative standard deviation was 2.5-9.9%. the total detection time was less than  2 h.

TI  == environmental regulation of campylobacter jejuni major outer membrane protein porin expression in escherichia coli monitored by using green fluorescent protein.
AB  == porins allow exchanges between bacteria and their environment. in the gram-negative food-borne pathogen campylobacter jejuni two porins, major outer membrane protein (momp) and omp50, have been identified. momp is synthesized at a very high level under laboratory culture conditions, suggesting that its promoter functions very efficiently under these conditions. in campylobacter samples, we observed that momp porin expression increased at a high temperature (42 degrees c) or a high ph (ph 8.5) compared to expression at a low temperature (31 degrees  c) or an acidic ph (ph 5.5). to study the regulation of momp expression at the transcriptional level, we constructed an momp-gfp fusion in which gfp expression  was put under the control of the momp promoter. interestingly, we observed the same pattern of regulation in escherichia coli, as monitored by green fluorescent protein production, that was found in campylobacter: the ranges of ph and temperature tested are physiologically relevant, because they can be found in the digestive tracts of both birds and humans, which are both colonized by campylobacter: our results suggest that a component of the regulatory mechanism is conserved in c. jejuni and e. coli. however, medium osmolarity and sodium salicylate did not have a significant effect on c. jejuni momp promoter activity  in e. coli, suggesting that major regulatory elements of e. coli porin expression do not participate in momp regulation. in contrast, mechanisms involving dna supercoiling may be involved, as shown by dna gyrase inhibition assays. these findings are a step towards determining the role of outer membrane proteins in the adaptation of c. jejuni to its environment.

TI  == helicobacter pylori impairs dna mismatch repair in gastric epithelial cells.
AB  == background & aims: helicobacter pylori infection is a major gastric cancer risk factor. h. pylori gastritis occurs more frequently in individuals with microsatellite instability-positive than those with microsatellite instability-negative gastric cancers, raising the possibility that h. pylori infection affects dna mismatch repair (mmr). the aim of this study was to determine the effect of h. pylori on the expression of dna mmr proteins and rna in gastric epithelial cells. methods: gastric cancer cell lines were cocultured with h. pylori, bacterial extracts, and campylobacter jejuni or escherichia coli. muts (hmsh2 and hmsh6) and mutl (hmlh1, hpms2, and hpms1) dna mmr protein and rna levels were determined. results: all cell lines examined showed decreased levels  of muts and mutl dna mmr proteins in a dose-dependent manner after coculture with h. pylori strains. the reduction in dna mmr protein levels was caused by heat-sensitive h. pylori products. the levels of dna mmr proteins were affected by c. jejuni but not by e. coli. rna levels of hmsh2 and hmsh6 were also reduced  after exposure to h. pylori. conclusions: h. pylori infection of gastric epithelial cells leads to a decrease in dna mmr proteins that is at least in part related to an h. pylori-induced decrease in messenger rna levels of repair genes. these data suggest that h. pylori infection might lead to a deficiency of dna mmr in gastric epithelial cells that may increase the risk of mutation accumulation in gastric mucosa cells and the risk of gastric cancer during chronic h. pylori infection.

TI  == development of an antibiotic resistance monitoring system in hungary.
AB  == because of the rapid development and spread of antimicrobial resistance it is important that a system be established to monitor antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic zoonotic and commensal bacteria of animal origin. susceptibility testing of bacteria from carcasses and different samples of animal origin has been carried out in veterinary institutes for a long time but by an inconsistent  methodology. the disc diffusion method proposed by the national committee for clinical laboratory standards (nccls) was introduced in all institutes in 1997. in order to obtain a coherent view of the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria a  computer system was consulted, consisting of a central computer to store all data and some local computers attached to it through the network. at these local measuring stations computers are connected to a video camera, which displays the  picture of petri dishes on the monitor, and inhibition zone diameters of bacteria can be drawn with the mouse by the inspector. the software measures the diameters, evaluates whether or not the bacteria are sensitive, and stores the data. the evaluation is based upon the data of the nccls. the central computer can be connected to as many local computers with measuring stations as we wish, so it is suitable for an integrated system for monitoring trends in antimicrobial resistance of bacteria from animals, food and humans, facilitating comparison of  the occurrence of resistance for each circumstance in the chain. it depends on the examiners which antibiotics they want to examine. thirty-two different antibiotic panels were compiled, taking into consideration the active ingredients of medicinal products permitted for veterinary use in hungary, natural resistance and cross-resistance, the mechanism of resistance and the animal species, i.e. which drugs were recommended for treatment in the given animal species, and the recommendations of the oie expert group on antimicrobial resistance. the members  of the panels can be changed any time, even during the measuring process. in addition to the inhibition zone diameters of bacteria the database also includes  information about bacterial and animal species, the age of animals and the sample or organ where the bacteria are from. since january 2001 the antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli, salmonella, campylobacter and enterococcus strains isolated from the colons of slaughter cows, pigs and broiler chickens has also been examined. each of the 19 counties of hungary submits to the laboratory three tied colon samples from a herd of the above-mentioned animals every month.

AB  == foodborne infections are the leading cause of health problems during and after travel to areas of low hygienic standards. the majority of cases are traveler's diarrhea. however, some foodborne infections can cause severe or chronic enteritis (e.g. shigellosis, typhoid fever, amebic dysentery, helminth infections), or diseases of other organ systems (e.g. hepatitis a, poliomyelitis, tissue parasitoses). the etiology of traveler's diarrhea is heterogeneous. most common are bacteria, notably enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and rotavirus. new diagnostic methods (pcr, coproantigen-elisa) increase the diagnostic sensitivity and spectrum considerably. microbiological diagnosis is indicated in severe or chronic enteritis, and in the immunocompromized. however, to apply the complete spectrum  of available methods is economically and medically not justified, and the diagnostic work-up has to be done in a step-wise manner. antibiotics like ciprofloxacin are effective in treatment and prevention of traveler's diarrhea. however, the empiric use of antibiotics should be restricted to the treatment of  dysenteric and febrile cases of enteritis. new antisecretory drugs, nonabsorbable antibiotics, and new vaccines against cholera, etec and rotavirus are under clinical development.

TI  == antimicrobial use and resistance in animals.
AB  == food animals in the united states are often exposed to antimicrobials to treat and prevent infectious disease or to promote growth. many of these antimicrobials are identical to or closely resemble drugs used in humans. precise figures for the quantity of antimicrobials used in animals are not publicly available in the  united states, and estimates vary widely. antimicrobial resistance has emerged in zoonotic enteropathogens (e.g., salmonella spp., campylobacter spp.), commensal bacteria (e.g., escherichia coli, enterococci), and bacterial pathogens of animals (e.g., pasteurella, actinobacillus spp.), but the prevalence of resistance varies. antimicrobial resistance emerges from the use of antimicrobials in animals and the subsequent transfer of resistance genes and bacteria among animals and animal products and the environment. to slow the development of resistance, some countries have restricted antimicrobial use in feed, and some groups advocate similar measures in the united states. alternatives to growth-promoting and prophylactic uses of antimicrobials in agriculture include improved management practices, wider use of vaccines, and introduction of probiotics. monitoring programs, prudent use guidelines, and educational campaigns provide approaches to minimize the further development of antimicrobial resistance.

AB  == in this study, we compared a standardized solution of human serum protein (hsp) and fresh frozen plasma (ffp) with regard to the antibody specificity against a number of microbial pathogens and some important pathogenicity factors of bacterial pathogens. due to the clinical use of hsp and ffp for therapeutical plasma exchange, we have chosen a spectrum of microbial pathogens for serological analysis that is critical in clinical settings. with the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique, we could show that hsp contains marked igg antibody reactivity against antigens of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, enterobacter sakazakii, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, chlamydia pneumoniae, and candida albicans. although no igm antibodies against the pathogens tested could be detected in hsp, moderate iga reactivity was found against 4 of 12 microbial antigens. immunoblot analysis  demonstrated specific iga and igg responses against the endoproteinase glu-c and  the superantigens enterotoxin a and b of s. aureus, the iga-protease of neisseria gonorrhoeae, and shiga toxin 2 of enterohemorrhagic e. coli. by using 3 different hsp batches in parallel, we could demonstrate antibody reactivity against important microbial pathogens and toxins. this antibody profile is essentially more homogeneous than that of 3 batches of ffp.

AB  == a prospective study of 62 chemotherapy-induced neutropenic episodes in patients with acute leukaemia was conducted to determine the incidence and causes of abdominal infections, and to assess the diagnostic value of the combined use of ultrasonography (us) and microbiology. each patient underwent us of liver, gallbladder and complete bowel before chemotherapy, on days 2-4 after the end of  chemotherapy and in cases of fever, diarrhoea or abdominal pain. us was combined  with a standardized clinical examination and a broad spectrum of microbiological  investigations. from january to august 2001, 243 us examinations were performed.  the overall incidence of abdominal infectious diseases was 17.7% (11 out of 62, 95% confidence interval (ci): 9-29%). four patients (6.5%) developed neutropenic  enterocolitis; two of them died, two survived. bowel wall thickening (bwt) > 4 mm in these four patients ranged from 5.8 to 23.6 mm and was detected only in one patient with mucositis. in three other patients (4.8%) clostridium difficile, and in one patient (1.6%) campylobacter jejuni, caused enterocolitis without bwt. cholecystitis was diagnosed in three patients (4.8%) and hepatic candidiasis was  strongly suspected in one patient. abdominal infections caused by gastroenteritis viruses, cytomegalovirus (cmv) or cryptosporidium were not observed. we conclude  that in neutropenic patients with acute leukaemia receiving chemotherapy: (i) bwt is not a feature of chemotherapy-induced mucositis and should therefore be considered as sign of infectious enterocolitis; (ii) viruses, classic bacterial enteric pathogens (salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter, aeromonas, vibrio subsp., enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli) and cryptosporidium have a very low incidence; and (iii) abdominal infections may be underestimated when us  is not used in every patient with abdominal pain.

TI  == tropical diarrhoea: new developments in traveller's diarrhoea.
AB  == traveller's diarrhoea is the most common illness acquired by visitors to developing countries, affecting 20-50% of the 35 million people who travel from industrialized countries each year. important risk factors include point of origin and destination of the traveller, host factors, and exposure to contaminated food and water. the most common causes of traveller's diarrhoea in adults in developing countries include infection with escherichia coli, shigella  spp., salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., vibrio parahaemolyticus (in asia), rotavirus (in latin america), and protozoa (giardia, cryptosporidium and cyclospora spp., and entamoeba histolytica). no pathogen is identified in over half of patients with traveller's diarrhoea, however. the primary objectives of treatment of traveller's diarrhoea are to reduce the symptoms and duration of diarrhoeal illness, to reduce inconvenience caused by such illness and to prevent cancellation of planned activities. these important objectives are best accomplished by empirical self-therapy with a combination of antimicrobial agents and loperamide. since the first use of ciprofloxacin, fluoroquinolones have become the drugs of choice in empirical therapy for moderate-to-severe traveller's diarrhoea in adults. the options for children include nalidixic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (along with erythromycin if campylobacter infection is a possibility) and furazolidone. education on hygiene and safe food preparation help to prevent many diarrhoeal diseases, including traveller's diarrhoea.

TI  == comparison of rheumatological and gastrointestinal symptoms after infection with  campylobacter jejuni/coli and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli.
AB  == objectives: to estimate the incidence of postinfectious joint complaints after campylobacter jejuni/coli enteritis compared with enteritis caused by enterotoxigenic e coli (etec). to compare gastrointestinal symptoms, antibiotic treatment, and antibody levels among patients with and without joint symptoms. method: questionnaires were sent to 210 consecutive patients with campylobacter infection and an equal number of patients with e coli (etec). blood samples for anti-campylobacter antibodies were collected after two weeks, three months, six months, and two years. results: twenty seven of 173 (16%) patients with campylobacter and 10/177 (6%) with e coli (etec) reported joint symptoms (p=0.004). in the campylobacter group duration of diarrhoea was a median of 13 days for patients with arthralgia and seven days for those without joint pain (p=0.0058). patients with e coli had diarrhoea of longer duration than patients infected with campylobacter (14 days v seven days; p=0.0005). e coli patients had fewer gastrointestinal symptoms than campylobacter patients (p=0.0001). fifty nine per cent of campylobacter patients with joint pain had received antibiotic treatment because of enteritis compared with 26% with enteritis only (p=0.03). campylobacter species and serotypes were equally distributed in both groups and there was no difference in anti-campylobacter antibody levels between the groups. conclusion: there was a significantly increased risk of developing joint symptoms after contracting campylobacter infection compared with e coli. campylobacter patients with joint pain had more severe gastrointestinal symptoms and longer duration of diarrhoea. antibiotic treatment does not seem to prevent reactive joint symptoms. levels of anti-campylobacter antibodies were the same in both groups.

TI  == microbial evaluation of selected fresh produce obtained at retail markets.
AB  == the microbial quality of five types of fresh produce obtained at the retail level was determined by standard quantitative techniques. these techniques included aerobic plate count (apc), total coliform counts, escherichia coli counts, and yeast and mold counts. three different methods were used to determine total coliform counts, which consisted of macconkey agar plate counts, colicomplete most probable number counts, and petrifilm e. coli (ec) plate counts. the mean apcs for sprouts, lettuce, celery, cauliflower, and broccoli were 8.7, 8.6, 7.5,  7.4. and 6.3 log10 cfu/g, respectively. macconkey agar counts indicated that 89 to 96% of the apcs consisted of gram-negative bacteria. yeast and mold counts were in a range expected of fresh produce. fresh produce was also analyzed for human pathogens. samples were analyzed for staphylococcus spp., bacillus spp., salmonella spp., listeria spp., and campylobacter spp. one isolate of staphylococcus was found to be enterotoxigenic, and one species of bacillus was also toxigenic. neither salmonella spp. nor campylobacter spp. were detected in any of the produce samples. a variety of listeria spp., including listeria monocytogenes, were found in fresh produce.

TI  == characterization of the campylobacter jejuni heptosyltransferase ii gene, waaf, provides genetic evidence that extracellular polysaccharide is lipid a core independent.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni produces both lipooligosaccharide (los) and a higher-molecular-weight polysaccharide that is believed to form a capsule. the role of these surface polysaccharides in c. jejuni-mediated enteric disease is unclear; however, epitopes associated with the los are linked to the development  of neurological complications. in escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium the waaf gene encodes a heptosyltransferase, which catalyzes  the transfer of the second l-glycero-d-manno-heptose residue to the core oligosaccharide moiety of lipopolysaccharide (lps), and mutation of waaf results  in a truncated core oligosaccharide. in this report we confirm experimentally that c. jejuni gene cj1148 encodes the heptosyltransferase ii enzyme, waaf. the campylobacter waaf gene complements an s. enterica serovar typhimurium waaf mutation and restores the ability to produce full-sized lipopolysaccharide. to examine the role of waaf in c. jejuni, waaf mutants were constructed in strains nctc 11168 and nctc 11828. loss of heptosyltransferase activity resulted in the production of a truncated core oligosaccharide, failure to bind specific ligands, and loss of serum reactive gm(1), asialo-gm(1), and gm(2) ganglioside epitopes. the mutation of waaf did not affect the higher-molecular-weight polysaccharide supporting the production of a los-independent capsular polysaccharide by c. jejuni. the exact structural basis for the truncation of the core oligosaccharide was verified by comparative chemical analysis. the nctc 11168 core oligosaccharide differs from that known for hs:2 strain ccug 10936 in possessing  an extra terminal disaccharide of galactose-beta(1,3) n-acetylgalactosamine. in comparison, the waaf mutant possessed a truncated molecule consistent with that observed with waaf mutants in other bacterial species.

TI  == comparative antibiotic resistance of diarrheal pathogens from vietnam and thailand, 1996-1999.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance rates for shigella, campylobacter, nontyphoidal salmonella, and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were compared for vietnam and thailand from 1996 to 1999. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline was common. quinolone resistance remains low in both countries, except among campylobacter and salmonella organisms in thailand. nalidixic acid resistance among salmonellae has more than  doubled since 1995 (to 21%) in thailand but is not yet documented in vietnam. resistance to quinolones correlated with resistance to azithromycin in both campylobacter and salmonella in thailand. this report describes the first identification of this correlation and its epidemiologic importance among clinical isolates. these data illustrate the growing magnitude of antibiotic resistance and important differences between countries in southeast asia.

TI  == microbiological consequences of skin removal prior to evisceration of broiler carcasses.
AB  == the objective of this project was to determine if removal of skin prior to evisceration lowers the number of bacteria that can be recovered by whole carcass rinse or sponge sampling. four experiments were conducted, two with each type of  sampling (rinse or sponge). new york dressed carcasses obtained from a commercial broiler processing plant were aseptically skinned or left with skin intact. the carcasses were then aseptically eviscerated by hand. carcasses were rinsed in 100 ml sterile water or sampled by moist sponge. when sampled by rinse, significantly fewer campylobacter and total aerobic bacteria were recovered from carcasses that had been skinned prior to evisceration. when sampled by sponge, significantly fewer campylobacter, escherichia coli, coliform and total aerobic bacteria were recovered from the outer surface of carcasses without skin. no differences were noted for bacterial counts recovered from internal surfaces by sponge sampling. similar trends were observed when carcasses were subjected to an inside and outside washing step after evisceration. removal of skin and washing the carcass  led to significantly less campylobacter being recovered by whole carcass rinse compared to carcasses that were washed with the skin on. when sampled by sponge,  incidence of campylobacter and level of total aerobic bacterial counts were lower on the outer surface of skinned and washed carcasses than on washed carcasses with intact skin. like the unwashed carcasses, no differences were noted for bacterial counts recovered from internal surfaces by sponge sampling. although not commercially practical, it is possible to lower the level of campylobacter on the outside of broiler carcasses by removal of the skin prior to evisceration.

TI  == variation in numbers of bacteria on paired chicken carcass halves.
AB  == bacterial counts from paired broiler carcass halves were examined for relationships between numbers and kinds of bacteria that might indicate fecal contamination. broiler carcasses removed from a commercial processing plant just  before chilling were split aseptically along the midline, and each side was rinsed in 400 ml of phosphate buffered saline for 1 min with either mechanical or hand shaking. both halves of six carcasses were rinsed on four different days for a total of 24 carcasses sampled with each shaking method. aerobic bacteria, coliforms, escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni were enumerated and summed  to obtain whole carcass counts. there were no significant (p < 0.05) differences  in numbers of bacteria recovered by the two rinse methods. in left-right comparisons, only e. coli was significantly different (p = 0.04), with the right  side having higher counts (least-square means of 1.09 vs. 0.97). for aerobic plate count (apc), coliforms, e. coli, and campylobacter, correlations between paired left and right side counts were between 0.78 and 0.86. the correlation between whole carcass counts and absolute left-right differences was significant  for apc (0.43), but was not significant for coliforms, e. coli, and campylobacter, so higher whole carcass counts were not associated with higher counts on one side of the carcass. correlations between different bacteria on whole carcasses were significant for e. coli-apc (0.39), e. coli-coliforms (0.67), and apc-coliforms (0.71), but other combinations had non-significant correlations. the correlation was not significant between e. coli and campylobacter, a relatively fragile organism whose presence can be interpreted to indicate fairly recent fecal contamination. there were no indications that high e. coli counts on inspection-passed, prechill carcasses indicated recent fecal contamination.

TI  == should all stool specimens be routinely tested for clostridium difficile?
AB  == objective: to determine the frequency with which clostridium difficile was detected in stool specimens from outpatients and patients hospitalized for less than 4 days to assess the usefulness of routine laboratory screening for detecting this enteric pathogen. methods: seven hundred and forty-one specimens from 398 patients were cultured over a 6-month period for salmonella, shigella, yersinia, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter and clostridium difficile. clostridium difficile culture-positive samples were further tested for cytotoxin  production. results: campylobacter, salmonella, shigella and e. coli o157:h7 were isolated in 50 (6.7%) specimens from 35 (8.8%) patients. clostridium difficile was cultured from 88 (11.9%) specimens from 35 (8.8%) patients and its cytotoxin  detected in 35 (4.7%) specimens of 12 (3%) patients. clostridium difficile was the second most frequent enteric pathogen after campylobacter. of 178 (24%) specimens submitted with a specific request for clostridium difficile testing, 13 (7.3%) were cytotoxin positive (three patients); of 563 specimens for which clostridium difficile was not requested, 22 (3.9%) were cytotoxin positive (nine  patients). conclusions: nine of 12 patients with cytotoxin-positive specimens would have gone undiagnosed in the laboratory had all stool samples submitted not been tested. these results suggest that clostridium difficile disease is under-recognized and that testing all stool samples for clostridium difficile may be warranted in our community of patients.

TI  == update on traveler's diarrhea.
AB  == diarrhea is one of the most common health problems among travelers. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is implicated most commonly, enteroaggregative e. coli has recently been described as a major pathogen. shigella, campylobacter, and salmonella organisms are less common causes of acute diarrhea, and intestinal protozoa are typical causes of protracted diarrhea. although education is the mainstay of prevention measures, behavior modification has been shown to be difficult. chemoprevention is rarely required with the availability of effective  treatment, but there has been some interest in the use of vaccines. maintenance of hydration is most important in children. in addition to bismuth preparations and loperamide, newer agents being developed for symptomatic relief include zaldaride maleate and racecadotril. fluoroquinolones effectively treat severe traveler's diarrhea, and even a single dose may be sufficient. however, with the  emergence of resistance, particularly in campylobacter infection, other agents are required; interest has focused on azithromycin and rifaximin.

TI  == prevalence and diversity of arcobacter spp. isolated from the internal organs of  spontaneous porcine abortions in denmark.
AB  == a study was conducted to determine the prevalence and possible significance of campylobacteria in pig abortions in denmark. surface-cauterised liver and kidney  samples from 55 aborted pig fetuses submitted to the danish veterinary laboratory were taken and a sensitive isolation procedure used to examine pooled tissue samples for campylobacter, arcobacter and helicobacter spp. routine microbiological, immunological, and histopathological examinations were also performed to identify concurrent infections or histopathological changes. the abortions tested negative for established abortifacient pathogens (brucella, leptospira, ppv, prrsv), but arcobacter spp. were recovered from 23/55 abortions. co-infections with streptococcus suis, escherichia coli, and haemolytic streptococci were observed in 7/23 arcobacter-positive fetuses, and in 4/32 arcobacter-negative fetuses. histopathological analyses identified placentitis, pneumonia, hepatitis and encephalitis among the study group. however, no obvious  pathologic features were solely associated with arcobacter-positive cases, nor were arcobacter-like bacteria observed in tissue samples. protein profile analyses of the 27 arcobacter isolates identified 11 as a. cryaerophilus and 10 as a. skirrowii. six strains could not be classified into any existing species and were phenotypically distinct, thus, potentially representing at least one new species. the identification results showed that multiple taxa could be found in a single fetus, and in distinct aborted fetuses from a single sow. the high prevalence of arcobacters in danish pig abortions may account for at least some of the >90% of cases in which no established abortifacient agent is detected, but further studies are needed to define the role of each species, especially where co-infections with other bacteria are present.

TI  == [acute gastroenteritis in hospitalized children. 14-year evolution].
AB  == objectives: to analyze the etiology and evolution of patients with acute gastroenteritis hospitalized in our pediatric department and to study the clinical and laboratory differences between acute viral and bacterial gastroenteritis. patients and methods: we studied the children with a diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis, aged between 0 and 14 years, who were consecutively admitted between 1987 and 2000. differences were considered statistically significant if p < 0.05. results: a total of 2,613 patients diagnosed with acute  gastroenteritis were hospitalized (10.4 % of hospital admissions). the most common pathogens isolated were rotaviruses (46.5 %), followed by salmonella (32.6 %) and campylobacter (19.3 %). hospital admissions due to salmonella (p < 0.0001), other bacteria (escherichia coli and shigella) (p < 0.002) and adenoviruses (p < 0.01) significantly decreased. rotaviruses were the most frequently detected pathogens in winter and in children aged less than 1 year (p  < 0.0001). the incidence of salmonella spp was greater in summer and in children  older than 2 years (p < 0.0001). the incidence of hyperthermia (rectal temperature higher than 38.5 degreec) (p < 0.0001), dehydration (p < 0.0005) and  fecal blood (p < 0.0001) was higher in bacterial diarrheas. erythrocyte sedimentation rate (p < 0.001) and leukocyte counts were higher in bacterial gastroenteritis (p < 0.01). conclusions: rotaviruses were the most frequently isolated enteropathogens. the features that best distinguished between bacterial  and viral diarrhea were hyperthermia and fecal blood. hospital admissions due to  salmonella shigella e. coli, and adenoviruses significantly decreased.

AB  == the gene coding for o-acetylserine lyase (oasl) was cloned from a selenomonas ruminantium hd4 lambda zap ii genomic library by degenerative probe hybridization and complementation. sequence analysis revealed a 933 bp orf with a g + c content of 53%. the orf had significant homology with enzymes involved in cysteine biosynthesis. a curablastn homology search showed that the orf shared 59% nucleotide identity with the cysk of bacillus subtilis. the deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high (>70%) similarity with the cysk of b. subtilis and other  cysteine synthesis proteins from mycobacterium tuberculosis, mycobacterium leprae, and spinacia oleracea. further analysis predicted that the gene product was a member of the pyridoxal phosphate enzyme family and of cytoplasmic origin.  phylogenetic analysis clustered the s. ruminantium gene product with the oasla isoform of b. subtilis and the oaslb isoforms of streptococcus suis, escherichia  coli, and campylobacter jejuni. the oasl of s. ruminantium hd4 was also able to complement the cysm cysk double mutations in escherichia coli nk3 and allow for growth on minimal media that contained either sulfate or thiosulfate as the sole  source of sulfur. these results suggest that the gene functions as a cysm in s. ruminantium hd4. in conclusion, this research describes the cloning and expression of an o-acetylserine lyase gene from the predominant ruminal anaerobe  s. ruminantium hd4. to our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing genes involved in sulfur metabolism from the genus selenomonas.

TI  == production and application of new monoclonal antibodies specific for a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to establish monoclonal antibodies that could be used to produce a diagnostic test composed of one kind of monoclonal antibody recognizing a fecal helicobacter pylori antigen. the need to develop such a test  arose from disadvantages of the diagnostic test that uses a polyclonal antibody or plural kinds of monoclonal antibodies, such as the lower specificity for h. pylori antigen and the difficulty of reproduction with consistent quality. mice were immunized with sonicated cells of the coccoid form of h. pylori, and fecal samples from h. pylori-positive subjects were screened by a direct sandwich enzyme immunoassay (eia) for antibody production from 32 hybridoma clones. the three stable clones produced antibodies (21g2, 41a5, and 82b9) that reacted with  the same soluble antigen. gel filtration chromatography showed that the molecular masses of the cellular antigen and the fecal antigen were the same, 260 kda. the  antigen was labile in response to sodium dodecyl sulfate and heat treatments. a single-step direct sandwich eia using a single monoclonal antibody, 21g2, was developed. the eia could detect the antigen in 41 h. pylori clinical isolates and in fecal samples from seven h. pylori-positive subjects. several kinds of helicobacter species (helicobacter felis, helicobacter hepaticus, helicobacter mustelae, and helicobacter cinaedi) except h. pylori, major bacteria in feces (campylobacter jejuni, bacteroides vulgatus, bifidobacterium breve, bifidobacterium infantis, and escherichia coli), and fecal samples from six h. pylori-negative subjects showed negative results. these results indicate that the new monoclonal antibodies and the new specific eia would be useful as a noninvasive method of diagnosis of h. pylori infection.

TI  == pathogenic-bacterial water contamination in mountainous catchments.
AB  == this space-time study of bacteriological response compared the presence of pathogens with indicators contained in surface and groundwater in mountainous regions. a systematic search for bacteria such as listeria, salmonella, campylobacter and yersinia carried out simultaneously with a search for indicators has shown that these waters can occasionally contain potentially pathogens, though these are generally to be found in small quantities. the most common pathogens found are campyobacter and listeria. salmonella has never been isolated. the presence of pathogens is usually accompanied by the presence of classic indicators of contamination such as escherichia coli, enterococci and other aerobic bacteria. exceptions are only to be observed in cases of samples presenting very low numbers of pathogens. such low pathogen levels have a minimal impact on human health; but we cannot exclude that, during periods affected by specific conditions, higher levels might temporarily occur. our research has demonstrated that classic indicators can be considered as efficient detectors of  pathogens in most cases. when these indicators are used systematically and regularly, the human health hazard can be qualified as low but not negligible. the presence of pathogens, together with their survival capacity, brings the protection measures currently applied to safeguard drinking waters sharply into question.

AB  == a total of 825 samples of retail raw meats (chicken, turkey, pork, and beef) were examined for the presence of escherichia coli and salmonella serovars, and 719 of these samples were also tested for campylobacter spp. the samples were randomly obtained from 59 stores of four supermarket chains during 107 sampling visits in  the greater washington, d.c., area from june 1999 to july 2000. the majority (70.7%) of chicken samples (n = 184) were contaminated with campylobacter, and a  large percentage of the stores visited (91%) had campylobacter-contaminated chickens. approximately 14% of the 172 turkey samples yielded campylobacter, whereas fewer pork (1.7%) and beef (0.5%) samples were positive for this pathogen. a total of 722 campylobacter isolates were obtained from 159 meat samples; 53.6% of these isolates were campylobacter jejuni, 41.3% were campylobacter coli, and 5.1% were other species. of the 212 chicken samples, 82 (38.7%) yielded e. coli, while 19.0% of the beef samples, 16.3% of the pork samples, and 11.9% of the turkey samples were positive for e. coli. however, only 25 (3.0%) of the retail meat samples tested were positive for salmonella. significant differences in the bacterial contamination rates were observed for the four supermarket chains. this study revealed that retail raw meats are often  contaminated with food-borne pathogens; however, there are marked differences in  the prevalence of such pathogens in different meats. raw retail meats are potential vehicles for transmitting food-borne diseases, and our findings stress  the need for increased implementation of hazard analysis of critical control point (haccp) and consumer food safety education efforts.

TI  == an antibody-immobilized capillary column as a bioseparator/bioreactor for detection of escherichia coil o157:h7 with absorbance measurement.
AB  == a capillary-column-based bioseparator/bioreactor was developed for detection of escherichia coli o157:h7 by chemically immobilizing anti-e. coli o157:h7 antibodies onto the inner wall of the column, forming the "sandwich" immunocomplexes (immobilized antibody-e. coli o157: h7-enzyme-labeled antibody) after the sample and the enzyme-labeled antibody passed through the column and detecting the absorbance of the product in the bioreactor with an optical detector. the effects of the blocking agent, flow rate of samples and substrates, buffer, mgcl2, and ph on the detection of e. coli o157:h7 were investigated. the  parameters, 2% bsa in 1.0 x 10-2 m, ph 7.4, pbs as the blocking agent, 0.5 ml/h as the sample flow rate, 1.0 x 10(-2) m mgcl2, and 2.0 x 10(-4) m p-nitrophenyl phosphate in 1.0 m, ph 9.0 tris buffer as the substrate for the enzymatic reaction, and 1.0 ml/h as the substrate flow rate, were used in the bioseparator/bioreactor system for detection of e. coli o157:h7. the selectivity  of the system was checked, and other pathogens, including salmonella typhimurium, campylobacterjejuni, and listeria monocytogenes, had no interference with the detection of e. coli o157:h7. its working range was from 5.0 x 10(2) to 5.0 x 10(6) cfu/ml, and the total assay time was < 1.5 h without any enrichment. the relative standard deviation was approximately 2.0-7.3%.

TI  == trichuris suis: detection of antibacterial activity in excretory-secretory products from adults.
AB  == antibacterial activity was detected in excretory-secretory products (esp) of adult trichuris suis cultured in vitro in serum-free media. gram-negative bacteria (campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and escherichia coli) and gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus) were sensitive to esp. susceptibility was dependent on the concentration of esp but not on the inoculum  size. preliminary assessment of the mode of action suggests a bacteriocidal mechanism. this antibacterial activity was heat stable and resistant to digestion with pronase e and trypsin. based on ultrafiltration experiments, the activity is less than 10,000 mw. this excreted/secreted antibacterial activity from t. suis is likely a component of a humoral defense system for this helminth.

TI  == prevalence of foodborne pathogens in bulk tank milk.
AB  == bulk tank milk from 131 dairy herds in eastern south dakota and western minnesota was examined for the presence of for foodborne pathogens. campylobacter jejuni, shiga-toxin producing escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella spp.,  and yersinia enterocolitica were detected in 9.2, 3.8, 4.6, 6.1, and 6.1% of bulk tank milk samples, respectively. thirty-five of 131 (26.7%) bulk tank milk samples contained one or more species of pathogenic bacteria. isolates of salmonella belonged to group d (n = 4), b (n = 2), c (n = 1), and e (n = 1) "o" serogroups. all six isolates of listeria monocytogenes were identified as o antigen type 1. four of five isolates of e. coli encoded for the shiga-toxin 2 gene, while one strain encoded for the shiga-toxin 1 gene. escherichia coli o157:h7 was not isolated from bulk tank milk samples. based on autoagglutination  testing, it was inferred that all eight isolates of yersinia enterocolitica were  likely to be virulent. non a-grade (manufacturing grade) raw milk producers were  at a higher risk (odd's ratio, 4.98; confidence interval, 1.96 to 12.22) of having one or more pathogens in their bulk tank milk than were grade a producers. it was observed that 21 of 79 (26.6%) dairy producers who consumed raw milk had one or more pathogenic bacteria in their bulk tank milk. the findings of the study warrant the need for educational programs for dairy producers about the risks associated with consumption of raw milk.

TI  == bacterial aetiology and anti-microbial resistance of childhood diarrhoea in yemen.
AB  == in a 12-month period, 561 stool cultures from yemeni children aged 1-60 months and presenting with diarrhoea, were analysed to identify the bacterial aetiology  and their anti-microbial resistance to the commonly used antibiotics. a total of  190 (33.9 per cent) were positive for bacterial culture. most of the positive cultures (58 per cent) were from children aged 1-12 months. the majority of the positive cultures were enteropathogenic escherichia coli (58.4 per cent) salmonella spp., and shigella spp. (20 per cent each). campylobacter were found to be an extremely uncommon agent of childhood diarrhoea making only 1.6 per cent of the positive cultures. the majority of the salmonella were group c (60.5 per cent) and group b (29 per cent). of the shigella isolates, 13 (34 per cent) were  s. flexneri, and seven (18 per cent) s. dysentrea. more than two-thirds of the salmonella isolates were resistant to nalidixic acid, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, and amoxycillin, while 42 per cent were resistant to  cefotaxime. most of the shigella isolates were susceptible to nalidixic acid and  cefotaxime, and resistant to the other antibiotics. all the tested enteropathogenic e. coli isolates were resistant to amoxycillin, 83 per cent were resistant to co-trimoxazole, 62 per cent to chloramphenicol, and 54 per cent to gentamicin, while only 16 and 6 per cent were resistant to nalidixic acid and cefotaxime, respectively. this study, the first in yemen, draws attention to the  urgent need of a national surveillance system, essential for the containment of anti-microbial resistance.

TI  == pathogenesis of infectious diarrhea.
AB  == a brief overview of some of the main features involved in normal physiological bi-directional absorption and secretion of fluid in the gut is given, including the nature and cellular location of key enzymes, ion pumps, symports, antiports and diffusion channels; the microanatomy of intestinal villous vasculature and the dynamics of villus blood flow, which together generate hypertonic zones in villus tip regions; and the production, differentiation, escalator movement (from crypt to villus tip) and subsequent shedding of intestinal epithelial cells. (neural and hormonal mechanisms that regulate normal mucosal ion transport are not discussed.) the manner in which vibrio cholerae, several pathotypes of escherichia coli, several salmonella serotypes, rotavirus, campylobacter species, shigella dysenteriae, yersinia species and clostridium difficile perturb these mechanisms and cause diarrhea, is discussed. throughout the article, the main emphasis is on experimental studies designed to elucidate biological mechanisms and (where relevant) the microbial determinants responsible for diarrheal disease. allusions are also made to the involvement of host responses such as the inflammatory response, the production and release of potent cytokines and accelerated homeostatic responses (such as increased rates of crypt cell division seen in some infections), and the role that they play in pathophysiological fluid secretion.

TI  == prospective study of the incidence of diarrhoea and prevalence of bacterial pathogens in a cohort of vietnamese children along the red river.
AB  == we prospectively studied diarrhoea incidence among 1655 children < 5 years of age in northern vietnam for 1 year using primarily passive surveillance. standard culture methods were used to detect bacterial pathogens. overall 2160 cases occurred (13 cases/child per year). peak rates of diarrhoea occurred in children  < 12 months old. rates ranged from 3.3 cases/child per year in children < 1 year  old, to 0.7 cases/child per year in 4-year-olds. campylobacter, shigella and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli were most commonly isolated. rates detected by active surveillance were about twice those detected passively. s. flexneri was the most common shigella serogroup (65 %). s. flexneri serotypes 6, 4, 1 and y were most common, but 40% were untypable using commercial antisera. the data illustrate important regional differences in pathogen prevalence and shigella serotype distribution. shigella vaccine development strategies, commonly targeting s. flexneri 2a, s. sonnei and s. dysenteriae 1, will have little impact on diarrhoea rates in vietnam.

TI  == [impact on public health of quinolone resistance in animal-origin bacteria].
AB  == fluoroquinolones are one of the most useful classes of antimicrobial agents used  in human and animal medicine today, both because of their spectrum and their physicochemical properties. the use of quinolones in animals is a matter of special concern because it could contribute to the acquisition of resistance in foodborn bacteria (such as salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli) and this, in turn, could lead to a reduction in the efficacy of such compounds in treating infections in humans. however, the causal relationship between the use of fluoroquinolones in veterinary medicine and the isolation of fluoroquinolone-resistant bacteria in humans has not been generally proven and, moreover, the use of fluoroquinolones in animals is only one of the many factors  implicated in the resistance to these antimicrobials. even so, the surveillance of fluoroquinolone resistance in bacteria isolated from animals and foods and the prudent use of these antimicrobials in animals should have the highest priority.

TI  == dietary effects on the microbiological safety of food.
AB  == the high mortality rate associated with human infections caused by escherichia coli strains of the serotype o157:h7 has brought to public attention the importance of ruminants as reservoirs of food-borne pathogens. in addition to established examples such as salmonella, campylobacter and listeria, recent evidence is emerging of the role of food in the transmission of helicobacter pylori and mycobacterium paratuberculosis. food-borne pathogens harboured by ruminants are spread through shedding in the faeces and subsequent faecal contamination of raw food. ruminant shedding appears to be affected by diet and,  of particular concern, may be increased during fasting regimens imposed during transport to the slaughterhouse. the survival of food-borne pathogens in the ruminant gut is affected by many factors including microbe-microbe interactions,  interactions involving plant metabolites and the presence of inhibitory end-product metabolites such as short-chain fatty acids. the potential importance of digesta flow and bacterial detachment in shedding of food-borne pathogens is discussed. experimental procedures with dangerous pathogens have constraints, particularly in animal experimentation. this situation may be overcome by the use of rumen-simulating fermentors. one such system which, like the natural rumen, has a different turnover rate for solid and liquid digesta, was found to maintain rumen-like variables over an 11 d period. this system may prove useful for the study of dietary effects on food-borne pathogens.

TI  == [the current antimicrobial resistance situation in swiss veterinary medicine].
AB  == antimicrobial susceptibility data (n = 1501) and bacterial isolates (n = 258) of  important bacterial pathogens from animals were collected in collaboration with eight swiss laboratories from may 1999 to february 2000. using these data, the antimicrobial resistance situation could be assessed for the following bacterial  species: escherichia coli, salmonella, haemophilus parasuis, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, pasteurella multocida, mannheimia haemolytica, bordetella bronchiseptica, campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, streptococci, and enterococci. differences in the distribution of resistance between animal species could be evidenced in e. coli and salmonella. some resistance frequency data were compared with those obtained in 1980. a significant increase of resistance frequency was observed for several antibiotics. this includes in particular an increase of ampicillin, gentamicin, and cotrimoxazole resistance in e. coli. a similar increase was observed in salmonella for ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, and nalidixic  acid. staphylococci from dogs (s. intermedius and s. aureus) also presented a clear increase of resistance for penicillin, neomycin, sulfonamides, cotrimoxazole, and erythromycin. finally, a comparison with data from abroad shows that the antibiotic resistance situation in switzerland is relatively favorable.

TI  == acute diarrhoea in children treated in an outpatient setting in athens, greece.
AB  == objective: to describe the epidemiology and aetiology of acute diarrhoea among children treated exclusively in an outpatient setting in greece. methods: during  1999, children with acute diarrhoea who attended the emergency department of our  hospital were prospectively studied. patients requiring hospitalization were excluded. stool specimens were tested microscopically, for bacterial enteropathogens by standard and selective medium cultures and for rotavirus and adenovirus by latex agglutination test. results: one hundred and thirty-two children (median age: 2 years) were included in the study; an enteropathogen was  detected in 63 (48%) of them. isolates included rotavirus (19 patients), salmonella sp (12), campylobacter sp (10), aeromonas sp (9), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (6), adenovirus (6), giardia lamblia (4), yersinia enterocolitica (2) and shigella sp (1). half of the bacterial cases occurred from august to october, and two rotavirus-associated peaks occurred during february and august. acute diarrhoea caused by viruses affected exclusively children under six years of age, mainly those attending day care centres. macroscopic blood in stools was reported only among patients with a bacterial infection. socioeconomic characteristics were not helpful in differentiating disease due to specific enteropathogens. conclusions: bacterial enteropathogens account for a significant proportion of acute diarrhoea in children treated in the outpatient setting in greece. rotavirus is also a frequent cause affecting mostly younger children and  those attending day care centers. the presence of blood in stools and the seasonality of bacterial infections may enable their presumptive diagnosis.

TI  == emerging food-borne pathogens.
AB  == the epidemiology of foodborne diseases is changing. while in many developing nations the efficient treatment of diarrhoeal diseases through oral rehydration has probably led to the prevention of many food related deaths, the underlying problems have not been solved. in these countries, the disease incidence of food-and waterborne disease is still increasing, and now data from other parts of the world indicate that new foodborne pathogens have emerged as important public  health problems. over the last two decades, bacterial infections caused by campylobacter and enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli have emerged, well-recognized pathogens, such as salmonella eoteritidis, have increased dramatically in disease incidence and important foodborne pathogens have become increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. the future strategy for prevention of foodborne disease should be founded in scientifically based evaluations of the whole food production chain 'from farm to table', including a  description of the most important (risk) factors. epidemiological studies of outbreaks as well as sporadic cases should be aimed at a better understanding of  these factors. in terms of public health importance of the problem, the focus should be on the size of the problem, and the potential for improvement. the indications are that both in developed and developing countries there is significant potential for an improvement of the situation. with this aim in mind, international effort should focus on scientific assessments of the potential for  risk reduction under different regional conditions.

TI  == hemolytic-uremic syndrome and escherichia coli o121 at a lake in connecticut, 1999.
AB  == objective: non-o157 shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli (stec) have emerged as an important public health problem. outbreaks attributed to non-o157 stec rarely  are reported. in 1999, follow-up of routine surveillance reports of children with hemolytic- uremic syndrome (hus) identified a small cluster of 3 cases of hus, all of whom had spent overlapping time in a connecticut lake community in the week before onset of symptoms. we conducted an investigation to determine the magnitude and source of the outbreak and to determine risk factors associated with the transmission of illness. methods: we conducted a cohort study and an environmental investigation. the study population included all people who were at the lake in a defined geographic area during july 16-25, 1999. this time and area were chosen on the basis of interviews with the 3 hus case-patients. a case was defined as diarrhea (>/=3 loose stools/d for >/=3 days) in a person who was at the lake during july 16-25, 1999. stool samples were requested from any lake resident with diarrheal illness. stools were cultured for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and e coli o157. broth cultures of stools were tested for shiga toxin. case-patients were asked to submit a serum specimen for antibody testing to lipopolysaccharides of selected stec. environmental samples from sediment, drinking water, lake water, and ice were obtained and cultured for e coli and tested for shiga toxin. an environmental evaluation of the lake was conducted to  identify any septic, water supply system, or other environmental condition that could be related to the outbreak. results: information was obtained for 436 people from 165 (78%) households. eleven (2.5%) people had illnesses that met the case definition, including the 3 children with hus. the attack rate was highest among those who were younger than 10 years and who swam in the lake on july 17 or 18 (12%; relative risk [rr]: 7.3). illness was associated with swimming (rr = 8.3) and with swallowing water while swimming (rr = 7.0) on these days. no person who swam only after july 18 developed illness. clinical characteristics of case-patients included fever (27%), bloody diarrhea (27%), and severe abdominal cramping (73%). only the 3 children with hus required hospitalization. no bacterial pathogen was isolated from the stool of any case-patient. among lake residents outside the study area, e coli o121:h19 was obtained from a shiga toxin-producing isolate from a toddler who swam in the lake. serum was obtained from 7 of 11 case-patients. six of 7 case-patients had e coli o121 antibody titers that ranged from 1:320 to >1:20 480. e coli indicative of fecal contamination was identified from sediment and water samples taken from a storm drain that emptied into the beach area and from a stream bed located between 2 houses, but no shiga toxin-producing strain was identified. conclusions: our findings are consistent with a transient local beach contamination in mid-july, probably with e coli o121:h19, which seems to be able to cause severe illness. without hus surveillance, this outbreak may have gone undetected by public health officials. this outbreak might have been detected sooner if shiga toxin screening had been conducted routinely in hus cases. laboratory testing that relies solely  on the inability of an isolate to ferment sorbitol will miss non-o157 stec, such  as e coli o121. serologic testing can be used as an adjunct in the diagnosis of stec infections. lake-specific recommendations included education, frequent water sampling, and alternative means for toddlers to use lake facilities.

TI  == prevalence of salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli on ostrich carcasses and the susceptibility of ostrich-origin e. coli isolates to various antibiotics.
AB  == there has been limited research on the prevalence of foodborne pathogens such as  escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, and campylobacter on ostrich carcasses. likewise, few studies have been done in ostriches to determine the antimicrobial  susceptibilities of common bacteria, like e. coli. in this study, ostrich carcasses were sampled from eight slaughterhouses in ohio and one in indiana. although results demonstrated no e. coli o157:h7 from the carcasses sampled, 91%  (116/128) of the dressed carcasses sampled had e. coli present. one carcass sample (1/152) was positive for salmonella. campylobacter were detected in 10% (19/191) of the carcasses. antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 93 carcass e.  coli isolates showed resistance to erythromycin (99%), neomycin (65%), netilmicin (2%), oxytetracycline (22%), streptomycin (2%), and trimethoprim (3%). all isolates were resistant to bacitracin, lincomycin, penicillin, and vancomycin. for the large intestinal sampling, 149 of the 217 (69%) samples had e. coli present. fifty of these 149 samples had e. coli levels ranging from 10(2) to 10(5) colony-forming units/g feces. campylobacter were isolated from 6 of 201 (3%) samples. no salmonella colony was detected. antimicrobial susceptibility testing on 131 intestinal e. coli isolates showed resistance to erythromycin (98%), neomycin (66%), netilmicin (34%), oxytetracycline (34%), streptomycin (40%), and trimethoprim (13%). all isolates were resistant to bacitracin, lincomycin, penicillin, and vancomycin.

TI  == a randomized, blinded, controlled trial investigating the gastrointestinal health effects of drinking water quality.
AB  == a double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial was carried out in in melbourne, australia, to determine the contribution of drinking water to gastroenteritis. melbourne is one of the few major cities in the world that draws drinking water from a protected forest catchment with minimal water treatment (chlorination only). six hundred families were randomly allocated to receive either real or sham water treatment units (wtus) installed in their kitchen. real units were designed to remove viruses, bacteria, and protozoa. study participants completed  a weekly health diary reporting gastrointestinal symptoms during the 68-week observation period. there were 2,669 cases of highly credible gastroenteritis (hcg) during the study (0.80 cases/person/year). the ratio of hcg episode rates for the real wtu group compared to the sham wtu group was 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.85-1.15, p = 0.85). we collected 795 fecal specimens from participants with gastroenteritis, and pathogens were not more significantly common in the sham wtu group. we found no evidence of waterborne disease in melbourne. the application of this methodology to other water supplies will provide a better understanding of the relationship between human health and water quality.

TI  == direct exposure to animal enteric pathogens.
AB  == humans have very close interactions with working, food-producing, and companion animals. according to the american veterinary medical association, there are more than one hundred million cat and dog pets in the united states. furthermore, non-traditional pets like reptiles and exotic birds are not unusual companion animals in households. in addition to sharing with animals our living and/or working space and time, we also share, unfortunately, many disease causing microorganisms. in the past few years, we have become aware that several enteric  pathogens that were thought to be mostly restricted to animals are a major cause  of human disease. examples of such pathogens include the protozoan parasite cryptosporidium parvum and bacteria such as campylobacter spp. this review will examine the characteristics of zoonotic enteric pathogens including bacterial (helicobacter spp., campylobacter spp., salmonella spp., and verotoxin-producing  escherichia coli); parasitic (toxoplasma gondii, giardia spp., cryptosporidium spp.); and viral (rotavirus, norwalk-like virus, hepatitis e virus), and the status of our knowledge with regard to the impact of such pathogens on human health.

TI  == dysentery in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus in zimbabwe: an  emerging role for schistosoma mansoni and escherichia coli o157?
AB  == information on bloody diarrhoea in hiv-positives is scarce. a prospective study was therefore performed, in zimbabwe, to determine and compare the pathogens associated with bloody diarrhoea in 25 antiretroviral-naive hiv-infected patients and 15 non-hiv-infected patients. stool cultures and colonic biopsies were performed. shigella was isolated from 18 (45%) of the subjects, schistosoma mansoni from eight (16%), escherichia coli h7:o157 from three (8%) and campylobacter jejunii from two (5%). there was no evidence of salmonella, entamoeba histolytica or cytomegalovirus infection. shigella dysenteriae type-1 occurred more often in the hiv-negatives than the hiv-positives (p = 0.02). although hiv-associated bloody diarrhoea in zimbabwe appears to be most frequently caused by shigella, it may also be commonly the result of infection with sc. mansoni or shiga-toxin-producing e. coli. a larger study specifically to examine the role of sc. mansoni and e. coli o157 is warranted.

TI  == occurrence of escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes, salmonella and campylobacter spp. on beef carcasses in northern ireland.
AB  == a survey of beef carcasses was conducted in all 10 european community approved abattoirs in northern ireland to determine the incidence of escherichia coli o157:h7. analyses were based on excised samples of neck meat taken less than 48 h post-kill. overall, 780 carcasses were sampled and all were negative for e. coli  o157:h7. a sub-set of samples was analysed for the presence of listeria monocytogenes (n=200), salmonella (n=200) and campylobacter spp.(n=100). l. monocytogenes was not detected but listeria innocua was found on five carcasses and listeria seeligeri on one. three carcasses carried salmonellas; salmonella mbandaka was found on two and salmonella thompson on one. campylobacter spp. were not detected on any carcasses. the results indicate that very few beef carcasses  in northern ireland appear to carry any of the four pathogens sought, and this may help explain the low incidence of e. coli o157:h7 in the northern ireland human population, relative to the rest of the uk.

TI  == development of a ceue-based multiplex polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for direct detection and differentiation of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli in thailand.
AB  == a novel ceue-based multiplex pcr system was developed as an efficient diagnostics test to detect and differentiate c. jejuni and c. coli. there is no cross reactivity between c. jejuni and c. coli. in addition, the assay does not produce a positive signal from other enteric bacteria including salmonella, shigella and  escherichia coli strains. campylobacter detection sensitivity was determined to be equivalent to previously reported pcr for other enteric bacteria. we also noticed that silicon dioxide extraction can improve campylobacter detection sensitivity from infected stool samples. it was demonstrated that the pcr assay developed in this study had a much better campylobacter detection rate than the traditional culturing method (77% versus 56%). however, we also identified small  numbers of culture positive stools (8%, or 16 out of 202 samples) that did not yield pcr positive results for campylobacter. these pcr negative/culture positive stools were proven to be inhibitory to pcr amplification.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of intestinal bacteria from swiss poultry flocks before the ban of antimicrobial growth promoters.
AB  == from the crop and the caecum of swiss broilers slaughtered between november 1997  and january 1998, escherichia coli, enterococci, staphylococci, lactobacilli and  campylobacter species were isolated. after identification to the genus or species level, their minimal inhibitory concentrations (mic's) for several clinically used antimicrobial agents were determined with the e-test stripes and compared to those from studies in other european countries. all strains of enterococcus faecalis (n = 38), e. faecium (27), staphylococci (n = 39) and lactobacilli (n =  14) showed a hundred percent resistance against bacitracin which was included in  the feed of the mother animals, but not in the feed of the investigated animals.  e.coli strains (n = 60) showed higher resistance incidences than in comparable studies from finland and denmark, but lower than those in studies from italy and  germany. in staphylococci, low resistance rates were observed. a high susceptibility of the 13 campylobacter jejuni strains was found against therapeutically used antimicrobials. these data can be used as a baseline to determine antibiotic resistance rates after implementation of the growth promotor ban in 1999 in switzerland.

TI  == continuous online processing of fecal- and ingesta-contaminated poultry carcasses using an acidified sodium chlorite antimicrobial intervention.
AB  == the objective of this study was to determine the effectiveness of the combined use of an inside-outside-bird-washer for the removal of visible contamination and an online acidified sodium chlorite (asc) spray system in reducing microbial levels on contaminated poultry carcasses. specifically, we attempted to determine if this technique (referred to as continuous online processing [cop]) would (i) eliminate the need for offline reprocessing of contaminated carcasses, (ii) meet  zero fecal tolerance standards, and (iii) attain significant reductions in titers of some of the commonly found bacterial species. carcasses were sampled for ercherichia coli, salmonella, and campylobacter at five stations along the processing lines in a series of five commercial plant studies to compare the efficacy of the cop system to that of offline processing. the microbiological quality of fecally contaminated carcasses was found to be significantly better following cop treatment (e. coli, 0.59 log10 cfu/ml; salmonella, 10.0% incidence) than after standard offline reprocessing (e. coli, 2.37 log10 cfu/ml; salmonella, 31.6% incidence). zero fecal tolerance requirements were met by all but 2 (0.2%)  of the 1.127 carcasses following cop. cop also significantly reduced the titers of campylobacter; residual titers were 1.14 log10 cfu/ml (49.1% incidence) following cop, compared to 2.89 log10 cfu/ml (73.2% incidence) in carcasses that  underwent offline reprocessing. these results support the combined use of an inside-outside-bird-washer for the removal of visible contamination and an online asc spray system to reduce microbial levels in commercially processed poultry.

TI  == the iron- and temperature-regulated cjrbc genes of shigella and enteroinvasive escherichia coli strains code for colicin js uptake.
AB  == a cosmid library of dna from colicin js-sensitive enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec) strain o164 was made in colicin js-resistant strain e. coli vcs257, and colicin js-sensitive clones were identified. sensitivity to colicin js was associated with the carriage of a three-gene operon upstream of and partially overlapping senb. the open reading frames were designated cjrabc (for colicin js  receptor), coding for proteins of 291, 258, and 753 amino acids, respectively. tn7 insertions in any of them led to complete resistance to colicin js. a near-consensus fur box was found upstream of cjra, suggesting regulation of the cjr operon by iron levels. cjra protein was homologous to iron-regulated pseudomonas aeruginosa protein phuw, whose function is unknown; cjrb was homologous to the tonb protein from pseudomonas putida; and cjrc was homologous to a putative outer membrane siderophore receptor from campylobacter jejuni. cloning experiments showed that the cjrb and cjrc genes are sufficient for colicin js sensitivity. uptake of colicin js into sensitive bacteria was dependent on the exbb protein but not on the e. coli k-12 tonb and tola, -b, and  -q proteins. sensitivity to colicin js is positively regulated by temperature via the virb protein and negatively controlled by the iron source through the fur protein. among eiec strains, two types of colicin js-sensitive phenotypes were identified that differed in sensitivity to colicin js by 1 order of magnitude. the difference in sensitivity to colicin js is not due to differences between the sequences of the cjrb and cjrc proteins.

AB  == the use of poultry waste as a fertiliser on arable land is an accepted method of  waste treatment. however, run-off from such practices may result in contamination of the watercourse by human pathogens. in this study the effectiveness of using constructed wetlands as an alternative treatment for poultry manure waste was evaluated. enumeration of campylobacter spp., escherichia coli, total coliforms and total aerobes were carried out on influent and effluent samples from reed beds loaded with poultry waste. for both sequential loading and continuous loading there was a statistically significant mean log reduction of 3.56 and 4.25 for e. coli, 3.2 and 3.88 for coliforms, 3.85 and 4.2 for total aerobic counts and 3.13 and 2.96 for campylobacter spp., respectively. this method, which has been previously recognised as cost-effective and environmentally acceptable, provides an efficient method for reducing numbers of these bacteria in poultry waste and therefore an effective alternative treatment for such waste or waters containing run off from land previously spread with poultry manure.

TI  == a phase-variable capsule is involved in virulence of campylobacter jejuni 81-176.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni strain 81-176 (hs36, 23) synthesizes two distinct glycan structures, as visualized by immunoblotting of proteinase k-digested whole-cell preparations. a site-specific insertional mutant in the kpsm gene results in loss of expression of a high-molecular-weight (hmw) glycan (apparent mr 26 kda to > 85 kda) and increased resolution of a second ladder-like glycan (apparent mr 26-50 kda). the kpsm mutant of 81-176 is no longer typeable in either hs23 or hs36 antisera, indicating that the hmw glycan structure is the serodeterminant of hs23 and hs36. both the kpsm-dependent hmw glycan and the kpsm-independent ladder-like structure appear to be capsular in nature, as both are attached to phospholipid rather than lipid a. additionally, the 81-176 kpsm gene can complement a deletion in escherichia coli kpsm, allowing the expression of an alpha2,8 polysialic acid  capsule in e. coli. loss of the hmw glycan in 81-176 kpsm also increases the surface hydrophobicity and serum sensitivity of the bacterium. the kpsm mutant is also significantly reduced in invasion of int407 cells and reduced in virulence in a ferret diarrhoeal disease model. the expression of the kpsm-dependent capsule undergoes phase variation at a high frequency.

TI  == emerging mechanisms of fluoroquinolone resistance.
AB  == broad use of fluoroquinolones has been followed by emergence of resistance, which has been due mainly to chromosomal mutations in genes encoding the subunits of the drugs' target enzymes, dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv, and in genes that affect the expression of diffusion channels in the outer membrane and multidrug-resistance efflux systems. resistance emerged first in species in which single mutations were sufficient to cause clinically important levels of resistance (e.g., staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa). subsequently, however, resistance has emerged in bacteria such as campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, in which multiple mutations  are required to generate clinically important resistance. in these circumstances, the additional epidemiologic factors of drug use in animals and human-to-human spread appear to have contributed. resistance in streptococcus pneumoniae, which  is currently low, will require close monitoring as fluoroquinolones are used more extensively for treating respiratory tract infections.

TI  == tungstate uptake by a highly specific abc transporter in eubacterium acidaminophilum.
AB  == the gram-positive anaerobe eubacterium acidaminophilum contains at least two tungsten-dependent enzymes: viologen-dependent formate dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. (185)w-labeled tungstate was taken up by this organism with a maximum rate of 0.53 pmol min(-)1 mg(-)1 of protein at 36 degrees c. the uptake was not affected by equimolar amounts of molybdate. the genes tupabc coding for an abc transporter specific for tungstate were cloned in the downstream region of genes encoding a tungsten-containing formate dehydrogenase. the substrate-binding protein, tupa, of this putative transporter was overexpressed in escherichia coli, and its binding properties toward oxyanions were determined by a native polyacrylamide gel retardation assay. only tungstate induced a shift of tupa mobility, suggesting that only this anion was specifically bound by tupa. if molybdate and sulfate were added in high molar excess (>1000-fold), they were also slightly bound by tupa. the k(d) value for tungstate was determined to be 0.5 microm. the genes encoding the tungstate-specific abc transporter exhibited highest similarities to putative transporters from methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum, haloferax volcanii, vibrio cholerae, and campylobacter jejuni. these five transporters represent a separate phylogenetic group of oxyanion abc transporters as evident from analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences of the binding proteins. downstream of the tupabc genes, the genes moea, moea-1, moaa, and a truncated moac have been identified by sequence comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences. they should participate in the biosynthesis of the pterin cofactor that is present in molybdenum- and tungsten-containing enzymes except nitrogenase.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni infections: update on emerging issues and trends.
AB  == infection with campylobacter jejuni is one of the most common causes of gastroenteritis worldwide; it occurs more frequently than do infections caused by salmonella species, shigella species, or escherichia coli o157:h7. in developed countries, the incidence of campylobacter jejuni infections peaks during infancy  and again during early adulthood. most infections are acquired by the consumption and handling of poultry. a typical case is characterized by diarrhea, fever, and  abdominal cramps. obtaining cultures of the organism from stool samples remains the best way to diagnose this infection. an alarming recent trend is the rapid emergence of antimicrobial agent--resistant campylobacter strains all over the world. use of antibiotics in animals used for food has accelerated this trend. it is fortunate that complications of c. jejuni infections are rare, and most patients do not require antibiotics. guillain-barre syndrome is now recognized as a post-infectious complication of c. jejuni infection, but its incidence is <1 per 1000 infections. careful food preparation and cooking practices may prevent some campylobacter infections.

TI  == enteric and foodborne disease in children: a review of the influence of food- and environment-related risk factors.
AB  == canadian statistics show that children from birth to four years of age are more likely to be reported with an infection from campylobacter, giardia, salmonella and shigella species, and verotoxigenic escherichia coli than any other age group. a review of the canadian and international literature, and an analysis of  case and outbreak data suggest that the risk factors for infection in young children (ages birth to four years) are different from the risk factors for older children and adults. in children from birth to four years of age, infant formula, fast foods, snacks and candies have caused major outbreaks of enteric and foodborne diseases; however, the contamination of a child's environment or the presence of ill individuals in a household may be highly significant to disease expression. contact with animals (including family pets) and contaminated surfaces, together with experimental touching and testing behaviours, are important routes of infection for infants and preschool children. risk factors for enteric infections in children appear to be related, occasionally, to specific foods that are particularly attractive to all children (all age groups from infants up to and including elementary school-aged childen), to an infected  person or pet in the same household, or to the contamination of a child's environment. nonfood-related risk factors may be of particular significance in infection in infants and very young children. contact with animals, particularly  exotic pets and farm animals, or their environments should be considered to be a  potential source of infection in children in situations in which there is an absence of other risk factors. the evidence presented in the current paper emphasizes the importance of personal and home hygiene practices in limiting children's exposure to enteric pathogens. strict hand washing practices and restrictions on touching birds, reptiles and other animals at petting zoos or in  nursery and primary school facilities are recommended to avoid widespread infection. public health authorities should consider the development of guidelines on the provision of hand washing facilities and instruction notices in settings where the public may come into contact with farm or other animals in jurisdictions where such guidelines do not already exist.

AB  == we previously showed that highly metastatic clones derived from the poorly metastatic human melanoma cell line m4be are very radiosensitive provided that they are deficient in complex gangliosides. here, we report that the highly metastatic clone 4 appears more sensitive to activated adherent leukocytes than m4be via a transmembrane tnf-alpha-dependent mechanism. adherent leukocytes (al)  were freshly isolated from different blood donors and were activated with esherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (lps). these al contain 80% (73-93%) monocytes, 15% (6-20%) b lymphocytes and 5% (1-8%) t lymphocytes. the tumour cell survival following contact with al was estimated with a clonogenic assay where isolated tumour cells were plated for 14 days with al. we show on the one hand that either exogenous bovine brain gm1 gangliosides or campylobacter jejuni lps with gm1-like structure (lps-like gm1) significantly decrease the hypersensitivity of clone 4 to al. on the other hand, the cleaving with neuraminidase of more than 50% of the sialic residues bound to endogenous gangliosides in resistant m4be cells significantly increases their sensitivity to al. thus, our highly metastatic cells appear both very sensitive to activated al  when they are deficient in complex gangliosides and resistant to al when they are transiently exposed to exogenous gangliosides or lps-like gangliosides. these in  vitro data may reflect the paradoxidal behaviour of highly metastatic cells in vivo which appear both very sensitive to physiological stresses and able to survive to form secondary tumours.

TI  == presence and level of campylobacter, coliforms, escherichia coli, and total aerobic bacteria recovered from broiler parts with and without skin.
AB  == this study was undertaken to determine if broiler chicken parts without skin are  less contaminated with campylobacter than those with skin. samples were taken in  a commercial plant from defeathered carcasses before evisceration. bacterial counts from rinse of aseptically removed meat samples were lower than those from  stomached skin samples. no campylobacter were recovered from meat collected from  the breasts or thighs, and only 2 of 10 drumstick meat samples had detectable levels of campylobacter. however, 9 of 10 breast skin, 10 of 10 thigh skin, and 8 of 10 drumstick skin samples were positive for campylobacter, with between 2 and  3 log10 cfu/g of campylobacter. breasts, thighs, and drumsticks were removed from broiler carcasses following evisceration before entering the chill tank. there was a significant difference (50 to 90%) in the levels of campylobacter on breasts, thighs, and drumsticks with and without skin. similar trends were noted  for coliform, escherichia coli, and total aerobic bacterial counts from samples collected in the plant. broiler part samples were also collected at retail outlets. these samples were either skin on and skinned in the laboratory or skin  off at purchase. aseptic removal of skin from broiler breasts, thighs, and drumsticks did not cause change in campylobacter, coliform, e. coli, or total aerobic counts recovered from the skinned part. likewise, parts purchased without skin did not have different bacterial counts than paired parts purchased with the skin on. consumers should not expect to significantly lower the number of bacteria present on a chicken breast, thigh, or drumstick by removing the skin.

AB  == the effects of elevated chlorine concentrations (25 ppm) added to water in the final carcass washing equipment on total viable counts (tvcs 22 degrees c) and escherichia coli and enterobacteriaceae levels on poultry carcasses were investigated. mean tvc counts on neck skin samples were significantly reduced when pre-evisceration and postwash samples were compared with log10 4.98 to 4.52  cfu/g recovered, respectively (p < or = 0.05). no significant reductions in tvc counts were observed in control samples at corresponding sampling points subjected to wash water containing 1 to 2 ppm chlorine. e. coli and enterobacteriaceae counts were not significantly altered following final carcass  washing in the processing plant. a second trial assessed the microbial decontamination capabilities of sodium triphosphate (tsp) on broiler carcasses. neck skin samples from carcasses were obtained before final washing (control), following a 15-s dip in potable water and after dipping in a 10% tsp solution (ph 12) for 15 s. reductions in e. coli and enterobacteriaceae counts were all statistically significant for both water and tsp-treated samples when compared with corresponding controls (p < or = 0.01). the tsp treatment resulted in higher reductions of log10 1.95 and 1.86/g for e. coli and enterobacteriaceae, respectively. in contrast, reductions of log10 0.37 and 0.3 l/g were observed for e. coli and enterobacteriaceae counts when water-dipped carcasses were compared with corresponding controls. significantly, salmonella was not detected in any of the tsp-treated carcasses, while log10 1.92 and 1.04/g were found in control and  water-dipped samples, respectively. thermophilic campylobacter counts were significantly lower in both treatment groups when compared with corresponding controlsresulting in log10 0.55 and 1.71/g reductions for water- and tsp-dipped carcasses, respectively (p < or = 0.01).

TI  == antimicrobial resistance and bacterial identification utilizing a microelectronic chip array.
AB  == species-specific bacterial identification of clinical specimens is often limited  to a few species due to the difficulty of performing multiplex reactions. in addition, discrimination of amplicons is time-consuming and laborious, consisting of gel electrophoresis, probe hybridization, or sequencing technology. in order to simplify the process of bacterial identification, we combined anchored in situ amplification on a microelectronic chip array with discrimination and detection on the same platform. here, we describe the simultaneous amplification and discrimination of six gene sequences which are representative of different bacterial identification assays: escherichia coli gyra, salmonella gyra, campylobacter gyra, e. coli parc, staphylococcus meca, and chlamydia cryptic plasmid. the assay can detect both plasmid and transposon genes and can also discriminate strains carrying antibiotic resistance single-nucleotide polymorphism mutations. finally, the assay is similarly capable of discriminating between bacterial species through reporter-specific discrimination and allele-specific amplification. anchored strand displacement amplification allows  multiplex amplification and complex genotype discrimination on the same platform. this assay simplifies the bacterial identification process greatly, allowing molecular biology techniques to be performed with minimal processing of samples and practical experience.

TI  == spread of antibiotic resistance with food-borne pathogens.
AB  == this short review summarizes data on antibiotic resistance profiles of common food-borne pathogens like salmonella sp., escherichia coli, campylobacter sp., listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci. as a flashlight on the literature of the last few years, it provides ample evidence that antibiotic resistance traits have entered the microflora of farm animals and the food produced from them. molecular analysis of the resistance genes, where available, shows that the food microflora is not separated from its human counterpart and conjugative transfer of resistance genes has been demonstrated in vitro and in a few cases in vivo. for example, for salmonella typhimurium, resistance towards tetracyclines has increased from zero in 1948 to a 98% level in certain epidemic populations of s.  typhimurium dt104 in 1998. the high incidence of food-borne pathogens in raw meat and milk together with a high level of therapeutic, prophylactic and nutritional  application of antibiotics in agriculture reveals an antibiotic resistance problem of global dimensions. the resistance problem in human medicine will not be solved if there is a constant influx of resistance genes into the human microflora via the food chain.

TI  == bacterial food-borne zoonoses.
AB  == in many countries of the world, bacterial food-borne zoonotic infections are the  most common cause of human intestinal disease. salmonella and campylobacter account for over 90% of all reported cases of bacteria-related food poisoning world-wide. poultry and poultry products have been incriminated in the majority of traceable food-borne illnesses caused by these bacteria, although all domestic livestock are reservoirs of infection. in contrast to the enzootic nature of most salmonella and campylobacter infections, salmonella enteritidis caused a pandemic in both poultry and humans during the latter half of the 20th century. salmonella typhimurium and campylobacter appear to be more ubiquitous in the environment, colonising a greater variety of hosts and environmental niches. verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157 (vtec o157) also emerged as a major food-borne zoonotic pathogen in the 1980s and 1990s. although infection is relatively rare in humans, clinical disease is often severe, with a significant mortality rate among the young and elderly. the epidemiology of vtec o157 is poorly understood, although ruminants, especially cattle and sheep, appear to be  the major source of infection. the dissemination of s. enteritidis along the food chain is fairly well understood, and control programmes have been developed to target key areas of poultry meat and egg production. recent evidence indicates that these control programmes have been associated with an overall reduction of s. enteritidis along the food chain. unfortunately, existing controls do not appear to reduce the levels of campylobacter and vtec o157 infections. future control strategies need to consider variations in the epidemiologies of food-borne zoonotic infections, and apply a quantitative risk analysis approach to ensure that the most cost-effective programmes are developed.

TI  == foodborne illnesses.
AB  == foodborne illnesses cause a substantial human and financial burden. despite sanitary infrastructure improvements, the incidence of foodborne bacterial infections due to non-typhoidal salmonellae (nts), campylobacter jejuni, and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (ehec) has risen over the last two decades. overall, viruses account for two thirds of all foodborne illness. most foodborne  illnesses are self-limited. supportive therapy with rehydration and the correction of electrolyte abnormalities is usually sufficient. antibiotics play a beneficial role in the treatment of patients with certain foodborne diseases, such as listeriosis and typhoid fever, and all patients with tissue invasive or bloodstream infections. immunocompromised patients should be treated presumptively. antibiotics are of variable efficacy for the treatment of many infections limited to the gastrointestinal tract, and recommendations differ between pathogens. antibiotics are generally helpful for shigellosis and cholera, and possibly beneficial for campylobacteriosis. however, antibiotics are potentially harmful in uncomplicated nts and ehec gastroenteritis and generally should not be used. toxin-mediated food poisoning usually does not require specific therapy. the exception is botulism, for which botulinum antitoxin is highly efficacious if used early in the course of illness. empiric therapy for gastroenteritis is possibly beneficial, though the magnitude of benefit is modest and incurs the risk of inadvertently treating nts or ehec. the choice of antibiotic should be based on local resistance patterns and the results of susceptibility testing.

TI  == the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance in food-borne bacteria.

TI  == oral ciprofloxacin vs. intramuscular ceftriaxone as empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in children.
AB  == background: acute invasive diarrhea is a potentially serious condition in children. because of the increasing resistance of enteric pathogens to commonly used oral antibiotics, intramuscular ceftriaxone has become the routine drug in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea requiring an emergency visit in southern israel. the inconvenience of this parenteral regimen created an increased need for oral pediatric formulations for the treatment of invasive diarrhea. objectives: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a suspension formulation of ciprofloxacin in the treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in infants and children. patients and methods: from july 1996 through december 1997, 201 evaluable children ages 6 months to 10 years (35% <1 year; 70% <3 years) presenting with acute invasive diarrhea at the pediatric emergency room were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin suspension (10 mg/kg twice a day + im  placebo; n = 95) or im ceftriaxone (50 mg/kg/day + placebo suspension; n = 106) for 3 days in a double blind manner. stool cultures for shigella, salmonella, campylobacter spp. and diarrheagenic escherichia coli were obtained on days 1, 3, 4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5. clinical response and safety were assessed on days 1, 2, 3,  4 to 5 and 21 +/- 5. results: we isolated 127 pathogens from 121 (60%) patients:  73 (57%) shigella; 23 (18%) salmonella; 18 (14%) e. coli; and 13 (10%) campylobacter. overall bacteriologic eradication on day 4 to 5 was 99% for shigella, 77% for salmonella and 77% for campylobacter, with no difference between the 2 groups. clinical cure or improvement was observed in 100 and 99% of the ciprofloxacin and ceftriaxone groups, respectively. serum ciprofloxacin values determined on day 3 of the treatment were higher in the majority of patients than were the mic50 and mic90 values for the shigella and salmonella spp. isolated. possible drug-related adverse events occurred in 13 patients [ciprofloxacin, 8 (8%); ceftriaxone, 5 (4.7%)] and were mild and transient. joint examination was normal during and after completion of therapy in all patients. conclusion: oral ciprofloxacin was as safe and effective as intramuscular ceftriaxone for the empiric treatment of acute invasive diarrhea in ambulatory pediatric patients requiring an emergency room visit.

AB  == studies of the impact of enteric pathogens and their virulence factors on the proteins comprising the tight junction and zonula adherens offer a novel approach to dissection of tight junctional complex regulation. most studies to date provide only tantalizing clues that select pathogens may indeed assault the tight junctional complex. information on critical human pathogens such as campylobacter jejuni and shigella and salmonella subspecies is lacking. mechanistic studies are currently sparse, but available results on pathogenic escherichia coli and specific virulence factors such as the rho-modifying and protease bacterial toxins indicate four major mechanisms by which these pathogens may act: 1) direct cleavage of tight junctional structural proteins; 2) modification of the actin cytoskeleton; 3) activation of cellular signal transduction; and 4) triggering transmigration of polymorphonuclear cells across the epithelial cell barrier. new therapeutics may evolve from detailed studies of these pathogens and the cellular processes and proteins they disrupt.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni cytolethal distending toxin mediates release of interleukin-8 from intestinal epithelial cells.
AB  == live cells of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli can induce release of interleukin-8 (il-8) from int407 cells. additionally, membrane fractions of c. jejuni 81-176, but not membrane fractions of c. coli strains, can also induce release of il-8. membrane preparations from 81-176 mutants defective in any of the three membrane-associated protein subunits of cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) were unable to induce il-8. the presence of the three cdt genes on a shuttle plasmid in trans restored both cdt activity and the ability to release il-8 to membrane fractions. however, cdt mutations did not affect the ability of  81-176 to induce il-8 during adherence to or invasion of int407 cells. when c. jejuni cdt genes were transferred on a shuttle plasmid into a c. coli strain lacking cdt, membrane preparations became positive in both cdt and il-8 assays. growth of c. jejuni in physiological levels of sodium deoxycholate released all three cdt proteins, as well as cdt activity and il-8 activity, from membranes into supernatants. antibodies against recombinant forms of each of the three cdt  subunit proteins neutralized both cdt activity and the activity responsible for il-8 release. the data suggest that c. jejuni can induce il-8 release from int407 cells by two independent mechanisms, one of which requires adherence and/or invasion and the second of which requires cdt.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni isolates obtained from human and animal sources showed different invasion levels into human embryonic intestinal (int-407) cells. there  was no significant relation between the degree of invasion and cytotoxins production. the depolymerization of both microfilaments by cytochalasin-d and microtubules by colchicine, demecolcine and nocodazole or stabilization of microtubules by paclitaxel reduced the invasiveness of c. jejuni, although microfilament depolymerization showed greater inhibition than microtubule depolymerization. interference with receptor-mediated endocytosis by g-strophanthin and monodansylcadaverine and inhibition of endosome acidification  by monensin reduced the number of viable intracellular c. jejuni cells. furthermore inhibition of only host protein kinases by staurosporine, but not phosphoinositide 3-kinase by wortmannin or protein kinase-c by calphostin-c, significantly reduced invasion of epithelial cells by c. jejuni. these data suggest that the internalization mechanism triggered by c. jejuni is strikingly different from the microfilament-dependent invasion mechanism exhibited by many of the well-studied enteric bacteria such as enteroinvasive strains of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis.

TI  == a 26 kda protein of helicobacter pylori shows alkyl hydroperoxide reductase (ahpc) activity and the mono-cistronic transcription of the gene is affected by ph.
AB  == the 26 kda protein of helicobacter pylori, with 67% amino acid identity to alkyl  hydroperoxide reductase (ahpc) of campylobacter jejuni, was studied. we wanted to evaluate it the protein has ahpc activity. therefore, an escherichia coli mutant  defective for alkyl hydroperoxide reductase and a plasmid expressing the 26 kda protein from h. pylori were used in complementation studies. the complemented e.  coli mutant showed a decreased sensitivity to cumene hydroperoxide indicating that the 26 kda protein of h. pylori has ahpc activity and could be of importance in the defence against oxidative stress. furthermore, northern blot analysis detected one mrna transcript of approximately 700 bp which is in agreement with the gene being transcribed as a single gene with its own promoter. this promoter  region was further characterized by primer extension experiments. additional studies on how environmental factors, such as long term growth and ph, can affect the transcription of the gene were performed on two h. pylori strains. we found that low ph and long term growth repressed transcription of the gene. attempts to construct a mutant deficient for the gene in h. pylori were unsuccessful.

TI  == an evaluation of the presence of pathogens on broilers raised on poultry litter treatment-treated litter.
AB  == two trials were conducted to evaluate the presence of salmonella, campylobacter,  and generic escherichia coli on broilers raised on poultry litter treatment (plt)-enhanced litter in comparison with those raised on untreated litter. two company a farms included three houses on each farm as the treated group and three houses per farm as controls. two complete growouts were evaluated on each farm. the company b study included 10 farms with two paired houses per farm, one house  as the treated group and one house as the control. one growout was evaluated per  farm. the pathogen sampling consisted of litter sampling and whole bird rinses on the farm and in the processing plant. litter ph, ammonia concentration, total litter bacteria, temperatures, and humidity were also recorded. the study with company a resulted in lower mean levels of ph, ammonia concentration, total litter bacteria, litter e. coli, and bird rinse counts for salmonella and e. coli in houses treated with plt. the results for company b closely resembled those for company a, but also included campylobacter data, which showed no difference between treated and control groups. the data indicate that plt may be a beneficial component for on-farm pathogen reduction.

TI  == diarrheagenic escherichia coli and acute and persistent diarrhea in returned travelers.
AB  == to determine the role of diarrheagenic escherichia coli in acute and persistent diarrhea in returned travelers, a case control study was performed. enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) was detected in stool samples from 18 (10.7%) of 169 patients and 4 (3.7%) of 108 controls. enteroaggregative e. coli (eaggec) was detected in 16 (9.5%) patients and 7 (6.5%) controls. diffuse adherent e. coli strains were commonly present in both patients (13%) and controls (13.9). campylobacter and shigella species were the other bacterial enteropathogens most  commonly isolated (10% of patients, 2% of controls). multivariate analysis showed that the presence of etec was associated with acute diarrhea (odds ratio [or], 6.7; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.5 to 29.1; p = 0.005), but not with persistent diarrhea (or, 1.6; 95% ci, 0.4 to 7.4). eaggec was significantly more  often present in patients with acute diarrhea than in controls (p = 0.009), but no significant association remained after multivariate analysis. etec and eaggec  are frequently detected in returned travelers with diarrhea. the presence of etec strains is associated with acute but not with persistent diarrhea.

TI  == identification of enteric pathogens in hiv-positive patients with diarrhoea in northern india.
AB  == enteric pathogens associated with chronic diarrhoea in hiv-positive patients were studied. the study was conducted during january 1995-december 1998. stool specimens from all diarrhoea patients (n = 26) were examined microscopically for  ova and parasites using wet preparations and stained smears. stool samples from diarrhoea patients were also cultured on appropriate media to isolate enteric bacterial pathogens. of the 59 patients, 26 (44%) had prolonged diarrhoea for more than 4 weeks. enteric pathogens were detected in 19 (73%) of the 26 patients: 17 patients harboured a single pathogen, and 2 patients had mixed pathogens. the detection rate of emerging parasites, including isospora, cryptosporidium, blastocystis hominis, and strongyloides stercoralis as a single  agent, was significantly higher than conventional pathogens (50% vs 19.2%; p < 0.05). only one patient harboured both conventional and emerging pathogens (entamoeba histolytica and cryptosporidium). isospora belli was detected in 8 (31%) of the 26 diarrhoea patients: in 7 (27%) patients as a single agent and in  one patient with s. stercoralis. cryptosporidium was identified in 3 (11%) diarrhoea patients: in 2 (8%) patients as a single agent and in one patient with  e. histolytica, followed by b. hominis in 2 (8%) patients. e. histolytica was most commonly isolated (3/26; 11.5%), followed by giardia lamblia, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and campylobacter jejuni (one patient each). parasitic pathogens were frequently associated with hiv-positive patients with diarrhoea in northern india. i. belli was the most frequent parasite isolated, followed by cryptosporidium. stools of all hiv-positive patients with diarrhoea should thoroughly be investigated to identify aetiologic agents for proper management.

TI  == an integron cassette carrying dfr1 with 90-bp repeat sequences located on the chromosome of trimethoprim-resistant isolates of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the frequent occurrence of high-level trimethoprim resistance in clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni was shown to be related to the acquisition of foreign resistance genes (dfrl or dfr9 or both) coding for resistant variants of  the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase, the target of trimethoprim. the dfr1 gene detected on the chromosome of 40 different clinical strains of c. jejuni was studied further regarding structure and genetic organization. most of the dfr1 genes were found as integron cassettes inserted in the chromosome. in 36% of the  examined isolated, the dfr1 gene showed identity to that previously characterized in trimethoprim-resistant escherichia coli. in 40% of the cases, however, a variant of the dfr1 gene containing a 90-bp direct repeat was detected, and in 5% of the isolates, the repeat-containing dfr1 variant was found to occur in the form of two cassettes in tandem in an integron context. the existence of the 90-bp repeat within the coding sequence of the dfr1gene was found to play a role  in the adaptation of c. jejuni to ambient concentrations of trimethoprim.

TI  == use of oleic acid to reduce the population of the bacterial flora of poultry skin.
AB  == the effect of oleic acid on native bacterial flora of poultry skin was examined.  skin from commercial broiler carcasses was washed once or twice in solutions of 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, or 10% (wt/vol) oleic acid and rinsed in peptone water. aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci in the rinsates were enumerated. significantly fewer aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in oleic acid than from control samples. additionally, fewer bacteria were recovered from rinsates of skin washed in higher concentrations of oleic acid than from skin washed in lower concentrations of the fatty acid. in most cases, there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria recovered from rinsates of skin washed once or twice in solutions of oleic acid. washing skin samples twice  in 10% solutions of oleic acid significantly reduced the number of aerobic bacteria, enterobacteriaceae, campylobacter, and enterococci that remained attached to the skin. campylobacter sp., enterococcus faecalis, and listeria monocytogenes isolates possessed the least resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid in vitro, while escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa showed higher resistance. enterobacter cloacae, staphylococcus lentus, and salmonella typhimurium had the greatest resistance to the antibacterial activity of oleic acid. findings indicate that oleic acid reduces the number of bacteria on the skin of processed broilers and that the fatty acid is bactericidal to several spoilage and pathogenic bacteria associated with poultry.

TI  == expression of the cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) operon in actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans: evidence that the cdtb protein is responsible for g2 arrest of the cell cycle in human t cells.
AB  == we have previously shown that actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor that is encoded by the cdtb gene, which is homologous to a family of cytolethal distending toxins (cdt) expressed by several gram-negative bacteria. in this study, we report that the cdt locus in a. actinomycetemcomitans is composed of five open reading frames, designated orf1, orf2, cdta, cdtb, and cdtc. the deduced amino acid sequences of the five open reading frames are highly conserved among a. actinomycetemcomitans strains 652, y4, 29522, and hk1651. there is also strong homology with the cdt proteins of haemophilus ducreyi (87-91%), but only partial homology with that of campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli (29-48%). analysis of a. actinomycetemcomitans mrna by rt-pcr suggests that the two small open reading frames upstream of cdta are coexpressed  with cdta, cdtb, and cdtc. we next utilized a series of plasmids that express various combinations of the cdt genes to determine their requirement for expression of immunoinhibitory activity. cell extracts of e. coli transformed with each of the plasmids were tested for their capacity to induce g2 arrest in the cell cycle of pha-activated human t cells. these experiments suggest that expression of cdtb alone is sufficient to induce g2 arrest in human t cells, but  do not exclude the possibility that cdtc also contributes to cell cycle arrest. the implications of our results with respect to the function of the individual cdt proteins are discussed.

TI  == development of a direct viable count procedure for the investigation of vbnc state in listeria monocytogenes.
AB  == a viable but non-culturable (vbnc) bacterial state was originally detected in studies in environmental microbiology. in particular, this state has been demonstrated for a number of human pathogens (escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, vibrio cholerae, legionella pneumophila and campylobacter jejuni). the presence of vbnc cells poses a major public health problem since they cannot  be detected by traditional culturing methods and the cells remain potentially pathogenic under favourable conditions. but, as far as we know, the vbnc state has not been yet described in listeria monocytogenes. in most studies, this has been assessed by the kogure procedure based on cellular elongation in the presence of dna gyrase inhibitors. the antibiotic used was nalidixic acid in order to prevent dna replication, only efficient in gram-negative bacteria studies. in this study, we describe a new dvc procedure to detect and count viable of l. monocytogenes suspended in filtered, sterilized distilled water. we  used different concentrations of ciprofloxacin, efficient both in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. bacteria cells were removed and resuspended in bhi broth, with yeast extract and ciprofloxacin. the mixture was incubated at different incubation times at 37 degrees c. after different incubation times, cells were filtered through an isopore polycarbonate black membrane filter and covered with a dapi solution or orange acridine. the filters were prepared and examined by epifluorescence microscopy. elongated cells were counted as viable cells, whereas normal size was regarded as nonactive ones. this method allows determination of ciprofloxacin concentration and incubation time optimal to detect maximum viable cells percentage in l. monocytogenes.

AB  == food poisoning in humans can be caused by many different bacterial genera. while  the incidence of food poisoning in england, wales and scotland from salmonella has reached a plateau, there has been an increase in the incidence from campylobacter. the incidence from escherichia coli o157:h7 rose to 1997 but declined slightly in 1998 (data from the public health laboratory service and the scottish centre for infection and environmental health). this organism has a high virulence in humans and a very low infective dose. infection can produce a wide range of responses, including death. the low infective dose presents a major threat. the organism is relatively heat-sensitive and the cooking of food products to achieve a centre core temperature of 70 degrees c for 2 min is sufficient to destroy it. it is relatively acid-tolerant and will survive for several weeks at ph 4.2. several foodstuffs, as well as water, have been implicated in world-wide outbreaks. the e. coli o157:h7 food-borne outbreak in lanarkshire in 1996 led to 21 fatalities. the pennington group report, issued in  april 1997, reported on the circumstances leading to this outbreak, the implications for food safety and the lessons to be learnt. four areas covered within the pennington group report specific to meat hygiene are reviewed in this  paper. on-farm practices must ensure the presentation of clean animals for slaughter. there is a requirement for the development and introduction of risk assessment techniques based upon hazard analysis of critical control points in abattoirs, and the meat and livestock commission (mlc) is producing a manual for  use by the abattoir sector. the pennington report stated that there was a need for research into the potential use of end-process treatments such as steam pasteurization. the mlc is involved in evaluating such a system. meat production  premises and butchers' shops in england are introducing haccp through an mlc scheme funded by the department of health. at the point of consumption, food safety is improved by the provision of practical guidelines regarding the handling of meat and meat products. these are distributed at retail outlets and communicated to secondary schools via mlc's educational publications.

TI  == clinical pathology of foodborne diseases: notes on the patient with foodborne gastrointestinal illness.
AB  == the symptoms and signs in persons with food- or waterborne infections provide clues to the nature of the infecting microbe. proper treatment of the affected individual, and protection of those exposed to the same source, is dependent on time-honored methods of diagnosis: exposure history, and physical examination. laboratory testing may help to identify the responsible agent. spontaneous recovery is the most likely outcome once supportive measures such as fluid and electrolyte replacement are addressed. antibiotics are often unnecessary and may  prolong fecal excretion of certain microorganisms. in immunosuppressed persons or those weakened by marginal nutrition, foodborne infection can be more severe, mandating more specific therapy. management requires knowing the level of tissue  invasion and organ infected by each of the commonly encountered microbes. some of the most life-threatening infections (cholera, for example) are associated with no visible tissue injury, yet they have a profound impact on gut function. in contrast, salmonellosis and shigellosis can cause severe gut injury, and when foodborne infections extend beyond the confines of the gut, skilled care is essential. examples are hemolytic uremic syndrome of escherichia coli infections, or listeriosis, both of which require urgent attention. long-term consequences of gut infections such as the paralytic guillain-barre syndrome following campylobacter infections illustrates the long-term problems sometimes encountered. because it is unlikely that all infectious agents will ever be removed from food and water in any country, sound medical intervention tailored to the extent of illness will be the mainstay of handling such illnesses.

TI  == spread of resistance from food animals to man--the uk experience.
AB  == since 1990 there have been dramatic increase in the occurrence multiply drug-resistant strains of zoonotic pathogens causing infections in humans in many developed countries. of particular note has been the epidemic spread of mr strains of s. typhimurium dt 104, which now appear to have an almost world-wide distribution. within dt104 the increasing spectrum of resistance is of considerable concern, with strains with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin increasing in incidence in the united kingdom and also causing serious disease in humans in other countries. for campylobacters the incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant organisms is also increasing, with reports of such isolates from numerous countries throughout the world. for vtec o157, although resistance is increasing, multiple resistance and resistance to ciprofloxacin remains rare. drug resistance in food-borne pathogens is an unfortunate but almost inevitable consequence of the use of antimicrobials in food animals. although for some pathogens--e.g., campylobacter spp., the use of antimicrobials  in human medicine is also an important factor (smith el al 1999), it is the use of antimicrobials in food animals which has been a major factor in the development of decreased susceptibility to antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin in zoonotically-transmitted salmonellas. such use is quite legitimate. however it is regrettable that recommendations such as propounded in 1992 in the uk by the expert group on animal feedingstuffs--the lamming committee, that any new antibiotics with cross resistance to those used in human medicine should not be used for prophylaxis in animal husbandry, were not accepted (anonymous, 1992). although the clock cannot be turned back, to combat the development of resistance to such important drugs as the fluoroquinolones it is hoped that a code of practice for their use in food animals will soon be internationally implemented.

TI  == enteropathogens in adult patients with diarrhea and healthy control subjects: a 1-year prospective study in a swedish clinic for infectious diseases.
AB  == a 1-year prospective study was conducted to identify enteropathogens in adults with diarrhea (n=851) and in healthy control subjects (n=203) by use of conventional laboratory methods. virulence factor genes for diarrheagenic escherichia coli were detected by polymerase chain reaction. enteropathogens were identified in 56% of patients and 16% of control subjects. the isolation rate was 65% for patients with symptoms for <1 week and for travelers; >1 pathogen was found in 11% of patients. the most frequent enteropathogens were campylobacter (13% of patients), clostridium difficile (13%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  (8%), salmonella (7%), shigella (4%), blastocystis hominis (4%), calicivirus (3%), rotavirus (3%), enteroaggregative e. coli (2%), aeromonas (2%), giardia intestinalis (2%), cryptosporidium (2%), and astrovirus (2%). less frequently isolated (< or =1% of patients) were verotoxigenic e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli, enteroinvasive e. coli, entamoeba histolytica/entamoeba dispar, microsporidia, and adenovirus. fifty percent of the patients were hospitalized, and 43% needed intravenous fluids. the median duration of diarrhea was 14 days. clinical features were not helpful for predicting the etiology of diarrhea.

TI  == some emerging food and water borne pathogens.
AB  == emerging pathogens are those infective organisms whose incidence has recently increased or is likely to increase during the next two decades due to changes in  demography, food habits, food technology, commerce, water sources and environmental factors. some important emerging food and water borne bacterial pathogens include listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli o157: h7, vibrio cholerae biotype e1 tor serotype 0139, vibrio parahaemolyticus and aeromonas hydrophila, a. sobria, and a. caviae. the prevalence, ecological relationships of these organisms, their transmission through food, water and other environmental sources, and role of their virulent factors in the pathogenesis of infections and their public health significance is discussed in this paper with special reference to the situation in india.

TI  == antibiotic resistance monitoring in bacteria of animal origin: analysis of national monitoring programmes.
AB  == methods of antibiotic resistance monitoring of bacteria from animals in 12 european countries were surveyed in 1998. most laboratories used disk diffusion methods, usually expressing results qualitatively, although a few also expressed  the results either as mics or zone diameters. the number of antibiotics used ranged from 5 to 37 (mean 15) and the most common antibacterials were streptomycin, gentamicin, neomycin, ampicillin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol and sulphonamides. salmonellae were monitored by most centres but few-tested campylobacter regularly. escherichia coli from a wide range of animal species were tested in nine countries. enterococci were tested on a limited ad hoc basis  in six countries. staphylococci, streptococci and pasteurellae were also frequently monitored but the number of isolates tested showed wide variation. overall the presentation of the results differed, but most programmes used disk diffusion, control strains and monitored similar bacteria. thus, it may be possible to harmonise monitoring programmes within the eu.

TI  == rapid and specific enzyme immunoassay on hydrophobic grid membrane filter for detection and enumeration of thermophilic campylobacter spp. from milk and chicken rinses.
AB  == six commercially available anti-campylobacter antibodies were examined for their  applicability in an enzyme immunoassay on hydrophobic grid membrane filters, both for the detection and enumeration of campylobacter spp. when a panel of nine campylobacter (seven campylobacter jejuni and two campylobacter coli) and eight non-campylobacter strains were used in a dot-blot format enzyme immunoassay to test the specificity of these antibodies, only one polyclonal antibody (biodesign) detected all campylobacter strains. escherichia coli o157:h7 produced weak nonspecific signals due to endogenous peroxidase activity. the specificity of this biodesign antibody was further tested against 30 more campylobacter strains and more than 600 non-campylobacter strains on hydrophobic grid membrane  filters grown on modified campylobacter agar with charcoal and deoxycholate, a campylobacter selective medium. all the campylobacter strains were detected, whereas only two (acinetobacter calcoaceticus, salmonella minnesota) of the approximately 130 non-campylobacter strains, which grew on modified campylobacter agar with charcoal and deoxycholate, gave false-positive signals. this simple, rapid, and specific enzyme immunoassay also detected campylobacter spp. from inoculated milk and chicken rinses and naturally contaminated chicken rinses.

TI  == campylobacter recovery from external and internal organs of commercial broiler carcass prior to scalding.
AB  == campylobacter is a human pathogen commonly found on live broilers and processed carcasses. to plan effective intervention strategies, it would be helpful to know which campylobacter populations are associated with the external and internal organs of broilers. six carcasses were collected after exiting the bleed tunnel at a commercial broiler plant on each of three visits (n = 18). carcasses were placed individually into sterile plastic bags, sealed, and covered with ice for transport to the laboratory. five locations were sampled aseptically from each carcass: breast feathers (hand picked from the sternal tracts); breast skin, including the sternal tracts; crop; ceca; and colon. samples included adhering contamination or lumen contents and were covered with phosphate-buffered saline and blended. serial dilutions were made for examination of campylobacter, coliform, escherichia coli, and total aerobic bacterial populations. average sample weights (grams) were as follows: feathers, 1.5; skin, 6.5; crop, 5.1; ceca, 7.8; and colon, 3.1. campylobacter populations (mean log10 colony-forming units per gram of sample) found were feathers, 5.4; skin, 3.8; crop, 4.7; ceca, 7.3; and colon, 7.2. coliform/e. coli populations observed were feathers, 6.4/6.0; skin, 5.3/4.9; crop, 4.3/3.7; ceca, 6.6/6.2; and colon, 5.8/5.3. total aerobic bacterial populations found were feathers, 7.9; skin, 7.1; crop, 5.8; ceca, 6.8; and colon, 6.4. on a per gram basis, ceca and colon are the internal organs that if ruptured could cause the highest number of campylobacter to be leaked onto the carcass. the crop also contained more campylobacter per gram than did the skin, and if compromised may increase the numbers on the surface of the carcass. however, even with no contamination from an internal organ, a substantial population of campylobacter is already resident on broiler skin as the carcass enters the early stages of processing.

TI  == the effects of dietary mannaoligosaccharides on cecal parameters and the concentrations of enteric bacteria in the ceca of salmonella-challenged broiler chicks.
AB  == the ability of different enteric pathogens and coliforms to trigger agglutination of yeast cells (saccharomyces cerevisiae, ncyc 1026) and a yeast cell wall preparation (mos) was examined. five of seven strains of escherichia coli and 7 of 10 strains of salmonella typhimurium and salmonella enteritidis agglutinated mos and sac. cerevisiae cells. strains of salmonella choleraesuis, salmonella pullorum, and campylobacter did not lead to agglutination. two strains that agglutinated mos (s. typhimurium 29e and salmonella dublin) and one nonagglutinating strain (s. typhimurium 27a) were selected as challenge organisms for in vivo studies in chicks under controlled conditions. in a series of three trials in which 3-d-old chicks were orally challenged with 10(4) cfu of s. typhimurium 29e, birds receiving 4,000 ppm of dietary mos had reduced cecal s. typhimurium 29e concentrations (5.40 vs 4.01 log cfu/ g; p < 0.05) at day 10. in  a second series of three trials with s. dublin as challenge organism, the number  of birds that tested salmonella positive in the ceca at day 10 was less when mos  was part of the diet (90 vs 56%; p < 0.05). to test the effect of mos on concentrations of bacteria that do not express type 1 fimbriae, a challenge trial was conducted with s. typhimurium 27a. however, strain 27a did not colonize the birds sufficiently to evaluate whether mos affected its cecal concentration. mannanoligosaccharide did not significantly reduce the concentrations of cecal coliforms (p < 0.10) although they were numerically lower. it had no effect on cecal concentrations of lactobacilli, enterococci, anaerobic bacteria, lactate, volatile fatty acid, or cecal ph.

TI  == influence of flooring type during transport and holding on bacteria recovery from broiler carcass rinses before and after defeathering.
AB  == four trials were conducted to determine whether conventional solid or elevated wire mesh flooring, during transport and holding of broilers prior to slaughter,  influenced the number of bacteria recovered from feathered and defeathered carcasses. after 4 h off feed, 7-wk-old broilers were placed at commercial density into a modified commercial transport dump-coop on either fiberglass sheeting or 2.54x2.54 cm wire mesh flooring that allowed feces to fall through. broilers were transported for 1 h and then held for 13 h under a covered shed before processing. broilers were killed by electrocution, and the vents were plugged to prevent escape of feces. external carcass rinses were obtained twice (from the same carcass) from eight broilers per flooring treatment per trial, before scalding and defeathering and again after defeathering and removal of the  head and feet. greater numbers of total aerobes, coliforms, and escherichia coli  were recovered from feathered carcasses than from defeathered carcasses. campylobacter count was also less for defeathered than feathered carcasses from the solid flooring treatment but did not significantly decrease following defeathering of carcasses from the wire flooring. the incidence of campylobacter-positive carcasses was reduced following defeathering for both flooring treatments, but the percentage of salmonellae-positive carcasses remained constant. coliform (log10 6.20 vs. 5.63 cfu/ml of rinse) and e. coli (log10 5.93 vs. 5.36) counts in the feathered rinses were significantly higher for the solid flooring compared with wire flooring, respectively. after defeathering, the number of coliforms (log10 3.12) and e. coli (log10 2.91) recovered did not differ between flooring treatments. aerobic plate count (log10  7.06 and 4.02), campylobacter count (log10 2.49 and 1.80), and the incidence of campylobacter-positive (44 and 11%) and salmonellae-positive (52 and 50%) carcasses for feathered and defeathered rinses, respectively, did not differ between flooring treatments. these results indicate that although broilers transported and held on solid flooring had noticeably dirtier breast feathers and higher coliform and e. coli counts prior to scalding and defeathering, bacteria recovery from external carcass rinses did not differ between the solid and wire flooring treatments after defeathering.

TI  == [preliminary results of antibiotic resistance monitoring in the netherlands].
AB  == qualitative tests are used to monitor antimicrobial resistance in bacteria of animal origin in the netherlands. quantitative information on trends in resistance is thus not obtained. moreover, in general a limited panel of antibiotics is tested. the present study describes resistance in zoonotic food-borne pathogens salmonella, campylobacter, and escherichia coli o157 isolated from human clinical cases and from faeces of healthy food animals in 1998 and 1999, as determined with quantitative susceptibility tests. the resistance of the indicator organisms e. coli and enterococcus faecium isolated from faecal samples of broilers and pigs randomly sampled at slaughterhouses was  also determined. for this end, faecal samples from veal calves were sampled in 1996 and 1997 at the three main dutch veal calf slaughterhouses. in 1998 only a limited number of faecal samples of veal calves were taken at farms. for e. coli  and salmonella the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, imipenem, gentamicin, doxycycline, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, florfenicol, carbadox, and flumequine. for e. faecium the following antibiotics were tested: amoxicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, chloramphenicol, doxycycline, erythromycin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, streptomycin ('high level' > 2000 mg/ml), gentamicin ('high level' > 500 mg/ml), ciprofloxacin, bacitracin, flavofosfolipol, salinomycin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, virginiamycin, tilmicosin, avilamycin, and everninomycin. for campylobacter the following antibiotics were tested: erythromycin, doxycycline, gentamicin, carbadox, flavofosfolipol, ciprofloxacin,  trimethoprim/sulphamethoxazole, amoxicillin, and metronidazole.

AB  == enteropathogens and clinical features associated with diarrhoea were investigated in 1526 children admitted over a 5-year period to the paediatric ward of a hospital in the highlands of papua new guinea. overall, a recognized pathogen was isolated from 39 per cent of the children admitted with diarrhoea. the most commonly isolated agents were rotavirus (23 per cent), shigella spp. (13 per cent), campylobacter spp. (12 per cent), cryptosporidium parvum (10 per cent) and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (8 per cent). the clearest clinical associations were rotavirus with vomiting, and shigella with blood and pus in the stool. a control series of children admitted with other complaints was also included, and the odds ratios for diarrhoea for the above five pathogens were 18.2, 9.6, 3.7, 2.2, and 1.6, respectively.

TI  == prospects for 'competitive exclusion' treatment to control salmonellas and other  foodborne pathogens in poultry.
AB  == in newly hatched chicks, the rapid establishment of an adult-type intestinal microflora, via the oral route, produces almost immediate resistance to colonization by any food poisoning salmonellas that gain access to the rearing environment. exploitation of the 'competitive exclusion' (ce) effect is now an accepted part of the overall strategy by which poultry-associated salmonellas are being controlled in some countries. this review covers practical aspects of ce treatment and factors affecting efficacy in both laboratory-scale trials and field studies. it also considers possible applications in preventing colonization of poultry with escherichia coli o157 and campylobacter jejuni. for the latter, evidence suggests that the 'protective' organisms are different from those involved in salmonella control.

TI  == multiple n-acetyl neuraminic acid synthetase (neub) genes in campylobacter jejuni: identification and characterization of the gene involved in sialylation of lipo-oligosaccharide.
AB  == n-acetyl neuraminic acid (nana) is a common constituent of campylobacter jejuni lipo-oligosaccharide (los). such structures often mimic human gangliosides and are thought to be involved in the triggering of guillain-barre syndrome (gbs) and miller-fisher syndrome (mfs) following c. jejuni infection. analysis of the c. jejuni nctc 11168 genome sequence identified three putative nana synthetase genes termed neub1, neub2 and neub3. the nana synthetase activity of all three c. jejuni neub gene products was confirmed by complementation experiments in an escherichia coli neub-deficient strain. isogenic mutants were created in all three neub genes, and for one such mutant (neub1) los was shown to have increased mobility. c. jejuni nctc 11168 wild-type los bound cholera toxin, indicating the  presence of nana in a los structure mimicking the ganglioside gm1. this property  was lost in the neub1 mutant. gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and fast atom  bombardment-mass spectrometry analysis of los from wild-type and the neub1 mutant strain demonstrated the lack of nana in the latter. expression of the neub1 gene  in e. coli confirmed that neub1 was capable of in vitro nana biosynthesis through condensation of n-acetyl-d-mannosamine and phosphoenolpyruvate. southern analysis demonstrated that the neub1 gene was confined to strains of c. jejuni with los containing a single nana residue. mutagenesis of neub2 and neub3 did not affect los, but neub3 mutants were aflagellate and non-motile. no phenotype was evident  for neub2 mutants in strain nctc 11168, but for strain g1 the flagellin protein from the neub2 mutant showed an apparent reduction in molecular size relative to  the wild type. thus, the neub genes of c. jejuni appear to be involved in the biosynthesis of at least two distinct surface structures: los and flagella.

TI  == etiology of travelers' diarrhea on a caribbean island.
AB  == background: between december 6, 1994 and march 10, 1996, a study of the etiology  of diarrhea was carried out among 332 travelers to five all-inclusive hotels in negril, jamaica. methods: stool specimens were collected and sent to montego bay  for laboratory analysis. escherichia coli strains isolated at the jamaican laboratory were sent to houston for toxin testing. results: a recognized enteropathogen was found in 118 of the 332 (35.5%) cases. enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) were the most commonly identified pathogen (87/332; 26.2%) followed by salmonella (4.2%) and shigella (4.2%). clustering of etiologically defined cases  was studied at each hotel. a cluster was defined as 2 or more cases with the same pathogen identified in the same hotel within 7 days. in the 3 hotels with the highest number of cases of diarrhea, enteropathogens were part of a cluster in 65 of 99 cases (65.7%) of diarrhea of which an etiologic agent was identified. in the other 2 hotels, only 4 of 20 cases (20%) occurred in clusters. conclusions: a total of 25 clusters of travelers' diarrhea cases was detected at the five hotels during the study period. seventeen of 25 (68%) etec isolations occurred as part of a clustering of diarrhea cases. the largest outbreak of pathogen-identified diarrhea consisted of 7 cases of etec producing both heat-stable and heat-labile  enterotoxins. in the jamaican hotels with all inclusive meal packages most diarrhea cases occurred as small clusters, presumably as the result of foodborne  outbreaks.

AB  == acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in u.s. military personnel during deployment. this study investigated the microbial causes of diarrhea in u.s. troops on exercises in southeast asia aboard the u.s.s. germantown from march through may 1996. a total of 49 (7%) patients with diarrhea reported to sick call during a 3-month deployment involving 721 personnel. diarrheal samples from 49 patients were subjected to bacterial and parasitologic examination, but sufficient samples from only 47 of 49 were available for analysis of the presence of norwalk-like virus (nlv). of the 49 diarrhea cases, 10 (20.4%) appeared to be due to bacterial etiology alone, 10 (20.4%) due to bacteria and the prototype taunton agent (tna), 11 (22.4%) due to  tna only, and 4 (8.0%) due to parasites. norwalk-like virus rna was present in 21 (45%) of 47 stool samples from the diarrhea cases, 10 with bacterial etiologies and 11 without bacterial or parasitic etiologies. no pathogen was detected in 14  (29%) of the cases. four of the controls showed the presence of parasitic organisms. of the 11 cases in which enterotoxigenic escherichia coli was isolated, 8 were positive for colonization factor antigen (cfa/iv), and 3 were cfa-negative. the bacterial pathogens tested were all susceptible to gentamicin,  and furadantin, but were resistant to ceftriaxone and norfloxacin, including 75%  of the campylobacter spp. these data support the view that the major cause of diarrhea for troops deployed in this geographic area is most likely nlvs.

TI  == screening of patients with acute infectious diarrhoea: evaluation of clinical features, faecal microscopy, and faecal occult blood testing.
AB  == background: for optimal management of acute infectious diarrhoeal diseases, it is necessary to utilize a screening process to distinguish between invasive and non-invasive diarrhoeas. the aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic utilities of clinical features, faecal microscopy (fm), and faecal occult blood testing (fobt) in distinguishing invasive diarrhoeas from non-invasive ones. methods: a total of 1008 patients with acute diarrhoea were evaluated. rectal swabs were cultured for salmonella, shigella, and vibrio species; rectal swabs from 109 of these patients were also examined for campylobacter, enterotoxigenic  escherichia coli, and rotavirus species. isolation of faecal enteropathogens served as the gold standard. fobt was performed with a commercial modified guaiac test. specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value (ppv), negative predictive value (npv), accuracy, and likelihood ratio were compared. results: among the 1008 patients 402 with a single identified enteropathogen were available for analysis. invasive and non-invasive enteropathogens were isolated from 262 (65.2%) and 140 (34.8%) cases, respectively. the presence of visible blood in faeces was almost a pathognomonic sign of invasive diarrhoea but had poor sensitivity. clinical features were useful but inadequate in differentiating patients with non-bloody diarrhoea (74% of patients) into invasive and non-invasive categories. the sensitivities, specificities, ppvs, and npvs of fm and fobt were 75%, 77%, 58%, 88%, and 85%, 68%, 53%, and 91%, respectively. conclusion: the presence of visible blood in faeces is a highly specific clinical feature of invasive diarrhoea but suffers from low sensitivity. in non-bloody diarrhoea fobt is a valuable screening test and is comparable to fm, particularly when interpreted in the clinical context.

TI  == genetic and biochemical evidence of a campylobacter jejuni capsular polysaccharide that accounts for penner serotype specificity.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative spiral bacterium, is the most common bacterial cause of acute human gastroenteritis and is increasingly recognized for its association with the serious post-infection neurological complications of the miller-fisher and guillain-barre syndromes. c. jejuni lipopolysaccharide (lps) is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of both uncomplicated infection and more serious sequelae, yet the lps remains poorly characterized. current studies  on c. jejuni suggest that all strains produce lipooligosaccharide (los), with about one-third of strains also producing high-molecular-weight lps (referred to  as o-antigen). in this report, we demonstrate the presence of the high-molecular-weight lps in all c. jejuni strains tested. furthermore, we show that this lps is biochemically and genetically unrelated to los and is similar to group ii and group iii capsular polysaccharides. all tested kpsm, kpss and kpsc mutants of c. jejuni lost the ability to produce o-antigen. moreover, this correlated with serotype changes. we demonstrate for the first time that the previously described o-antigen of c. jejuni is a capsular polysaccharide and a common component of the thermostable antigen used for serotyping of c. jejuni.

TI  == distribution and seasonality of microbial indicators and thermophilic campylobacters in two freshwater bathing sites on the river lune in northwest england.
AB  == two freshwater bathing sites, the crook o'lune and the university boathouse, on the river lune in the north-west of england, were monitored over a 2 year period  for the faecal indicators, faecal coliforms and faecal streptococci, the pathogens, salmonella and campylobacter, and compliance with the eu directive on  bathing water quality. faecal indicator numbers showed no seasonal variation, with numbers in the bathing season similar to those in the non-bathing season. they were consistently above the eu guideline and imperative standards so that if the eu bathing water quality directive (76/160/eec) were applied, neither site would comply. faecal indicator numbers in the sediments were an order of magnitude higher than in the overlying water. campylobacter numbers showed seasonal variation in the water with higher counts in winter than in the summer,  although numbers were low. higher numbers were found in the sediments but there was no seasonal variation. analysis of various inputs showed that indicators and  campylobacters came from a mixture of sources, namely a sewage treatment works, agricultural run-off, streams and mallards. microbial numbers in the water at the crook o'lune, which is closer to the sources of pollution, were twice those at the boathouse. in the sediments they were six to eight times higher. faecal coliforms were all identified as escherichia coli of which 80% were a single biotype. faecal streptococci were all enterococci of which 55% were e. avium, 38% e. faecalis and 7% e. durans. salmonella was not isolated from either the water column or the sediments. campylobacters were mainly camp. jejuni, followed by camp. coli, uptc and camp. lari.

AB  == we have applied two strategies for the cloning of four genes responsible for the  biosynthesis of the gt1a ganglioside mimic in the lipooligosaccharide (los) of a  bacterial pathogen, campylobacter jejuni oh4384, which has been associated with guillain-barre syndrome. we first cloned a gene encoding an alpha-2, 3-sialyltransferase (cst-i) using an activity screening strategy. we then used nucleotide sequence information from the recently completed sequence from c. jejuni nctc 11168 to amplify a region involved in los biosynthesis from c. jejuni oh4384. the los biosynthesis locus from c. jejuni oh4384 is 11.47 kilobase pairs  and encodes 13 partial or complete open reading frames, while the corresponding locus in c. jejuni nctc 11168 spans 13.49 kilobase pairs and contains 15 open reading frames, indicating a different organization between these two strains. potential glycosyltransferase genes were cloned individually, expressed in escherichia coli, and assayed using synthetic fluorescent oligosaccharides as acceptors. we identified genes encoding a beta-1, 4-n-acetylgalactosaminyl-transferase (cgta), a beta-1, 3-galactosyltransferase (cgtb), and a bifunctional sialyltransferase (cst-ii), which transfers sialic acid to o-3 of galactose and to o-8 of a sialic acid that is linked alpha-2,3- to a galactose. the linkage specificity of each identified glycosyltransferase was confirmed by nmr analysis at 600 mhz on nanomole amounts of model compounds synthesized in vitro. using a gradient inverse broadband nano-nmr probe, sequence information could be obtained by detection of (3)j(c,h) correlations across the glycosidic bond. the role of cgta and cst-ii in the synthesis of the gt1a mimic in c. jejuni oh4384 were confirmed by comparing their sequence and activity with  corresponding homologues in two related c. jejuni strains that express shorter ganglioside mimics in their los.

AB  == little is known about the molecular pathogenesis of hepatitis and enterocolitis caused by enterohepatic helicobacter species. sonicates of the murine pathogen helicobacter hepaticus were found to cause progressive cell distension, accumulation of filamentous actin, and g(2)/m cell cycle arrest in hela cell monolayers. the genes encoding this cytotoxic activity were cloned from h. hepaticus. three open reading frames with closest homology to cdta, cdtb, and cdtc from campylobacter jejuni were identified. sonicates of a laboratory strain  of escherichia coli carrying the cloned cdtabc gene cluster from h. hepaticus reproduced the cytotoxic activities seen with sonicates of h. hepaticus. cytolethal distending toxin activity is a potential virulence determinant of h. hepaticus that may play a role in the pathogenesis of helicobacter-associated hepatitis and enterocolitis.

AB  == an outbreak of infantile diarrhoea was investigated in 32 children, all <2 years  old, in the tropical north of australia. rotavirus (63%) and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) (59%) were the most common pathogens identified. of the 19 epec isolates, 14 (74%) were of serotype o126:h12, hitherto unreported as an epec serotype. other pathogens isolated included salmonella spp. (16%), campylobacter spp. (3%), giardia (3%) and shigella spp. (3%). epec-related gastro-enteritis is an uncommon but recognised cause of diarrhoeal outbreaks in australia and clinicians need to be aware of the possibility of this serotype being implicated. this report highlights the disadvantages of relying on serotyping alone for the recognition of epec.

TI  == arginine biosynthesis in campylobacter jejuni tgh9011: determination of the argcobd cluster.
AB  == arginine biosynthetic genes from campylobacter jejuni tgh9011 were cloned by functional complementation of the respective escherichia coli arginine biosynthetic mutants. complementation of arga, argb, argc, argd, arge, argf, and  argh auxotrophs was accomplished using a pbr322-based c. jejuni tgh9011 plasmid library. by cross-complementation analyses, the first four steps of arginine biosynthesis were shown to be closely linked on the genome. two additional clones complementing the first (arga) and fifth (arge) steps in arginine biosynthesis were obtained. neither recombinant showed linkage to the arg cluster, to each other, nor to other arginine biosynthetic functions by cross-complementation. genes argf and argh were not linked to other arginine biosynthetic genes by cross-complementation analysis. restriction enzyme patterns of recombinant plasmids fell into five groups. group i contained the arg(abcd) complementing locus. group ii and group iii were the two genetic loci corresponding to the arga and arge complementing genes. group ii contains the hipo gene encoding n-benzoylglycine-amino-acid amidohydrolase, also known as hippurate hydrolase. group iii contains the hipo homolog of c. jejuni. group iv represents the argf gene. group v is the argh gene. functional complementation of mutations in the first four steps of the arginine biosynthetic pathway was obtained on recombinant plasmid pargc2. the predicted order of gene complementation was argcarga(argbargd). the sequence of the insert in plasmid pargc2 revealed direct  homologs for argc, argb, and argd. however, sequence analysis of the gene complementing arga function in two separate e. coli arga mutants determined that  the c. jejuni gene was not a canonical arga gene. the gene complementing the arga defect, which we call argo, showed limited homology to the streptothricin acetyltransferase gene (sat) of escherichia coli. the flanking open reading frames in pargc2 showed no homologies to arginine biosynthetic genes. the structure of the argcobd gene arrangement is discussed with reference to the presence and location of other arginine biosynthetic genes on the genome of c. jejuni and other bacterial organisms.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of ready-to-eat street-vended foods in johannesburg, south africa.
AB  == fifty-one ready-to-eat street foods, 18 dishwater, and 18 surface swab samples were collected from six vendors in johannesburg, south africa. food temperatures  were recorded at the time of sampling. standard methods were used to determine aerobic plate counts (apcs), spore counts (scs), and enterobacteriaceae counts (ecs) for food samples as well as coliform counts (ccs) for water and swab samples. in addition, petrifilm escherichia coli count (pc) plates were used for  the enumeration of coliforms in food, water, and swab samples. the presence of selected foodborne pathogens in the food samples as well as the presence of nonpathogenic e. coli 1 (in food and water samples) was also tested for. predominant colonies isolated from apc plates were characterized to the genus level. holding temperatures for cooked meats and gravies ranged from 42.0 to 94.0 degrees c, and those for uncooked salads ranged from 29.0 to 39.0 degrees c. mean apc values of 3.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g, 4.0 (+/-1.2) log cfu/ml, and 2.1 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. mean sc values of 1.6 (+/-0.2) log cfu/g and 1.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 were obtained for food and swab samples, respectively. a mean ec value of 2.0 (+/-0.4) log cfu/g for food samples and mean cc values of 2.5 (+/-0.3) log cfu/ml and 1.3  (+/-0.3) log cfu/25 cm2 for water and swab samples, respectively, were determined. mean pc values of 1.6 (+/-0.1) log cfu/g, 1.9 (+/-0.6) log cfu/ml, and 1.4 (+/-0.4) log cfu/25 cm2 were determined for food, water, and swab samples, respectively. bacillus cereus was detected in 22%, clostridium perfringens in 16%, salmonella spp. in 2%, and e. coli (non-o157:h+) in 2% of the 51 food samples. e. coli was found in 14 water samples (78%) and in 3 food samples (6%). campylobacter spp., listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus,  vibrio cholerae, and yersinia enterocolitica were also tested for in the food samples, but they were not detected. the 340 isolates obtained from apc plates for food, water, and swab samples were predominantly bacillus spp., micrococcus spp., and staphylococcus spp. for all three sample types. it was concluded that the foods analyzed in this study were of acceptable quality and safety.

TI  == antibiotic usage in animals: impact on bacterial resistance and public health.
AB  == antibiotic use whether for therapy or prevention of bacterial diseases, or as performance enhancers will result in antibiotic resistant micro-organisms, not only among pathogens but also among bacteria of the endogenous microflora of animals. the extent to which antibiotic use in animals will contribute to the antibiotic resistance in humans is still under much debate. in addition to the veterinary use of antibiotics, the use of these agents as antimicrobial growth promoters (agp) greatly influences the prevalence of resistance in animal bacteria and a poses risk factor for the emergence of antibiotic resistance in human pathogens. antibiotic resistant bacteria such as escherichia coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and enterococci from animals can colonise or  infect the human population via contact (occupational exposure) or via the food chain. moreover, resistance genes can be transferred from bacteria of animals to  human pathogens in the intestinal flora of humans. in humans, the control of resistance is based on hygienic measures: prevention of cross contamination and a decrease in the usage of antibiotics. in food animals housed closely together, hygienic measures, such as prevention of oral-faecal contact, are not feasible. therefore, diminishing the need for antibiotics is the only possible way of controlling resistance in large groups of animals. this can be achieved by improvement of animal husbandry systems, feed composition and eradication of or vaccination against infectious diseases. moreover, abolishing the use of antibiotics as feed additives for growth promotion in animals bred as a food source for humans would decrease the use of antibiotics in animals on a worldwide scale by nearly 50%. this would not only diminish the public health risk of dissemination of resistant bacteria or resistant genes from animals to humans, but would also be of major importance in maintaining the efficacy of antibiotics  in veterinary medicine.

TI  == human gastrin: a helicobacter pylori--specific growth factor.
AB  == background & aims: helicobacter pylori resides within the gastric mucosa, a niche hostile to other microorganisms. human gastrin levels are elevated after infection and return to normal after eradication. the aim of this study was to test the direct effect of gastrin on the growth of h. pylori. methods: h. pylori  and control bacteria were grown with gastrin or control peptides and growth rate  was determined. (125)i-labeled gastrin was used to determine uptake. results: human gastrin stimulated h. pylori growth in a specific, dose-dependent manner. gastrin shortened the lag time, increased growth rate in the logarithmic phase, and increased final bacterial concentration at the stationary phase. these effects were shown over a wide concentration range, including physiological luminal and serum levels. labeled gastrin uptake was inhibited by unlabeled gastrin. controls consisting of cholecystokinin and pentagastrin inhibited gastrin uptake but did not stimulate growth. in contrast, somatostatin and epidermal growth factor had no effect on either gastrin uptake or bacterial growth. these results suggest a structurally restricted, receptor-mediated, gastrin-specific effect. conclusions: human gastrin is a specific growth factor for h. pylori and may have a role in the adaptation of h. pylori to its unique habitat.

TI  == prevalence and infection risks of zoonotic enteropathogenic bacteria in swiss cow-calf farms.
AB  == a longitudinal study was performed in 67 larger swiss cow-calf farms from september 1996 through november 1997. the objectives of the study were to estimate prevalence and risk factors for colonization with potentially zoonotic enteropathogenic bacteria in younger calves and in calves at weaning age. the study included data from 395 calves with three to four fecal samples each. fecal  samples were analyzed for campylobacter spp., verotoxin producing e. coli (vtec), yersinia spp. and salmonella sp. possible environmental and individual factors associated with colonization of these agents were examined. the calves were housed indoor during the first 3 months of life (winter 1996/1997). the prevalences within this time period were: c. coli 3.4%, c. fetus 15.5%, c. hyointestinalis 9.6%, c. jejuni 38.5%, vtec 44.3% and yersinia spp. 2%. at the end of the grazing season the prevalences at weaning (8-10 months of age) were: c. coli 1.7%, c. fetus 4.0%, c. hyointestinalis 25.9%, c. jejuni 13.3%, vtec 38.2% and yersinia spp. 0%. no salmonellae were present at any time of the study. the prevalences of c. jejuni and vtec increased significantly within the first 3  months of life, whereas c. hyointestinalis decreased. none of the environmental factors such as housing or feeding had any consistent influences on colonization  by the bacteria studied. vtec, campylobacter spp. and yersinia spp. should probably be considered as normal inhabitants of the bovine intestinal tract. however, as they represent a source of gastrointestinal infections in humans, management factors limiting intestinal colonization of these bacteria should be considered in cow-calf operations.

AB  == a recombinant protein comprising the maltose-binding protein (mbp) of escherichia coli fused to amino acids 5 to 337 of the flaa flagellin of campylobacter coli vc167 was evaluated for immunogenicity and protective efficacy against challenge  by a heterologous strain of campylobacter, campylobacter jejuni 81-176, in two murine models. the sequence of the flaa gene of strain 81-176 revealed a predicted protein which was 98.1% similar to that of vc167 flaa over the region expressed in the fusion protein. mice were immunized intranasally with two doses  of 3 to 50 microgram of mbp-flaa, given 8 days apart, with or without 5 microgram of the mutant e. coli heat-labile enterotoxin (lt(r192g)) as a mucosal adjuvant.  the full range of mbp-flaa doses were effective in eliciting antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin g (igg) responses, and these responses were enhanced by adjuvant use, except in the highest dosing group. stimulation of flaa-specific intestinal secretory iga (siga) responses required immunization with higher doses of mbp-flaa (>/=25 microgram) or coadministration of lower doses with the adjuvant. when vaccinated mice were challenged intranasally 26 days after immunization, the best protection was seen in animals given 50 microgram of mbp-flaa plus lt(r192g). the protective efficacies of this dose against disease symptoms and intestinal colonization were 81.1 and 84%, respectively. when mice which had been immunized with 50 microgram of mbp-flaa plus lt(r192g) intranasally were challenged orally with 8 x 10(10), 8 x 10(9), or 8 x 10(8) cells of strain 81-176, the protective efficacies against intestinal colonization at 7 days postinfection were 71.4, 71.4, and 100%, respectively.

TI  == case-control study of enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in dhaka, bangladesh.
AB  == the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh, is a major  center for research into diarrheal diseases. the center treats more than 100,000  patients a year. to obtain useful information representative of all patients, a surveillance system in which a 4% systematic sample of all patients is studied in detail, including etiological agents of diarrhea, was installed in october 1979.  the first paper on etiology for the surveillance patients was published in 1982,  which identified a potential enteric pathogen in 66% of patients. in subsequent years, several new agents of diarrhea have been identified. to assess the importance of a broader spectrum of diarrheal agents including the ones identified relatively recently, we studied 814 children with diarrhea. the children were up to 5 years of age and were part of the surveillance system. they were matched with an equal number of community controls without diarrhea. the study was conducted from february 1993 to june 1994. a potential enteric pathogen was isolated from 74.8% of diarrheal children and 43.9% of control children (p =  0.0001). even though the first study was not a case-control study, it identified  rotavirus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp.  , and vibrio cholerae o1 as major pathogens. the present study identified these pathogens as being significantly associated with diarrhea. in addition, the study also identified six additional agents, including enteropathogenic e. coli, aeromonas spp., v. cholerae o139, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, clostridium difficile, and cryptosporidium parvum, as being significantly associated with diarrhea. plesiomonas shigelloides, salmonella spp., diffusely adherent e. coli, enteroaggregative e. coli, entamoeba histolytica, and giardia lamblia were not significantly associated with diarrhea. enteroinvasive e. coli,  enterohemorrhagic e. coli, and cyclospora cayetanensis were not detected in any of the children. the major burden of diseases due to most pathogens occurred in the first year of life. as in the previous study, seasonal patterns were seen for diarrhea associated with rotavirus, v. cholerae, and enterotoxigenic e. coli, and infections with multiple pathogens were common. with a few exceptions, these findings are in agreement with those from other developing countries. this knowledge of a broader spectrum of etiological agents of diarrhea in the surveillance patients will help us plan studies into various aspects of diarrheal diseases in this population.

AB  == reliable epidemiologic data are essential for formulating effective policy to control rotavirus disease through immunization. the objective of this study was to describe the epidemiology of rotavirus diarrhea in a population-based cohort of children under 3 years of age residing in abu homos, egypt, in 1995-1996. rotavirus diarrhea incidence rates (episodes per person-year) were 0.13 for infants aged <6 months, 0.61 for those aged 6-11 months, 0.17 for those aged 12-23 months, and 0.15 for those aged 24-35 months. fifty-six percent of children with rotavirus diarrhea had clinical dehydration; 90% of rotavirus diarrheal episodes occurred between july and november. in infants under 1 year of age, receipt of breast milk was associated with a lower incidence of rotavirus diarrhea. no other sociodemographic or environmental factor was found to be significantly associated with rotavirus diarrhea. of 46 rotavirus isolates with strains identified, 41 (89%) were g serotypes 1 and 2. rotavirus diarrhea was a major cause of morbidity in this cohort. promotion of breastfeeding may exert a protective effect in young infants in this setting, but improvements in water and sanitation are unlikely to be effective preventive measures. the use of effective immunization against rotavirus in early infancy should be considered a public health priority.

AB  == in brazil diarrhea is the cause of approximately 15% of death among infants. enteropathogenic e coli is the most important bacterial agent causing acute diarrhea, which is defined as less than 14 days of duration. about 30% of these cases may evolve to persistent diarrhea, defined as lasting more than 14 days. in this work it was carried out a case-control study including 34 children under 2 years of age, and admitted to hospital facilities in sao paulo for rehydration therapy. thirty-four age matched children hospitalized in the same facilities, and presenting no gastrointestinal symptoms were included as controls. stool samples were analyzed for the presence of bacterial pathogens (diarrheagenic e coli, shigella, salmonella, yersinia, and campylobacter), protoparasytes, rotavirus, and enteric adenovirus. the e coli strains isolated were analyzed for  their ability to adhere to hep-2 cultured cells, in a 3 h adhesion assay. search  for homology with dna probes for localized adherence (eaf, eaea probes), aa (enteroagregative adherence) (aa probe), and diffuse adherence (f1845, aida-i probes) was carried out by the colony hybridization method. twenty-four of the cases were acute diarrhea and 10 persistent diarrhea. strains with localized adherence were associated with acute and persistent diarrhea. about 23.5% of e coli were associated with typical enteropathogenic e coli strains (eaf+, eaea+).  enteroaggregative e coli (eaggec) (aa+) was isolated only from cases and in similar frequency for acute and persistent diarrhea. diffusely adherent e coli (daec) which did not hybridize with the diffuse adherence probes were isolated among cases and controls. e coli eaea+ with localized-like adherence was isolated from cases in a frequency three times higher than in controls, suggesting that it may really have a pathogenic potential.

TI  == sulfonamide resistance in clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni: mutational changes in the chromosomal dihydropteroate synthase.
AB  == the characterization of the genetic basis of sulfonamide resistance in campylobacter jejuni was attempted. the resistance determinant from a sulfonamide-resistant strain of c. jejuni was cloned and was found to show 42% identity with the folp gene (which codes for dihydropteroate synthase, the target of sulfonamides) of the related bacterium helicobacter pylori. the sequences of the areas surrounding the folp gene in c. jejuni showed similarity to those of the areas surrounding the corresponding gene in h. pylori. the folp gene of c. jejuni, which mediates the resistance, was observed to show particular features when it was compared to other known folp genes. one of these features is the presence of two pairs of direct repeats (15 and 27 bp) within the coding sequence of the gene. comparison of the c. jejuni folp genes that mediate susceptibility and resistance revealed the occurrence of mutations that changed four amino acid  residues. resistance of c. jejuni to sulfonamides could be associated with one or several of these four mutational substitutions, which all occurred in the five different resistant isolates studied. the codon for one of these changed amino acids was found to be located in the second direct repeat within the coding sequence of the gene. the change made the repeat perfect. the transformation of both the resistance and the susceptibility variants of the gene into an escherichia coli folp knockout mutant was found to complement the dihydropteroate synthase deficiency, confirming that the characterized sulfonamide resistance determinant codes for the c. jejuni dihydropteroate synthase enzyme. kinetic measurements established different affinities of sulfonamide for the dihydropteroate synthase enzyme isolated from the resistant and susceptible strains. in conclusion, sulfonamide resistance in c. jejuni was shown to be associated with mutational changes in the chromosomally located gene for dihydropteroate synthase, the target of sulfonamides.

TI  == cloning and characterization of a gene encoding an antigenic membrane protein from actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae with homology to abc transporters.
AB  == actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a pathogenic bacterium responsible for a highly contagious and often fatal form of bronchopneumonia in swine. survival from a natural infection generally results in immunity from further infection by  all 12 common serotypes, suggesting the presence of common protective antigens. we have identified one of the antigenic membrane proteins from a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5, and cloned the gene which encodes it. this gene is found in all 12 serotypes, and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass  of 30 kda. sequence analysis revealed that this antigen has a typical signal sequence characteristic of lipoproteins, and is likely to be secreted and inserted into the periplasmic side of the inner membrane. the gene shows high homology to the surface antigen cjaa of campylobacter jejuni and to solute binding proteins of the abc transporter family. the probable role of this protein in substrate binding and transport was supported by the presence of an upstream gene with significant homology to atp binding proteins of the same family. in escherichia coli, the cloned gene produced a protein which reacted strongly with  convalescent sera from swine infected with a. pleuropneumoniae serotype 5, and weakly with sera from swine infected with serotype 1a or from swine vaccinated with a killed bacterin of serotype 1a or 5. it thus appears that this antigen displays some crossreactivity between serotypes, and may be less exposed in bacterins than in live cells. this protein, designated apaa, may have an important role in nutrient acquisition and in the pathogenesis of infections caused by a. pleuropneumoniae.

AB  == a study of imported unprepared whole lettuces sampled from supermarkets, greengrocers, shops, and market stalls found that all were of acceptable microbiological quality. twenty-seven out of 151 (18%) imported lettuce samples had enterobacteriaceae levels of 10(4) cfu/g or more. however, these bacteria that constitute part of the natural microflora of unprepared vegetables may also  be derived from the soil and/or by poor handling. the pathogens, salmonella spp., shigella spp., campylobacter spp., escherichia coli o157:h7, vibrio cholerae, listeria monocytogenes, and also escherichia coli, an indicator of fecal contamination, were not detected in any imported lettuces, indicating that hygiene, harvesting, and production practices were good. imported lettuces with enterobacteriaceae levels of 10(4) cfu/g or more varied with type of retail premises and the temperature at which the lettuces were displayed. samples from greengrocers, shops, and market stalls were more likely to contain enterobacteriaceae at levels in excess of 10(4) cfu/g than those from supermarkets.

TI  == prevention and treatment of traveler's diarrhea.
AB  == common pathogens in traveler's diarrhea include enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, campylobacter, shigella, salmonella, yersinia and many other species. viruses and protozoa are the cause in many cases. fortunately, traveler's diarrhea can usually be avoided by carefully selecting foods and beverages. although drug prophylaxis is now discouraged, treatment with loperamide (in the absence of dysentery) and a fluoroquinolone, such as ciprofloxacin (500 mg twice daily for one to three days), is usually safe and effective in adults with traveler's diarrhea. trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline are alternatives, but resistance increasingly limits their usefulness. antibiotic treatment is best reserved for cases that fail to quickly respond to loperamide. antibiotic resistance is now widespread. nonabsorbable antibiotics, immunoprophylaxis with vaccines and biotherapeutic microbes that inhibit pathogen infection may eventually supplant antibiotic treatment. in the meantime, azithromycin and new fluoroquinolones show promise as possible replacements for the older agents. ultimately, the best solution is improvements in sanitary engineering and the development of safe water supplies.

TI  == high-performance liquid chromatography determination of residue levels on chicken carcasses treated with cetylpyridinium chloride.
AB  == cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) has been found to be effective in reducing contamination of chicken carcasses from a variety of microorganisms, including escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni, aeromonas hydrophila, listeria monocytogenes, and staphylococcus aureus. a procedure has been developed to determine residue levels on chicken carcasses after cpc treatment. for the analysis, chicken carcasses were extracted with 95% ethanol. the cpc concentration in the extract was measured by high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) with ultraviolet detection using dodecylpyridinium chloride (dpc) as an internal standard. the method was validated in the concentration range of 3-200 microg/ml cpc in ethanolic extract. this assay is rapid, precise,  and accurate.

TI  == a study of infectious intestinal disease in england: microbiological findings in  cases and controls.
AB  == a study was undertaken to identify the microorganisms and toxins in stool specimens associated with infectious intestinal disease (iid) among cases in the  community and presenting to general practitioners (gps) and in asymptomatic controls. population based cohorts were recruited from practice lists in 70 practices and followed for 26 weeks (cohort component). seven hundred and sixty-one cases of iid identified from the cohorts, 2893 cases who presented to gps in 34 of the practices (gp component), and age/sex matched control subjects (555 and 2264, respectively) submitted stool specimens by post for comprehensive  microbiological examination. campylobacter spp (12.2% of stools tested), rotavirus group a (7.7%), and small round structured virus (srsv) (6.5%) were the organisms most commonly detected in the gp component. srsv was identified in 7.0% of cases in the community cohort. no target microorganisms or toxins were identified in 45.1% and 63.1% of cases in the two components. aeromonas spp, yersinia spp, and some enterovirulent groups of escherichia coli were detected as frequently in controls as in cases. the higher frequency of detection of campylobacter, salmonella, and rotavirus among cases who presented to gps than among those in the community suggests that those pathogens cause more severe illness. no enteropathogens were detected from a large proportion of cases although comprehensive standard methods were used to seek them.

TI  == inhibition of salmonella typhimurium in the chicken intestinal tract by a transformed avirulent avian escherichia coli.
AB  == an avirulent, wild-type avian escherichia coli (e. coli av) was electrotransformed with a plasmid coding for the production of microcin 24 (pgob18) and was designated e. coli avgob18. the transformant inhibited the growth of seven serotypes of salmonella commonly associated with colonization and contamination of poultry products and seven strains of e. coli o157:h7 in the in  vitro colicin/microcin assay. the transformant did not inhibit the replication of multiple isolates of listeria monocytogenes or campylobacter jejuni in similar assays. the transformant is nonconjugative, indicating that the plasmid would not be transmitted to other intestinal microflora in the environment. the transformant also survived in sterile tap and deionized water incubated at 25 c and 37 c in the laboratory for 30 days and was recovered from drinkers and birds  in in vivo floor pen studies. in in vivo studies, e. coli avgob18 did not colonize the intestinal tract of broiler chicks when given as a single or multiple dose and did not reduce the salmonella load in the broilers. but salmonella typhimurium was reduced significantly in the intestinal tracts of broiler chickens when e. coli avgob18 was administered continually in the water supply.

AB  == mics of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, and those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin for 19 genetically characterized fluoroquinolone-resistant strains were determined by the agar dilution method. the mics of moxifloxacin for escherichia isolates with one mutation in gyra (corresponding to ser83-->leu or asp87-->gly substitution) were 0.25-0.5 mg/l, while those of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 0.06-0.25, 1 and 0.12-0.5 mg/l, respectively. these values were four- to 16-fold higher than those of the same antibiotics for the wild-type strain, e. coli kl16. similar results were observed with clinical isolates of salmonella spp. harbouring one mutation in gyra leading to the substitution of ser83 by phe or tyr. in the presence of two mutations in the e. coli gyra gene, the mics of moxifloxacin ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 2, 0.5, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively; these were 32 times higher than the mics of these agents for e. coli kl16. the mics of the four quinolones for triple mutants with two mutations in gyra and one in parc were even higher, i.e. 8, 8, 16 and 8-16 mg/l, respectively. the mics of moxifloxacin  for campylobacter coli and campylobacter jejuni strains with a gyra mutation leading to thr86-->ile substitution ranged from 1 to 2 mg/l, while the mics of ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were 16-32 mg/l, 8-16 and 4-8 mg/l, respectively. for high-level ciprofloxacin-resistant (mics of 32 mg/l) clinical isolates of enterococcus faecalis with one substitution at position 83 in gyra (e. coli coordinates), the mics of moxifloxacin, ofloxacin and sparfloxacin were  8-16, > or = 128 and 32 mg/l respectively. in conclusion, moxifloxacin and other  fluoroquinolones exhibit cross-resistance against aerobic gram-negative bacilli and enterococci. the in-vitro activity of moxifloxacin was greater than that of ofloxacin and slightly less than that of ciprofloxacin and sparfloxacin against enterobacteriaceae, but greater than those of the three other compounds tested against campylobacter spp and e. faecalis.

TI  == susceptibility in vitro of helicobacter pylori to cetylpyridinium chloride.
AB  == the antimicrobial agent cetylpyridinium chloride (cpc) which is used in therapy of oro-pharyngeal infections and for antiseptic treatment of the oral cavity is active against different bacterial species. determination of the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) using the agar dilution technique revealed that the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori in vitro is highly susceptible to cpc as indicated by an mic of 10 microm (3.4 microg ml(-1)) which was significantly lower than the mic of cpc against other bacterial species, which were analyzed in comparison to h. pylori. bacteria of the genus campylobacter, various streptococcus spp., staphylococcus aureus and escherichia coli showed higher mics ranging from 100 microm to 2 mm. in summary, this finding renders cpc-containing  drugs candidates possibly useful for eradication or for the prevention of transmission of the gastric pathogen.

TI  == evidence for a system of general protein glycosylation in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == a genetic locus from campylobacter jejuni 81-176 (o:23, 36) has been characterized that appears to be involved in glycosylation of multiple proteins,  including flagellin. the lipopolysaccharide (lps) core of escherichia coli dh5alpha containing some of these genes is modified such that it becomes immunoreactive with o:23 and o:36 antisera and loses reactivity with the lectin wheat germ agglutinin (wga). site-specific mutation of one of these genes in the  e. coli host causes loss of o:23 and o:36 antibody reactivity and restores reactivity with wga. however, site-specific mutation of each of the seven genes in 81-176 failed to show any detectable changes in lps. multiple proteins from various cellular fractions of each mutant showed altered reactivity by western blot analyses using o:23 and o:36 antisera. the changes in protein antigenicity could be restored in one of the mutants by the presence of the corresponding wild-type allele in trans on a shuttle vector. flagellin, which is known to be a  glycoprotein, was one of the proteins that showed altered reactivity with o:23 and o:36 antiserum in the mutants. chemical deglycosylation of protein fractions  from the 81-176 wild type suggests that the other proteins with altered antigenicity in the mutants are also glycosylated.

AB  == objective: to determine diagnostic yield of stool cultures for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, and escherichia coli o157:h7 (sscye) among hospitalized children and to develop guidelines for appropriate use of these tests. setting. tertiary care pediatric hospital. design: computerized records from the microbiology laboratory from january 1992 to december 1996 were reviewed retrospectively to collect data on the number of stool cultures performed in inpatients and outpatients, the length of hospital stay at the time cultures were sent, and diagnostic yield of cultures in hospitalized patients. a detailed review of medical records of all patients with  a stool pathogen isolated after 3 days of hospitalization was also undertaken. the results from this retrospective analysis were used to develop guidelines to reduce unwarranted stool cultures and to educate medical care providers in the appropriate use of these tests. the impact of these guidelines on reduction in the volume of stool cultures performed on hospitalized patients was measured prospectively from january 1998 to june 1998. results: a total of 27 110 stool cultures for sscye were performed in the 5-year study period. of the 14 125 cultures from inpatients, 174 (1.2%) were positive. among the cultures from inpatients, 9378 (66%) were from patients hospitalized for >3 days. only 13 (.14%) were positive. of these 13 cultures, 4 represented nosocomial infections,  whereas the remaining 9 cultures either were sent to document clearance from a patient known previously to be infected with an enteric pathogen (7), or were attributed to delayed testing in individuals admitted with a diarrheal illness (2). introduction of guidelines to reject all sscye cultures from patients hospitalized for >3 days who did not meet specified criteria was associated with  an overall reduction of 689 (43%) in the volume of tests performed in the 6-month period evaluated. this included 497 fewer cultures ordered and 192 cultures that  were ordered but rejected because screening criteria were not met. only 11 (5.4%) of 203 cultures sent >3 days after admission were processed because they met clinical criteria for testing. none were positive. estimated cost savings were $50 163/year. conclusions: stool cultures for sscye among hospitalized patients have very low diagnostic yield and are extremely overutilized. simple guidelines, such as rejecting (with few exceptions) cultures from patients hospitalized for >3 days, can reduce substantially such unnecessary testing.

TI  == isolation and purification of a campylobacter upsaliensis autolysin.
AB  == autolytic activity in the soluble and sediment fractions of sonicates of the spiral and the coccoid form of campylobacter upsaliensis could not be demonstrated by native (nondenaturing) polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page). autolysins were detected, however, by using denaturing sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds)-page gels containing either purified escherichia coli peptidoglycan or whole cells of micrococcus luteus (micrococcus lysodeikticus) as the turbid substrate, with subsequent renaturation by treatment with triton x-100 buffer. in renaturing gels that contained escherichia coli peptidoglycan, 14 putative autolytic bands ranging from 200 to 12 kda were detected. in similar gels containing whole cells of m. luteus, only a single band appeared with a molecular mass of 34 kda. this band corresponded to one of the bands present in the gels containing escherichia coli peptidoglycan. this common autolysin was isolated by  adsorbing it from campylobacter upsaliensis soluble fractions onto m. luteus cells and then subjecting these cells to renaturing sds-page in gels containing escherichia coli peptidoglycan. the 34-kda autolysin differed from a single 51-kda autolysin unique to the m. luteus cells, and when isolated from an sds-page gel, was pure when tested by isoelectric focusing. the n-terminal amino  acid sequence analysis showed the first 15 amino acids of the 34-kda autolysin to have 67% identity to a part of antigenic protein peb4 of campylobacter jejuni. the purified autolysin was used to immunize rabbits and the antibodies produced precipitated autolytic activity from cell lysates. the specificity of the antibodies was shown by western blotting: only a single specific band occurred, with a molecular mass of 34 kda, and thus it seems unlikely that the 34-kda autolysin was derived from any of the other autolysins that were detected.

TI  == cloning, sequencing and molecular analysis of the campylobacter jejuni groesl bicistronic operon.
AB  == the groesl bicistronic operon from the enteric pathogen campylobacter jejuni was  cloned and sequenced. it consists of two orfs encoding proteins with molecular masses of 9.5 and 57.9 kda, which showed a high degree of homology to other bacterial groes and groel proteins. northern blot analysis suggested that the groesl operon is transcribed as a bicistronic mrna, and its steady-state level was markedly increased after temperature upshift. by primer extension assay, one  potential transcription start point preceding the groesl genes could be demonstrated, and a putative promoter region compatible with both escherichia coli and c. jejuni sigma70 consensus sequences was identified. a conserved inverted repeat, which is believed to be involved in the regulation of the groesl genes, was found between the -10 promoter box and the groes translation start site. the complete coding region of groel was fused with pet-22b(+) and expressed in e. coli as a his6-tagged recombinant protein (rcjhsp60-his). after purification, the protein was recognized by an anti-hsp60 monoclonal antibody. elisa and western immunoblotting experiments showed that igg and iga antibody responses against rcjhsp60-his were not significantly increased in sera from 24 patients with sporadic campylobacter infection when compared to sera from 16 healthy controls.

TI  == actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans immunosuppressive protein is a member of the family of cytolethal distending toxins capable of causing a g2 arrest in human t  cells.
AB  == we have previously shown that actinobacillus actinomycetecomitans produces an immunosuppressive factor (isf) capable of impairing human lymphocyte function by  perturbing cell cycle progression. we now report that isf is the product of the cdtb gene, one of three genes encoding the family of cytolethal distending toxins (cdt). the isf polypeptide exhibits >/=95% identity with hemophilus ducreyi cdtb  protein and </=60% homology with escherichia coli or campylobacter jejuni cdtb. pretreatment of pha-activated lymphocytes with 5-25 ng isf results in g2 arrest of cd4+ and cd8+ t cells. similarly, treatment of hela cells results in g2 arrest and cell elongation and distension. however, lymphocytes are at least 5 times more sensitive to isf than hela cells and do not undergo the elongation and distension that characterizes interactions of cdts with cell lines. isf-treated lymphocytes express normal cyclin a and b1 levels, but contain reduced levels of  cell cycle-dependent kinase-1 (cdk1). additionally, the majority of cdk1 is in the hyperphosphorylated, inactive, form. in contrast, pha-induced g2 cells contain elevated levels of the hypophosphorylated, active cdk1. failure of isf-treated cells to dephosphorylate cdk1 is not associated with decreased availability of cdc25. these studies suggest that the cdtb protein alone is capable of inducing g2 arrest in lymphocytes and cell cycle arrest, elongation, and distension of hela cells. our studies also suggest that lymphocytes may be primary targets for a. actinomycetemcomitans cdtb (isf) and possibly for other cdt family members as well. thus, cdts may function to impair host immunity and contribute to the pathogenesis of disease associated with cdt-producing organisms.

AB  == the clpb heat-shock protein is necessary for the survival of escherichia coli cells upon sudden increase of temperature. using a pcr-based genomic walking method, the nucleotide sequence of a clpb homolog from campylobacter jejuni was determined. the clpb gene encodes a protein of 857 amino acid (aa) residues, with a predicted molecular mass of 95.3kda. alignment of the deduced aa sequence with  other known bacterial clpb proteins revealed overall identity from 47% (e. coli)  to 61% (helicobacter pylori). within the clpb promoter region, as indicated by primer extension analysis, we identified a sequence identical to the e. coli sigma70 consensus promoter. northern blot analysis confirmed that clpb is heat-inducible in c. jejuni. the clpb protein, fused to a 6xhis tag, was synthesized in e. coli and purified by metal-affinity and size exclusion chromatography. in elisa studies, iga levels reactive to recombinant clpb were significantly higher in sera of patients with prior c. jejuni infections than in  sera obtained from healthy control persons.

AB  == cigarette smoking is a potential risk factor which has recently been associated with periodontal disease progression. the objective of this study was to compare  the microbial profile of smokers and non-smokers in a group of patients with early onset periodontitis. the study population consisted of 60 healthy individuals, 40 males and 20 females aged 22 to 35 yr, exhibiting early onset periodontitis. thirty patients were smokers (30.9 cigarettes/d) and 30 non-smokers. smokers had a higher proportion of deep pockets (pd >5 mm), especially in the maxilla anterior and premolar regions (p < 0.001) and presented a significantly greater mean probing depth and attachment loss (p <0.05) in diseased sites and a significantly greater alveolar bone loss (p <0.01) compared  to non-smokers. two pooled bacterial samples were obtained from each patient. samples were collected from the deepest periodontal pockets of each quadrant. the samples were cultured anaerobically and in 10% co2 plus air for bacterial isolation using selective and non-selective media. isolates were characterized to species level by conventional biochemical tests and various identification kits.  smokers harboured a greater number of bacteria in total. analysis of bacterial counts using the anova (mann-whitney u-test) showed that staphylococcus aureus, peptostreptococcus micros, campylobacter concisus, escherichia coli, bacteroides  forsythus, c. gracilis, c. rectus, porphyromonas gingivalis, selenomonas sputigena, candida albicans and aspergillus fumigatus were found in significantly higher numbers and more frequently in smokers while streptococcus intermedius, a. naeslundii, a. israelii and eubacterium lentum were detected more frequently and  in significantly higher proportions in non-smokers. the isolation of bacteria belonging to the exogenous flora such as e. coli, c. albicans, a. fumigatus and s. aureus in smokers' microbiota underscores the importance of the host that is adversely affected by cigarette smoking.

TI  == [principles and management of the ambulatory treatment of traveller's diarrhea].
AB  == traveller's diarrhea (td, turista) is the most common health disturbance in travellers, affecting 20-50% of two-week travellers depending on their origin, destination and eating habits. the etiological agents most frequently isolated from the stools are enterotoxinogenic escherichia coli (etec), salmonella spp., shigella spp., but the rate of isolation of campylobacter spp. and non cholera vibrios is also high in asia. preventive measures in eating habits should in principle be able to curb the incidence of td but compliance of travellers is usually poor. antibiotic chemoprophylaxis has proved effective, but economic, safety and microbiological (drug resistance) considerations discourage its widespread use. any treatment strategy should consider that td is usually a self-limiting, benign illness in most travellers, even though infants, elderly people or persons with severe baseline diseases (heart diseases, diabetes, immunocompromised hosts, etc...) may sometimes suffer severe consequences. adequate rehydration is the cornerstone of treatment and intestinal motility inhibitors may be used in adults (not in children) with severe diarrhea during the first 24 hours if the suspicion of invasive pathogen has been ruled out. routine antibiotic treatment of td is controversial, due to the benign nature of  the syndrome and to the impossibility to ascertain its causative agent. it should be limited to severe and disabling cases. among the many antibiotics tested, quinolones are now considered first-choice treatment worldwide, even though disturbing reports of the increasing prevalence of quinolone-resistant campylobacter spp. from asia have been recently published. cotrimoxazole is efficient in central america. the role of non absorbed antibiotics and probiotics is still to be fully elucidated.

TI  == evaluation of accuracy and repeatability of identification of food-borne pathogens by automated bacterial identification systems.
AB  == the performances of five automated microbial identification systems, relative to  that of a reference identification system, for their ability to accurately and repeatedly identify six common food-borne pathogens were assessed. the systems assessed were the microlog system (biolog inc., hayward, calif.), the microbial identification system (mis; midi inc., newark, del.), the vitek system (biomerieux vitek, hazelwood, mo.), the microscan walkaway 40 system (dade-microscan international, west sacramento, calif.), and the replianalyzer system (oxoid inc., nepean, ontario, canada). the sensitivities and specificities of these systems for the identification of food-borne isolates of bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., and verotoxigenic escherichia coli were determined with 40 reference positive isolates and 40 reference negative isolates for each pathogen. the sensitivities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 42.5 to 100%, and the specificities of these systems for the identification of these pathogens ranged from 32.5 to 100%. some of the systems had difficulty correctly identifying the reference isolates when the results were compared to those from the reference identification tests. the sensitivity of mis for the identification of s. aureus, b. cereus, e. coli, and c. jejuni, for example, ranged from 47.5 to 72. 5%. the sensitivity of the microlog system for the identification of e. coli was 72.5%, and the sensitivity of the vitek system  for the identification of b. cereus was 42.5%. the specificities of four of the five systems for the identification of all of the species tested with the available databases were greater than or equal to 97.5%; the exception was mis for the identification of c. jejuni, which displayed a specificity of 32.5% when  it was tested with reference negative isolates including campylobacter coli and other campylobacter species. all systems had >80% sensitivities for the identification of salmonella species and listeria species at the genus level. the repeatability of these systems for the identification of test isolates ranged from 30 to 100%. not all systems included all six pathogens in their databases; thus, some species could not be tested with all systems. the choice of automated  microbial identification system for the identification of a food-borne pathogen would depend on the availability of identification libraries within the systems and the performance of the systems for the identification of the pathogen.

TI  == apoptotic effect of outer-membrane proteins from campylobacter jejuni on chicken  lymphocytes.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a significant cause of food-borne diseases in humans. the bacterium is considered a commensal organism in chickens, and it can heavily colonize chickens without causing inflammation. poultry may be the major reservoir for the human infection in developed countries. here we show that an outer-membrane protein extract prepared from the bacteria caused apoptosis of chicken lymphocytes detected in vitro with the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dutp nick end-labeling assay that preferentially labels individual apoptotic cells. blood- and spleen-lymphocytes from different-aged chickens displayed a significantly greater percentage of apoptotic cells after culture with the outer-membrane proteins from c. jejuni than controls treated with phosphate-buffered saline, chicken ovalbumin, or outer-membrane proteins prepared from e. coli strain bl21. the c. jejuni extract also produced apoptosis  of chicken lymphoblastoid tumor cell lines. apoptosis was blocked by pretreating  the extract with proteinase k or antiserum against outer-membrane proteins. the results suggest that c. jejuni may be capable of achieving immune avoidance in chickens by causing apoptosis of lymphocytes.

TI  == etiology of outpatient pediatric nondysenteric diarrhea: a multicenter study in the united states.
AB  == background: few data have been published recently on the etiology of outpatient pediatric diarrhea in the us. methods: we determined the etiology of acute, nondysenteric diarrhea among 147 children between 2 and 11 years old presenting to 9 outpatient clinics in various regions of the us between august, 1991, and august, 1993. enteropathogens were sought by conventional laboratory methods. the various diarrheagenic escherichia coli were sought. results: a recognized etiologic agent was detected in the stools of 89 (60.5%) children and 15 (10) patients had multiple agents detected. rotavirus was found in 43 (29.3%) of the children, with a spring and winter peak in occurrence. giardia lamblia was identified in 22 (15%) cases with a spring peak. hep-2 cell-adherent e. coli were found in 15 (10.2%). other agents found included: enteric adenovirus in 7 (4.8%); salmonella in 5 (3.4%); enterohemorrhagic e. coli in 5 (3.4%); enteropathogenic e. coli in 2 (1.4%); enterotoxigenic e. coli in 2 (1.4%); entamoeba histolytica in 1 (0.70%); and campylobacter jejuni in 1 (0.7%). conclusions: in addition to the presence of conventional enteropathogens, diarrheagenic e. coli (hep-2 cell-adherent e. coli, enterohemorrhagic e. coli, enteropathogenic e. coli and enterotoxigenic e. coli) were associated with endemic pediatric diarrhea in the us.

TI  == cloning and expression of the dnak gene of campylobacter jejuni and antigenicity  of heat shock protein 70.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a leading cause of infectious diarrhea throughout the world. in addition, there is growing evidence that guillain-barre syndrome, an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the peripheral nervous system, is frequently preceded by c. jejuni infection. in the present study, the hrca-grpe-dnak gene cluster of c. jejuni was cloned and sequenced. the dnak gene  consists of an open reading frame of 1,869 bp and encodes a protein with a high degree of homology to other bacterial 70-kda heat shock proteins (hsps). the overall percentages of identity to the hsp70 proteins of helicobacter pylori, borrelia burgdorferi, chlamydia trachomatis, and bacillus subtilis were calculated to be 78.1, 60.5, 57.2, and 53. 8%, respectively. regions similar to the escherichia coli sigma70 promoter consensus sequence and to a cis-acting regulatory element (circe) are located upstream of the hrca gene. following heat  shock, a rapid increase of dnak mrna was detectable, which reached its maximum after 20 to 30 min. a 6-his-tagged recombinant dnak protein (rcjdnak-his) was generated in e. coli, after cloning of the dnak coding region into pet-22b(+), and purified by affinity and gel filtration chromatography. antibody responses to rcjdnak-his were significantly elevated, compared to those of healthy individuals, in about one-third of the serum specimens obtained from c. jejuni enteritis patients.

TI  == lymphocyte subset profile of young healthy children residing in a rural area: possible role of recurrent gastrointestinal infections.
AB  == background: lymphocyte subsets in healthy children are currently characterized by age-related standards. because antigenic stimuli play a role in maturation of the immune system after birth, there is a question of whether cellular immune development differs in infants whose living conditions entail extensive antigenic exposure and infants growing up in a more protected environment. methods: peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets were studied in two populations of children of similar age and nutritional status; children belonging to a rural population residing in proximity with farm animals and children from an economically privileged urban population. in each population, children studied included a group with an acute diarrheal episode and a healthy control group. results: among rural population children, 65% had experienced at least one episode of gastroenteritis within the previous 3-month-period, compared with less than 10% of urban population children. in the rural population group 15% had experienced two or more episodes of gastroenteritis. the proportion of helper t cells was similar in rural population and urban population children. among helper t cells,  the proportion of cd29+ "memory" cells of the total cd4+ helper t cells was more  than two times higher than those in rural population children. the proportion of  cd8 cells was higher in rural population children than in urban population children, and the proportion of natural killer cells, cd56+ and cd57+, was two to three times higher in rural population children. within each population, peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets did not differ between the healthy control group and those with acute diarrhea. conclusions: in young children exposure to environmental pathogens and specifically to gastrointestinal antigenic stimuli is a major factor affecting development of the cellular immune response. young children who have experienced enhanced infectious exposure have a peripheral blood lymphocyte profile similar to that of adults.

TI  == expression of the flgfg operon of campylobacter jejuni in escherichia coli yields an extra fusion protein.
AB  == two campylobacter jejuni genes with homology to the escherichia coli flgf and flgg genes encoding two of the basal body rod proteins were isolated, and the nucleotide sequence was determined and analyzed. these two c. jejuni genes were shown, by northern hybridization analysis, to function as a single operon (flgfg). two transcriptional start sites were detected upstream of flgf, corresponding to the two rna transcripts detected in the northern blot. western blot immunoassays using anti-flgf and anti-flgg antibodies demonstrated the synthesis of flgf and flgg proteins in c. jejuni and in escherichia coli containing the c. jejuni flgf and flgg genes. maxicell analysis and western immunoblots using anti-flgf antibodies to probe flgfg-encoded proteins in e. coli revealed the presence of a protein with a molecular mass of approximately the combined mass of the flgf and flgg proteins. anti-flgf antibodies detected in c.  jejuni cell extracts the native flgf protein and also a higher-molecular-weight protein that is likely encoded by the flgf and part of the flgg sequences.

TI  == human milk glycoconjugates that inhibit pathogens.
AB  == breast-fed infants have lower incidence of diarrhea, respiratory disease, and otitis media. the protection by human milk has long been attributed to the presence of secretory iga. however, human milk contains large numbers and amounts of complex carbohydrates, including glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosaminoglycans, mucins, and especially oligosaccharides. the oligosaccharides comprise the third most abundant solid constituent of human milk, and contain a myriad of structures. complex carbohydrate moieties of glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides are synthesized by the many glycosyltransferases in the mammary  gland; those with homology to cell surface glycoconjugate pathogen receptors may  inhibit pathogen binding, thereby protecting the nursing infant. several examples are reviewed: a fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits the diarrheagenic effect of stable toxin of escherichia coli. a different fucosyloligosaccharide inhibits infection by campylobacter jejuni. binding of streptococcus pneumoniae and of enteropathogenic e. coli to their respective receptors is inhibited by human milk oligosaccharides. the 46-kd glycoprotein, lactadherin, inhibits rotavirus binding and infectivity. low levels of lactadherin in human milk are associated with a higher incidence of symptomatic rotavirus in breast-fed infants. a mannosylated glycopeptide inhibits binding by enterohemorrhagic e. coli. a glycosaminoglycan inhibits binding of gp120 to cd4, the first step in hiv infection. human milk mucin inhibits binding by s-fimbriated e. coli. the ganglioside, gm1, reduces diarrhea production by cholera toxin and labile toxin of e. coli. the neutral glycosphingolipid, gb3, binds to shigatoxin. thus, many complex carbohydrates of  human milk may be novel antipathogenic agents, and the milk glycoconjugates and oligosaccharides may be a major source of protection for breastfeeding infants.

TI  == iron storage in bacteria.
AB  == iron is an essential nutrient for nearly all organisms but presents problems of toxicity, poor solubility and low availability. these problems are alleviated through the use of iron-storage proteins. bacteria possess two types of iron-storage protein, the haem-containing bacterioferritins and the haem-free ferritins. these proteins are widespread in bacteria, with at least 39 examples known so far in eubacteria and archaebacteria. the bacterioferritins and ferritins are distantly related but retain similar structural and functional properties. both are composed of 24 identical or similar subunits (approximately  19 kda) that form a roughly spherical protein (approximately 450 kda, approximately 120 a diameter) containing a large hollow centre (approximately 80  a diameter). the hollow centre acts as an iron-storage cavity with the capacity to accommodate at least 2000 iron atoms in the form of a ferric-hydroxyphosphate  core. each subunit contains a four-helix bundle which carries the active site or  ferroxidase centre of the protein. the ferroxidase centres endow ferrous-iron-oxidizing activity and are able to form a di-iron species that is an intermediate in the iron uptake, oxidation and core formation process. bacterioferritins contain up to 12 protoporphyrin ix haem groups located at the two-fold interfaces between pairs of two-fold related subunits. the role of the haem is unknown, although it may be involved in mediating iron-core reduction and iron release. some bacterioferritins are composed of two subunit types, one conferring haem-binding ability (alpha) and the other (beta) bestowing ferroxidase activity. bacterioferritin genes are often adjacent to genes encoding a small [2fe-2s]-ferredoxin (bacterioferritin-associated ferredoxin or bfd). bfd  may directly interact with bacterioferritin and could be involved in releasing iron from (or delivering iron to) bacterioferritin or other iron complexes. some  bacteria contain two bacterioferritin subunits, or two ferritin subunits, that in most cases co-assemble. others possess both a bacterioferritin and a ferritin, while some appear to lack any type of iron-storage protein. the reason for these  differences is not understood. studies on ferritin mutants have shown that ferritin enhances growth during iron starvation and is also involved in iron accumulation in the stationary phase of growth. the ferritin of campylobacter jejuni is involved in redox stress resistance, although this does not appear to be the case for escherichia coli ferritin (ftna). no phenotype has been determined for e. coli bacterioferritin mutants and the precise role of bacterioferritin in e. coli remains uncertain.

TI  == etiologies of acute, persistent, and dysenteric diarrheas in adults in bangui, central african republic, in relation to human immunodeficiency virus serostatus.
AB  == a study of the etiologies of diarrhea in adults in relation to their human immunodeficiency virus (hiv) serostatus and number of cd4+ cells was carried out  in the central african republic. in cases and controls, multi-parasitism was observed. salmonella spp. were identified mainly during acute diarrhea, with 50%  of the s. enteritidis isolated during the study being responsible for septicemia  and/or urinary tract infection in immunodeficient patients. enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) were the most frequently identified agent in hiv+ patients with persistent diarrhea; 42.8% of the patients with eaggec as sole pathogens had bloody diarrhea, and these strains were negative for the presence of a virulence plasmid. coccidia were found in those with acute and persistent diarrhea. blood was observed in 53.3% of infections involving coccidia as the sole pathogen. microsporidium spp. and blastocystis hominis were found only in hiv+ patients with persistent diarrhea. shigella spp., campylobacter spp., and entamoeba histolytica were found in hiv+ and hiv- dysenteric patients; bacteria resembling spirochetes that could not be cultivated were identified only in hiv+  cases with dysentery. shiga-like toxin-producing e. coli o157:h- was isolated from two cases with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. fungi were identified as the sole  pathogen in 6.4% of the hiv+ patients with persistent diarrhea. most of enteropathogenic bacteria identified were resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, remained susceptible to ampicillin plus clavulanic acid, and were susceptible to amikacin, gentamicin, and ciprofloxacin.

TI  == campylobacter fetus surface layer proteins are transported by a type i secretion  system.
AB  == the virulence of campylobacter fetus, a bacterial pathogen of ungulates and humans, is mediated in part by the presence of a paracrystalline surface layer (s-layer) that confers serum resistance. the subunits of the s-layer are s-layer  proteins (slps) that are secreted in the absence of an n-terminal signal sequence and attach to either type a or b c. fetus lipopolysaccharide in a serospecific manner. antigenic variation of multiple slps (encoded by sapa homologs) of type a strain 23d occurs by inversion of a promoter-containing dna element flanked by two sapa homologs. cloning and sequencing of the entire 6.2-kb invertible region  from c. fetus 23d revealed a probable 5.6-kb operon of four overlapping genes (sapcdef, with sizes of 1,035, 1,752, 1,284, and 1,302 bp, respectively) transcribed in the opposite direction from sapa. the four genes also were present in the invertible region of type b strain 84-107 and were virtually identical to  their counterparts in the type a strain. although sapc had no database homologies, sapd, sape, and sapf had predicted amino acid homologies with type i  protein secretion systems (typified by escherichia coli hlybd/tolc or erwinia chrysanthemi prtdef) that utilize c-terminal secretion signals to mediate the secretion of hemolysins, leukotoxins, or proteases from other bacterial species.  analysis of the c termini of four c. fetus slps revealed conserved structures that are potential secretion signals. a c. fetus sapd mutant neither produced nor secreted slps. e. coli expressing c. fetus sapa and sapcdef secreted sapa, indicating that the sapcdef genes are sufficient for slp secretion. c. fetus slps therefore are transported to the cell surface by a type i secretion system.

TI  == irradiation as a method for decontaminating food. a review.
AB  == despite substantial efforts in avoidance of contamination, an upward trend in the number of outbreaks of foodborne illnesses caused by nonsporeforming pathogenic bacteria are reported in many countries. good hygienic practices can reduce the level of contamination but the most important pathogens cannot presently be eliminated from most farms nor is it possible to eliminate them by primary processing, particularly from those foods which are sold raw. several decontamination methods exist but the most versatile treatment among them is the  processing with ionizing radiation. decontamination of food by ionizing radiation is a safe, efficient, environmentally clean and energy efficient process. irradiation is particularly valuable as an endproduct decontamination procedure.  radiation treatment at doses of 2-7 kgy--depending on condition of irradiation and the food--can effectively eliminate potentially pathogenic nonsporeforming bacteria including both long-time recognized pathogens such as salmonella and staphylococcus aureus as well as emerging or "new" pathogens such as campylobacter, listeria monocytogenes or escherichia coli o157:h7 from suspected  food products without affecting sensory, nutritional and technical qualities. candidates of radiation decontamination are mainly poultry and red meat, egg products, and fishery products. it is a unique feature of radiation decontamination that it can also be performed when the food is in a frozen state. with today's demand for high-quality convenience foods, irradiation in combination with other processes holds a promise for enhancing the safety of many minimally processed foods. radiation decontamination of dry ingredients, herbs and enzyme preparations with doses of 3-10 kgy proved to be a viable alternative  to fumigation with microbicidal gases. radiation treatment at doses of 0.15-0.7 kgy under specific conditions appears to be feasible also for control of many foodborne parasites, thereby making infested foods safe for human consumption. microorganisms surviving low- and medium-dose radiation treatment are more sensitive to environmental stresses or subsequent food processing treatments than the microflora of unirradiated products. radiation treatment is an emerging technology in an increasing number of countries and more-and-more clearances on radiation decontaminated foods are issued or expected to be granted in the near future.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are common causes of gastrointestinal disease and a proportion of c. jejuni infections have been shown to be associated with the guillain-barre syndrome. the waac gene from campylobacter coli, involved in lipopolysaccharide core biosynthesis, was cloned by complementation of a heptose-deficient strain of salmonella typhimurium, as judged by novobiocin sensitivity, lipopolysaccharide (lps)-specific phage sensitivity, and polyacrylamide-resolved lipopolysaccharide profiles. the c. jejuni waac gene was  subsequently cloned using the waac gene isolated from c. coli as a probe. the c.  jejuni and c. coli waac genes are capable of encoding proteins of 342 amino acids with calculated molecular masses of 39381da and 39317da, respectively. sequence and in-vitro analyses suggested that the c. coli waac gene may be transcribed from its own promoter. translation of the c. coli waac gene in a cell-free system yielded a protein with a mr of 39000. the waac gene was detected in every c. jejuni and c. coli isolate tested as judged by dot-blot hybridization analysis. southern hybridization analysis indicated that both campylobacter species contain a single copy of the waac gene. unlike escherichia coli and s. typhimurium isolates, the waac gene in c. jejuni and c. coli isolates does not appear to be linked to the waaf (rfaf) gene.

TI  == campylobacter jejuni as a cause of traveler's diarrhea: clinical features and antimicrobial susceptibility.
AB  == traveler's diarrhea is the most common health problem of international travelers. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli seems to be the most frequent cause of  traveler's diarrhea, many other microorganisms, such as campylobacter jejuni, may cause this infectious disease. campylobacter jejuni is recognized as a leading cause of enteritis in humans both in developing and in developed countries. however, a few reports on the incidence and antimicrobial resistance of campylobacter spp. as a cause of traveler's diarrhea have been published. the limited data on the treatment of c. jejuni infections suggest that ciprofloxacin  may shorten the duration of symptoms. however, treatment failure associated with  the emergence of quinolone-resistant strains of c. jejuni has been documented. the purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence of c. jejuni associated with traveler's diarrhea and to analyze the geographic distribution as well as the clinical features and susceptibility to antibiotics.

AB  == the gene encoding the crystalline surface layer (s-layer) protein from campylobacter rectus, designated slp, was sequenced and the recombinant gene product was expressed in escherichia coli. the gene consisted of 4086 nucleotides encoding a protein with 1361 amino acids. the n-terminal amino acid sequence revealed that slp did not contain a signal sequence, but that the initial methionine residue was processed. the deduced amino acid sequence displayed some  common characteristic features of s-layer proteins previously reported. a homology search showed a high similarity to the campylobacter fetus s-layer proteins, especially in their n-terminus. the c-terminal third of slp exhibited homology with the rtx toxins from gram-negative bacteria via the region including the glycine-rich repeats. the slp protein had the same n-terminal sequence as a 104-kda cytotoxin isolated from the culture supernatants of c. rectus. however, neither native nor recombinant slp showed cytotoxicity against hl-60 cells or human peripheral white blood cells. these data support the idea that the n-terminus acts as an anchor to the cell surface components and that the c-terminus is involved in the assembly and/or transport of the protein.

TI  == foodborne illness in the elderly.
AB  == the elderly (> or = 65 years of age) are more susceptible to morbidity and mortality from foodborne-induced gastroenteritis than younger individuals. several factors contribute to the increased susceptibility to foodborne infections as well as other infections in elderly populations. these include an age-associated decrease in humoral and cellular immunity, age-related changes in  the gastrointestinal tract (decreased production of gastric acid and decreased intestinal motility), malnutrition, lack of exercise, entry into nursing homes, and excessive use of antibiotics. data from foodborne outbreaks associated with nursing homes indicate that the elderly are more likely to die from foodborne campylobacter, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella, and staphylococcus aureus infections than the general population. infections by salmonella species are the most common cause of illness and death in nursing homes with salmonella enteritidis as the major cause of both morbidity and mortality. while it is impossible to turn back the clock, practicing a healthy life-style with regular exercise, maintaining a balanced diet, receiving regular  health care, paying attention to personal hygiene, and monitoring food preparation and handling should lead to a reduced incidence of foodborne and other infections in the elderly.

TI  == acid-sensitive enteric pathogens are protected from killing under extremely acidic conditions of ph 2.5 when they are inoculated onto certain solid food sources.
AB  == gastric acidity is recognized as the first line of defense against food-borne pathogens, and the ability of pathogens to resist this ph corresponds to their oral infective dose (id). naturally occurring and genetically engineered acid-sensitive enteric pathogens were examined for their ability to survive under acidic conditions of ph 2.5 for 2 h at 37 degreesc when inoculated onto ground beef. each of the strains displayed significantly high survival rates under these normally lethal conditions. the acid-sensitive pathogens campylobacter jejuni and vibrio cholerae, which were protected at lower levels from acid-induced killing by ground beef under these conditions, were sensitive to killing in acidified media at ph 5.0 but survived at ph 6.0. salmonella inoculated onto the surface of preacidified ground beef could not survive if the ph on the surface of the beef was 2.61 or lower but was viable if the surface ph was 3. 27. this implies that the ph of the microenvironment occupied by the bacteria on the surface of the food source is critical for their survival. salmonella was also shown to be protected from killing when inoculated onto boiled egg white, a food source high  in protein and low in fat. these results may explain why salmonella species have  a higher oral id of approximately 10(5) cells when administered under defined conditions but have been observed to cause disease at doses as low as 50 to 100 organisms when consumed as part of a contaminated food source. they may also help explain why some pathogens are associated primarily with food-borne modes of transmission rather than fecal-oral transmission.

AB  == this study was conducted to describe the occurrence of acquired resistance to antimicrobials used for growth promotion among bacteria isolated from swine, cattle and poultry in denmark. resistance to structurally related therapeutic agents was also examined. three categories of bacteria were tested: 1) indicator  bacteria (escherichia coli, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium), 2) zoonotic bacteria (campylobacter, salmonella, yersinia enterocolitica), and 3) animal pathogens (e. coli, staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), staphylococcus hyicus, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae). all antimicrobials used as growth promoters in denmark and some structurally related  therapeutic agents (in brackets) were included: avilamycin, avoparcin (vancomycin), bacitracin, carbadox, flavomycin, monensin, olaquindox, salinomycin, spiramycin (erythromycin, lincomycin), tylosin (erythromycin, lincomycin), and virginiamycin (pristinamycin). bacterial species intrinsically resistant to an antimicrobial were not tested towards that antimicrobial. breakpoints for growth promoters were established by population distribution of the bacteria tested. a total of 2,372 bacterial isolates collected during october 1995 to september 1996 were included in the study. acquired resistance to all currently used growth promoting antimicrobials was found. a frequent occurrence of resistance were observed to avilamycin, avoparcin, bacitracin, flavomycin, spiramycin, tylosin and virginiamycin, whereas resistance to carbadox, monensin,  olaquindox and salinomycin was less frequent. the occurrence of resistance varied by animal origin and bacterial species. the highest levels of resistance was observed among enterococci, whereas less resistance was observed among zoonotic bacteria and bacteria pathogenic to animals. the association between the occurrence of resistance and the consumption of the antimicrobial is discussed. the results show the present level of resistance to growth promoters in bacteria  from food animals in denmark. they will form the baseline for comparison with future prospective studies, thereby enabling the determination of trends over time.

TI  == the microbiological examination of butchery products and butchers' premises in the united kingdom.
AB  == in a study of 1400 manufacturing butchers' premises, 2330 raw prepared meats, 2192 cooked meats and 4635 environmental samples were examined. verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli o157:h7 (o157 vtec) was isolated from five of 1400 (0.4%) premises. three raw meat products contained o157 vtec, and two raw meat preparation areas and two items of equipment used exclusively for cooked meats were contaminated with o157 vtec. salmonella spp. and campylobacter  spp. were detected in 84 of 2330 (4%) and 15 of 2330 (0.6%) raw meat products, respectively. of the cooked meats examined, seven of 2192 (0.3%) samples were of  unacceptable microbiological quality and a further 352 (16%) were of unsatisfactory quality. of the unacceptable samples, two contained salmonella spp. (salm. typhimurium dt193, salm. typhimurium pt104), three contained staphylococcus aureus in excess of 10(4) cfu g-1, and two contained e. coli in excess of 10(4) cfu g-1. neither campylobacter spp. nor o157 vtec were detected in cooked meats. in the majority of premises, raw and unwrapped cooked meat products were physically separated in displays (94%) and refrigerators (81%), and dedicated equipment/utensils (69-89%) were used for raw meat and unwrapped cooked meat products and other ready-to-eat foods. in approximately half (48%), there were separate serving counters and in 13%, separate staff for raw and cooked meats. most managers (75%) had received some food hygiene training. however, in 29% of premises, one or more members of staff handled raw and then cooked or ready-to-eat foods without washing their hands, and in 11%, one or more staff members handled raw and cooked meats directly with bare hands. a documented hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp) system was present in 17% of premises and in a further 31%, an undocumented haccp system was in place. the low incidence of food-borne pathogens in cooked meat products and in the environmental areas examined, together with a high level of physical separation of raw and cooked meats, indicate that most manufacturing butchers' premises have appropriate physical control measures in place. however, haccp and hygienic practice are areas that require improvement to reduce the risk of cross-contamination with food-borne pathogens from raw to cooked meats.

TI  == the lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis locus of campylobacter jejuni 81116.
AB  == most campylobacter jejuni strains express lipo-oligosaccharides. some strains also express lipopolysaccharides (lps), with o-antigen-like carbohydrate repeats. c. jejuni 81116 expresses an lps containing both lipo-oligosaccharides and o-antigen-like repeats, but nothing is known about the structure or sugar composition of these lps species. a cosmid library of the genome of c. jejuni 81116 was constructed and probed with campylobacter hyoilei genes involved in lps synthesis. five cosmids hybridized with the probe and two of these expressed c. jejuni 81116 lps in escherichia coli. by subcloning, a 16 kb dna region was identified which contains the genetic information required to express c. jejuni lps. dna sequence analysis revealed 11 orfs homologous to genes involved in lps synthesis of other bacteria. they consisted of three homologues of sugar biosynthesis genes, two homologues of transport genes and six homologues of sugar transferases.

TI  == inactivated whole-cell bacterial vaccines: current status and novel strategies.
AB  == inactivated bacterial whole-cell vaccines have been the most widely studied prophylactic treatment for infectious diseases. they offer an economical, and potentially safe, effective means of preventing disease. the disadvantages of these vaccines have been that parenteral administration, while effective in some  instances, may have caused adverse reactions in vaccinees, while oral administration often required high doses and resulted in short-term immunity. more recent studies describing new approaches for improving antigenicity of inactivated whole-cell vaccines and the enhancement of immune responses to oral immunization offer great hope for improving the efficacy of these agents. promising whole cell vaccines include those against vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, and more recently campylobacter jejuni.

TI  == an efficient sampling technique used to detect four foodborne pathogens on pork and beef carcasses in nine belgian abattoirs.
AB  == the method presented in this paper should prove useful in assessing the effectiveness of haccp plans developed in slaughterhouses. samples were collected by swabbing well-defined areas of pork and beef carcasses with sterile gauze. between 160 and 420 half-carcasses were swabbed in each of nine pork or beef slaughterhouses. swabs from five carcasses were placed in the same sterile stomacher bag, constituting a single composite sample. standard or validated analytical methods were used to isolate and characterize four foodborne pathogens. salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, campylobacter spp., and verocytotoxin-producing e. coli were detected, respectively, in 27, 2, 2, and 14% of the pork samples and 0, 22, 10, and 5% of the beef samples. of the 10 samples  positive for e. coli o157, only one yielded an isolate confirmed to be enterohemorrhagic. since salmonella spp. appear as the main contaminant port (27%) and l. monocytogenes as the main containment of beef (22%), any slaughterhouse sampling plan should include testing for the former in the case of pork carcasses and for the latter in the case of beef carcasses. one should also  test regularly for the presence of e. coli o157 and campylobacter spp. in pork and beef abattoirs. the method presented here is an easy way to assess the contamination rate of carcasses at the end of the slaughtering process.

TI  == trisodium phosphate increases sensitivity of gram-negative bacteria to lysozyme and nisin.
AB  == cell suspensions of campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens, and salmonella enteritidis exposed to sublethal concentrations (0.5  to 5 mm) of trisodium phosphate (tsp) for 10 min showed greatly increased susceptibility to lysozyme (10 micrograms ml-1) and/or nisin (1 microm). under optimal conditions at 37 degrees c, reductions in viable count after 30 min were  up to six log cycles. at 4 degrees c, c. jejuni showed greater resistance than at 37 degrees c, and maximal cell kills (95%) were reduced by more than two log cycles. cells dried on the surface of chicken skin were more resistant than suspended cells to tsp-lysozyme and tsp-nisin treatments; nevertheless, at 37 degrees c, kills varied from approximately 95% for s. enteritidis cells with nisin (30 microm) or lysozyme (100 micrograms ml-1) to > 99.9% for c. jejuni and  e. coli cells with nisin. under the experimental conditions used, nisin also reduced viable counts of skin-attached staphylococcus aureus by > 99.9%. the results suggest that the high tsp concentrations (approximately 10% wt/vol, 0.25  m) needed for successful decontamination of gram-negative bacteria, on the surface of poultry and other foodstuffs, may be substantially reduced by following tsp treatment with exposure to low lysozyme or nisin concentrations.

TI  == characterization of the thermal stress response of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni, a microaerophilic, gram-negative bacterium, is a common cause of gastrointestinal disease in humans. heat shock proteins are a group of highly conserved, coregulated proteins that play important roles in enabling organisms to cope with physiological stresses. the primary aim of this study was  to characterize the heat shock response of c. jejuni. twenty-four proteins were preferentially synthesized by c. jejuni immediately following heat shock. upon immunoscreening of escherichia coli transformants harboring a campylobacter genomic dna library, one recombinant plasmid that encoded a heat shock protein was isolated. the recombinant plasmid, designated pmek20, contained an open reading frame of 1,119 bp that was capable of encoding a protein of 372 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 41,436 da. the deduced amino acid sequence of the open reading frame shared similarity with that of dnaj, which belongs to the hsp-40 family of molecular chaperones, from a number of bacteria.  an e. coli dnaj mutant was successfully complemented with the pmek20 recombinant  plasmid, as judged by the ability of bacteriophage lambda to form plaques, indicating that the c. jejuni gene encoding the 41-kda protein is a functional homolog of the dnaj gene from e. coli. the ability of each of two c. jejuni dnaj  mutants to form colonies at 46 degreesc was severely retarded, indicating that dnaj plays an important role in c. jejuni thermotolerance. experiments revealed that a c. jejuni dnaj mutant was unable to colonize newly hatched leghorn chickens, suggesting that heat shock proteins play a role in vivo.

AB  == the etiological agents of diarrhea in vientiane, lao people's democratic republic (lao pdr), were studied in the period from october 1996 to august 1997. a total of 880 patients with diarrhea visiting medical facilities were examined for shigella, salmonella, diarrheagenic escherichia coli, vibrio, aeromonas, campylobacter, and rotavirus. shigella spp., heat-stable enterotoxin (st)-producing e. coli, and serogroup-based enteropathogenic e. coli were found to be the main organisms causing diarrhea in vientiane, with frequencies of 16.8% (148 of 880), 17.2% (111 of 645), and 11.0% (97 of 880), respectively. relatively low incidences were observed in the cases of salmonella spp., (0.6%; 5 of 880), campylobacter spp. (4.4%; 39 of 880), and rotavirus (6.1%; 9 of 148), and no isolates of v. cholerae o1 or o139 or aeromonas were recovered. an analysis of the incidences of enteropathogens with respect to age and seasonal variations demonstrated that the frequencies of isolation of shigella spp. and heat-labile enterotoxin-producing e. coli were significantly higher in those aged 1 to 5 years than in those younger than 1 year of age and those older than 5 years of age (p < 0.0001 and p < 0.05, respectively) and that the frequencies of isolation of shigella spp. and st-producing e. coli were significantly higher in the rainy  season than in the dry season (p < 0.005 and p < 0.001, respectively). almost all strains of shigella spp. tested were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, and erythromycin and were susceptible to cefdinir and ofloxacin. this is the first intensive and longitudinal study to define the etiologic agents of diarrheal diseases in lao pdr.

AB  == both enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) and an obligate intracellular bacterium, previously referred to as an intracellular campylobacter-like organism and now designated lawsonia intracellularis, have been reported as causes of enterocolitis in rabbits. an outbreak of enterocolitis in a group of rabbits, characterized by an unusually high rate of mortality, was found to be associated  with dual infection with epec and l. intracellularis. the epec strain was found to have eaea gene homology but was negative for afra homology. the absence of the afra gene, which encodes the structural subunit for the af/r1 pilus, indicates that this rabbit epec strain is distinct from the prototypic rdec-1 strain. this  finding suggests that rabbit epec strains widely reported in western europe, which lack af/r1 pili, are also present in rabbits in the united states. dual infection with these two pathogens in rabbits has not been previously reported and may have contributed to the unusually high mortality observed in this outbreak.

TI  == the campylobacter fetus s layer is not essential for initial interaction with hep-2 cells.
AB  == in vitro adherence assays were used to determine whether the s layer mediated interactions between campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis strains and hep-2 cells. at multiplicity of infection ratios ranging from 0.1:1 through 100:1, quantitation of bacterial adherence by light microscopy revealed that s layer deficient isogenic c. fetus 809k and c. fetus 810k were not less efficient in their attachment to hep-2 cells; either s layer deficient c. fetus strains interacted with hep-2 cells in greater numbers than the corresponding wild-type parent strains 809 and 810 or there was no significant difference in adherence levels between wild-type and mutant strains. adherence of c. fetus strains to hep-2 cells increased most during the first 2 h of a 22-h incubation period with  only a slight increase in c. fetus cell numbers occurring subsequent to 2 h. at each assay point throughout this 22-h time period, equivalent numbers of wild-type and s layer deficient c. fetus strains were observed associated with hep-2 cells. prior to 2 h, adherence levels of all c. fetus strains exceeded those of escherichia coli ab264 and salmonella typhimurium sl1344. and, unlike s. typhimurium, c. fetus did not undergo significant replication following initial adherence to hep-2 cells. campylobacter fetus did not adhere to hep-2 cells in a  localized or aggregative pattern but were randomly distributed over individual hep-2 cells and at no time during the assay with c. fetus were changes in hep-2 cell morphology apparent. these data suggest that the s layer is not essential for mediating initial interactions between c. fetus and hep-2 cells.

AB  == strains of the periodontal pathogen campylobacter rectus express a 150- to 166-kda protein on their cell surface. this protein forms a paracrystalline lattice, called the surface layer (s-layer), on the outer membrane of this gram-negative bacterium. to initiate a genetic analysis of the function of the s-layer in the pathogenesis of c. rectus, we have cloned and characterized its gene. the s-layer gene (crs) from c. rectus 314 encodes a cell surface protein which does not have a cleaved signal peptide at its amino terminus. although the  amino acid sequence deduced from the crs gene has 50% identity with the amino-terminal 30 amino acids of the four s-layer proteins from campylobacter fetus, the similarity decreases to less than 16% over the rest of the protein. thus, the crs gene from c. rectus encodes a novel s-layer protein whose precise role in pathogenesis may differ from that of s-layer proteins from other organisms. southern and northern blot analyses with probes from different segments of the crs gene indicate that the s-layer gene is a single-copy, monocistronic gene in c. rectus. rna end mapping and sequence analyses were used  to define the crs promoter; there is an exact match to the escherichia coli -10 promoter consensus sequence but only a weak match to the -35 consensus element. southern blots of dna from another strain of c. rectus, atcc 33238, demonstrated  that the crs gene is also present in that strain but that there are numerous restriction fragment length polymorphisms in the second half of the gene. this finding suggests that the carboxy halves of the s-layer proteins from strains 314 and 33238 differ. it remains to be determined whether the diversities in sequence are reflected in functional or antigenic differences important for the pathogenesis of different c. rectus isolates.

TI  == clinical, microbiological and epidemiological aspects of escherichia coli o157 infection.
AB  == in the last decade infections caused by escherichia coli o157:h7 and other verocytotoxigenic e. coli (vtec) have emerged as a major public health concern in north america and in europe, and increasingly in other areas of the world. although absolute numbers of infections are low in comparison with other enteric  pathogens such as salmonella or campylobacter, it is well-recognised that e. coli o157 can produce severe, potentially life-threatening, illness. as a consequence  of this awareness, there has been a rapid expansion of our knowledge about these  organisms and the diseases which they cause. in this article, the clinical, microbiological and epidemiological features of vtec o157 infection are reviewed.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the fur gene from helicobacter pylori.
AB  == the fur homologue of helicobacter pylori was isolated by screening a plasmid-based, genomic dna library using the fur titration assay (furta). the analysis of the dna sequence revealed significant homology with fur proteins from various other bacterial species. the highest degree of homology was observed for  the fur protein from campylobacter jejuni. the h. pylori fur gene on a plasmid could partially complement the fur mutation in escherichia coli strain h1681. the repressor activity depended on addition of iron to the medium indicating that iron acts as a co-repressor for the h. pylori protein similar to fur from other bacteria. comparison of fur from h. pylori strain nctc11638 with the recently published genomic dna sequence of another strain (26695) confirmed the identity of the fur homologue and revealed that the fur locus is highly conserved in both  strains.

TI  == trends in antibiotic resistance among diarrheal pathogens isolated in thailand over 15 years.
AB  == antibiotic resistance trends were examined for shigella species, nontyphoidal salmonella species, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), and campylobacter species isolates from indigenous persons and travelers in thailand for up to 15 years. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was found in >90% of shigella  and 40% of etec and nontyphoidal salmonella isolates. resistance to nalidixic acid was found in 97%-100% of shigella dysenteriae 1 strains isolated between 1992 and 1995. ciprofloxacin resistance was detected in 1% of etec isolates in 1994 and 1995 and in one of 349 nontyphoidal salmonella isolates in 1995. ciprofloxacin resistance among campylobacter species increased from zero before 1991 to 84% in 1995 (p < .0001). azithromycin resistance was found in 7%-15% of campylobacter isolates in 1994 and 1995, as well as 15% of etec and 3% of salmonella isolates in 1995. enteric pathogens in thailand have developed resistance to virtually all antibiotics routinely used in the treatment of diarrhea, as well as the newer fluoroquinolone and macrolide classes of drugs.

TI  == foodborne diseases. emerging pathogens and trends.
AB  == the epidemiology of foodborne diseases is rapidly changing. in the past 15 years, new foodborne pathogens, such as campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli o157:h7, have emerged as important public health problems. well-recognized pathogens, such as salmonella serotype enteritidis, have increased in prevalence  or become associated with new vehicles, and pathogens such as c. jejuni and s. typhimurium are becoming increasingly resistant to antimicrobial agents. evolving trends in foodborne diseases are being driven by the same factors that have led to the emergence of other infectious diseases: changes in demographic characteristics of the population, human behavior, industry, and technology and the shift toward a global economy, microbial adaptation, and breakdown in the public health infrastructure. addressing emerging foodborne disease will require  more sensitive and timely surveillance, enhanced methods of laboratory identification and subtyping, and identification of effective prevention and control strategies.

AB  == stool specimens from 3,600 diarrhoeal patients from the island of crete, greece,  were examined for bacterial pathogens, during a three-year period (1992-1994). one or more pathogens were identified in 826 patients (22.9%), more often from children. salmonella spp. were the most frequently isolated organisms in 13.6% of the patients, followed by campylobacter in 4.7%, and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) in 3.9%. yersinia enterocolitica was found in 0.7%, shigella spp. in  0.7% and aeromonas hydrophila in 0.05%. vibrio spp. and enterohaemorragic e. coli were not identified in the stools tested. resistance to ampicillin was observed in 36% of the salmonella, 62% of the shigella, and 27% of the epec isolates. cotrimoxazole resistance was observed in 42% of the shigella and 12% of the epec  isolates, while tetracycline and the quinolones were inactive against almost half and erythromycin against 20% of the campylobacter isolates. this is the first study investigating bacterial pathogens associated with diarrhoea on the island of crete.

TI  == identification of campylobacter jejuni promoter sequences.
AB  == a promoterless lacz shuttle vector, which allowed screening of promoters by beta-galactosidase activity in campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli, was developed. chromosomal dna fragments from c. jejuni were cloned into this vector; 125 of 1,824 clones displayed promoter activity in c. jejuni. eleven clones with  strong promoter activity in c. jejuni were further characterized. their nucleotide sequences were determined, and the transcriptional start sites of the  putative promoters in c. jejuni were determined by primer extension. only 6 of these 11 promoters were functional in e. coli. the 11 newly characterized and 10  previously characterized c. jejuni promoters were used to establish a consensus sequence for c. jejuni promoters. the 21 promoters were found to be very similar. they contain three conserved regions, located approximately 10, 16, and 35 bp upstream of the transcriptional start point. the -10 region resembles that of a typical sigma70 e. coli promoter, but the -35 region is completely different. in  addition a -16 region typical for gram-positive bacteria was identified.

TI  == characterization and quantification of bacterial pathogens and indicator organisms in household kitchens with and without the use of a disinfectant cleaner.
AB  == this two year study evaluated the prevalence of indicator bacteria and specific pathogens in 10 'normal' kitchens in the united states. in phase i, none of the kitchens was cleaned with an antimicrobial cleaner or disinfectant. eight locations within the kitchens were monitored for: total heterotrophs, staphylococci, pseudomonas, total coliforms and faecal coliforms. almost all locations at all households exhibited contamination, with the sink and sponge samples exhibiting large bacterial concentrations. the faecal coliform concentrations in sink and sponge samples were very high, with 63 and 67% of all  samples being positive, respectively. escherichia coli was detected in 16.7% of all sink surfaces and 33.3% of all sponges. salmonella was detected once and campylobacter, on two occasions. in a second phase, households were provided with an antimicrobial disinfectant cleaner which families were encouraged to use but not forced to do so; in some cases, the product was used infrequently or not at all. this regimen did not demonstrate any consistent reduction in the incidence of bacterial contamination. by contrast, in the final phase of the study where disinfectant use was targeted for surfaces soon after contamination with foods or hands, the incidence of contamination decreased dramatically. these data show that normal kitchens can easily be contaminated with a variety of bacterial contaminants including faecal coliforms, e. coli, salmonella and campylobacter. irregular use, or not using antimicrobial agents, is unlikely to reduce the risk  of these infectious agents. by contrast, targeted use is likely to reduce the incidence of bacterial contaminants.

TI  == host mutations (miaa and rpsl) reduce tetracycline resistance mediated by tet(o)  and tet(m).
AB  == the effects of mutations in host genes on tetracycline resistance mediated by the tet(o) and tet(m) ribosomal protection proteins, which originated in campylobacter spp. and streptococcus spp., respectively, were investigated by using mutants of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. the miaa, miab, and miaab double mutants of s. typhimurium specify enzymes for trna modification at the adenosine at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon in trna. in s. typhimurium, this involves biosynthesis of n6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthio-adenosine (ms2io6a). the miaa mutation reduced the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by both tet(o) and tet(m),  but the latter showed a greater effect, which was ascribed to the isopentenyl (i6) group or to a combination of the methylthioadenosine (ms2) and i6 groups but not to the ms2 group alone (specified by miab). in addition, mutations in e. coli rpsl genes, generating both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-dependent strains, were also shown to reduce the level of tetracycline resistance mediated  by tet(o) and tet(m). the single-site amino acid substitutions present in the rpsl mutations were pleiotropic in their effects on tetracycline mics. these mutants affect translational accuracy and kinetics and suggest that tet(o) and tet(m) binding to the ribosome may be reduced or slowed in the e. coli rpsl mutants in which the s12 protein is altered. data from both the miaa and rpsl mutant studies indicate a possible link between stability of the aminoacyl-trna in the ribosomal acceptor site and tetracycline resistance mediated by the ribosomal protection proteins.

AB  == a formalin inactivated, campylobacter jejuni whole cell vaccine, either with or without escherichia coli heat labile toxin (lt) as a mucosal adjuvant, was administered orally to broiler chickens. three vaccine trials were performed, differing in the number of vaccinations, and time of administration, as well as the inclusion and dose of lt. the overall reductions of c. jejuni colonization in the vaccinated chickens ranged from 16 to 93% compared with non-vaccinated controls. enhanced levels of anti-c. jejuni secretory iga antibodies were demonstrated in vaccinated chickens. vaccination also appeared to induce an anamnestic response to c. jejuni antigens in the 14-33 kda range, as demonstrated by western immunoblots. interestingly, the inclusion of lt in the vaccine regimen did not appear to boost the immunogenicity of the vaccine. these results are encouraging and suggest that future development of successful oral vaccines for the control of enteropathogenic campylobacter in poultry is feasible.

TI  == [the drug susceptibility pattern of the presumed etiologic agents of infectious enteritis including verotoxin-producing escherichia coli o-157].
AB  == the drug susceptibility patterns were investigated for verotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) including o-157, salmonella spp., vibrio parahaemolyticus and campylobacter jejuni subsp. jejuni that were obtained in and after july 1996. the results are summarized as follows; 1. we found highly resistant strains of vtec to tetracycline (tc) and ampicillin (abpc). minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of some of the drugs against vtec in an aerobic condition were significantly different from those in an anaerobic condition. for example, aerobic.anaerobic mic ranges of the drugs tested were as follows: chroramphenicol (cp): 1.56-3.13 micrograms/ml.0.78-1.56 micrograms/ml, tc: 1.56-> 100 micrograms/ml.0.78-> 100 micrograms/ml, minocycline (mino): 1.56-12.5 micrograms/ml.0.78-3.13 micrograms/ml, kanamycin (km): 3.13-6.25 micrograms/ml.25-100 micrograms/ml, fosfomycin (fom): 3.13-25 micrograms/ml.0.78-6.25 micrograms/ml, norfloxacin (nflx): < or = 0.025-0.2 microgram/ml.< or = 0.025-0.2 microgram/ml, abpc: 1.56-> 100 micrograms/ml.0.78-> 100 micrograms/ml and cefaclor (ccl): 1.56-25 micrograms/ml.56-12.5 micrograms/ml. mics of cp and tetracyclines (tcs) in an anaerobic condition were  lower by twofold and the mic of fom was lower by fourfold, but the variabilities  of mic-ranges of nflx, abpc and ccl were small. the mic of km was high. 2. we observed that some of salmonella spp. were highly resistant to cp, tcs and mino,  and some were moderately resistant to nflx. 3. the detection frequency of tc-resistant strains and nflx-insensitive or resistant strains were high among c. jejuni subsp. jejuni. 4. strains of v. parahaemolyticus and c. jejuni subsp. jejuni were mostly resistant to abpc and ccl, mics of which were in high ranges.  5. fecal concentrations in mino, km, fom and nflx reported in literatures are high enough to have some antimicrobial activities, leed dose of abpc and ccl are  quite low.

TI  == construction of a helicobacter pylori-escherichia coli shuttle vector for gene transfer in helicobacter pylori.
AB  == in this study, a helicobacter pylori-escherichia coli shuttle vector was constructed for transferring dna into h. pylori. the smallest cryptic plasmid (1.2 kb), php489, among those harbored by 77 h. pylori isolates was selected as a base replicon for constructing vectors. hindiii-digested php489 was ligated with  a kanamycin resistance gene [aph(3')-iii], which originated from campylobacter jejuni, to produce the recombinant plasmid php489k. php489k was efficiently transformed into and stably maintained in h. pylori strains. the shuttle vector pbhp489k (3.6 kb) was constructed by the recombination of php489, cole1, and aph(3')-iii sequences. pbhp489k was reciprocally transformed into and maintained  in both h. pylori and e. coli. introduction of the shuttle vector clone dna (pbhp489k/ab; 6.7 kb), containing the urea and ureb genes of h. pylori, into urease-negative mutants of h. pylori led to the restoration of their urease activity. the transformants were confirmed to contain the incoming plasmid dna. pbhp489k satisfied the requirements for an h. pylori-e. coli shuttle vector, implying that it might be a useful vector for investigating pathogenicity and restriction-modification systems of h. pylori.

AB  == three gene libraries of campylobacter jejuni 72dz/92 dna were prepared using lambda gt11, psupercos and pwsk129 cloning vectors. screening of the libraries with escherichia coli absorbed antiserum generated against whole c. jejuni revealed several immunoreactive clones of apparent molecular masses 19, 28, 30 and 50 kda. the most commonly isolated clones expressed 30 kda protein. the nucleotide sequence of the 1768 bp c. jejuni dna yielded one complete (orf2) and  two partial open reading frames (orf1 and orf3). orf2 encoded cjaa protein exhibits relevant overall homology to several prokaryotic solute binding proteins (family 3), components of the abc transport system, while the product of the truncated orf3 (cjab protein) shows extensive homology to gram-negative bacterial proteins, members of the sugar transporter family. the genetic organization of the putative cjaab operon was studied. the cjaa gene fragment (616 bp) was amplified from three c. jejuni strains isolated from patients with acute bloody diarrhea, whereas it was not amplified from strains which caused acute diarrhea with no blood in the stools. the gene was introduced into avirulent salmonella typhimurium vaccine strain where it is expressed at a reasonably high level.

TI  == produce handling and processing practices.
AB  == in the past decade, outbreaks of human illness associated with the consumption of raw vegetables and fruits (or unpasteurized products produced from them) have increased in the united states. changes in agronomic, harvesting, distribution, processing, and consumption patterns and practices have undoubtedly contributed to this increase. pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes, clostridium botulinum, and bacillus cereus are naturally present in some soil, and their presence on fresh produce is not rare. salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae, parasites, and viruses are more likely to  contaminate fresh produce through vehicles such as raw or improperly composted manure, irrigation water containing untreated sewage, or contaminated wash water. contact with mammals, reptiles, fowl, insects, and unpasteurized products of animal origin offers another avenue through which pathogens can access produce. surfaces, including human hands, which come in contact with whole or cut produce  represent potential points of contamination throughout the total system of growing, harvesting, packing, processing, shipping, and preparing produce for consumption. treatment of produce with chlorinated water reduces populations of pathogenic and other microorganisms on fresh produce but cannot eliminate them. reduction of risk for human illness associated with raw produce can be better achieved through controlling points of potential contamination in the field; during harvesting; during processing or distribution; or in retail markets, food-service facilities, or the home.

TI  == emerging foodborne diseases: an evolving public health challenge.
AB  == the epidemiology of foodborne disease is changing. new pathogens have emerged, and some have spread worldwide. many, including salmonella, escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter, and yersinia enterocolitica, have reservoirs in healthy food animals, from which they spread to an increasing variety of foods. these pathogens cause millions of cases of sporadic illness and chronic complications,  as well as large and challenging outbreaks over many states and nations. improved surveillance that combines rapid subtyping methods, cluster identification, and collaborative epidemiologic investigation can identify and halt large, dispersed  outbreaks. outbreak investigations and case-control studies of sporadic cases can identify sources of infection and guide the development of specific prevention strategies. better understanding of how pathogens persist in animal reservoirs is also critical to successful long-term prevention. in the past, the central challenge of foodborne disease lay in preventing the contamination of human food  with sewage or animal manure. in the future, prevention of foodborne disease will increasingly depend on controlling contamination of feed and water consumed by the animals themselves.

AB  == sequencing of a fragment of helicobacter pylori genome led to the identification  of two open reading frames showing striking homology with coenzyme a (coa) transferases, enzymes catalyzing the reversible transfer of coa from one carboxylic acid to another. the genes were present in all h. pylori strains tested by polymerase chain reaction or slot blotting but not in campylobacter jejuni. genes for the putative a and b subunits of h. pylori coa-transferase were introduced into the bacterial expression vector pkk223-3 and expressed in escherichia coli jm105 cells. amino acid sequence comparisons, combined with measurements of enzyme activities using different coa donors and acceptors, identified the h. pylori coa-transferase as a succinyl coa:acetoacetate coa-transferase. this activity was consistently observed in different h. pylori strains. antibodies raised against either recombinant a or b subunits recognized  two distinct subunits of mr approximately 26,000 and 24, 000 that are both necessary for h. pylori coa-transferase function. the lack of alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and of succinyl coa synthetase activities indicates that the generation of succinyl coa is not mediated by the tricarboxylic acid cycle in h.  pylori. we postulate the existence of an alternative pathway where the coa-transferase is essential for energy metabolism.

TI  == distribution of serotypes of campylobacter jejuni and c. coli from danish patients, poultry, cattle and swine.
AB  == the number of human cases of enteritis caused by campylobacter jejuni and c. coli is increasing in denmark and other european countries. no systemic typing has earlier been performed on campylobacter isolates of danish origin. the primary purpose of this study was to provide a serotype distribution of campylobacter isolates from danish patients and the major food production animals. in addition, the occurrence of intestinal carriers of thermophilic campylobacters among these  food production animals was examined. in a nationwide survey, the individual isolation rate was 36% for broiler chickens, 47% for cattle and 46% for swine when sampled at the slaughterhouse. c. jejuni accounted for 83-91% of the thermophilic campylobacter spp. in broiler chickens and cattle, whereas 95% of the isolates from swine was c. coli. in human patients with campylobacter enteritis, 94% of the isolates were c. jejuni and 6% were c. coli. heat-stable serotyping (the 'penner scheme') was performed on a total of 398 isolates from the four sources: human patients (n = 145), broiler chickens (n = 94), swine (n = 111) and cattle (n = 48). among human isolates, serotype o:1,44, o:2 and the o:4-complex accounted for 62% of the c. jejuni isolates. these serotypes were also common in samples from broilers and cattle. in swine, c. coli o:30 and o:46  were most common. the serotype distribution of human clinical isolates showed large overlap with the serotype distribution of campylobacters in cattle and chickens, and on this basis both could be major sources of human campylobacteriosis.

TI  == effect of cytolethal distending toxin on f-actin assembly and cell division in chinese hamster ovary cells.
AB  == cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) is a newly described toxin produced by a number of enteropathogens, including campylobacter jejuni, various escherichia coli strains, and a few shigella species. cdt induces distension and eventual death of a number of transformed cell lines. here, we extend previous studies by demonstrating that morphological changes in cdt-treated chinese hamster ovary cells are coincident with changes in cytoskeletal structure and an inhibition of  cell proliferation. cdt-treated cells underwent a progressive accumulation of f-actin assemblies which microscopically resembled actin stress fibers. accumulation of the stress fiber-like structures in cdt-treated cells was accompanied by an apparent blockage of cell division. multinucleation was detected in some cells but did not constitute a significant feature of cdt action. although toxin-treated cells failed to divide, cell viability remained high for the first 4 days following toxin treatment, as evidenced by trypan blue  exclusion and neutral red uptake. [3h]thymidine incorporation studies on cdt-treated cells were consistent with a blockage of cell proliferation without a direct inhibition of dna synthesis. although the progression of toxin action developed slowly, a 2-min exposure to cdt resulted in an irreversible development of toxicity. together, our data indicate that cdt affects f-actin assembly within target cells and may interrupt the regulation or function of cell cycle-dependent events leading to cytokinesis.

TI  == public health and pork and pork products: regional perspectives of denmark.
AB  == an ambitious programme to eliminate pork as an important source of human salmonellosis was initiated in denmark in 1993 by the ministry of food, agriculture and fisheries. the programme comprises control of feedmills, breeding and multiplying herds, slaughter herds and slaughter plants, as well as the final product, fresh pork. as a consequence, the level of occurrence of salmonella spp. in fresh pork produced in denmark is approximately 1%. yersinia enterocolitica 0:3 infections are common in slaughter pig herds in denmark, and pork is considered to be the only source of human infection in the country. the incidence of pork-related occurrences of human salmonellosis and yersiniosis in 1996 was approximately nine cases per 100,000 inhabitants for both diseases. all swine in  denmark are screened for trichinella spp. infection, although no positive results have been obtained since 1930. swine are not considered to be a source for campylobacter jejuni or enterohaemorrhagic escherichia coli in denmark. listeria  monocytogenes can be detected in relatively high rates in pork: however, the incidence of human listeriosis is only 0.5 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. toxoplasma gondii antibodies have been demonstrated in 3% of slaughter pigs, though the importance of pork as a source of infection is probably very low. denmark is officially free from brucella abortus, b. melitensis and mycobacterium bovis.

TI  == risks and prevention of contamination of dairy products.
AB  == consumers and regulatory officials are becoming increasingly aware of the human health risk of the presence of micro-organisms or chemicals in the agricultural environment. providing 'on-farm food safety' programmes which address the daily management of the production unit with regard to animal health and well-being, public health and environmental health must be a top priority for agriculturalists and veterinarians. developing critical control point management  (ccpm) procedures for animal and human health concerns is a viable approach to aid in alleviating public concerns about dairy products and the food supply in general. such ccpm programmes may be created for individual production units based upon risk analysis, total quality management and hazard analysis and critical control point principles. implementation of these programmes will be essential both in addressing food safety concerns for the resident population of  a nation and in developing or maintaining international markets for the export of animal products.

TI  == public health hazards from small ruminant meat products in europe.
AB  == foodborne diseases, in particular those related to meat and meat products, have recently become a matter of great public concern. sheep and goat meat can transmit infections and diseases either through handling during preparation procedures or as a result of ingestion by the consumer. the authors highlight the second route of contamination in relation to meat and meat products from small ruminants in european countries. among the most important diseases transmitted by mutton and goat meat, toxoplasmosis remains the greatest threat, particularly in  immuno-compromised people and in pregnant women. other pathogens which may be associated with the consumption of meat from small ruminants include: clostridium perfringens, cryptosporidium parvum and campylobacter jejuni. as with other ruminant species, escherichia coli o157:h7 can be considered as an emerging pathogen, for which control efforts must be made. the classical zoonoses (brucellosis, q fever, hydatidosis) are also presented here, although the major source of contamination for these diseases remains contact with infected animals  or the handling of carcasses. the fact that the association of foodborne diseases with mutton and goat meat is less frequent than with the meat of other animal species should be noted, for the following reasons: a) lower levels of production; b) less intensive production, leading to a weaker microbial contamination; c) mutton and goat meat are subjected to processing less often than other meats; d) the usual boiling or cooking processes.

TI  == meat from dairy cows: possible microbiological hazards and risks.
AB  == the authors provide an overview of the circumstances associated with culling of dairy cattle in the united states of america (usa) and focus on the possible significant microbiological hazards associated with meat from cull dairy cows. cull dairy cows are an important source of food in the usa, accounting for at least approximately 17% of ground beef. the potential microbiological hazards for foodborne illness from cull dairy cows discussed here include salmonella (with special attention to s. typhimurium dt104), escherichia coli o157:h7, campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. possible sources and means of contamination are pointed out, as are the potential foodborne risks from bacillus cereus and aeromonas spp. in conclusion, widespread microbiological studies are needed to determine the prevalence and risk of foodborne pathogens in cull dairy cattle.

TI  == intensive (pasture) beef cattle operations: the perspective of new zealand.
AB  == beef production in new zealand has characteristics typical of a temperate climate and pasture-based animal husbandry. the specific pathogens which may contaminate  fresh beef and which are empirically considered to be of public health importance are similar to those in other countries with temperate climates, i.e. salmonella, campylobacter, escherichia coli o157:h7, listeria monocytogenes and toxoplasma gondii. with the exception of t. gondii, it is likely that almost all transmission of these hazards through consumption of beef results from unseen microbial cross-contamination from gastrointestinal sources during slaughter, dressing and further processing. gaining comprehensive information on carcass contamination levels is an essential first step in establishing food safety objectives for a particular beef production system, and in designing risk-based hazard analysis and critical control point (haccp) plans. it is likely that the lower mean and maximum numbers of indicator micro-organisms on new zealand carcasses (when compared with other countries) are in part due to the pre-slaughter cleanliness status of cattle reared under temperate, pasture conditions. similarly, the failure to detect specific pathogens of gastrointestinal origin in a comprehensive baseline survey most probably reflects the limited pathway for faecal contamination during slaughter and dressing under  processing conditions in new zealand. the new zealand example provides strong evidence for the need to design haccp plans according to the specific national (or regional) situation. reducing all pathways for faecal contamination of products to the maximum extent practicable will be the most important factor in achieving desired food safety objectives for fresh beef. variable densities of microbial pathogens in gastrointestinal contents are also likely to have a significant effect on subsequent contamination levels of beef carcasses: however, effective controls for limiting the presence of most pathogens of concern in the  live animal have yet to be identified.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of terminalia macroptera root.
AB  == terminalia macroptera guill et perr. (combretaceae) is a medicinal plant used in  guinea-bissau and other west african countries to treat infectious diseases. the  ethanol extract from t. macroptera decorticated root and their liquid-liquid partition fractions, were screened for antimicrobial activity, by the twofold serial microdilution assay against seven reference bacterial strains and against  candida albicans. the extract and fractions showed some activity against at least one of the test microorganisms. the best results were obtained against shigella dysenteriae and vibrio cholerae. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of t. macroptera ethanol extract were also determined for about 100 clinical strains of campylobacter sp., escherichia coli, salmonella sp., shigella sp. and vibrio cholerae. the ethanol extract activity against campylobacter strains is similar to co-trimoxazole, higher than sulfamethoxazole but lower than tetracycline, erythromycin, ampicillin and streptomycin. ellagitannins are the major compounds  in the extract and active fractions. the obtained results suggest a potential importance of this medicinal plant in the treatment of enteric diseases, particularly in campylobacter infections.

TI  == outbreaks of food poisoning in adults due to escherichia coli o111 and campylobacter associated with coach trips to northern france.
AB  == thirty-seven out of 48 people on a coach excursion to northern france developed gastrointestinal symptoms within 4 days of the trip. twenty-six had stool samples positive for escherichia coli o111, 8 were also positive for campylobacter species, and 1 was positive for campylobacter alone. strains of e. coli were positive for the effacing and attaching protein (eaea) gene, but negative for other e. coli virulence genes, and therefore belonged to the enteropathogenic e.  coli (epec) group. twenty-two out of 37 people in a second party which followed the same itinerary 2 weeks later also became ill. one had a stool sample positive for e. coli o111. analytical epidemiology suggested that the source of infections was a restaurant in northern france at which both parties had eaten.

TI  == [acute diarrhea: stool water loss in hospitalized infants and its correlation with etiologic agents and lactose content in the diet].
AB  == forty weaned male infants were studied during their first year of life, all hospitalized with acute diarrhea in the gastroenterology and metabolism unit of the hospital "umberto i", sao paulo, sp, brazil. we evaluated and quantified water fecal losses, employing the metabolic bed technique, relating the feeding formula employed with the different causal enteropathogenic agents. 67.5% of the  studied infants were under six months and 40% under three months of age. two groups were randomly assembled to receive, lactose or lactose free feeding formulae. twenty one patients received a lactose-containing formula (ninho 10%) and the other 19 children were fed caseine (portagen) formulae. according to coproculture results and identification of enteropathogenic agents, we divided the studied infants relating feeding formula with the presence or absence of the  enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec): i-13 with positive coproculture for epec and diets which included lactose--(l/epec+); ii--eight with negative coproculture for epec and diets which included lactose--(l/epec-); iii--seven with positive coproculture for epec and lactose free diets--(g/epec+); iv--12 with negative coproculture for epec and lactose free diets. (g/epec-). the most frequently isolated agent at coproculture was epec, in 20 of the cases (50%), followed by campylobacter (7.5%). it was also possible to observe that the frequencies of eiec, salmonella and rotavirus were all equal (2.5%). mixed infections occurred only between epec and eiec, registering a frequency of 5%. the eiec samples, associated to epec 0111 were serotyped as 0 28 ac: h- and 0 152:h-. the use of metabolic bed made the evaluation of fecal volumes possible by a simple and quick technique, thus allowing a closer clinical monitoring, as well as a more reliable evaluation of the patients hospitalized with acute diarrhea. average acceptance volumes of the formulae--either with or without lactose--were  always below the amount recommended by fao/who (100 kcal/day) which shows the impact of acute diarrhea on the decrease of food intake. the average volumes of watery fecal losses found among any of the studied subgroups may be considered quite relevant when compared to standard values. especially within the l/epec+ group fecal losses, both on the first day (83.56 ml/kg/day) and, mainly, on the second (119.44 ml/kg/day) reached exceedingly high levels indicating a disastrous association between the presence of epec in the small intestine and lactose offer in the diet. thus, the results show that there exists a positive and significant  association between poor lactose absorption and the presence of epec in the feces. who's recommendation proposing the use of diluted cow milk, in universal and indiscriminate administration, in the two first days of the disease, may represent a risk factor, not only for malnutrition, but also for the survival rates of children with severe diarrhea, especially those under six months of age  and hospitalized with epec enteroinfection.

TI  == emerging foodborne diseases.
AB  == the epidemiology of foodborne diseases is rapidly changing. recently described pathogens, such as escherichia coli o157:h7 and the epidemic strain of salmonella serotype typhimurium definitive type 104 (which is resistant to at least five antimicrobial drugs), have become important public health problems. well-recognized pathogens, such as salmonella serotype enteritidis, have increased in prevalence or become associated with new vehicles. emergence in foodborne diseases is driven by the same forces as emergence in other infectious  diseases: changes in demographic characteristics, human behavior, industry, and technology; the shift toward a global economy; microbial adaptation; and the breakdown in the public health infrastructure. addressing emerging foodborne diseases will require more sensitive and rapid surveillance, enhanced methods of  laboratory identification and subtyping, and effective prevention and control.

TI  == [bacteriological studies on sporadic diarrhea diseases in oita district, 1985-1996].
AB  == approaching the problem of how close the sporadic diarrhea diseases correlate with epidemics of infectious diarrheas, including food poisonings, bacteriological studies were made on the characteristics of sporadic diarrheas in the past 10 years and analyzed. in collaboration with physicians, mostly pediatricians, in oita district during 1985 to 1986 and 1989 to 1996, a total of  1707 specimens was obtained from diarrhea patients, suspected of bacterial cause. we have isolated 717 strains from 670 specimens (ca 40% of the total). the majority were; campylobacter, salmonella and epec with the rate of about 40, 24 and 23% respectively. on the other hand, isolation of vibrio spp. and staphylococcus were very few. the yearly trend of detection rates of such major agents were as follows: campylobacter had the highest rate in the early period, 1989, but thereafter tended to decrease. in contrast, salmonella continued to increase in rate through the study period until the present when it exceeds that  of campylobacter. this alternation is due primarily to the rapid increase of s. enteritidis since its recent appearance. vtec stays at a low rate with a slow increase showing no prevalence so far. from the above results the following may meet with attention. vibrios and staphylococci, known as popular agents for food  poisonings, seem unlikely to correlate with sporadic diarrheas. instead, the evidence that recent food poisoning is often represented by salmonella, especially s. enteritidis, suggests that epidemics of infectious diarrhea may be  attributed to the background of common sporadic diarrheas.

TI  == helicobacter pylori induces an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines in human gastric epithelial cells: quantification of mrna for interleukin-8, -1 alpha/beta, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha.
AB  == despite the fact that helicobacter pylori is known to be non-invasive, mucosal infiltration of inflammatory cells have been observed in the gastric mucosa. the  exact pathogenesis of such an inflammatory reaction has not been well defined. we explored the repertoire of cytokine genes expressed in human gastric epithelial cells in response to coculture with h. pylori. after gastric epithelial cells, snu-5 and kato iii, were infected with h. pylori, expression of several cytokine  genes was assessed using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. interleukin (il)-8, -1 alpha and -1 beta mrna were expressed in both gastric epithelial cells throughout the entire infection period. in snu-5, il-1 alpha and il-8 mrna were expressed at 1 h, reached a peak level at 4 h and then decreased. interleukin-1 beta mrna was expressed less frequently than il-1 alpha, or il-8 mrna. in snu-5 cells, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (gm-csf), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (mcp-1), and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha) mrna were expressed at 9 h, but was not expressed in kato iii. gene expression paralleled the amount of il-8 protein measured by enzyme-linked immunoabsorbent assay (elisa). interleukin-8 mrna expression was not observed in kato iii cells infected with campylobacter fetus ssp. fetus, campylobacter jejuni or escherichia coli. il-8 mrna expression was increased not  only in gastric epithelial cells but also in non-gastric cells infected with h. pylori. these results suggest that an inflammatory reaction induced by h. pylori  may be initially triggered by an array of pro-inflammatory cytokines expressed by infected gastric epithelial cells.

TI  == a new cytolethal distending toxin (cdt) from escherichia coli producing cnf2 blocks hela cell division in g2/m phase.
AB  == escherichia coli strain 1404, isolated from a septicaemic calf, carries a transferable plasmid called pvir which codes for the cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 2 (cnf2). a 4h interaction between strain 1404 and hela cells induced the formation of giant mononucleated cells blocked in g2/m phase. mating experiments  between strain 1404 and a non-pathogenic recipient strain demonstrated that the factor(s) encoded by pvir mediated the cell-cycle arrest. a 3.3 kb dna fragment isolated from a dna bank of pvir was shown to code for the factor(s) causing the  cell-cycle arrest. nucleotide sequence analysis revealed the presence of three genes encoding proteins sharing significant amino acid homology with the cytolethal distending toxins (cdts) previously isolated from e. coli, campylobacter jejuni and shigella dysenteriae. southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the pvir of other cnf2-producing e. coli strains contained sequences related to cdt. although the amino acid sequences amongst cdt diverged  significantly, the two other cdts previously isolated from e. coli were also able to block the hela cell cycle. in conclusion, this study demonstrates the mode of  action of cdt and will help us to elucidate the role of this emerging toxin family in microbial pathogenesis.

AB  == objective: bacteria play a crucial pathogenetic role in lyme arthritis (la), reactive arthritis (rea), other forms of spondyloarthropathy (spa), and possibly  in undifferentiated oligoarthritis (uoligo). polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technology has been applied to detect bacterial dna of individual microbes in synovial fluid (sf) of patients with arthritides. we screened for dna sequences of 8 bacterial species simultaneously in sf of patients with inflammatory joint disease. methods: we examined 104 sf samples of 96 patients with rea (n = 13), undifferentiated spa (uspa, n = 10), uoligo (n = 50), juvenile chronic arthritis  (jca, n = 13), and rheumatoid arthritis (ra, n = 10). a nested pcr approach was developed to detect dna sequences of 8 bacteria: chlamydia trachomatis, c. pneumoniae, yersinia enterocolitica, salmonella enteritidis, campylobacter jejuni, shigella flexneri, klebsiella pneumoniae, and borrelia burgdorferi. the detection limit was determined at 10 bacterial/sample. serology and lymphocyte proliferation assay were done in parallel in most patients. results: in 12 cases  bacterial dna of b. burgdorferi (n = 7), c. trachomatis (n = 2), c. jejuni (n = 2), and c. pneumoniae (n = 1) was detected in patients with uoligo (n = 9) and jca (n = 3), while no evidence of bacterial dna was found in patients with rea, uspa, and ra. shigella flexneri dna was detected in 4 cases, but the significance of this finding remains uncertain due to the high sequence homology of this species with escherichia coli. dna of y. enterocolitica, s. enteritidis, or k. pneumoniae was not found. a positive serologic response was found in 7/9 pcr positive patients. in 11/96 cases antibodies to 2 or more bacteria were found in  parallel (11.5%). antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation was observed in 5/9 pcr positive patients. conclusion: bacterial dna was detected in peripheral joint of patients with uoligo and jca, but not in rea, uspa, or ra in this study. the detection of bacterial dna in synovial material by pcr technology gives useful diagnostic information, especially when antibodies against several microbes are present or antibodies are not detectable. failure to detect bacterial dna in patients with rea and uspa with longstanding disease suggests that in later stages autoimmune mechanisms may operate.

TI  == do the binding properties of oligosaccharides in milk protect human infants from  gastrointestinal bacteria?
AB  == the oligosaccharide fraction of human milk, the third most abundant solid constituent, consists of hundreds of structures, many of them fucosylated. oligosaccharides may bear structural homology to cell surface glycoconjugates used as receptors by pathogens, thus protecting nursing infants. the ability of human milk to protect against heat-stable enterotoxin of escherichia coli in suckling mice has been attributed to neutral fucosylated oligosaccharides of milk. the same phenomenon has been found in human t84 cells, allowing the mechanism of inhibition by the oligosaccharide to be studied in vitro. the oligosaccharide binds to the extracellular domain of guanylyl cyclase, thereby inhibiting the binding of stable toxin. the protective oligosaccharide is a large structure present in too low a concentration to be routinely measured directly; however, its concentration in milk may be inferred by measuring smaller, more plentiful, structurally homologous oligosaccharides. the adhesion by invasive pathogenic strains of campylobacter to their enterocyte target is also inhibited  by human milk fucosyloligosaccharides. because campylobacter binds h-2 type oligosaccharide structures, the concentration of protective oligosaccharide may also be inferred from the total oligosaccharide profile. the relationship between oligosaccharide profile heterogeneity in human milk and the incidence of specific gastrointestinal bacterial disease in infants consuming these milks could indicate the significance of these oligosaccharides to infant health. the efficacy of synthetic analogs of active oligosaccharides will confirm their clinical relevance and define minimum structural features essential for activity.

TI  == molecular characterization of plda, the structural gene for a phospholipase a from campylobacter coli, and its contribution to cell-associated hemolysis.
AB  == a gene (plda) encoding a 35.0-kda protein with significant homology to the escherichia coli outer membrane phospholipase was identified upstream of an operon encoding an enterochelin transport system in campylobacter coli. the results of this study suggest that this gene encodes an outer membrane phospholipase a in c. coli. first, expression of the plda gene product in a plda-deficient mutant of e. coli led to the restoration of phospholipase a activity. the recombinant product also partitioned to the outer membrane, suggesting that it may be similarly located in c. coli. second, heterologous overexpression in e. coli, followed by in vitro folding and purification of c. coli plda, resulted in pure protein which displayed calcium-dependent lysophospholipase and phospholipase a activities in vitro. finally, mutants of c. coli in which the plda gene had been inactivated by allelic exchange were deficient in phospholipase a activity. phospholipases are associated with lysis of erythrocytes by a number of bacterial pathogens. the plda mutant was shown to  have a reduced hemolytic activity compared to the wild-type strain, suggesting a  role for the phospholipase a in the lysis of erythrocytes by c. coli. since hemolysins are intimately associated with the disease-causing potential of a number of bacterial pathogens, it is likely that the phospholipase a plays some role in campylobacter virulence.

AB  == background: escherichia coli o157:h7 is increasingly recognized as a cause of bacterial diarrhea in the united states, but the frequency of its isolation and the clinical and epidemiologic features of e. coli o157:h7 infection in a large,  geographically diverse population of patients have not been well described. objective: to determine the frequency of isolation of e. coli o157:h7 relative to that of other bacterial enteric pathogens in a nationwide sample of patients and  to identify the clinical and epidemiologic features of e. coli o157:h7 infection. design: population prevalence study from october 1990 to october 1992. setting: 10 u.s. hospitals. patients: both inpatients and outpatients who had stool samples submitted to 1 of 10 laboratories for routine pathogen identification. measurements: clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory information was collected for infected and uninfected patients. isolates of e. coli o157:h7 were tested for production of shiga toxin. patient charts were then reviewed. results: escherichia coli o157:h7 was isolated from 118 (0.39%) of the 30463 fecal specimens tested. the proportion of fecal specimens with isolates was higher at northern sites (0.57%) than at southern sites (0.13%) (p < 0.001). escherichia coli o157:h7 was more likely to be isolated from visibly bloody stool specimens than from specimens without visible blood (odds ratio [or], 59.2 [95% ci, 36.6 to 96.0) and was the pathogen most commonly isolated from visibly bloody stool specimens that yielded a bacterial enteric pathogen (39% of such specimens). the  highest age-specific isolation proportions from fecal specimens for e. coli o157:h7 were in patients 5 to 9 years of age (0.90%) and 50 to 59 years of age (0.89%). clinical features independently associated with e. coli o157:h7 infection compared with the other enteric pathogens included a history of bloody  diarrhea (or, 18.6 [ci, 7.4 to 48.6]), visibly bloody stool specimens (or, 8.1 [ci, 3.6 to 18.3]), no reported fever (or, 8.3 [ci, 1.6 to 50.0]), leukocyte count greater than 10 x 10(9)/l (or, 4.0 [ci, 1.7 to 9.5]), and abdominal tenderness on physical examination (or, 2.9 [ci, 1.2 to 7.2]). conclusions: in some geographic areas and some age groups, isolation proportions from fecal specimens for e. coli o157:h7 surpassed those of other common enteric pathogens.  one third of isolates of this organism came from nonbloody specimens. because person-to-person transmission of e. coli o157:h7 is not uncommon and infection with this organism may cause severe disease, stool specimens from all patients with a history of acute bloody diarrhea should be cultured for e. coli o157:h7.

TI  == foodborne diseases active surveillance network, 1996.
AB  == as an important strategy for addressing emerging infections in the united states, in 1994 cdc began implementing emerging infections programs (eips) in state health departments, in collaboration with local health departments, academic institutions, and organizations of health professionals. eips are sites that conduct special population-based surveillance projects, emphasize collaborative epidemiologic and laboratory projects, and pilot and evaluate prevention efforts. the primary foodborne diseases component of the eip is the foodborne diseases active surveillance network (foodnet)--a collaborative effort among cdc, the u.s. department of agriculture (usda), the food and drug administration, and the eip sites. the objectives of foodnet are to 1) determine more precisely the burden of foodborne diseases in the united states, 2) determine the proportion of specific  foodborne diseases associated with certain contaminated foods or with other exposures, and (3) provide the framework to respond rapidly and collaboratively to emerging foodborne diseases. this report summarizes preliminary results from foodnet for 1996, which document regional and seasonal differences in the incidences of certain bacterial foodborne diseases, and presents findings of the  1995 baseline survey of clinical laboratories, which suggests that, for some pathogens, factors other than differing laboratory practices accounted for regional variations in incidences.

TI  == general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with milk and dairy products in england and wales: 1992 to 1996.
AB  == twenty general outbreaks of food poisoning in england and wales associated with the consumption of milk and dairy products were reported to the phls communicable disease surveillance centre between 1992 and 1996. a total of 600 people were ill and at least 45 people were admitted to hospital but no deaths were reported. salmonella species were responsible for 11 outbreaks, campylobacter species for five, vero cytotoxin producing escherichia coli o157 (vtec) for three, and cryptosporidium parvum for one. outbreaks were associated with hotels (2 outbreaks), a psychogeriatric hospital, schools (3), a royal air force base, a farm visit, an outdoor festival (2), and community outbreaks associated with milk supplied direct from farms (8). milk was implicated in 16 outbreaks; 10 of which  were associated with unpasteurised milk. two outbreaks were associated with eating contaminated ice cream, and two with eating contaminated cheese. all these outbreaks could have been prevented by pasteurisation and simple hygienic measures.

TI  == the campylobacter jejuni porin trimers pack into different lattice types when reconstituted in the presence of lipid.
AB  == purified major outer membrane protein of campylobacter jejuni exhibited different classes of molecules by sds/page and immunoblotting. a high-molecular-mass product (120-140 kda) was observed under mild conditions of solubilization, a folded monomeric form of 35 kda was seen when treated at high sds concentrations  and finally, a single band around 45 kda occurred when the sample was heated to 96 degrees c [bolla, j. m., loret, e., zalewski. m. & pages, j. m. (1995) j. bacteriol. 177, 4266-4271]. the high-molecular-mass product was reconstituted into two-dimensional crystals in the presence of phospholipids and mg2+. the c. jejuni porin required different conditions for successful reconstitution into two-dimensional crystals than the escherichia coli porin ompf. electron microscopy and digital image processing of negatively stained specimens revealed  a rectangular lattice with a unit cells size of a = 8.9 nm, b = 14.9 nm, an oblique lattice with a = 8.9 nm, b = 30.1 nm, gamma = 98 degrees, and a trigonal  lattice with a = b = 9.6 nm. projection maps were calculated to a resolution of 2 nm, and exhibited a trimeric protein with three stain-filled indentations.

TI  == prevalence of bacterial enteropathogens in pet dogs in trinidad.
AB  == the rectal swabs of diarrhoeic and apparently healthy non-diarrhoeic dogs presented to a small animal clinic were cultured for escherichia coli, salmonella and campylobacter and the enteropathogens were characterized. overall, of 130 dogs divided equally into two groups consisting of 65 diarrhoeic and 65 non-diarrhoeic dogs, 99 (76.2%), 6 (4.6%) and 18 (13.8%) were positive for e. coli, salmonella and campylobacter, respectively. the differences were statistically significant (p < or = 0.05; chi 2). the prevalences of the enteropathogens in diarrhoeic and non-diarrhoeic dogs were not statistically significant (p > or = 0.05; chi 2). diarrhoea was significantly (p < or = 0.01; chi 2) more prevalent in dogs less than 6 months of age and 7 months to 1 year old than in dogs older than 1 year. the prevalences of salmonella, e. coli and enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) strains were not significantly (p > or = 0.05; chi 2) associated with age but the prevalence of campylobacter infection was significantly (p < or = 0.01; chi 2) higher in dogs less than 1 year old (25.0%)  than in older dogs (5.4%). of 99 e. coli strains tested, three (3.0%), four (4.0%), five (5.1%) and 20 (20.2%) were haemolytic, non-sorbitol fermenters, verocytotoxigenic (vt) and epec strains, respectively. resistance to tetracycline (59.6%) and ampicillin (50.5%) was most prevalent and significantly (p < or = 0.01; chi 2) higher than to six other antimicrobial agents.

AB  == oral delivery of vaccines results in these being taken up by specialised microfold epithelial cells covering peyer's patches of the gastrointestinal tract, therefore stimulating regulatory t cells and surface iga positive (siga+)  b cells. t helper cells can be divided into 2 subsets, type 1 (t(h)1) and type 2  (t(h)2), according to their function and the cytokines they secrete. t(h)1 cytokines such as interleukin (il)-2, interferon-gamma and tumour necrosis factor-beta (tnfbeta) elicit activation of t cells and macrophages, whereas t(h)2 cytokines such as il-4, il-5, il-6 and il-10 favour mucosal and parenteral b cell responses. therefore, t(h)2-type t cells are of particular interest for mucosal responses, since they help in the differentiation of siga+ b cells into iga-producing plasma cells. as a result, one can take advantage of the fact that  different forms of antigen delivery systems generally influence the outcome of an immune response, and use those that best induce mucosal responses. an example of  this would be orally administered live attenuated salmonella versus the oral administration of cholera toxin. the first induces a dominant t(h)1-type response, and the second a t(h)2-type response. thus these 2 delivery systems can be exploited in order to elicit the desired immune response depending on the protective response required. alternatively, encapsulating antigens into polyglycolide microspheres or liposomes, or incorporating them into immune-stimulating complexes, has facilitated the delivery of antigens which otherwise do not result in an immune response when given orally. much progress is being made in the construction of attenuated viral and bacterial vectors for the  delivery of antigen to mucosal sites. for example, poliovirus has been used as a  vector to deliver both rotavirus and hiv antigens. bacterial vectors and attenuated mutant bacteria for use in vaccines have also been extensively researched. examples of these include salmonella typhi mutants, vibrio cholerae,  shigella species, helicobacter pylori and campylobacter jejuni. in addition, new  approaches are being developed to induce responses at mucosal surfaces such as the gastrointestinal, respiratory and genitourinary tracts. these include the use of adjuvants that stimulate mucosal responses such as cholera toxin and escherichia coli heat labile toxin, as well as the coexpression of cytokine genes with antigenic proteins on live vectors to drive the immune response so that mucosal responses are favoured. furthermore, nucleic acid vaccines and the potential use of transgenic plants are new technologies that are contributing to  our ability to induce responses at mucosal surfaces.

TI  == dna fingerprinting of campylobacter fetus using cloned constructs of ribosomal rna and surface array protein genes.
AB  == dna fragments coding for the ribosomal rna and the surface array proteins of campylobacter fetus have been cloned from a genomic library constructed in escherichia coli. they were used in the molecular characterization of c. fetus (subsp. fetus; subsp. venerealis) strains by restriction fragment length polymorphism (rflp) method. ribotyping results showed that all strains of the two subspecies can be classified under one ribogroup implying very close relatedness. the sapa gene dna marker, however, discriminated all the strains regardless of the subspecies when chromosomal dna was restricted with hindiii, haeiii, xbai or  ecorv. these results illustrate that the sapa probe is potentially useful in fingerprinting c. fetus strains and in determining the relationships of strains for epidemiological purposes.

TI  == examination of diarrheagenicity of cytolethal distending toxin: suckling mouse response to the products of the cdtabc genes of shigella dysenteriae.
AB  == some strains of escherichia coli, shigella spp., and campylobacter spp. that have been implicated in diarrheal disease produce cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). cdt induces unique morphological changes in chinese hamster ovary cells, but its  association with diarrheal disease is unclear. we studied the diarrheagenicity of cdt using the cdt genes that we originally cloned from shigella dysenteriae. the  cdt genes were subcloned into a high-copy-number plasmid in e. coli jm109 to achieve high-level cdt production into the culture supernatant. an isogenic cdt-  derivative was constructed by deletion of the 0.9-kb sequence internal to the cdt genes. a suckling mouse model was established, in which the intragastrically administered culture supernatant of the cdt+ e. coli strain induced excretion of  loose and/or watery feces more often than did that of the cdt- strain in 24 h. the partially purified cdt preparation induced profuse watery diarrhea by 12 h in this model. high-level intestinal fluid accumulation in 4 h appeared to be related to the watery diarrhea. the results indicate that cdt is diarrheagenic to suckling mice and suggest that diarrheagenicity is dependent on cdt level. the preparations containing wild-type cdt induced tissue damage (necrosis and reparative hyperplasia) in the descending colon, whereas the tissues of the small intestines remained apparently intact. association between the colonic damage and diarrhea is unclear and needs further investigation.

TI  == identification of serpulina species associated with porcine colitis by biochemical analysis and pcr.
AB  == a pcr system for the detection and identification of group iv spirochetes (serpulina pilosicoli) was designed to complement biochemical tests, e.g., the hippurate hydrolysis and beta-glucosidase tests, and to verify the accuracy of a  previously proposed biochemical classification system. the pcr assay was based on amplification of a segment of the 16s rrna gene. both primers were constructed to selectively amplify the 16s rrna gene of serpulina pilosicoli. all analyzed serpulina strains exhibiting the capacity to hydrolyze hippurate and lacking beta-glucosidase activity, including the type strain for spirochetal diarrhea, p43, were amplified with the pcr system. all other tested strains, including type and field strains of different phenotypes of serpulina species, as well as salmonella species, campylobacter species, and escherichia coli strains, were negative in the assay. among the tested strains were 18 scottish field isolates originating from the mucosae of pigs with colitis. a simple classification scheme, suitable for routine classification of porcine intestinal spirochetes, is also presented. the scheme is based on hemolysis, indole production, and the hippurate hydrolysis test.

TI  == identification of a functional homolog of the escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium cysm gene encoding o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase b in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the final step of l-cysteine biosynthesis in escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium consists of the formation of l-cysteine from o-acetylserine and sulfide. this reaction can be catalyzed by two enzymes, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase a and o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase b, the former of which has been  more rigorously characterized. in contrast to o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase a, o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase b is preferentially used for cysteine biosynthesis during anaerobic growth and is able to utilize thiosulfate as a substrate. campylobacter jejuni is a micro-aerophilic, gram-negative bacterium, and a member of the epsilon subdivision of eubacteria. we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed a gene from c. jejuni that encodes a protein of 299 aa with a calculated molecular mass of 32,367 da. complementation analysis of an e. coli cysteine auxotroph with the pmek34-14 recombinant plasmid containing a 1.2-kb insert of chromosomal dna from c. jejuni revealed that transformants were capable of growth in medium containing either sulfide or thiosulfate as sole sulfur sources. these data indicate that the cloned c. jejuni gene is a functional homolog of the cysm gene that codes for o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase b in e. coli and s. typhimurium.

TI  == isolation and virulence factors of verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli in human stool samples.
AB  == objective: to evaluate the isolation rate of o157 and non-o157 verocytotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) strains, to study the occurrence  of additional virulence factors and to correlate these with clinical symptoms. methods: over more than 5 years, 17 296 unduplicated fecal samples submitted for  routine culture were screened for vtec by a single pcr detecting vt1, vt2 and its variants. verocytotoxin b subunit genotypes of the isolates obtained by testing individual colonies in positive samples were determined by a polymerase chain reaction---restriction fragment length polymorphism (pcr---rflp) technique, the eaea gene and the 60-mda virulence plasmid by pcr, and the hemolytic phenotype by using cacl2-washed blood agar. results: verocytotoxin genes were found in 1.02% of the samples. non-o157 vtec strains were isolated in 0.66% and o157 in 0.17%. overall, vtec was less frequently isolated than campylobacter and salmonella but  more frequently than yersinia and shigella. all cases except two siblings were epidemiologically unrelated. cases of hemolytic uremic syndrome (hus) were only observed in association with serogroup o157, which seems to be more pathogenic than the non-o157 strains. among non-o157 vtec strains, eaea-positive strains are more frequently associated with clinical symptoms than are eaea-negative strains. other virulence factors correlate less closely with the presence of symptoms. conclusions: vtec is the third bacterial intestinal pathogen in our study population. all stool samples from patients with diarrhea should be screened for  the most frequent serogroup, o157, or, if this is not possible, at least those from patients with bloody diarrhea. non-o157 vtec strains, especially if they are eaea positive, are also associated with diarrhea, more often non-bloody. pcr or the new commercially available immunoassays could be used in selected cases, e.g. in patients suffering from hus and in cases of outbreaks.

TI  == zoonoses in the meat industry: a review.
AB  == zoonoses are diseases, the infections of which can be transmitted between man and animals. only a few are of importance with respect to poultry meat and meat from  cattle, sheep, horses and goats. advances in the control of diseases such as tuberculosis, brucellosis and trichinosis in animals have reduced the hazards posed to workers in the meat industry and to consumers of meat. however, inspection of animals ante- and post-mortem cannot detect all infectious agents present. this applies particularly to bacteria such as campylobacter, salmonella, verotoxigenic and other pathogenic escherichia coli and yersinia. protection of meat workers from infection depends upon taking normal hygienic precautions, which also protect the meat from contamination from the workers. consumers are exposed to a smaller range of zoonoses than meat workers because they encounter only meat that has passed inspection. in addition, heavily contaminated parts of  the animal, such as the hide, feathers and viscera have been removed. further advances in making meat safer are likely to result from the introduction of integrated quality assurance systems. these involve identifying, monitoring and keeping records of the disease status and treatment of each animal (or poultry flock) so that its history is known when it reaches the abattoir. they should also include programmes aimed at minimising colonisation by zoonotic bacteria such as camplyobacters, salmonellas and verotoxigenic escherichia coli.

TI  == epidemiological study on infectious diarrheal diseases in children in a coastal rural area of kenya.
AB  == diarrheal diseases are major causes of morbidity and mortality among children in  developing countries. we have analyzed the causative agents of diarrhea in children under five years of age who resided in rural environments but attended a hospital in malindi, a coastal town in kenya. bacterial diarrhea was found in 239 (27.7%) of 862 patients with diarrhea. diarrheagenic escherichia coli, including  enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, and enterohaemorrhagic strains, was isolated from 119 (13.8%) patients, followed by salmonella spp. (63 cases, 7.3%) and shigella spp. (56 cases, 6.5%). intestinal parasites were found in 109 (12.6%) of the patients. entamoeba histolytica and giardia lamblia were found in 67 (7.8%) and 42 (4.9%) of the cases, respectively. rotavirus was found in 69 (16.1%) of 428 cases, a part of the 862 cases. significant differences in age distribution were seen in diarrheal cases due to campylobacter spp., g. lamblia, and rotavirus. no significant seasonal incidence of specific pathogens was found, but the number of diarrheal patients was significantly correlated to rainfall. drinking water was contaminated with bacteria at concentrations ranging from 10(3) to 10(6) cfu/ml in 98% of the households and by coliform bacteria at concentrations of 10(2) to 10(5) cfu/ml in 72% of the households. these results suggest that the main routes of infection may be contaminated drinking water and  fecal-oral transmission of enteric pathogens. consequently, we propose that the enhancement of hygienic practice through health education is a feasible control measure of diarrhea in the study area.

TI  == economic costs and trade impacts of microbial foodborne illness.
AB  == this article presents the economic costs of foodborne diseases for selected countries, the approaches used to calculate these costs, and a discussion on the  interaction between microbial food safety issues and international trade in food. the human illness costs due to foodborne pathogens are estimated most completely  in the united states of america, where, each year, 7 foodborne pathogens (campylobacter jejuni, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli o157:h7. listeria monocytogenes, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and toxoplasma gondii) cause an estimated 3.3-12.3 million cases of foodborne illness and up to 3900 deaths. these 7 pathogens are found in animal products and cost the united states an estimated $6.5-$34.9 billion (1995 us$) annually. the presence of foodborne pathogens in a country's food supply not only affects the health of the local population, but also represents a potential for spread to pathogens to visitors to the country and to consumers in countries which import food products. with more complete data on foodborne illnesses, deaths, costs and international trade  rejections in each country, indicators could be developed by which changes in food safety can be monitored.

TI  == novel approaches to control of bacterial infections in animals.
AB  == bacterial infections of poultry remain of great importance world-wide in terms of economic effects and public health. they include infections caused by salmonella, escherichia coli, campylobacter and pasteurella. through the introduction of rigid hygienic measures it is possible to breed and rear poultry free of these pathogens. however, the cost to the industry would be prohibitive and economically disastrous. biological measures have been introduced albeit in a relatively empirical way. antibiotic therapy and prophylaxis is used extensively  with the associated problems of development of resistance. killed vaccines are used but are not usually very effective. live vaccines are increasingly becoming  acceptable and studies are under way to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of these infections so that vaccine development may become less empirical. work with live vaccines to be used against salmonella has shown that they may be administered orally to newly-hatched chicks. the vaccine strain colonises the gut extensively and prevents re-infection by other salmonella strains by a genus-specific mechanism which is similar to that which occurs during down-regulation of bacterial growth in stationary-phase nutrient broth cultures. the mechanism of this phenomenon is currently being studied. this approach may also be applied to control campylobacter infections. bacteria of the pasteurella group and e. coli may produce septicaemic infections in poultry. recent work with k1+ e. coli infections in mice has shown that virulent bacteriophages may be used to treat or prevent septicaemias and meningitides. this work has been extrapolated to chickens with a similar degree of success and  it suggests that some infections of this sort in animals and man may be amenable  to this approach. in-bred lines of chickens have been found to vary greatly in their susceptibility to systemic salmonella infections. this is probably mediated by one gene and the effect is dominant and not linked to sex or mhc. the mouse natural resistance gene (nrampi) does not appear to contribute greatly to this effect. differences in the extent of gut colonisation by salmonella in in-bred and out-bred lines can also be detected. these results are very exciting and open up opportunities for disease control for the future.

TI  == safe poultry meat production in the next century.
AB  == the revolutionary industrialisation of the poultry industry in the last 30 years  has made the food poultry meat available for large groups of consumers. due to its nutritional, sensory and economical characteristics, poultry meat is by far the most popular animal food product world-wide. epidemiological reports, however, incriminate poultry meat as a source for outbreaks of human food poisoning. the organisms involved are salmonella spp., campylobacter spp. and, to a lesser extent, listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, yersinia enterocolitica, clostridium perfringens and aeromonas spp. contamination of the end-product with pathogenic microorganisms is a reflection of the contamination of the live birds and, therefore, measures to be taken by industry  to avoid contamination of the consumer-ready product should start at that level.  in terms of the critical control point approach of the haccp concept, the quantitative contribution of critical phases in the production chain towards end-product contamination should be estimated in order to take the necessary intervention or corrective steps. to guarantee the production of safe poultry meat, knowledge of the capability of microorganisms to colonise the gastrointestinal tract is needed and the use of vaccines, antimicrobials and competitive exclusion microfloras as well as the implementation of new processing technology should be encouraged.

AB  == the ferritin gene (cft) of campylobacter jejuni was overexpressed in cells of escherichia coli using a t7 rna polymerase expression system. many round particles which were the same size as the ferritin particles purified from c. jejuni were observed in the lysate of the cft-overexpressed e. coli cells. since  most of them were devoid of a central electron dense core consisting of ferric irons, the campylobacter ferritins over-produced in e. coli seemed to be apoferritin. when large amounts of ferrous iron (supplied as feso4) were added to culture medium, the cft-overexpressed cells formed large inclusion bodies of paracrystalline arrays comprised of ferritin particles with central electron dense cores. the addition of ferric irons did not produce paracrystalline inclusion.

AB  == many microorganisms previously unrecognized as food-borne or harmful are emerging as human pathogens transmitted by food. this is a result of recent acquisition of key virulence factors, detection by newly developed isolation procedures, or astute detective-like laboratory skills of microbiologists. six microbial pathogens, including shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, listeria monocytogenes, arcobacter butzleri, helicobacter pylori, cryptosporidium parvum,  and cyclospora, have become recognized as significant causes of human illness. although the ecology and epidemiology of illness caused by some of these pathogens have not been fully elucidated, food has the potential of being an important vehicle in their dissemination. existing technologies and new approaches such as irradiation and hazard analysis critical control point (haccp) programs are useful tools in the control of food-borne hazards. however, because  of ever-changing products, processes, food-handling practices, societal habits, and pathogens, emerging food-borne diseases will continue to be an important public health concern.

TI  == comparative histopathology of intestinal infections.
AB  == intestinal infections are characterized by a range of histologic changes. some examples (moving progressively deeper into the tissue from the intestinal lumen)  are: 1) enterotoxigenic e. coli infections are characterized by layers of e. coli adherent to villous epithelium, usually with little or no apparent structural damage to the mucosa. 2) the term enteropathogenic e. coli infection designates a disease characterized by e. coli attached intimately to the epithelial cell surface membrane with effacement of brush border microvilli. 3) rotavirus infections are characterized by destruction of villous epithelial cells. parvovirus infections are characterized by destruction of crypt epithelial cells. 4) some intracellular infections with campylobacter-like organisms are characterized by epithelial cell hyperplasia. 5) hemorrhagic colitis in humans, caused by enterohemorrhagic e. coli strains, is characterized by mucosal hemorrhage and edema indicative of vascular necrosis. 6) most of these lesions are accompanied by some degree of inflammation. neurophils and lymphocytes mediate some of the structural and functional changes characteristic of these infections. some changes are mediated directly by microbial products. additional  examples of the complexity of these diseases are: 1) edema disease of swine is characterized both by adherent e. coli and vascular necrosis (each process mediated by a different bacterial virulence attribute). 2) rotavirus infections are characterized both by destruction of villous epithelial cells and compensatory hyperplasia of crypt epithelial cells. 3) there is suggestive evidence that enterohemorrhagic e. coli infections may involve: a) destruction of epithelial brush border by attaching-effacing e. coli, b) neutrophil mediated epithelial cell destruction, c) shiga-like toxin mediated epithelial cell destruction and d) shiga-like toxin mediated vascular necrosis which in turn causes ischemic damage to epithelium.

AB  == a prospective epidemiological and clinical study of acute diarrhea in children under 5 years old was done at king mongkut prachomklao hospital in order to provide baseline data for health officers to make a strategic plan to reduce the  diarrheal mortality and morbidity, which is one of the mid-decade goals for children. there were 105 cases of acute diarrhea patients admitted to the pediatric ward between may 1995 and april 1996. seventy-six per cent of them were in the younger age group (> 1 month-2 years old) while 23.8 per cent were in the  older age group (2-5 years old). causative pathogens were identified in 64 patients (61%). younger patients had a higher percentage of identifiable pathogens (66.7%) than older patients (44.4%). rotavirus was the most common pathogen isolated (17.2%). the other common pathogens identified were eschericia  coli (14.1%), campylobacter jejuni (14.1%), shigella (12.5%), entamoeba histolytica (7.8%) and salmonella (3.1%). mixed infections were reported in 31.3  per cent of these patients. clinical presentations and stool characteristics were difficult to distinguish from most of the pathogens. however, rotavirus was highly suspected if a younger child presented with fever, watery to loose stool with the predominant symptom of vomiting. mucous, mucous-bloody stool gave a clue to the diagnosis of shigella and entamoeba histolytica. most cases had at least mild to moderate dehydration, so oral rehydration solution (ors) was successfully given in only 31.4 per cent of patients. antibiotics were prescribed to 51.4 per  cent of patients in this study. healthcare personnel should emphasize to parents  and caretakers about good hygienic behavior to reduce the episodes of diarrhea and the use of ors every time when their children have diarrheal episodes to reduce the disease severity.

AB  == a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) technique was developed for specific identification of c. jejuni. a primer pair of a conserved region of flagellin a (fla a) gene identified all 15 strains of c. jejuni isolated from human faeces. none of the control strains like helicobacter pylori, vibrio cholerae escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium except c. coli exhibited any amplified product by pcr. a predicted 450 bp could also be amplified from 4 chicken caecal contents positive for c. jejuni-c coli by culture. the caecal contents remained positive for c. jejuni-c. coli by pcr after preservation at 4 degrees c for one week when  no viable organism could be detected. restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis (rflp) of fla a amplified product by using bgl ii enzyme classified 15 strains into 5 types. three c. jejuni strains isolated from the same patient over a period of 3 wk showed the same rflp pattern. the present study indicates that pcr is specific for c. jejuni-c. coli and it has the potential for rapid diagnosis of infection. rflp can be a good epidemiological marker for c. jejuni infection.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance in organisms causing diarrheal disease.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is becoming increasingly important in the treatment of enteric infections, particularly those due to shigella, vibrio cholerae, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (associated with traveler's diarrhea), and salmonella typhi. the rate of antimicrobial resistance is highest in the developing world, where the use of antimicrobial drugs is relatively unrestricted. of greatest immediate concern is the need for an effective, inexpensive antimicrobial that can be used safely as treatment for small children with dysentery due to shigella, primarily shigella dysenteriae type 1.

TI  == trends in bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones.
AB  == the emergence of resistance to fluoroquinolones in virtually all species of bacteria was recognized soon after the introduction of these compounds for clinical use more than 10 years ago. various resistance mechanisms, often interdependent, may explain different levels of resistance. epidemiological factors, local antibiotic policies, patients' characteristics, origin of the strains, and geographic location are among the factors contributing to highly variable resistance rates. during the last several years, resistance to fluoroquinolones has remained very high among methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus strains and in intensive care unit patients, and it has increased among nosocomial isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. more worrisome are recent reports of an overall increase in resistance to fluoroquinolones among bacteria responsible for community-acquired infections, such as escherichia coli, salmonella species, campylobacter species and neisseria gonorrhoeae.

TI  == the genetic and bacteriological aspects of peyronie's disease.
AB  == purpose: peyronie's disease has been associated with hla tissue types, including  hla-a1, dr3, dqw2 and hla-b7 cross-reactive group antigens which include hla-b27. this association was tested as was the process of molecular mimicry where the host hla surface antigen cross-reacts with a microorganism. materials and methods: hla tissue typing was performed on 51 white patients with peyronie's disease, of whom 15 also had dupuytren's contracture of the hand. fecal, urine and urethral samples were taken from patients with peyronie's disease who had proved penile inflammation on biopsy. the samples were cultured for species of campylobacter, shigella, salmonella, yersinia, chlamydia and gonococcus, all known to cross-react with the hla-b27 surface antigen. antibodies to klebsiella species, proteus species and escherichia coli were also assessed in the sera of 65 patients with peyronie's disease. results: a significant association between peyronie's disease and hla-b27 was found (p = 0.02). the remaining antigens of the hla-b7 group were not significantly associated with the disease individually  (hla-b7 p > 0.2, hla-b22 p > 0.6, hla-b40 p > 0.7) or as a group (p = 0.69). the  previously found associations did not reach significance in this study (hla-a1 p  > 0.5, hla-b8 p > 0.2, hla-cw7 p = 0.1, hla-dr3 p > 0.4, hla-dq2 p > 0.4). cultures for all enteric and urethral organisms were negative, and patients with  peyronie's disease did not have elevated serum titers of anti klebsiella, anti proteus or anti e. coli antibodies. conclusions: although there is an association between peyronie's disease and hla-b27, molecular mimicry does not occur with the organisms tested, and an infectious agent has not been found in this study.

TI  == risk factors for outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease linked to domestic catering.
AB  == the epidemiology of general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering for large numbers is described and compared with foodborne outbreaks in other settings. from 1 january 1992 to 31 december 1994, the phls communicable disease surveillance centre identified 101 foodborne general outbreaks of infectious intestinal disease associated with domestic catering in england and wales (16% of all foodborne outbreaks). salmonella species were associated with 77 of the 101 outbreaks and s. enteriditis phage type 4 accounted for 57. small round structured viruses were implicated in five outbreaks, clostridium perfringens in four, bacillus cereus in two, and campylobacter sp and escherichia coli in one each. no pathogen was identified in 11 outbreaks. outbreaks occurred most commonly in summer. the commonest vehicles implicated were poultry/eggs in 44 outbreaks, desserts in 13, and meat/meat products in nine. salad/vegetables, sauces, and fish/shellfish were each implicated in eight  outbreaks. raw shell eggs were implicated in a fifth of outbreaks. inappropriate  storage was the commonest fault, reported in association with 50 outbreaks (ambient temperature for long periods before serving in 29), inadequate heat treatment was reported in 35, cross contamination in 28, an infected food handler in 11, and other faults in 14. outbreaks associated with catering on domestic premises were independently more likely than outbreaks in other settings to be associated with salmonellas, inappropriate storage of food, and consumption of poultry, eggs, or sauces. public health services need to direct messages about the use, preparation, and storage of food to those who cater on domestic premises.

TI  == incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  more than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic  rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for c. difficile enterotoxin. however, 27 cefmetazole-induced  diarrheic cases were not associated with c. difficile. other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as campylobacter spp., bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens and clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. however, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. this was ascribed to the overgrowth of clostridium innocuum and clostridium sporogenes. there were no remarkable differences in changes in other  bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.

AB  == the role of lipopolysaccharide (lps) in the serotyping of campylobacter jejuni based on heat-stable antigens was examined using sds-page and a silver stain for  carbohydrate. none of the 32 type strains of camp. jejuni expressed long-chain lps. rabbit antibodies, prepared to 10 selected strains of camp. jejuni, reacted  with surface-exposed carbohydrate antigens, which were not lps. this study suggests that the heat-stable antigens of camp. jejuni, which form the basis for  the established penner serotyping scheme, are probably capsular and not lps.

TI  == differentiation of bacterial 16s rrna genes and intergenic regions and mycobacterium tuberculosis katg genes by structure-specific endonuclease cleavage.
AB  == we describe here a new approach for analyzing nucleic acid sequences using a structure-specific endonuclease, cleavase i. we have applied this technique to the detection and localization of mutations associated with isoniazid resistance  in mycobacterium tuberculosis and for differentiating bacterial genera, species and strains. the technique described here is based on the observation that single strands of dnas can assume defined conformations, which can be detected and cleaved by structure-specific endonucleases such as cleavase i. the patterns of fragments produced are characteristic of the sequences responsible for the structure, so that each dna has its own structural fingerprint. amplicons, containing either a single 5'-fluorescein or 5'-tetramethyl rhodamine label were  generated from a 620-bp segment of the katg gene of isoniazid-resistant and -sensitive m. tuberculosis, the 5' 350 bp of the 16s rrna genes of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella arizonae, shigella sonnei, shigella dysenteriae, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus, hominis, staphylococcus warneri, and staphylococcus aureus and an approximately 550-bp dna segment comprising the intergenic region between the 16s and 23s rrna genes of salmonella typhimurium, salmonella enteritidis, salmonella  arizonae, shigella sonnei, and shigella dysenteriae serotypes 1, 2, and 8. changes in the structural fingerprints of dna fragments derived from the katg genes of isoniazid-resistant m. tuberculosis isolates were clearly identified and could be mapped to the site of the actual mutation relative to the labeled end. bland patterns which clearly differentiated bacteria to the level of genus and, in some cases, species were generated from the 16s genes. cleavase i analysis of  the intergenic regions of salmonella and shigella species differentiated genus, species, and serotypes. structural fingerprinting by digestion with cleavase i is a rapid, simple, and sensitive method for analyzing nucleic acid sequences and may find wide utility in microbial analysis.

TI  == attempted definition by immunoblotting of the causes of reactivity in suspected false-positive sera in the brucella ovis complement fixation test.
AB  == seventy-nine suspected false-positive sera, obtained over 1 year from routine submissions for brucella ovis serological testing, were used in this study. these sera, which exhibited titres in the complement fixation test, but which because of their epidemiological history and their reactions in the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and gel diffusion test were suspected to be false positives,  were further analysed by immunoblotting. in blots, using b. ovis antigens, rough  lipopolysaccharide was identified as the major, immuno-reactive bacterial component. antibodies against this macromolecule were present in 46.8% of the suspected false-positive sera. in order to find out if rough lipopolysaccharides  from other bacterial species could be the possible cause for the suspected false  positivity, 23 sera with highest complement fixation titres were reacted in blots with cell extracts from escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, yersinia pseudotuberculosis, bortedella bronchiseptica, actinobacillus seminis, campylobacter fetus fetus, campylobacter jejuni, mycobacterium paratuberculosis,  mycobacterium phlei, corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis and pure lipopolysaccharides from escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium. despite high frequencies of antibody reaction with proteins in most of these bacterial cell extracts, which reflect the presence of infections with these bacteria, immuno-staining in the rough lipopolysaccharide region was not observed.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with childhood diarrhea in italy. the italian study group on gastrointestinal infections.
AB  == background: infectious diarrheal diseases remain an important cause of childhood  morbidity in industrialized countries. the knowledge of the etiology and epidemiology of childhood diarrhea in a given area is needed to plan any measure  designed to prevent or ameliorate diarrheal illness and to develop practice guidelines for the most appropriate stool examination procedures. methods: we evaluated 618 children with diarrhea and 135 controls prospectively for viral, bacterial and parasitic enteric pathogens. diarrheagenic escherichia coli was identified by gene probes specific to different virulence factors. stool filtrates were examined for the presence of free bacterial toxins by a cell culture cytotoxicity assay. clinical and epidemiologic data were recorded and analyzed in relation to microbiologic findings. results: enteropathogens were identified in 59% of children with diarrhea and in 10.4% of asymptomatic controls. the agents mainly associated with disease were rotavirus (23.6%), salmonella (19.2%) and campylobacter (7.9%). rotavirus was significantly more frequent among children observed as inpatients whereas campylobacter was significantly more common in outpatients. infections with diarrheagenic e. coli,  shigella flexneri, yersinia enterocolitica, cryptosporidium and giardia were observed in a limited number of patients. the clinical presentation of children was not sufficiently characteristic to permit presumptive diagnosis of a specific pathogen. conversely the presence of blood and/or leukocytes in stools had a high positive predictive value for salmonella or campylobacter infection. conclusion:  the results of this study will be useful for planning strategies to prevent and control diarrheal diseases in our country.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni, a gram-negative, microaerophilic, spiral bacterium, is a common cause of human gastrointestinal disease. although investigators commonly use c. jejuni glycine-hydrochloride extracts in assays to determine the products  that promote the binding of the organism to eukaryotic cells, the proteins contained within these extracts remain ill defined. characterization of these proteins will provide a better understanding of c. jejuni gene regulation and organization. an antiserum was raised against a c. jejuni 29-kda gel-purified protein detected in glycine-hydrochloride extracts. this antiserum was used to screen an expression library of c. jejuni. a reactive clone that contained an open reading frame of 256 amino acids was identified. the cloned gene was transcribed and translated, and the product was exported to the periplasmic space in escherichia coli xl1-blue. the translated c. jejuni product, designated p29, exhibited significant similarity to the histidine and lysine-arginine-ornithine periplasmic binding proteins (hisj and lao, respectively) of salmonella typhimurium. the c. jejuni gene encoding the p29 protein complemented an s. typhimurium hisj mutant but not a lao mutant when provided in trans. these data suggest that the c. jejuni gene encoding the p29 protein is a homolog of the s. typhimurium hisj gene.

TI  == prevalence and clinical manifestations of shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli  infections in austrian children.

TI  == mechanism of action of cholera toxin & other toxins.
AB  == vibrio cholerae produce a variety of extracellular products that have deleterious effects on eukaryotic cells. the massive diarrhoea produced by v. cholerae is caused by cholera toxin (ct). ct is composed of 1a and 5b units. ct causes a significant amount of fluid secretion and haemorrhage in the ligated rabbit ileal loops. its action involves the role of various biochemical pathways. ct acts by activation of adenylate cyclase-camp system located at the basolateral membrane of intestinal epithelial cells. the increase in cyclic amp levels is mainly responsible for the altered transport of na+ and cl-. besides activating camp, ct is also known to act through release of prostaglandins and involvement of intramural nerves. besides ct, other bacterial toxins like escherichia coli lt, salmonella toxin, shigella toxin and campylobacter toxin also possess a-b structure. the structure and function of e. coli lt resembles closely that of ct. most of the bacterial toxins exert their effect through involvement of adp-ribosylating proteins whereas other toxins involve guanylate cyclase system,  calcium and protein kinases for their ultimate action.

TI  == prevalence of cytolethal distending toxin production in campylobacter jejuni and  relatedness of campylobacter sp. cdtb gene.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni produces a toxin called cytolethal distending toxin (cdt). the genes encoding this toxin in c. jejuni 81-176 were cloned and sequenced. the  nucleotide sequence of the genes revealed that there are three genes, cdta, cdtb, and cdtc, encoding proteins with predicted sizes of 30,11-6, 28,989, and 21,157 da, respectively. all three proteins were found to be related to the escherichia  coli cdt proteins, yet the amino acid sequences have diverged significantly. all  three genes were required for toxic activity in a hela cell assay. hela cell assays of a variety of c. jejuni and c. coli strains suggested that most c. jejuni strains produce significantly higher cdt titers than do c. coli strains. southern hybridization experiments demonstrated that the cdtb gene is present on  a 6.0-kb clai fragment in all but one of the c. jejuni strains tested; the cdtb gene was on a 6.9-kb clai fragment in one strain. the c. jejuni 81-176 cdtb probe hybridized weakly to dnas from c. coli strains. the c. jejuni 81-176 cdtb probe did not hybridize to dnas from representative c. fetus, c. lari, c.

TI  == evaluation of routine enteric pathogens in hospitalized patients: a canadian perspective.
AB  == diarrhea is a frequently encountered problem in hospitalized patients. since nosocomial spread of routine enteric pathogens such as salmonella species, shigella species, campylobacter species and escherichia coli o:157 h:7 seldom occurs, testing for these organisms in patients hospitalized for longer than three days has been questioned. the goal of this study was to determine the length of hospitalization preceding detection of routine enteric pathogens and clostridium difficile cytotoxin, and to develop guidelines for enteric cultures from hospitalized patients. the enteric pathogens detected in 1991 were c difficile toxin b(+), 77%; campylobacter species, 10%; salmonella species, 9%; e  coli o:157 h:7, 3%; and shigella species, 1%. for 1992, these numbers were 86%, 9%, 3%, 2% and 0%, respectively. none of the routine enteric pathogens isolated in 1991 or 1992 was detected in patients after their second day of hospitalization. routine cultures for enteric pathogens on hospitalized patients  were eliminated in february 1993, and physician ordering practices were monitored. with the exception of one campylobacter isolate per year, all routine  enteric pathogens isolated in 1993 and 1994 were detected by the second day of hospitalization. compliance with the changed protocol was 76% measured over a four-month period in 1993 and 74% over the year 1994. savings of $3,648.10 were associated with rejecting 191 'inappropriate' specimens in 1994. it was concluded that routine enteric cultures are unnecessary for patients hospitalized more than two days, and that appreciable financial savings can be achieved if revised protocols for processing stool cultures are instituted. however, when enteric protocol changes are in place compliance must be evaluated to ensure appropriate  utilization.

TI  == an environmentally regulated pilus-like appendage involved in campylobacter pathogenesis.
AB  == examination of strains of campylobacter jejuni, campylobacter coli, and campylobacter fetus by electron microscopy revealed that they produced peritrichous pilus-like appendages when the bacteria were grown in the presence of bile salts. various bile-salt supplements were used and it was found that deoxycholate and chenodeoxycholic acid caused a significant enhancement of pilus  production and resulted in a highly aggregative phenotype. morphologically, the pili were between 4 and 7 nm in width and were greater than 1 micron in length. a gene, termed pspa, which encodes a predicted protein resembling protease iv of escherichia coli, was identified in c. jejuni strain 81-176. a site-specific insertional mutation within this gene resulted in the loss of pilus synthesis as  determined by electron microscopy. insertions upstream and downstream of the gene had no effect on pilus production. the non-piliated mutant of strain 81-176 showed no reduction in adherence to or invasion of int 407 cells in vitro. however, this mutant, while still possessing the ability to colonize ferrets, caused significantly reduced disease symptoms in this animal model.

TI  == surveillance for waterborne-disease outbreaks--united states, 1993-1994.
AB  == problem/condition: since 1971, cdc and the u.s. environmental protection agency have maintained a collaborative surveillance system for collecting and periodically reporting data that relate to occurrences and causes of waterborne-disease outbreaks (wbdos). reporting period covered: this summary includes data for january 1993 through december 1994 and for previously unreported outbreaks in 1992. description of the system: the surveillance system  includes data about outbreaks associated with water intended for drinking (i.e.,  drinking water) and those associated with recreational water. state, territorial, and local public health departments are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating wbdos and voluntarily reporting them to cdc on a standard form. results: for the 2-year period 1993-1994, 17 states and one territory reported a  total of 30 outbreaks associated with drinking water. these outbreaks caused an estimated 405,366 persons to become ill, including 403,000 from an outbreak of cryptosporidiosis in milwaukee, the largest wbdo ever documented in the united states, and 2,366 from the other 29 outbreaks. no etiologic agent was identified  for five (16.7%) of the 30 outbreaks. the protozoan parasites giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium parvum caused 10 (40.0%) of the 25 outbreaks for which the etiologic agent was identified. two outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis occurred in large metropolitan areas (i.e., milwaukee and las vegas/clark county) and were associated with deaths among immunocompromised persons. the waterborne nature of  these two outbreaks was not recognized until at least 2 weeks after the onset of  the milwaukee outbreak and until after the end of the las vegas outbreak. campylobacter jejuni was implicated for three outbreaks and the following pathogens for one outbreak each: shigella sonnei, shigella flexneri, non-o1 vibrio cholerae (in a u.s. territory; the vehicle was commercially bottled water), and salmonella serotype typhimurium (the outbreak was associated with seven deaths). eight outbreaks of chemical poisoning were reported: three were caused by lead (one case each), two by fluoride, two by nitrate and one by copper. twenty (66.7%) of the 30 outbreaks were associated with a well-water source. fourteen states reported a total of 26 outbreaks associated with recreational water, in which an estimated 1,714 persons became ill. fourteen (53.8%) of these 26 were outbreaks of gastroenteritis. the etiologic agent in each of these 14 outbreaks was identified; 10 (71.4%) were caused by g. lamblia or c. parvum. six of these 10 were associated with chlorinated, filtered pool water, and three with lake water. one of the latter was the first reported outbreak of cryptosporidiosis associated with the recreational use of lake water. four outbreaks of lake water-associated bacterial gastroenteritis were reported,  two caused by s. sonnei, one by s. flexneri, and one by escherichia coli o157:h7. nine outbreaks of hot tub- whirlpool-, or swimming pool-associated pseudomonas dermatitis were reported. two outbreaks of swimming pool-associated dermatitis had a suspected chemical etiology. the child who had the one reported case of primary amebic meningoencephalitis, caused by infection with naegleria fowleri, died. interpretation: the number of wbdos reported annually has been similar for  each year during 1987-1994, except for an increase in 1992. protozoan parasites,  especially c. parvum and g. lamblia, remain important etiologic agents of wbdos.  the outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis in milwaukee and las vegas demonstrate that wbdos can occur in large metropolitan areas. surveillance methods are needed that expedite the detection of wbdos and the institution of preventive measures (e.g., boil-water advisories). actions taken: surveillance data that identify the types  of water systems, their deficiencies, and the etiologic agents associated with outbreaks are used to evaluate the adequacy of current technologies for prov

AB  == bivalve molluscs, (cockles, mussels, scallops and oysters) were examined according to ec shellfish bed classification regulations for faecal coliforms, escherichia coli and salmonella, and for coliforms and campylobacter which are not specified by these regulations. salmonella serotypes were detected in 8% of 433 molluscs. seven salmonella isolations (2%) were made from category a beds, nominally suitable for immediate consumption according to e. coli counts. a higher percentage of salmonella isolates (6%) was detected in shellfish which require relaying or depuration prior to eating. in another survey, thermophilic campylobacter spp. were found in 42% of 380 shellfish. these findings show bed classification on the basis of indicator organisms alone is not sufficient to assure the absence of bacterial, and no doubt viral, pathogens. depuration and end product specifications which require the absence of salmonellae are an essential part of these regulations. microbiologists may wish to consider whether tests for pathogens such as salmonella and campylobacter should be included when  determining the suitability of shellfish for human consumption.

TI  == observations on the control of campylobacter jejuni infection of poultry by 'competitive exclusion'.
AB  == various bacteria were isolated aerobically from caecal mucus of campylobacter-free broilers sampled at slaughter. the organisms were mainly presumptive coliform bacteria, enterococci and micrococcus/staphylococcus spp. none showed any inhibitory activity against campylobacter jejuni in a plate assay. on the other hand, adult hens yielded nine strains of escherichia coli and one strain of enterococcus faecium that were positive in the plate assay and most of which utilized mucin as an energy source. coliform bacteria with these properties were also isolated from samples of pig colon and faeces and associated environmental samples. all of the strains from chickens or pigs failed as separate mixtures to protect chicks against a challenge dose of 10(4)-10(5) cfu/bird of c. jejuni. by contrast, chicks dosed with anaerobic preparations of caecal mucus from campylobacter-free adult hens were partly protected against c.  jejuni, as shown by values for protection factor (mean log(10) of camplylobacters/g in caecal content of control chicks divided by corresponding mean for treated group). materials from three hens gave values of 7.3, 1.4 and 3.6, respectively.

TI  == epidemiology of diarrhea among expatriate residents living in a highly endemic environment.
AB  == objective: to determine the etiology of diarrhea among expatriate residents living in a developing country and identify risk factors for travelers' diarrhea  that are difficult to evaluate in tourist populations. design: clinic based case-control study. setting: primary care travel medicine clinic in kathmandu, nepal. participants: a total of 69 expatriate residents with diarrhea, compared with 120 tourists with diarrhea, and 112 asymptomatic resident and tourist controls, selected systematically during a 1-year period. main outcome measures:  risk factors for diarrhea assessed by questionnaire and pathogen prevalence assessed by microbiologic analysis of stool specimens. results: the dominant risk factors for diarrhea among expatriate residents included younger age (p = .003),  shorter duration of stay in nepal (p < .001), and eating out in restaurants (p =  .01). eating raw vegetables, salads, fresh fruit, or ice served in restaurants was not significantly associated with diarrhea. longer duration of residence was  linearly correlated with protection. enteric pathogens were identified in 44 (64%) of 69 residents with diarrhea compared with 100 (83%) of 120 tourists with  diarrhea, with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, campylobacter, and shigella predominant for both groups. pathogens were also found in stools from 32 (37%) of 87 asymptomatic resident controls and 13 (52%) of 25 tourist controls. the attack rate of diarrhea among expatriates was estimated to be 49% (95% confidence interval, 37% to 61%) per month during the first 2 years of residence. the highest-risk months were april through july. conclusions: diarrhea among expatriates in a highly endemic environment is a persistent risk. the extremely high prevalence of enteric pathogens among asymptomatic persons reflects widespread exposure. the most important risk factors for travellers' diarrhea are difficult to modify, including younger age, duration of stay, eating in restaurants, and seasonality. preventive dietary recommendations may not be fully protective, suggesting that pretravel advice should emphasize empiric treatment in addition to strategies to avoid exposure.

TI  == comparison of the pro-inflammatory cytokine-stimulating activity of the surface-associated proteins of periodontopathic bacteria.
AB  == saline extraction of the periodontopathic bacterium, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, releases surface-associated material (sam), a complex mixture of proteins and carbohydrates with potent biological actions on isolated  bone and on various mammalian cell populations. in this study, the relative ability of the sam from 5 organisms, implicated in the pathology of periodontal disease, to stimulate human mesenchymal and myelomonocytic cells to synthesize the proinflammatory cytokines - interleukin (il)-1 beta, il-6 and tumour necrosis factor (tnf)alpha has been investigated. the bacteria investigated were actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, eikenella corrodens, porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella intermedia and campylobacter rectus. human cells were exposed to a four log order range of concentrations of the sam, or of escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide, to provide full agonist dose responses in order to allow comparison of the potency and efficacy of each sam. all sams demonstrated the capacity to stimulate human gingival fibroblasts (hgfs), human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmcs) or the myelomonocytic cell line - mono-mac-6 to release one or all of the cytokines assayed. activity was heat- and trypsin-sensitive suggesting that the active components were proteinaceous. however, there were substantial differences in the potency and efficacy of each sam when compared on  a concentration basis (w/v). the most active sam was from a. actinomycetemcomitans with those from e. corrodens and p. gingivalis being slightly less active. the least active cytokine-stimulating sams were from c. rectus and pr. intermedia. one major difference between the sams and e. coli lps  was the inability of the former to stimulate hgfs to release il-1 beta or tnf alpha although they could stimulate pbmcs to release these cytokines. this may have relevance to the pathology of the periodontal diseases.

TI  == interruption of microbial cycles in farm animals from farm to table.
AB  == the fact that only slight problems are posed by salmonella, campylobacter and escherichia coli o157 in mammalian farm animals in norway, is undoubtedly due in  large degree to the agricultural set-up with small farms and small herds, allowing a good overview of the situation at any time. other factors are the very limited import of breeding animals and food products of animal origin, microbiological control of animal feed, and favourable geographical and climatic  conditions. however, the norwegian meat industry (including abattoirs) has continuing problems with yersinia enterocolitica o:3 in pigs and pig meat, and in some cases with listeria monocytogenes in cold cuts and toxoplasma gondii in sheep meat (lamb). these three agents are therefore used to illustrate appropriate measures to be taken at the herd level on the farm, in abattoirs and  in the meat processing industry.

AB  == background: nosocomial infection is a major problem in hospitalized patients, particularly those who are debilitated. these infections may manifest as diarrhea. the spectrum of infections agents causing nosocomial diarrhea in our country is not known. methods: thirty-two patients, admitted to the hospital with various complaints, who developed diarrhea during their hospital stay, were studied to identify the causative agents of diarrhea. hospital food samples were  also processed for pathogens. results: the bacteria isolated from patients included established enteropathogens like salmonella, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, campylobacter species and organisms with low pathogenicity like serratia marsescens, pseudomonas aeruginosa and morganella morganii. the bacterial pathogens isolated were resistant to most antibiotics, suggesting their nosocomial character. hospital food samples contained salmonella typhimurium, campylobacter jejuni (biotype 1) and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, suggesting that food might have been the vehicle for these infections. conclusion: nosocomial infection was found to be an important cause of diarrhea (34%), epec and salmonell being the predominant pathogens. water, egg and milk were the source of infection in these cases. special measures to obtain uneffected items will prevent occurrence of nosocomial diarrhea in our hospitals.

TI  == identification and characterization of genes required for post-translational modification of campylobacter coli vc167 flagellin.
AB  == two genes have been identified in campylobacter coli vc167 which are required for the biosynthesis of post-translational modifications on flagellin proteins. the ptma gene encodes a protein of predicted m(r) 28,486 which shows significant homology to a family of alcohol dehydrogenases from a variety of bacteria. the ptmb gene encodes a protein of predicted m(r) 26,598 with significant homology to cmp-n-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase enzymes involved in sialic acid capsular biosynthesis in neisseria meninigitidis and escherichia coli k1. site-specific mutation of either ptma or ptmb caused loss of reactivity with antisera specific  to the post-translational modifications and a change in the isoelectric focusing  fingerprints relative to the parent strains. mutation of ptmb, but not of ptma, caused a change in apparent m(r) of the flagellin subunit in sds-page gels. the ptma and ptmb genes are present in other strains of campylobacter. in a rabbit model the ptma mutant showed a reduced ability to elicit protection against subsequent challenge with heterologous strains of the same lior serotype compared to the parental wild-type strain. this suggests that the surface-exposed post-translational modifications may play a significant role in the protective immune response.

TI  == helicobacter pylori increases proliferation of gastric epithelial cells.
AB  == the direct and indirect effects of helicobacter pylori on cell kinetics of gastric epithelial cell line ags were investigated by flow cytometric analysis of ki-67 positive cells and by mtt assay. flow cytometric analysis of ki-67 positivity permits detection of cells that are in s-phase, whereas the mtt assay  is a colometric measure of the number of viable cells. in the absence of added stimulants, 23.06 (4.88)% mean (sd) of ags cells were ki-67 positive. when cells  were preincubated in the presence of h pylori, there was a significant increase in ki-67 positivity (66.20 (7.89)%, p < 0.001). this increase was not seen in cells cultured in the presence of campylobacter jejuni (24.63 (8.11)% or escherichia coli (21.66 (9.78)%). pre-incubation of ags cells with supernatants from both h pylori and mitogen activated peripheral blood lymphocytes also increased the per cent of cells that were ki-67 positive (72.93 (8.68) and 69.96  (12.35)%; p, 0.001) respectively. similar results were also found in mtt assay. these data show that both h pylori directly and the immune/inflammatory response  to h pylori indirectly can influence the rate of epithelial cell proliferation, suggesting this bacterium may be an initiating step in gastric carcinogenesis and an important co-carcinogenic factor in h pylori positive subjects.

TI  == enterochelin acquisition in campylobacter coli: characterization of components of a binding-protein-dependent transport system.
AB  == siderophore-mediated iron uptake systems play a central role in the pathogenesis  of infection for many bacterial pathogens. campylobacter species are not thought  to produce siderophores, yet they are able to utilize both ferrichrome and enterochelin as sources of iron. part of an operon named ceubcde, encoding components of a periplasmic binding-protein-dependent transport (pbt) system for  the uptake of a ferric siderophore from campylobacter coli, was cloned directly into escherichia coli using a plasmid rescue technique. phenotypic and genetic analyses of this system showed it to comprise two hydrophobic integral membrane proteins, ceub (35.5 kda) and ceuc (34.8 kda), which may form the cytoplasmic membrane permease, an atp-binding protein, ceud (28.8 kda), and a periplasmic substrate-binding protein, ceue (34.5 kda). in vivo labelling studies using [3h]palmitate demonstrated that ceue, the periplasmic binding protein, is expressed as a lipoprotein in c. coli, which is unusual for a gram-negative pbt system. mutants of c. coli, defective in components of the transport mechanism, were severely impaired in the ability to utilize enterochelin as an iron source suggesting that this siderophore is a substrate for the transport system. this is the first molecular characterization of a pbt system in campylobacter species.

TI  == identification and characterization of an immunogenic outer membrane protein of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we cloned and expressed in escherichia coli a gene encoding an 18-kda outer membrane protein (omp18) from campylobacter jejuni atcc 29428. the nucleotide sequence of the gene encoding omp18 was determined, and an open reading frame of  165 amino acids was revealed. the amino acid sequence had the typical features of a leader sequence and a signal peptidase ii cleavage site at the n-terminal part  of omp18. moreover, the sequence had a high degree of similarity to the peptidoglycan-associated outer membrane lipoprotein p6 of haemophilus influenzae  and the peptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein pal of e. coli. southern blot analysis in which the cloned gene was used as a probe revealed genes similar to that encoding omp18 in all species of the thermophilic group of campylobacters as well as campylobacter sputorum. all campylobacters tested expressed a protein with a molecular mass identical to that of omp18. the protein reacted immunologically with polyclonal antibodies directed against omp18 from c. jejuni. pcr amplification of the gene encoding omp18 with specific primers and subsequent restriction enzyme analysis of the amplified dna fragments showed that the gene for omp18 is highly conserved in c. jejuni strains isolated from humans, dogs, cats, calves, and chickens but is different in other campylobacter species. in order to obtain pure recombinant omp18 protein for serological assays, the cloned gene for omp18 was genetically modified by replacing the signal sequence with a dna segment encoding six adjacent histidine residues. expression of this construct in e. coli allowed purification of the modified protein (omp18-6xhis) by metal chelation chromatography. sera from patients with past c. jejuni infection reacted positively with omp18-6xhis, while sera from healthy blood donors showed no reaction with this antigen. omp18, which is an outer membrane protein belonging to the family of pals is well conserved in c. jejuni and is highly immunogenic. it is therefore a good candidate as an antigen for the serological diagnosis of past c. jejuni infections.

TI  == cloning and transcription regulation of the ferric uptake regulatory gene of campylobacter jejuni tgh9011.
AB  == a campylobacter jejuni (cj) tgh9011 (atcc 43431) gene homologous to the escherichia coli ferric uptake regulatory gene (fur) has been cloned and characterized. cj fur encodes a polypeptide consisting of 157 amino acids (aa) (18.1 kda). the 5'-flanking region of the cj fur gene contains two putative catabolite activator protein (cap)-binding sequences and four fur boxes or fur-binding sequences (fbs), implicating camp and autogenous regulation respectively. a major and a minor transcription start point (tsp) were active in  fe(+) and fe(-) media and three tsp were suppressed in fe(+) condition. the major transcript has an unusually short leader sequence. the homology of the cj fur to  other proteobacteria fur proteins is moderately low with identity ranging from 36.3% for yersinia pestis to 31.8% for legionella pneumophila. multiple alignments of the fur sequences identified three conserved motifs, i [aglkvtlpr1kil], ii [eiglatvyr] and iii [hhdhlvcldcgevief] (uppercase aa are identical in 12 or all 13 fur sequences and lowercase aa are identical in six or  more sequences). a truncated tgfh9011 fur missing 18 aa of the n terminus but retaining all three conserved motifs was shown to bind all four fbs sequences. the binding and transcription studies support autoregulation of fur expression in cj.

TI  == a genetic hybrid of the campylobacter jejuni flaa gene with lt-b of escherichia coli and assessment of the efficacy of the hybrid protein as an oral chicken vaccine.
AB  == the objectives of this study were to produce campylobacter jejuni flagellin fused to the b-subunit of the labile toxin (lt-b) of escherichia coli and to assess the efficacy of the hybrid protein as a chicken vaccine. part of the flaa gene (780 base pairs) was cloned in plasmid pbeb downstream and in frame with the lt-b to allow expression of a hybrid protein. transformed e. coli chi 6097 expressed the  hybrid protein (43 kdaltons) in inclusion bodies at mid log phase. the inclusion  bodies were isolated, and the identity of the protein was verified by western blot. this hybrid protein was administered as a vaccine to chickens either orally (0, 250, 500, or 1000 micrograms total protein) or intramuscularly (250 or 1000 micrograms). alimentary secretions were collected, and specific antibodies were assayed by western blot analyses. seventy-two percent of the birds vaccinated orally with 1000 micrograms protein showed detectable antibodies against c. jejuni flagellin in the excreta. none of the control birds produced detectable antibody to this antigen. for trials to demonstrate clearance of campylobacter, groups of chickens were vaccinated with the hybrid protein at 2 and 4 wk of age and challenged at 3 wk with an excess of c.jejuni. the number of birds that remained colonized at 5 wk of age was significantly lower among the vaccinated birds than among controls.

AB  == clinical features of infantile diarrhea were studied among 603 infants from birth to 12 months of age to determine the predominant clinical feature(s) seen in infantile diarrhea associated with a specific enteric pathogen. among the major clinical features, fever was most often seen in diarrhea due to yersinia spp. (61.5%) followed by that in rotavirus (26.1%). vomiting was mostly associated with vibrio cholerae infection (90.9%) and shigellosis (64.6%). dehydration was predominant in vibrio cholerae (90.9%) and salmonella (84.9%) infections. bloody  diarrhea was mostly due to shigella infection (74.3%). as regards diarrhea with multiple pathogens, vomiting and dehydration were most frequent with campylobacter+enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) (88.9% and 77.8%, respectively), while fever was more common with rotavirus+shigella+escherichia coli and rotavirus+giardia. infection with invasive organisms lead to vomiting, 4-10 stools per day and dehydration significantly more often as compared to infections with non-invasive organisms. similarly more stools of patients infected with invasive organisms showed presence of blood and more than 5 leukocytes/hpf as compared to those infected with non-invasive organisms.

TI  == myositis, lameness, and paraparesis associated with use of an oil-adjuvant bacterin in beef cows.
AB  == right hind limb lameness, progressing to bilateral paraparesis, was observed in 56 of 610 (9%) beef cows. lameness began 6 days to 4 weeks after vaccination in the right longissimus lumborum (loin) muscle with an escherichia coli/campylobacter bacterin in an oil adjuvant. postmortem examination of 5 affected cows revealed a large inflammatory mass at the site of vaccination. in each cow, the mass spread through adjacent intervertebral foramina into the vertebral canal and compressed the lumbar portion of the spinal cord. microbiologic procedures did not reveal a microbial agent in affected tissues or  in an unopened bottle of bacterin from the same lot used in the herd. histologic  examination revealed pyogranulomatous inflammation of the vaccination site and adjacent epidural tissue, with inflammatory nodules centered around large clear spaces that probably represented remnant emulsion from the oil adjuvant in the bacterin. as evident in these cows, im injection of irritating products may cause severe myositis. vaccination into paravertebral muscles is risky because of possible extension of inflammation through intervertebral foramina.

TI  == cloning of the helicobacter pylori reca gene and functional characterization of its product.
AB  == the reca protein is a key enzyme involved in dna recombination in bacteria. using a polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification we cloned a reca homolog from helicobacter pylori. the gene revealed an open reading frame (orf) encoding a putative protein of 37.6 kda showing closest homology to the campylobacter jejuni reca (75.5% identity). a putative ribosome binding site and a near-consensus sigma 70 promoter sequence was found upstream of reca. a second orf, encoding a putative protein with n-terminal sequence homology to prokaryotic and eukaryotic  enolases, is located directly downstream of reca. compared to the wild-type strains, isogenic h. pylori reca deletion mutants of strains 69a and nctc11637 displayed increased sensitivity to ultraviolet light and abolished general homologous recombination. the recombinant h. pylori reca protein produced in escherichia coli strain gc6 (reca-) was 38 kda in size but inactive in dna repair, whereas the corresponding protein in h. pylori 69a migrated at the greater apparent molecular weight of approx. 40 kda in sds-polyacrylamide gels. however, complementation of the h. pylori mutant using the cloned reca gene on a  shuttle vector resulted in a reca protein of the original size and fully restored the general functions of the enzyme. these data can be best explained by a modification of reca in h. pylori which is crucial for its function. the potential modification seems not to occur when the protein is produced in e. coli, giving rise to a smaller but inactive protein.

TI  == genetic analysis of the minimal replicon of plasmid pip417 and comparison with the other encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance plasmids from bacteroides spp.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the dna replication origin region of a bacteroides vulgatus plasmid, pip417, encoding 5-nitroimidazole resistance has been determined. this region of 1934 bp presents some characteristics similar to those of other replication protein-dependent origins. it contains a large open reading  frame which could encode a basic rep protein (repa) of 36.8 kda. upstream of this orf exist an at-rich region, three direct repeats (iterons) of 21 bp, multiple dnaa binding sites, and sites, and sites for the integration host factor (ihf). moreover, the amino acid sequence of the pip417 repa protein shows similarities with those of other rep proteins encoded by plasmids of gram-negative bacteria: pro1600 from pseudomonas aeruginosa; pps10 from pseudomonas syringae; pfa3 from neisseria gonorrhoeae; and two cryptic plasmids from campylobacter hyointestinalis and butyrivibrio fibrisolvens. although repa can be expressed in  an escherichia coli in vitro transcription-translation assay, vectors containing  the pip417 replication origin did not replicate in e. coli. the homology of the pip417 replication region with the corresponding regions of other bacteroides spp, plasmids was also studied by southern blot hybridization. the results indicated that the repa gene of plasmid pip417 is homologous to that of plasmid pip421, but not of plasmid pip419. the replication region of plasmid pip421 was sequenced and showed about 80% identity at the nucleotide level with that of pip417. a small (3634-bp) cloning vector (pfk12) of entirely defined nucleotide sequence was constructed for bacteroides spp.

AB  == in guillain-barre syndrome antibodies to gm1 and the presence of an antecedent campylobacter jejuni infection are correlated with a more severe course of the disease. from a group of 137 consecutive gbs patients, 11 sera had elevated titers of anti-gm1 igg antibodies during the acute stage of disease. each serum sample was preincubated with three different penner serotypes of whole c. jejuni  (pen o:4/59, pen o:41) and campylobacter coli (pen o:22) bacteria. the pen o:4/59 serotype, isolated from the stools of a guillain-barre syndrome patient, inhibited 63 to 93% of the anti-gm1 activity in 6 of 11 patients. the pen o:41 inhibited 63 to 100% of the anti-gm1 antibody activity in 9 of 11 patients. the pen o:22 inhibited anti-gm1 antibody activity in only 2 of 11 patients (80 and 86%). two guillain-barre syndrome patients did not show antibody absorption by any of the campylobacter serotypes tested, although this does not exclude the involvement of other serotypes. an escherichia coli control strain did not significantly absorb anti-gm1 antibodies. the results of this study indicate that anti-gm1 igg antibodies in guillain-barre syndrome sera recognize surface epitopes on whole campylobacter bacteria and that this recognition is strain-specific. this provides evidence for molecular mimicry in the pathogenesis of guillain-barre syndrome.

AB  == the major outer membrane protein (momp) of campylobacter jejuni was purified to homogeneity by selective solubilization and fast protein liquid chromatography. the amino acid composition of the momp indicates the presence of cysteine residues. the amino-terminal sequence, determined over 31 residues, shows no significant homology with any other porin from gram-negative bacteria except in a discrete region. immunocross-reactivity between escherichia coli ompc and the momp was analyzed, and a common antigenic site between these two porins was identified with an anti-peptide antibody. from circular dichroism and immunological investigations, the existence of a stable folded monomer, containing a high level of beta-sheet secondary structure, is evident. conformational analyses show the presence of a native trimeric state generated by association of the three folded monomers; the stability of this trimer is reduced compared with that of e. coli porins. this study clearly reveals that the c. jejuni momp is related to the family of trimeric bacterial porins.

AB  == the 29-kda protein peb4, a major antigen of campylobacter jejuni, is present in all c. jejuni strains tested and elicits an antibody response in infected patients. by screening a lambda gt11 library of chromosomal dna fragments of c. jejuni strain 81-176 in escherichia coli y1090 cells with antibody raised against purified peb4, a recombinant phage with a 2-kb insert expressing an immunoreactive protein of 29 kda was isolated. dna sequence analysis revealed that the insert contains two complete open reading frames orf-a and orf-b. orf-a  (peb4a) encodes a 273-residue protein with a calculated molecular mass of 30,460  daltons. the deduced amino acid sequence, composition and pl of the recombinant mature protein are similar to those determined for purified peb4. the first 21 residues resemble a signal peptide. gene bank searches indicated 33.7% identity with protein export protein prsa of bacillus subtilis and 23.8% identity with protease maturation protein precursor prtm of lactococcus lactis. pcr experiments indicate that peb4a is highly conserved among c. jejuni strains. orf-b begins 2 bp after the last codon of peb4a and encodes a putative protein of 353 residues with 63.4% identity with e. coli fructose 1,6-biphosphate aldolase. the sequence  arrangement suggests that these two genes form an operon.

TI  == purification and characterization of ferritin from campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we purified an iron-containing protein from campylobacter jejuni using ultracentrifugation and ion-exchange chromatography. electron microscopy of this  protein revealed circular particles with a diameter of 11.5 nm and a central core with a diameter of 5.5 nm. the protein was composed of a single peptide of 21 kda and did not serologically cross-react with horse spleen ferritin. the uv-visible  spectrum of the protein showed no absorption peaks in the visible region, indicating that little or no heme is bound. the ratio of fe:phosphate of c. jejuni ferritin was 1.5:1. from these morphological and chemical examinations, we concluded that the c. jejuni purified protein is a ferritin of the same class as  that of helicobacter pylori and bacteroides fragilis and differs from the heme-containing bacterioferritin of escherichia coli. the 30 n-terminal amino acids were sequenced and were found to resemble the sequences of other ferritins  strongly (h. pylori ferritin, 73% identity; b. fragilis ferritin, 50% identity; e. coli gene-165 product, 50% identity), and to a lesser degree, bacterioferritins (e. coli bacterioferritin, 26% identity; azotobacter vinelandii, 26% identity; horse spleen ferritin 30% identity). proteins that cross-reacted with antiserum against the ferritin of c. jejuni were found in other campylobacter species and in h. pylori, but not in vibrio, e. coli, or pseudomonas aeruginosa.

TI  == expression of adhesion molecules on human granulocytes after stimulation with helicobacter pylori membrane proteins: comparison with membrane proteins from other bacteria.
AB  == type b gastritis in its active form is characterized by a dense infiltration of the lamina propria with granulocytes. since the bacterium helicobacter pylori does not invade the epithelial barrier, a signaling pathway chemoattractive for granulocytes must exist across this mucosal boarder. one possible mechanism tested was whether granulocytes are directly activated by water-soluble membrane  proteins (wsp) from h. pylori. these findings were compared with the effects of wsp from other bacteria (helicobacter felis, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus). a unique activation pattern by h. pylori wsp was found. like all other wsp tested, they induced an upregulation of cd11b but had no influence on cd11c and, most strikingly, cd62l expression. in contrast, e. coli wsp, e.g., not only induce a strong cd11b and cd11c expression but also lead to a loss in surface cd62l. the lack of cd62l shedding conserves rolling of granulocytes along the endothelium, creating a favorable precondition for granulocytes to stick more readily to activated endothelium after h. pylori stimulation via cd11b-cd54 receptor-counterreceptor interaction. this may explain why h. pylori infection is a very strong stimulus for granulocyte infiltration. the active fraction for the induction of cd11b on granulocytes is a heat- and protease-sensitive protein with a molecular mass between 30 and 100 kda. one activation step involved may be the binding of wsp to cd15 determinants on granulocytes with subsequent induction of cd11b.

AB  == we tried to isolate verotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) on sorbitol-macconkey (smac) agar and in part by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) method from sporadic enteritis patients with bloody stools and intussusception patients who came to three pediatric clinics in the fukuoka area from october 1990 to september 1994. vtec o157:h7 strains were isolated from 6 (10.5%) of 57 patients with bloody stools, campylobacter spp. 15 (26.3%), salmonella spp. 14 (24.6%) and yersinia enterocolitica 2. we were not able to detect vt genes by pcr from 11 of 20 patients from whose stools no causative bacteria were isolated. massive fresh bloody stools following frequent watery diarrhea were typical of the vtec enteritis patients. only 1 patient had fever and 2 had leukocytosis, but the c-reactive protein in all of them was below 1+. the vtec strains were isolated during the summer season, 1 in june, 2 in july, and 3 in september. since in the area o157:h7 appeared to be the most prevalent vtec serotype, smac is very useful for screening vtec in bloody stools. vtec seems to be a rare pathogen of intussusception because the organisms were detected from none of the  30 patients.

TI  == expression and characterization of campylobacter jejuni benzoylglycine amidohydrolase (hippuricase) gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == the basis for the difference between campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli  is the presence and expression of the n-benzoylglycine amidohydrolase (hippuricase) gene only in c. jejuni. a pbr322 recombinant clone (phip-o) of c. jejuni tgh9011 capable of converting hippuric acid into benzoic acid and glycine, the hallmark of hippuricase activity, was characterized and sequenced. the hippuricase gene (hipo) was identified by use of deletion subclones and insertional inactivation. the transcription start point of the hippuricase gene was determined by primer extension analysis. a hippuricase-specific gene fragment was used to determine the presence of the gene in campylobacter species. maxicell analysis of recombinant plasmid phip-o by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis demonstrated the production of a 42-kda protein corresponding to the hipo gene product, in excellent agreement with the predicted molecular mass of the protein.

TI  == molecular characterization of a campylobacter jejuni lipoprotein with homology to periplasmic siderophore-binding proteins.
AB  == a genomic library of campylobacter jejuni (nctc 11351) was used to identify genes which could confer a hemolytic phenotype to escherichia coli. accordingly, when transformants were screened on blood plates, hemolytic colonies appeared at a frequency of 3 x 10(-4). the gene conferring the hemolytic activity was identified by subcloning and was found to be responsible for the phenotype of all hemolytic transformants isolated. the open reading frame conferring this activity encodes a protein of 36,244 da with a typical endopeptidase type ii leader sequence. the protein is modified with palmitic acid when it is processed in e. coli, confirming that it is a typical lipoprotein. the deduced gene product of 329 amino acids has significant homology to the group of solute binding proteins  from periplasmic-binding-protein-dependent transport systems for ferric siderophores, including the fatb protein from vibrio anguillarium and the fhud protein from bacillus subtilis. in particular, the protein contained the signature sequence for siderophore-binding proteins, suggesting that the protein  may be the siderophore-binding protein component of an iron acquisition system of c. jejuni.

TI  == interleukin-8 response of gastric epithelial cell lines to helicobacter pylori stimulation in vitro.
AB  == gastric infection with helicobacter pylori activates a mucosal inflammatory response by mononuclear cells and neutrophils that includes expression of cytokines interleukin-1 beta (il-1 beta), il-6, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and  il-8. in this study, we analyzed the il-8 response of human gastric cancer cell lines (kato iii, ags, and mkn28) to h. pylori infection in vitro. il-8 mrna expression was detected by reverse transcription-pcr amplification of rna extracted from epithelial cells after incubation with different h. pylori wild-type and mutant strains, and il-8 secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. exposure to viable h. pylori induced il-8 mrna and protein synthesis in all three gastric cell lines but not in nongastric epithelial cell lines. heat-killed h. pylori and a crude cytotoxin preparation did not induce significant il-8 secretion. il-8 mrna peaked between 2 and 4 h postinfection, and il-8 protein production was maximal 24 h postinfection. exposure of gastric carcinoma cells to other gastrointestinal bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, and escherichia coli, but not campylobacter fetus, induced il-8 synthesis. wild-type strains that expressed the vacuolating cytotoxin (tox+) and a cytotoxin-associated gene (caga) product (caga+) induced significantly more il-8 than did caga- tox- strains. however, there was no decrease in il-8 induction by isogenic mutants of caga-, tox-, or cag- tox- strains or by a mutant lacking the urease subunits. these results indicate that exposure to h. pylori and other gram-negative organisms that do not colonize the  gastric mucosa induces il-8 production by gastric carcinoma cells in vitro. although the caga+ tox+ phenotype of h. pylori is associated with enhanced il-8 production by gastric cell lines, other bacterial constituents are clearly essential.

TI  == differentiation of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli strains by using restriction endonuclease dna profiles and dna fragment polymorphisms.
AB  == the chromosomal dna fragment patterns from a total of 169 campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli isolates from poultry and humans were analyzed by using dna restriction endonucleases clai and ecorv. the dna restriction patterns produced by clai and ecorv consisted of unique dna fragments of 9 to 9.5 kb and 3.5 kb generated with clai and a single unique fragment of 3.0 kb produced by ecorv. these patterns were obtained with all strains of c. jejuni tested. the dna restriction patterns were further examined by southern blot analysis with a previously constructed dna probe, pmo2005, which is also able to distinguish between c. jejuni and c. coli spp. (5). two types of patterns were produced by hybridization with the clai-cleaved dna of c. jejuni strains, one of a single 18.5-kb genomic fragment and the other of 14.5- and 4.0-kb fragments. this indicated the presence of an extra clai site in this genomic fragment in the strains with the duplex pattern. the southern blot analysis of 169 c. jejuni and  c. coli isolates from poultry and from humans with dna probe pmo2005 demonstrated that 78% of c. jejuni strains isolated from chickens hybridized with dna probe pmo2005 with a characteristic 14.5- and 4.0-kb banding pattern and 22% hybridized with a single 18.5-kb fragment, whereas 71% of human isolates hybridized with the single 18.5-kb fragment and only 29% hybridized with 14.5- and 4.0-kb fragments.  these findings suggest that only a small proportion of c. jejuni strains that colonize chickens may cause disease in humans.

TI  == a lipopolysaccharide-binding domain of the campylobacter fetus s-layer protein resides within the conserved n terminus of a family of silent and divergent homologs.
AB  == campylobacter fetus cells can produce multiple s-layer proteins ranging from 97 to 149 kda, with a single form predominating in cultured cells. we have cloned, sequenced, and expressed in escherichia coli a sapa homolog, sapa2, which encodes a full-length 1,109-amino-acid (112-kda) s-layer protein. comparison with the two previously cloned sapa homologs has demonstrated two regions of identity, approximately 70 bp before the open reading frame (orf) and proceeding 550 bp into the orf and immediately downstream of the orf. the entire genome contains eight copies of each of these conserved regions. southern analyses has demonstrated that sapa2 existed as a complete copy within the genome in all strains examined, although northern (rna) analysis has demonstrated that sapa2 was not expressed in the c. fetus strain from which it was cloned. further southern analyses revealed increasing sapa diversity as probes increasingly 3' within the orf were used. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and then southern blotting with the conserved n-terminal region of the sapa homologs as a probe showed that these genes were tightly clustered on the chromosome. deletion mutagenesis revealed that the s-layer protein bound serospecifically to the c. fetus lipopolysaccharide via its conserved n-terminal region. these data indicated that the s-layer proteins shared functional activity in the conserved n terminus but diverged in a semiconservative manner for the remainder of the molecule. variation in s-layer protein expression may involve rearrangement of complete gene copies from a single large locus containing multiple sapa homologs.

TI  == identification of campylobacter jejuni on the basis of a species-specific gene that encodes a membrane protein.
AB  == to facilitate discrimination between the closely related enteropathogens campylobacter jejuni and c. coli, unique differences in antigenic surface structure were examined. a genomic library of c. jejuni 81116 was constructed in  plasmid pbluescriptiisk- and expressed in escherichia coli k-12. rabbit hyperimmune serum raised against c. jejuni atcc 29428 recognized a clone expressing a c. jejuni 24-kda membrane-associated protein. antiserum raised against sonicated recombinant e. coli expressing the 24-kda protein reacted with  c. jejuni, whereas c. coli did not react specifically. determination of the nucleotide sequence of the dna insert of this recombinant plasmid revealed an open reading frame encoding 214 amino acids; the gene was designated mapa; and its gene product was designated mapa. the 18 n-terminal amino acid residues constitute a signal sequence characteristic of prokaryotic membrane lipoproteins. in a dot blot hybridization assay with a mapa probe, 120 clinical isolates of c.  jejuni were unequivocally discriminated from 126 other campylobacters, including  34 c. coli isolates. a pcr test based on the mapa sequence was developed for identification of c. jejuni. a pcr product was obtained with all of the clinical  isolates of c. jejuni tested from human, dog, cat, bovine calf, and chicken sources. recombinant mapa with an added c-terminal six-histidine tail was affinity purified and used to immunize rabbits. the rabbit anti-mapa serum specifically recognized the protein in whole cells of c. jejuni on western blots  (immunoblots). the mapa protein was present in all of the c. jejuni strains tested and was absent in c. coli and related campylobacters.

AB  == compressive lumbar myelopathy is a recognized iatrogenic complication of injecting water-in-oil vaccines into paravertebral sites of laboratory animals and chickens. herein, we report the histologic and ultrastructural features of a  similar complication in a herd of cattle. iatrogenic posterior paresis developed  over 34 days in 56 of 610 cows (9.2%) following injection of a commercial bacterin 11-34 days earlier into m. longissimus lumborum. the bacterin was composed of inactivated escherichia coli and campylobacter fetus ssp. venerealis  in a proprietary adjuvant. tissues were collected for histopathology from 9 affected cattle that died or were euthanized after clinical signs lasting 6-38 days. a range of tissues, including the injection site lesion and lumbar spinal nerve roots, was obtained for ultrastructural examination from a cow with paresis of 31 days duration. there was locally extensive pyogranulomatous myositis with fibrosis and necrosis in right m. longissimus lumborum. extension of the lesion into the vertebral canal via spinal nerve foramina resulted in focal pyogranulomatous inflammation in epidural fat and in adjacent dura mater. there was axonal degeneration in dorsal, lateral, and ventral columns and chromatolysis of spinal motor neurons in lumbar spinal cord, secondary to compression. a distinctive histologic and ultrastructural feature of pyogranulomata was the presence of osmiophilic material at the center of inflammatory foci, surrounded by macrophages and giant cells that contained intracytoplasmic lipid droplets. ultrastructural examination of entrapped spinal nerves revealed axonal degeneration and loss of myelinated and unmyelinated fibers, segmental demyelination with remyelination, axonal spheroid formation, and early axonal regeneration.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == a comprehensive utilization review was done of all stool culture tests performed  at a pediatric hospital during a 3-year period from june 1, 1989 through to july  1, 1992. a total of 4,460 stool culture specimens were surveyed from 3,420 children. sixty percent (2,692) of the workload was from inpatients, 22% (1,001)  was from emergency room (er) visits and 18% (767) was from outpatient clinic/office visits. a total of 9% (294 of 3,420) of the children were confirmed to have enteric bacterial infection. enteric infections in southern alberta follow a typical pattern, where most cases of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella sp and campylobacter jejuni are diagnosed in the summer months between june and september. marked differences were found in the overall stool culture positivity rate between hospitalized children (94 of 2,141, 4%), and ambulatory children attending the er (176 of 892, 19%). although a significant number of children had more than one stool culture done, most cases of enteric bacterial infections were diagnosed on the first stool sample (290 of 294, 98%). most children (89 of 94, 95%) who were hospitalized because of an acute diarrheal illness had a bacteriological diagnosis confirmed within the first 4 days after admission (90 of 94, 96%), including immunocompromised children in the oncology ward. over the past year, significant sustainable cost savings have resulted from the implementation of practice guidelines for ordering pediatric stool cultures.

TI  == [hemolytic-uremic syndrome after verotoxin-producing escherichia coli infection].
AB  == the haemolytic uraemic syndrome, first described in 1955 by gasser, is the number one cause of acute renal failure in infants. there are three types of the haemolytic uraemic syndrome: the seasonal epidemic form with prodromic diarrhoea  and generally favourable outcome which usually occurs in infants, a less typical  form without signs of digestive tract involvement and no seasonal prevalence which occurs more readily in older children and sometimes in families has a less  favourable prognosis, and finally drug- or disease-related forms. currently, overall mortality due to haemolytic uraemic syndrome has been reduced to about 4%, usually as a result of damage to the central nervous system. several microorganism, including shigella dysenteriae, salmonella typhi, campylobacter jejuni, streptococcus pneumoniae, rickittsiae and certain viruses (coksackiae, influenzae, epstein-barr) have been identified as causative agents. in 1983, digestive tract infection due to an escherichia coli strain producing verotoxin was identified as capable of producing haemolytic uraemic syndrome and more rarely thrombopenic thrombotic purpura. the germ produces two exotoxins (whose effect is accentuated by the e. coli lipopolysaccharide endotoxin) which lead to  the glomerular microangiopathy causing haemolytic uraemic syndrome. diagnosis is  based on identification (monoclonal antibodies, elisa, pcr) of the verotoxins themselves or the two encoding genes in stool samples. symptomatic treatment is essential but the effectiveness of antibiotics is still debated. theoretically, antibiotics could worsen the syndrome by increasing endotoxin release from lysed  bacteria, but inversely they could also prevent the syndrome if given early enough. further research is required to acquire precise epidemiological data and  identify animal reservoirs of verotoxin producing e. coli.

AB  == asd gene of the human enteric pathogen, campylobacter jejuni dz72/92, has been isolated from a genomic library constructed in the expression plasmid vector puc8-2 in escherichia coli. the gene has been fished out by complementation of the asd gene deletion present in the genome of e. coli chi 6097. the smallest recombinant plasmid (puwm3) able to confer asd+ phenotype contains a 1.8 kb insert cloned into hindiii site located within the multi-cloning site of the puc8-2 vector. the origin of the insert has been confirmed by hybridization. several pieces of evidence indicate that the expression of the cloned house-keeping gene is driven from its own promoter, which can be recognised by e. coli rna polymerase. the asd gene promoter has been located on 300 kb hindiii-drai fragment of puwm3. recombinant plasmid puwm3 specifies a new 38 kda  protein which we believe is the asd gene product. overproduction of the 38 kda protein due to the transcription originating from the vector lacz gene promoter is toxic for the cells.

TI  == strategies to accelerate the applicability of gene amplification protocols for pathogen detection in meat and meat products.
AB  == traditionally, microbiological testing of meat products has involved isolating microorganisms and performing specific biochemical, and in some cases serological, tests to confirm the presence or absence of suspected food-borne pathogens. given the public attention meat products have received as sources of food-borne disease, there has been considerable interest in the application of rapid detection techniques that require hours rather than days for completion. theoretically, rapid detection methods could reduce the time from the initial sampling to confirmation so that conclusive results would be available by the time to process the meat product. both direct gene probe hybridization as well as gene amplification methods show promise as rapid detection techniques. at present, direct gene probe hybridization are being commercially utilized to confirm the presence of a suspected pathogen. a number of gene amplification protocols for detecting food-borne bacterial pathogens have been published. however, many of these studies have utilized spiked samples rather than naturally contaminated samples and many of them have involved extended template extraction/purification methodologies. there is still only a very limited amount  of information on the efficacies of the various protocols in detecting bacterial  pathogens, especially toxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter  spp., and listeria spp., in naturally contaminated food samples. in order to develop gene amplification protocols that have relevance to the meat industry, there must be a concerted effort to utilize naturally contaminated samples in the development and evaluation of protocols, as well as to initiate multilaboratory round robin evaluations of select protocols. availability of multilaboratory tested methodologies would provide a means to design pathogen detection strategies at the quality control level rather than an end product confirmatory response to an already documented outbreak.

AB  == the occurrence of campylobacter and enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) was studied in faecal samples from tanzanian children (< 5 years of age), adolescents and adults (only campylobacter) with and without diarrhoea. the campylobacter strains isolated were tested for subspecies, enterotoxigenicity and serotype. out of 394  children with diarrhoea 18% were infected with campylobacter and 20% with etec. in 278 samples tested for campylobacter and 136 tested for etec from asymptomatic children the corresponding numbers were 12 and 5%, respectively. in children < 18 months with diarrhoea campylobacter was noted in 22% and etec in 18%, whereas the figures were 11 and 4% respectively in asymptomatic children. in the age group 18 months to 5 years campylobacter was demonstrated in 2% of the children with diarrhoea and 27% had etec, while the figures were 15 and 8% for asymptomatic children. among adults the prevalence of campylobacter-positive samples was 1% both for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. there were no seasonal differences in the prevalences of both campylobacter and etec either in the symptomatic or the asymptomatic group. campylobacter jejuni was the dominating campylobacter species among both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. c. jejuni strains from patients with diarrhoea were significantly more often enterotoxigenic than were c. coli strains. the serotype pattern regarding campylobacter was in general similar for symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. we conclude that campylobacter and etec are common causes of bacterial diarrhoea in tanzanian children, and that campylobacter infections are  more important in children younger than 18 months, than in older ones.

TI  == mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones: state-of-the-art 1992-1994.
AB  == this paper gives an update on the mechanisms of bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. the laboratory techniques currently used to determine the mechanism(s) of resistance are outlined, including the use of restriction fragment length polymorphism and single-stranded conformational polymorphism analysis of mutations in gyra. alterations in gyra have continued to be the most  reported cause of resistance, with high level resistance due to 2 or more mutations in this gene. recently, mutations in gyra of mycobacterium tuberculosis and campylobacter jejuni have been described. complementation studies with plasmid encoded cloned gyrb from escherichia coli suggest that high fluoroquinolone resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration = 32 mg/l) in salmonella typhimurium can be due to mutation in both gyra and gyrb. decreased fluoroquinolone accumulation into e. coli has been shown to be due to mutations in a number of genes at different loci. current interest has focused upon the marrab and soxrs loci, with mutations in genes of either loci giving rise to decreased susceptibility to several unrelated drugs, including fluoroquinolones,  tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams, and decreased expression of  ompf. the genetic characterisation of fluoroquinolone efflux from staphylococcus  aureus has shown that efflux occurs in both fluoroquinolone-susceptible and -resistant bacteria. the most likely cause of resistance is overexpression of nora, giving rise to increased efflux. recently, 2 efflux systems in pseudomonas  aeruginosa have been proposed, mexa-mexb-oprk and mexc-mexd-oprm, conferring decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and some beta-lactams.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the presence of pathogenic bacteria poses a serious problem in sustaining the safety of dairy products. microbiological routine controls of these products make use of selective culture techniques. to detect pathogenic species, isolated colonies are characterized by specific metabolic activities and by serotyping. we present an alternative biochemical approach that does not require culture of bacteria. the total bacterial populations of food samples were isolated by centrifugation and analysed by pcrs specific for pathogenic species. a total of 90 raw milk samples and dairy products made from raw milk were screened by this method for the presence of listeria monocytogenes, escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic e. coli, campylobacter jejuni and c. coli. detection rates were 12/90 (13%) for l. monocytogenes, 41/90 (46%) for e. coli, 18/90 (20%) for enterotoxigenic e. coli producing heat-labile toxin type i or heat-stable toxin type i, and 6/90 (7%) for c. jejuni or c. coli. except for the use of different amplification primers, this approach is identical for any bacterial species to be detected. direct pcr analysis of food samples offers rapid screening for the presence of specific bacteria and enables selection of critical samples prior to  culture.

AB  == pcr was used to amplify a 238-bp region from helicobacter pylori which corresponded to the quinolone resistance-determining region in escherichia coli.  the gyra gene of h. pylori was cloned and sequenced. an open reading frame of 2,478 nucleotides coded for a polypeptide of 826 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 92,508 da. the amino acid sequence showed an overall 52% identity with other bacterial gyra genes but was most closely related to the gyra subunit of campylobacter jejuni (76.5% identity). sequencing of the amplification product from ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants of h. pylori revealed four classes of mutations with substitutions at amino acid 87 (asn-->lys), amino acid 88 (ala-->val), and amino acid 91 (asp-->gly, -->asn, or -->tyr) and a double substitution at amino acids 91 and 97 (ala-->val). ciprofloxacin-susceptible strains of h. pylori could be transformed to ciprofloxacin resistance by using the amplified fragment from resistant strains as donor dna. of the 11 ciprofloxacin-resistant mutants examined, only one did not have an alteration within the quinolone resistance-determining region, suggesting that, in h. pylori, resistance to quinolones is primarily a result of alterations in gyra.

TI  == safety and immunogenicity of a prototype oral whole-cell killed campylobacter vaccine administered with a mucosal adjuvant in non-human primates.
AB  == the safety and immunogenicity of two prototype oral campylobacter killed whole-cell (cwc) vaccines were tested in rhesus monkeys. animals were immunized with a primary two-dose series (days 0 and 14) of vaccine consisting of cwc (10(10) particles/dose) given alone or in combination with 0.5-1000 micrograms of the heat-labile enterotoxin of escherichia coli as an oral adjuvant (oa). a booster vaccination, 4 weeks after primary immunization, was given to animals receiving cwc alone or supplemented with 0.5, 5 or 50 micrograms of oa. both cwc  and cwc-oa were well tolerated, with no adverse side-effects noted. campylobacter-specific as well as adjuvant-specific antibody-secreting cells (ascs) were determined in peripheral blood collected 7 days after each vaccine dose. campylobacter-specific iga asc responses were enhanced by oa in a dose-dependent manner (p = 0.025), while igg asc responses were not. seroconversions (both iga and igg) to campylobacter antigens were also enhanced in monkeys receiving adjuvanted vaccine. no significant booster vaccination effect was observed in circulating ascs in any of the immunization groups. in vitro t-cell proliferative responses to campylobacter jejuni antigens were somewhat enhanced in both the cwc and cwc-oa immunization groups. these results demonstrate that cwc-oa is safe and superior to cwc alone in its ability to stimulate both local and systemic campylobacter-specific iga and igg responses in primates and they support its further evaluation in human clinical studies.

AB  == the study was conducted to isolate and characterize campylobacter, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli-labile toxin (etec-lt), shigella and salmonella  in flies and water. the material for the study, flies (n = 300) and water samples (n = 148), was collected from different localities in and around lahore, pakistan. cultivation of the samples was performed on conventional standard media. membrane filtration technique was used for water prior to culture. determination of etec-lt was done by gm1 elisa. results of our study showed that  flies and water were reservoirs for all the four pathogens, campylobacter, etec-lt, shigella and salmonella. flies from the village were carrying fewer enteropathogens, while water from the village was found to be more contaminated as compared to the city. campylobacter and etec-lt were the most frequently isolated pathogens in both flies and water. thus the incidence of diarrhoeal disease in children of developing countries may be decreased by providing plenty  of safe drinking water, improving excreta disposal, toilet facilities and giving  education in personal hygiene.

TI  == infectious agents causing acute watery diarrhoea in infants and young children in bangladesh and their public health implications.
AB  == we studied the age specific distribution of enteropathogens in young children presenting at a large diarrhoeal diseases hospital in urban bangladesh. a 5 per cent systematic sample was used to examine 1207 rectal swab specimens of children aged 1-35 months with acute watery diarrhoea. variation in isolation rates of enteropathogens was observed in different age groups. overall rotavirus (26 per cent) and campylobacter (26 per cent) were the most common pathogens followed by  enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (15 per cent), vibrio cholerae 01 (7 per cent),  other vibrios (9 per cent), shigella (4 per cent), and salmonella (< 1 per cent). in early infancy (1-5 months) more rectal swab specimens did not yield any enteropathogen compared to older children of 24-35 months old (44 v. 30 per cent). rotavirus was most frequently detected (35 per cent) in children between 6 and 11 months old. attendance of cholera cases at the hospital was alarmingly high in the third year of life (29 per cent). the study provided useful information that, in general, children under 2 years are predominantly infected with agents [rotavirus, campylobacter, and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec)] for which antibiotic therapy is not usually indicated. these patients can be managed effectively with oral rehydration therapy and proper feeding. knowledge of pathogens associated with more severe forms of diarrhoea may help in optimizing strategies for vaccination when suitable vaccines are available against enteric infections.

TI  == application of subtyping by combined allozyme, whole-cell protein and antibiotic  resistance analysis in epidemiological investigations of food-borne infections.
AB  == allozyme pattern, whole-cell protein pattern and antibiotic resistance were used  as markers for epidemiological subtyping (below the species level) of food-relevant bacteria. the results of this study confirm the applicability of these patterns as epidemiological markers also for this special purpose. electrotyping using also a reduced allozyme set seems to be the method with the highest discriminatory power of the three methods evaluated. several examples demonstrate that complex typing of bacteria based on a combination of these three methods is useful for the analysis of food-borne infections and establishment of  their causes but also for zoonotic studies. we see, beyond this, further applications of molecular subtyping methods in food microbiology and food hygiene such as safety checking in food industry or monitoring in biotechnological processes.

AB  == survival of bacillus cereus, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium and shigella flexneri during lactic acid fermentation of cereal gruels prepared from low-tannin (white) and high-tannin (red) sorghum varieties was studied. a previously fermented gruel (starter culture, sc) recycled daily or stored for 7, 14 or 28 days, germinated cereal flour (power flour, pf), or a combination of pf and sc (pf+sc) were used as starters. at 24 h, the ph of all gruels with added starter was </=4; the ph in control gruels without starter was >/=5.2. ph decrease was significantly faster in gruels made with pf+sc than with either pf or sc alone (p<0.05). a daily recycled sc resulted in a significantly faster decrease in ph (p<0.05) than sc stored for more than 7 days. acid production was correlated with ph decrease (r=-0.94; p<0.01). in control gruels, the enteropathogens remained at the inoculation level or increased in number. their growth was inhibited within 24 to 48 h in the fermented gruels, in the order: bacillus > campylobacter > escherichia coli > salmonella > shigella. the inhibition rate was significantly faster in fermenting gruel with pf+sc (p<0.05) than in gruel with pf or sc alone  and correlated with ph development (r=0.71; p<0.01). both white and red sorghum gruels gave similar results. using pf+sc as a starter resulted in a faster decrease in ph as well as a more rapid inhibition of enteropathogenic microorganisms. the effect is optimal if the sc is transferred daily.

TI  == high-frequency s-layer protein variation in campylobacter fetus revealed by sapa  mutagenesis.
AB  == campylobacter fetus utilizes paracrystalline surface (s-) layer proteins that confer complement resistance and that undergo antigenic variation to facilitate persistent mucosal colonization in ungulates. c. fetus possesses multiple homologues of sapa, each of which encode full-length s-layer proteins. disruption of sapa by a gene targeting method (insertion of kanamycin (km) resistance) caused the loss of c. fetus cells bearing full-length s-layer proteins and their  replacement by cells bearing a 50 kda truncated protein that was not exported to  the cell surface. after incubation of the mutants with serum, the survival rate was approximately 2 x 10(-2). immunoblots of survivors showed that phenotypic reversion involving high-level production of full-length (98, 127 or 149 kda) s-layer proteins had occurred. revertants were serum resistant but caused approximately 10-fold less bacteraemia in orally challenged mice than did the wild-type strain. southern hybridizations of the revertants showed rearrangement  of sapa homologues and retention of the km marker. these results indicate that there exists high-frequency generation of c. fetus sapa antigenic variants, and that intracellular mechanisms acting at the level of dna reciprocal recombination play key roles in this phenomenon.

TI  == regulatory effects of bifidobacteria on the growth of other colonic bacteria.
AB  == in the human large intestine bifidobacteria are a numerically important group of  micro-organisms which are considered to exert a range of biological activities related to host health. one aspect is the inhibitory effect of these bacteria on  other species, possibly excluding long term colonization by invasive pathogens. it has been suggested that the mechanism of inhibition carried out by bifidobacteria is related to the fermentative production of acids such as acetate and lactate. experiments reported in this paper attempted to address this theory. co-culture experiments whereby bifidobacterium infantis was incubated with escherichia coli and clostridium perfringens, in a variety of fermentation systems, indicated that the bifidobacterium was able to exert an inhibitory effect not necessarily related to acid production. further studies showed that eight species of bifidobacteria could variously excrete an anti-microbial substance with a broad spectrum of activity. species belonging to the genera salmonella, listeria, campylobacter and shigella, as well as vibrio cholerae, were all affected. these results show that bifidobacteria are able to exert more  than one mechanism of inhibition, which may be of some importance with regard to  protection against gastroenteritis.

TI  == metabolic activity of pathogenic bacteria during semicontinuous anaerobic digestion.
AB  == in natural environments such as anaerobic digesters, bacteria are frequently subjected to the stress of nutrient fluxes because of the continual changes in the flow of nutrients, and to survive, they must be capable of adapting readily to nutrient changes. in this study, the metabolic activities of escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, listeria monocytogenes, and campylobacter jejuni were studied within culture bags (versapor-200 filters, 0.22-microns pore size) in laboratory anaerobic digesters. the metabolic activity of these bacteria was indicated by their adenylate energy charge (ec) ratios and  their ability to incorporate [3h]thymidine, which was related to the respective changes in viable numbers within the culture bags during anaerobic digestion. fluctuations in the adenylate ec ratios, the uptake of [3h]thymidine, and the viable numbers of e. coli, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, and l. monocytogenes cells were probably due to constant changes in the amount of available nutrients within the anaerobic digesters. the viability of s. typhimurium increased quickly after a fresh supply of nutrients was added to the  system as indicated by the uptake of [3h]thymidine and an increase in the adenylate ec ratios. the viable numbers of e. coli, s. typhimurium, y. enterocolitica, and l. monocytogenes organisms declined rapidly from 10(7) to 10(8) cfu/ml to 10(3) to 10(4) cfu/ml and remained at this level for an indefinite period. the decimal reduction time calculated during the period of exponential decline ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 days for these bacteria. c. jejuni had the greatest mean decimal reduction time value (3.6 days).(abstract truncated at  250 words)

TI  == identification of surface-exposed outer membrane antigens of helicobacter pylori.
AB  == despite the potential significance of surface-localized antigens in the colonization by and disease processes of helicobacter pylori, few such components have been unequivocally identified and/or characterized. to further investigate the surface of this bacterium, monoclonal antibodies (mabs) to a sarcosine-insoluble outer membrane fraction prepared from h. pylori nctc 11637 were raised. mabs were selected on the basis of their surface reactivity to whole cells by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, immunofluorescence, and immunoelectron microscopy. by use of this selection protocol, 14 surface-reactive mabs were chosen. these mabs were used to identify six protein antigens (molecular masses, 80, 60, 51, 50, 48, and 31 kda), all of which were localized within or associated with the outer membrane. two of the mabs recognized the core region of lipopolysaccharide (lps). only these two anti-lps mabs also recognized  the flagellar sheath, indicating a structural difference between the sheath and outer membrane. three of the protein antigens (80, 60, and 51 kda) were strain specific, while the other three antigens were present in other strains of h. pylori. both the 51- and 48-kda antigens were heat modifiable and likely are porins. a conserved 31-kda protein may represent another species of porin. a method involving sucrose density ultracentrifugation and triton extraction that allows the preparation of h. pylori outer membranes with minimal inner membrane contamination is described. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis showed that the protein content of the h. pylori outer membrane is similar structurally to those of other species of helicobacter but markedly different from those of taxonomically related campylobacter spp. and escherichia coli. h. pylori also appeared to lack peptidoglycan-associated proteins.

AB  == the protein response to physiological stress was characterized in campylobacter jejuni 81176 after exposure to heat and ph shock and following periods of recovery. immunoreactivities of major stress-related proteins were determined with anti-campylobacter immune rabbit serum and intestinal lavage fluid. distinct proteins with molecular masses ranging from 10 to 120 kda were induced and/or released by selective heat or ph treatments. the most notable responses were those of two proteins with apparent molecular masses of 45 and 64 kda that were induced and two other proteins of 10 and 12 kda that were released by selective heat shock, alkaline ph treatment, or both. on the basis of n-terminal sequence analysis and immunological cross-reactivity data, the 64- and 10-kda proteins were the c. jejuni homologs of escherichia coli groel and groes proteins, respectively. enhanced chemiluminescence western blotting (immunoblotting) revealed that all four proteins were among the major protein antigens recognized  by anti-campylobacter rabbit serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and immune rabbit intestinal lavage iga (secretory iga). the results of this investigation suggest  that the c. jejuni 10-, 12-, 45-, and 64-kda proteins and a number of minor stress-related proteins deserve further evaluation of their respective roles in campylobacter pathogenesis and immunity.

TI  == urease-mediated destruction of bacteria is specific for helicobacter urease and results in total cellular disruption.
AB  == the survival of helicobacter mustelae, proteus mirobilis, escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni in the presence of urea and citrate at ph 6.0 was examined.  h. mustelae, which has urease activity similar to h. pylori, had a markedly reduced survival, median 2.5% (0-78%) (p < 0.001) when incubated under these conditions. only 7% of the ammonia produced by h. mustelae urease activity was recovered from the buffer, a similar percentage to that previously reported with  h. pylori. none of the other organisms, all of which had lower urease activity, had impaired survival under these conditions. electron microscopical studies demonstrated extensive structural damage to h. pylori following exposure to urea  and citrate at ph 6.0. this structural damage to the organisms makes it unlikely  that the low recovery of ammonia was due to retention of ammonia within the bacteria and suggests that the ammonia may have been incorporated into glutamate  or other amino acids. incorporation of ammonia into these compounds would deplete the cell of the key metabolic intermediate alpha-ketoglutarate and could thus explain the mechanism of the urease-dependent destruction of the organism.

TI  == genetic organization of the region upstream from the campylobacter jejuni flagellar gene flha.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni (cj) is a gram-bacterium that causes a diarrheal disease in  humans. a cj homolog of the lcrd/flha family of proteins was recently described [miller et al., infect. immun. 61 (1993) 2930-2936]. this family includes proteins that are involved in flagellar biogenesis, such as the cj flha protein,  but also includes proteins found in invasive pathogens, such as the yersinia pestis lcrd protein, that play a role in the regulation and/or secretion of virulence-related proteins. hybridization studies indicated that both the flha gene and upstream dna are present in several bacterial species closely related to cj, including c. fetus, c. lari, c. upsaliensis and c. hyointestinalis. the presence of a second flha/lcrd homolog was not detected in cj, indicating that a  a separate homolog involved in secretion of virulence proteins may not be present. the 4-kb region immediately upstream from cj flha was analyzed. three open reading frames (orfs) were found: a 408-nucleotide (nt) gene encoding a homolog of proteins present in escherichia coli and desulfovibrio vulgaris, but of unknown function, a 266-nt rpso gene and a 2823-nt gene encoding a homolog of  the bacillus subtilis spoiiie protein. the cj spoiiie homolog had 53% similar or  identical amino acids when compared to the b. subtilis protein, and like the b. subtilis protein contained a nt-binding domain and potential transmembrane (tm) regions. all three orfs were expressed in e. coli minicells, apparently from their own promoters.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == wolinella succinogenes possesses one polar flagellum, which shows a characteristic surface pattern of parallel lines along the axis of the filament in electron microscopic images. we determined the gene sequence of the wolinella  flagellin, which is, as in most other bacteria, the only structural component of  the filament. sequence comparison with other members of the proteobacteria revealed two highly conserved regions in the central part of the flagellin molecule among campylobacter spp. and helicobacter pylori, an area that had previously been described as highly variable. similar surface patterns are found  in related polarly flagellated bacteria, but not in escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis, which also lack these conserved regions.

TI  == phylogenetic and molecular characterization of a 23s rrna gene positions the genus campylobacter in the epsilon subdivision of the proteobacteria and shows that the presence of transcribed spacers is common in campylobacter spp.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a 23s rrna gene of campylobacter coli vc167 was determined. the primary sequence of the c. coli 23s rrna was deduced, and a secondary-structure model was constructed. comparison with escherichia coli 23s rrna showed a major difference in the c. coli rrna at approximately position 1170 (e. coli numbering) in the form of an extra sequence block approximately 147 bp long. pcr analysis of 31 other strains of c. coli and c. jejuni showed that 69% carried a transcribed spacer of either ca. 147 or ca. 37 bp. comparison of all sequenced campylobacter transcribed spacers showed that the campylobacter inserts were related in sequence and percent g+c content. all campylobacter strains carrying transcribed spacers in their 23s rrna genes produced fragmented 23s rrnas. other strains which produced unfragmented 23s rrnas did not appear to carry transcribed spacers at this position in their 23s rrna genes. at the 1850 region (e. coli numbering), campylobacter 23s rrna displayed a base pairing signature most like that of the beta and gamma subdivisions of the class proteobacteria, but in the 270 region, campylobacter 23s rrna displayed a helix signature which distinguished it from the alpha, beta, and gamma subdivisions. phylogenetic analysis comparing c. coli vc167 23s rrna and a c. jejuni tgh9011 (atcc 43431) 23s rrna with 53 other completely sequenced (eu)bacterial 23s rrnas  showed that the two campylobacters form a sister group to the alpha, beta, and gamma proteobacterial 23s rrnas, a positioning consistent with the idea that the  genus campylobacter belongs to the epsilon subdivision of the class proteobacteria.

TI  == selection of a gyra mutant of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to fluoroquinolones during treatment with ofloxacin.
AB  == a strain of mycobacterium tuberculosis resistant to ofloxacin was selected in a patient with a long history of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis eventually treated by ofloxacin combined with other second-line drugs. a mutation in the gyra gene was hypothesized to be the mechanism of acquired resistance to ofloxacin in this strain. chromosomal dna of strains mtb1, isolated before treatment and susceptible to ofloxacin (mic, 1 microgram/ml), and mtb2, isolated  during treatment and resistant to ofloxacin (mic, 32 micrograms/ml), was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) using two oligonucleotide primers highly homologous to dna sequences flanking the quinolone resistance-determining  region in gyra of mycobacteria. comparison of the nucleotide sequences of the 150-bp fragments obtained by pcr revealed a point mutation in mtb2 leading to the substitution of histidine for aspartic acid at a position corresponding to residues involved in quinolone resistance in escherichia coli (asp87), staphylococcus aureus (glu88), and campylobacter jejuni (asp90).

TI  == detection of shigellae, enteroinvasive and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) in patients returning from tropical countries.
AB  == we have used the polymerase chain reaction (pcr) to detect shigellae, eiec and etec in stool specimens of diarrhoeic patients returning from tropical countries. as compared to culture (7.1% positive specimens), which recognizes only shigella  strains, pcr performed on bacterial growth from directly inoculated macconkey agar plates and directed against virulence-associated genes present in both shigella and eiec was positive in 19.8% of the samples. we assumed that these additional positive results represent true rather than false positive samples because identical results for each single specimen were obtained using two different pcr systems and because positive results (culture as well as pcr) were  exclusively found in patients with recent travel but not in those who acquired diarrhoea in a developed country where these organisms are not endemic. pcr detecting lt- and st-specific sequences was positive in 18.5% of the patients with recent travel. again no positive cases were identified in controls. combining pcr and culture results, at least one bacterial pathogen was found in more than 50% of the patients with recent travel. we conclude that pcr is superior to culture methods for the detection of shigella, eiec and etec in travel-associated diarrhoea.

TI  == genetic, enzymatic, and pathogenic studies of the iron superoxide dismutase of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a microaerobic bacterium that produces an acute, self-limiting, watery or bloody diarrhea in humans. little is known about how c.  jejuni causes disease or even what specific capabilities it requires for survival in vivo. the enzyme, superoxide dismutase (sod), which catalyzes the breakdown of superoxide radicals to hydrogen peroxide and dioxygen is one of the bacterial cell's major defense mechanisms against oxidative damage. a pcr-based search for  sod genes in c. jejuni 81-176 revealed that this bacterium contained at least one sod gene. we cloned and sequenced a sod gene from 81-176 and determined that its  predicted protein product was most similar to that of fesods (sodb genes). transcriptional analysis indicated that this gene is monocistronic and may be transcribed from a sigma 70-like promoter. nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels stained to reveal sod activities, accompanied by inhibition studies, demonstrated that c. jejuni produces five electrophoretically distinct bands of sod activity,  all of which appeared to be fesods. analysis of an 81-176 sodb strain revealed that all of these fesod activities may be products of the one sodb gene that we cloned. the expression and enzymatic activity of the respective sodb and fesod produced by both c. jejuni and helicobacter pylori were examined in escherichia coli. both genes were expressed in e. coli, and the proteins produced were enzymatically active. finally, the ability of the 81-176 sodb strain to survive int407 cell invasion was found to be significantly decreased (12-fold) compared with that of the parent, suggesting a potential role for sodb in c. jejuni intracellular survival.

TI  == bacterial enteric pathogens in uncooked foods in thai markets.
AB  == in developing countries, the morbidity and mortality rates of gastrointestinal tract infections from food borne bacteria have been difficult to establish. most  studies have only been able to gather data prospectively from isolated geographic sources, rather than from large point-source epidemics. this study investigates the types of bacterial enteric pathogens found in food that was collected in a community in western thailand, where sporadic cases of hemolytic uremia syndrome  and cholera have been reported. samples of six different uncooked foods were collected from markets in two villages and in the hills in an area near bangkok and were tested at a district hospital laboratory within 2 hours of collection. from the 820 food samples collected, enteric pathogens were isolated from approximately 12%. these included nontyphoidal salmonella; vibrio parahemolyticus; attaching and effacing escherichia coli of nonenteropathogenic e. coli serogroups; campylobacter jejuni; enterotoxigenic e. coli; shigella; and  v. cholerae. travelers in developing countries should be made aware by diarrheal  disease programs that food obtained in markets may contain bacterial enteric pathogens and, therefore, the hygienic preparation of such foods is important in  the prevention of gastrointestinal disease.

TI  == rapid detection of serpulina hyodysenteriae in diagnostic specimens by pcr.
AB  == a pcr assay for the detection of serpulina hyodysenteriae in diagnostic specimens was developed on the basis of sequence analysis of a recombinant clone designated pred3c6. clone pred3c6, which contained a 2.3-kb dna fragment unique to s. hyodysenteriae, was identified by screening a plasmid library of s. hyodysenteriae isolate b204 genomic dna in escherichia coli by colony immunoblot  with the mouse monoclonal antibody 10g6/g10, which was produced against cell-free supernatant antigens from the same isolate. southern blot analysis of hindiii-digested genomic dna of s. hyodysenteriae serotypes 1 through 7 and of four weakly beta-hemolytic intestinal spirochetes, including serpulina innocens,  with the 2.3-kb dna fragment of pred3c6 indicated that the cloned sequence was present exclusively in the seven serotypes of s. hyodysenteriae. an oligonucleotide primer pair for pcr amplification of a 1.55-kb fragment and an internal oligonucleotide probe were designed and synthesized on the basis of sequence analysis of the 2.3-kb dna fragment of pred3c6. purified genomic dnas from reference isolates of s. hyodysenteriae serotypes 1 through 9, s. innocens,  weakly beta-hemolytic intestinal spirochetes belonging to genotypic groups distinct from those of reference serpulina spp., other cultivable reference isolates of the order spirochaetales, and enteric bacteria including escherichia  coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and bacteroides vulgatus were amplified with the oligonucleotide primer pair in a hot-start pcr. the 1.55-kb products were obtained only in the presence of genomic dna from each of the nine  serotypes of s. hyodysenteriae. the specificity of the 1.55-kb products for s. hyodysenteriae was confirmed on the basis of production of a restriction endonuclease pattern of the pcr products identical to the predicted restriction map analysis of pred3c6 and positive hybridization signal with the s. hyodysenteriae-specific internal oligonucleotide probe. by using total dna obtained from normal swine feces inoculated with decreasing concentrations of s.  hyodysenteriae cells, the sensitivity of the pcr assay was calculated to be between 1 and 10 organisms per 0.1 g of feces. the pcr assay was 1,000 times more sensitive than conventional culture of dysenteric feces on selective medium. there was complete agreement between the results of pcr assays and anaerobic culture on selective agar medium with diagnostic specimen (n = 9) obtained from six farms on which there were cases with clinical signs suggestive of swine dysentery. detection of s. hyodysenteriae by pcr amplification of dna has great potential for rapid identification of s. hyodysenteriae in diagnostic specimens.

AB  == we wished to study lt-b fusion proteins for potential as vaccines. we reasoned that a gene that was expressed as a lambda gt11 fusion protein would have a better chance of being expressed fused to lt-b. to facilitate such constructions, we modified plasmid pya3081. a bamhi-ecori-bamhi* (* is to stop codon) adapter was inserted into the single bamhi site to form a new plasmid-designated pbeb. the insert was designed so that the ecori site at the downstream end of the lt-b  gene was in the same reading frame as the ecori site in the beta-galactosidase gene of lambda gt11 and termination codons occurred downstream in all three reading frames. a clone was selected from a gt11 library based on the production  of a protein that reacted with antibodies to flagellin from campylobacter jejuni. dna from this clone was digested with ecori, the insert fragment purified and ligated into the ecori site of pbeb. a fusion protein of 43 kda was produced that reacted in western blot with antibodies against lt-b and flagellin. we have succeeded in making an easy method for subcloning fragments from gt11 into a vector for making lt-b fusion proteins.

AB  == raw ground beef patties inoculated with stationary-phase cells of escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonellae, or campylobacter jejuni were subjected to gamma irradiation (60co) treatment, with doses ranging from 0 to 2.52 kgy. the influence of two levels of fat (8 to 14% [low fat] and 27 to 28% [high fat]) and  temperature (frozen [-17 to -15 degrees c] and refrigerated [3 to 5 degrees c]) on the inactivation of each pathogen by irradiation was investigated. in ascending order of irradiation resistance, the d10 values ranged from 0.175 to 0.235 kgy (c. jejuni), from 0.241 to 0.307 kgy (e. coli o157:h7), and from 0.618  to 0.800 kgy (salmonellae). statistical analysis revealed that e. coli o157:h7 had a significantly (p < 0.05) higher d10 value when irradiated at -17 to -15 degrees c than when irradiated at 3 to 5 degrees c. regardless of the temperature during irradiation, the level of fat did not have a significant effect on the d10 value. salmonellae behaved like e. coli o157:h7 in low-fat beef, but temperature  did not have a significant effect when the pathogen was irradiated in high-fat ground beef. significantly higher d10 values were calculated for c. jejuni irradiated in frozen than in refrigerated low-fat beef. c. jejuni was more resistant to irradiation in low-fat beef than in high-fat beef when treatment was at -17 to -15 degrees c. regardless of the fat level and temperature during inactivation, these pathogens were highly sensitive to gamma irradiation.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the study was performed to assess the efficiency, acceptability and safety of dioctahedral smectite (ds) associated with rehydration in ambulatory infants with acute diarrhea. sixty-six thai infants, aged 1-24 months were randomly divided into 2 groups. one group of 32 infants (control group) received oral or intravenous rehydration, the other group of 34 infants (ds group) received the rehydration with ds. both groups were comparable for sex, age, weight, diet, duration of diarrhea, body temperature, nutritional and dehydration status. bacteriological stool examination was positive in 22% in control group and 26% in ds group for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and plesiomonas sp. rotavirus was found in 25% of the control group and 29%  of the ds group. seventy-two hours after therapy, 34% of infants were cured in the control group compared to 71% in ds group (p < 0.01) and 5 days after the beginning of treatment, 34% still had diarrhea in the control group compared to 12% in ds group (p = 0.04). the acceptability of ds was considered to be good in  30 infants (88%). no major side effect was observed. in conclusion, ds with rehydration shortens the course of acute diarrhea in ambulatory infants and may reduce the occurrence of prolonged diarrhea. ds is well tolerated in infants with acute diarrhea.

TI  == development and characterization of reca mutants of campylobacter jejuni for inclusion in attenuated vaccines.
AB  == isogenic reca mutants of campylobacter jejuni have been constructed for evaluation of their usefulness in attenuated vaccines against this major worldwide cause of diarrhea. the reca+ gene of c. jejuni 81-176 was cloned by using degenerate primers to conserved regions of other reca proteins in a pcr. the c. jejuni reca+ gene encodes a predicted protein with an m(r) of 37,012 with  high sequence similarity to other reca proteins. the termination codon of the reca+ gene overlaps with the initiation codon of another open reading frame which encodes a predicted protein which has > 50% identity with the n terminus of the escherichia coli enolase protein. a kanamycin resistance gene was inserted into the cloned reca+ gene in e. coli and returned to c. jejuni vc83 by natural transformation, resulting in allelic replacement of the wild-type reca gene. the  resulting vc83 reca mutant displayed increased sensitivity to uv light and a defect in generalized recombination as determined by natural transformation frequencies. the mutated reca gene was amplified from vc83 reca by pcr, and the product was used to transfer the mutation by natural transformation into c. jejuni 81-176 and 81-116, resulting in isogenic reca mutants with phenotypes similar to vc83 reca. after oral feeding, strain 81-176 reca colonized rabbits at levels comparable to wild-type 81-176 and was capable of eliciting the same degree of protection as wild-type 81-176 against subsequent homologous challenge  in the ritard (removable intestinal tie adult rabbit diarrhea) model.

TI  == epidemiology of acute diarrheal diseases in children in a high standard of living rural settlement in israel.
AB  == epidemiologic patterns of acute diarrheal diseases in a high standard of living communal settlement, situated in a region endemic for enteric diseases, were evaluated by a historical prospective study of 284 children (12,064 child months) from august, 1988, through july, 1992. three hundred eighty-three episodes of acute diarrhea were identified, yielding a rate of 0.38 episode per 12 child months. one hundred and children (35.6%) were reported to have 1 to 4 diarrheal episodes and 29 (10.2%) children had 5 or more diarrheal episodes during the follow-up period. the mean number of episodes of acute diarrhea per 12 child months in children ages 0 to 2 years was 2.28, in 2- to 6-year-olds 0.44, in 6- to 13-year-olds 0.12 and in 13- to 18-year-olds 0.03 (p < 0.001). children less than 12 months of age had a lower incidence of acute diarrheal diseases during the months they were being breast-fed than children that were fed with formula during the same period (1.22 vs. 3.06 episodes per 12 child months, respectively; p < 0.001). enteropathogens were isolated in 40% of diarrheal episodes in which stool cultures were obtained. the identification rates of the various enteropathogens were: diarrheagenic escherichia coli, 11%; shigella spp., 10%; giardia lamblia, 10%; salmonella spp., 4%; staphylococcus aureus, 3%; campylobacter jejuni, 1%. potential interventions against acute diarrhea in this  set up of a high standard of living rural community are education of caretakers and parents on hygienic practices that can prevent transmission of pathogens among the young children and encouraging mothers to breast-feed their children.

TI  == enterocecocolitis associated with escherichia coli and campylobacter-like organisms in a hamster (mesocricetus auratus) colony.
AB  == sporadic diarrhea and weight loss were observed in a breeding colony of syrian hamsters during a 2-year period. thirteen adult hamsters with diarrhea, anorexia, and weight loss were examined. histologic lesions consisted of diffuse nonsuppurative enterocecocolitis and multifocal epithelial proliferation in the cecum and colon. goblet cell hyperplasia was extensive in the colonic mucosa of many hamsters. the hamsters in this colony had not been treated with antibiotics  nor was clostridium difficile isolated from any of the hamsters. in contrast to typical proliferative ileitis in hamsters, most hamsters involved in this outbreak were mature adults rather than weanlings, and lesions were predominantly inflammatory rather than proliferative and involved small intestine, cecum, and colon rather than ileum. the isolation of beta-hemolytic escherichia coli and demonstration of campylobacter-like organisms by transmission electron microscopy and warthin-starry staining suggest that these two agents were involved in the pathogenesis of this disease. further studies, however, are needed to investigate the pathogenesis of this enteric syndrome in hamsters.

TI  == monitoring of selected bacteria and fungi in sand and sea water along the tel aviv coast.
AB  == monitoring sand and sea water of the mediterranean tel aviv beaches during 1989-1991 for bacterial quality showed varying data and no correlation between standard bacteria parameters (sbp) and potential pathogenic bacteria (ppb). an exceptional feature was observed in 1989 when faecal coliforms including escherichia coli and faecal streptococcus were less in sand than in sea water. these results may be attributed to the low turbulent activity of the sea in 1989, particularly in summer, compared with the next two years. in 1990 the number of sbp and ppb was always higher in sand than in sea water. the most frequent micro-organisms isolated from sand were e. coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and candida albicans. intensive engineering work and the construction of a chlorinator for sewage probably caused a dramatic drop in the number of sbp and ppb in sea water and sand during 1990-1991 on some beaches. campylobacter jejuni  was isolated from sand, and may be considered a possible hazard factor for enteritis in the population bathing at these beaches.

TI  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli: another cause of acute and chronic diarrhoea  in england?
AB  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli (eaggec) has been found to be associated with  acute and persistent diarrhoea in children in developing countries. its clinical  significance in developed countries has not been examined in much detail. in a survey of faecal samples from children with diarrhoea presenting to a children's  hospital in east london between august and december 1988, eaggec strains were isolated in 8 of 297 (2.7%) consecutive stool samples collected from 289 children and in 5 of 34 typed e. coli isolates during 1988. of the 13 children found to be excreting eaggec, 8 had acute diarrhoea and 5 had chronic diarrhoea of more than  14 days' duration; 5 children had mixed infections. compared to other organisms found during the same period, eaggec were isolated as frequently as many other better-known pathogens such as enteropathogenic e. coli, campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, giardia lamblia, and cryptosporidium. we conclude that eaggec may be an important pathogen in developed countries.

TI  == mechanisms of quinolone resistance.
AB  == two mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones are known: (i) alteration of the molecular target of quinolone action-dna gyrase, and (ii) reduction of the quinolone accumulation. mutations altering the n-terminus of the gyrase a subunit, especially those around residues ser83 and asp87, significantly reduce the susceptibilities towards all quinolones, while alterations of the gyrase b subunit are rarely found and are of minor importance. reduced drug accumulation is associated with alterations of the outer membrane protein profile in gram-negative bacteria. such mutations include the mara locus in escherichia coli and result in low level resistance towards quinolones and unrelated drugs. increased activity of naturally existing efflux systems, such as the transmembrane protein nora of staphylococci, may also lead to reduced accumulation in gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. clinical fluoroquinolone resistance is rarely found in intrinsically highly susceptible organisms such as enterobacteriaceae and involves a combination of at least two mutations. in contrast, species with moderate intrinsic susceptibility such as campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus require only one mutation to become clinically resistant. as a consequence development of resistance during therapy may result from acquisition of already resistant strains in the case of susceptible species, and selection of mutants in the case  of less susceptible species.

TI  == evidence for the presence of a receptor for the cytolethal distending toxin (cldt) of campylobacter jejuni on cho and hela cell membranes and development of  a receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of cldt.
AB  == using ligand blotting, it was found that partially purified cytolethal distending toxin prepared from an enterotoxigenic strain of campylobacter jejuni, bound to two peptides of molecular masses of approximately 59 kda and 45 kda and to a single peptide of 59 kda in protein blots prepared from hela and cho cell membranes, respectively. in contrast, labile toxin of escherichia coli and cholera toxin bound to a single peptide of the same molecular mass (15 kda) on protein blots prepared from both cho and hela cell crude membranes resolved by gel electrophoresis. this banding pattern was identical using sds-solubilized membrane, with or without heat treatment, but no band was obtained when reduced (treatment with 2-mercaptoethanol) samples were used for the gel electrophoresis. the differences between receptors of cytolethal distending toxin and cholera toxin/labile toxin were exploited to develop a receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of cytolethal distending toxin which involved the consecutive addition of either solubilized cho or hela membranes, antigen and antibody. this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay consistently detected crude cytolethal distending toxin diluted up to 16-fold. the receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for detection of cytolethal distending toxin developed in this study is a suitable alternative assay which can be performed easily in laboratories with minimal facilities and, more importantly, the results are available within a few hours as compared to times of up to 5 days in the conventional tissue culture detection of cytolethal distending toxin.

AB  == the deduced amino acid sequence of campylobacter jejuni tet(o), cloned in escherichia coli, has shown that it contains the five highly conserved sequences  of the gtp-binding domain found in other gtpases. asn-128 belongs to the g4 motif of such a domain and is involved in hydrogen bonding with the guanine ring of the nucleotide. substitution of asn-128 by 11 other amino acids resulted in a decrease in tetracycline resistance, indicating that tetracycline resistance conferred by tet(o) is related to gtp binding. the effect of the mutations on the gtp-binding domain is discussed with the ef-tu-gdp complex as a model.

TI  == diarrhoeal disease: current concepts and future challenges. molecular biological  approaches to the epidemiology of diarrhoeal diseases in developing countries.
AB  == diarrhoea in developing countries is caused by an increasingly long list of bacterial, viral, and parasitic pathogens with rotavirus, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, campylobacter, shigella, and salmonella heading the list. using methods to detect most of the known enteropathogens, one or more enteropathogen(s) is isolated in two-thirds of diarrhoeal illnesses in the developing world. many of these enteropathogens are also frequently isolated from children without diarrhoea. an aetiologic agent is more frequently isolated from  cases of invasive diarrhoea than from those with secretory diarrhoea. deoxyribonucleic acid probes have proved very useful in detecting pathogens such  as enterotoxigenic (etec), enteroinvasive (eiec), and enteropathogenic e. coli (epec), but have not yet proved to be particularly rapid or less expensive. molecular biology has proved useful in epidemiological studies as a means of strain identification. plasmids were initially used as convenient markers and proved useful in identifying epidemic strains of bacteria. other molecular markers, such as ribotyping, are accurate enough to be used as taxonomic tools.

AB  == the heat-labile toxin (hlt) of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) is a potent oral adjuvant. we determined whether the etec hlt could be mixed with killed campylobacter to induce an immune response protective upon subsequent challenge with live pathogens. mice were immunized orally three times with 10(9)  sonicated campylobacter with or without 25 micrograms of etec hlt, and humoral immune responses in intestinal lavage fluids measured by elisa. whereas 10(9) live bacteria induced strong intestinal iga responses, killed bacteria did not unless etec hlt was also added. the magnitude of the antibody response was dependent on the amount of antigen given. the etec hlt given with bacteria also induced a potent cross-reaction with cholera toxin. the latter had an adjuvant effect in mice similar to that of etec hlt. protection against colonization was studied in mice and rabbits. in contrast to non-immune animals, those given live  organisms or sonicated cells mixed with etec hlt quickly cleared homologous, but  not heterologous, lior serotypes of campylobacter upon challenge. these data show for the first time that etec hlt can potentiate an immune response to killed campylobacter that promotes a rapid clearance of live pathogens from the intestine.

AB  == most strains of helicobacter pylori are naturally competent for uptake of chromosomal dna. transformation frequencies for streptomycin resistance or rifampicin resistance markers ranged from 1 x 10(-4) to 1 x 10(-3) per viable cell using a plate transformation procedure. transformation of a metronidazole resistance marker (mtrr) was demonstrated when either a laboratory-derived mutant or a mtrr clinical isolate were used as the source of donor dna. mtrr was transformed at a frequency of 3 x 10(-5) per viable cell. all h. pylori strains tested produce large amounts of dnaase, which may reduce dna available for transformation. four h. pylori plasmids were isolated. dna fragments from h. pylori plasmids were deleted or rearranged when cloned in puc19 and propagated in escherichia coli dh5 alpha. an h. pylori plasmid, puoa26 which contained a chloramphenicol resistance determinant from campylobacter coli, was constructed in h. pylori. this plasmid could be successfully introduced by natural transformation only into h. pylori recipients which contained a homologous resident plasmid. transformation of puoa26 into plasmid-free cells of h. pylori was achieved by electroporation. transformation frequencies were 1 x 10(-4) transformants per viable cell when plasmid dna was isolated from the same strain; however, introduction of puoa26 dna derived from h. pylori 8091 into a different  h. pylori strain, nctc 11639, resulted in transformation at much lower frequencies (< or = 1 x 10(-7) per viable cell).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

AB  == the campylobacter fetus surface-layer (s-layer) proteins mediate both complement  resistance and antigenic variation in mammalian hosts. wild-type strain 23d possesses the sapa gene, which encodes a 97-kda s-layer protein, and several sapa homologs are present in both wild-type and mutant strains. here we report that a  cloned silent gene (sapa1) in c. fetus can express a functional full-length s-layer protein in escherichia coli. analysis of sapa and sapa1 and partial analysis of sapa2 indicate that a block of approximately 600 bp beginning upstream and continuing into the open reading frames is completely conserved, and then the sequences diverge completely, but immediately downstream of each gene is another conserved 50-bp sequence. conservation of sapa1 among strains, the presence of a putative chi (recbcd recognition) site upstream of sapa, sapa1, and sapa2, and the sequence identities of the sapa genes suggest a system for homologous recombination. comparison of the wild-type strain (23d) with a phenotypic variant (23d-11) indicates that variation is associated with removal of the divergent region of sapa from the expression locus and exchange with a corresponding region from a sapa homolog. we propose that site-specific reciprocal recombination between sapa homologs leads to expression of divergent s-layer proteins as one of the mechanisms that c. fetus uses for antigenic variation.

TI  == early child health in lahore, pakistan: viii. microbiology.
AB  == the causative agents of acute diarrhoea were investigated in children under the age of five years from 1985-1991 in three socio-economically different areas in lahore, pakistan. the aim was to determine the frequencies of the most common enteropathogens in faeces. the total isolation rate was 73.4%; two thirds (53.5%) were of bacterial and one third (19.9%) of viral origin. etec-lt (23.4%), rota virus (19.9%), epec (15%) and campylobacter (12%) were the single most frequent pathogens in all age groups and areas of living. the positivity of campylobacter  increased from 1.6% to 12% after the change of isolation technique. shigella was  isolated significantly (p > 0.001) more in children over than under one year of age. the incidence of bacterial infections was high during all seasons, while in  certain years rota virus was relatively low in the summer compared to the cooler  months. the prevalence of etec-lt diarrhoea was higher in the periurban slum as compared to the village and the urban slum. the study is the first of its kind in pakistan, and the results are similar to other comparable studies. it is thus possible to establish a well functioning and reliable microbiological laboratory  in developing countries in a setting with restricted trained personnel and material resources.

TI  == indirect evidence for two distinct mechanisms of dna cleavage at the orit of rp4  during conjugation.
AB  == mobilization of a potential campylobacter shuttle vector from escherichia coli k-12 into c. hyointestinalis generated a small plasmid harboring a hybrid orit nick region. this is presumed to have resulted from the cleavage and religation of the orit of rp4 and the putative nick region of the shuttle vector. these data imply that two distinct dna cleavage reactions occur at the orit site of rp4 during conjugal transfer.

TI  == application of polymerase chain reaction for the correlation of salmonella serovars recovered from greyhound feces with their diet.
AB  == the polymerase chain reaction was employed to correlate salmonella serovars isolated from fecal material of greyhounds suffering from gastroenteritis with those isolated from the diet fed to the greyhounds prior to onset of diarrhea. kennels around the abilene, kansas, area were contacted and supplied with materials needed to collect a portion of the diet each day. with the onset of diarrhea, the kennels were instructed to ship the fecal material and diet from the previous 10 days to the laboratory for testing. forty-one fecal samples and corresponding diets were screened for salmonella, clostridium perfringens, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus intermedius, and pathogenic (piliated) escherichia coli by direct culture using standard procedures. the fecal material was also screened for coronavirus and parvovirus using electron microscopy. thirty-five "normal" fecal samples were screened for all of the above mentioned microorganisms as a control. in addition, the fecal material was screened for e. coli verotoxins i and ii and clostridial enterotoxins. a total of 61 salmonella isolates were recovered from the 41 samples of feces and diet submitted for testing; 31 were recovered from the feces and 30 from the diet. four salmonella isolates were recovered from the normal fecal samples. results obtained by pcr, plasmid profiles, antigenic analysis, and antibiogram profiles indicated that 16 of the 31 isolates recovered from the fecal material were the same strain as that recovered from the diet.

TI  == common diarrhea pathogens and the risk of dehydration in young children with acute watery diarrhea: a case-control study.
AB  == the role of common diarrheal pathogens in dehydration was examined in children with acute watery diarrhea who attended the treatment center of the international centre for diarrhoeal disease research, bangladesh, in dhaka. two hundred sixty-nine children with moderate or severe dehydration were matched with 700 children with no dehydration. vibrio cholerae o1 infections were 5.5 times more likely to be associated with dehydration than in cases without this agent. no significant association could be found between the presence of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. campylobacter jejuni, or rotavirus infection and dehydration. these results were obtained after simultaneously controlling for age, lack of oral rehydration therapy (ort) at home, protein energy malnutrition, withdrawal of breast-feeding during diarrhea at home, poor housing, longer duration of diarrhea at home, and delay in reaching the treatment center. the cholera isolation rate was only 4.5% and thus explains only a small proportion of the cases of dehydration. in cholera-endemic areas, a strategy to prevent dehydration in small children is needed to ensure correct use of ort at home, prompt referral, and the use of a suitable antibiotic when cholera is clinically suspected.

TI  == cloning and characterization of the gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase gene of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == the gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase gene, proa, of campylobacter jejuni was isolated from a recombinant pbr322 clone. a hindiii fragment of the insert containing the gene was subcloned into puc19 and sequenced in both orientations.  the deduced amino acid sequence of gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase (ec 1.2.1.41) of c. jejuni exhibits 36.4% identity to that of escherichia coli and 36.0% identity to serratia marcescens. two highly conserved regions in the amino  acid sequence were identified from the alignment of the three available gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase gene sequences. the gene was expressed from its own promoter and the transcription start site was mapped. the proline biosynthetic genes of c. jejuni are not located tandemly and thus differ in this  respect from those of e. coli and s. marcescens, where gamma-glutamyl phosphate reductase and gamma-glutamyl kinase (prob) are located in a single operon.

TI  == the campylobacter sigma 54 flab flagellin promoter is subject to environmental regulation.
AB  == the complex flagellum of campylobacter coli vc167 is encoded by two tandemly oriented flagellin genes which are transcribed as two discrete transcriptional units from two different classes of promoters. the flab gene, which encodes the minor flab filament protein, is controlled by a sigma 54 promoter. a transcriptional fusion between a promoterless chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat) reporter gene cartridge and c. coli vc167 dna carrying flab transcription and translation signals, including the typical position -13-to-(-)26 flab sigma 54 consensus promoter sequence, was constructed. when carried on plasmid pric1013, the sigma 54-cat fusion expressed chloramphenicol resistance in escherichia coli, and cat production was affected by the ph of the growth medium, the composition of the growth atmosphere, and the growth temperature, with production being significantly higher at 42 degrees c. a conjugative suicide vector, pric1028, containing the sigma 54-cat fusion was constructed and used to  recombine the flab-cat fusion back into the c. coli chromosome in the correct position with respect to the flaa gene and its transcription terminator. cat production from the flab sigma 54 promoter in the c. coli transconjugant vc167-t2/28-1 was shown to peak at mid-log phase and to be modulated by growth medium ph, growth temperature, and the concentration of certain inorganic salts and divalent cations in the growth medium. under growth conditions which promoted elevated flab sigma 54 promoter activity, a flaa flab+ mutant of c. coli vc167 produced increased amounts of flab flagellar protein and displayed increased motility.

TI  == occult blood and fecal leukocytes as screening tests in childhood infectious diarrhea: an old problem revisited.
AB  == during a 24-month period 446 children with diarrhea and 16 controls had examination of their stools for leukocytes and for occult blood. fecal leukocytes were found in 36, 16 and 18% of children with salmonella-shigella-campylobacter,  rotavirus or enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, or cryptosporidial diarrhea, respectively. similarly 43, 39 and 38% of these groups, respectively, as well as  13% of controls had occult blood. notably 70% of 10 shigella cases had fecal leukocytes. in 166 children with mixed pathogens leukocytes were seen in 27 and 8% of children with salmonella-shigella-campylobacter or noninvasive pathogen, respectively. likewise 44 and 18% of these groups had occult blood. agreement between both tests being positive was poor, the highest result being 50% for shigella. dysentery combined with both tests positive was associated with 15 (88%) cases of invasive agents present in stool cultures, and combination of dysentery with fecal leukocytes was associated with 21 (72%) cases of invasive agents recovered. the results of these tests should be interpreted in the context of the clinical situation. a combined clinical-epidemiologic and screening tests-based approach to infectious diarrhea of childhood is suggested.

TI  == prevalence of gastrointestinal infection among international travellers returning to canada.
AB  == objective: to describe the prevalence of parasitic and bacterial gastrointestinal infection (excluding enterotoxigenic escherichia coli) among international travellers attending the international travel clinic at the university of calgary. methods: data were abstracted from the records of the first visit after  travel of all persons making a post travel visit between january 1, 1986 and march 31, 1990. results: data were available for 886 first visits (840 persons).  stools were submitted by 692 travellers. the frequency of stool submission varied by the duration of travel abroad, and the frequency of diarrhea either during or  after the trip was greater among those who had submitted a stool specimen. the prevalence of stools positive for ova, parasites or pathogenic bacteria was 41.2%. when only pathogenic organisms were considered, the prevalence of infection was 19.4%. the most commonly isolated pathogenic parasites were dientamoeba fragilis, giardia lamblia, and entamoeba histolytica. the most commonly isolated bacteria were campylobacter species and salmonella species. conclusions: although the prevalence of positive stool screens among returned travellers in this population was high, only about one-fifth of persons tested were positive for pathogens.

AB  == lipopolysaccharide of helicobacter pylori was tested for its mitogenicity and for its ability to stimulate cytokine release in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (pbmc) of healthy and h. pylori-infected blood donors. mitogenicity in pbmc induced by h. pylori lps was similar to that induced by campylobacter jejuni lipopolysaccharide, but lower than that induced by escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide in the h. pylori negative blood donor group. furthermore, h. pylori lps was able to induce tumour necrosis factor (tnf) interleukin 1 (il-1) and interleukin 6 (il-6) secretion of pbmc. compared with the ability of c. jejuni and e. coli lipopolysaccharides to stimulate cytokine release, h. pylori lipopolysaccharide induced a significantly lower tnf and il-1 secretion of pbmc than the other tested bacterial lipopolysaccharides. similar amounts of il-6 release were obtained by stimulation of pbmc with h. pylori and c. jejuni lipopolysaccharides, whereas a higher il-6 release was measured by stimulation with e. coli lipopolysaccharide. the results of this study suggest that h. pylori lipopolysaccharide has a lower immunological activity than lipopolysaccharides of other intestinal bacteria. this is probably due to its unusual acylation and phosphorylation pattern of lipid a.

AB  == this study was carried out in 1991 to learn the behavior of enteropathogenic agents causing acute diarrheal diseases in cuba. 30 children, admitted in hospitals or seen in outpatient services for acute diarrheal diseases, were selected in each province taking into account that they had not received antibiotic or chemotherapy treatments in the previous 72 hours. feces samples were taken from all patients for virological, bacteriological, and parasitological studies, and results were sent to the pedro kouri institute of tropical medicine. data were processed in dbase iii. higher positivity indices were attained in the winter months. the causative agents most frequently found were: rotavirus (8.2%); entamoeba histolytica (6.1%); and salmonella (4.2%). escherichia coli, campylobacter, shigella and rotavirus showed higher indices in  winter. shigella flexneri and shigella sonnei predominated. salmonella serogroups d, b, and c, and enteropathogenic escherichia coli 0119 and 026 subsets were the  most frequently found.

TI  == the epidemiology of bacterial resistance to quinolones.
AB  == the new fluoroquinolones have been in use for nearly 10 years in the treatment of community- and nosocomially-acquired infections. resistant clones may be selected during therapy and disseminate if favourable epidemiological conditions prevail.  resistance to the fluoroquinolones is still rare in common pathogens with 97 to 100% of strains remaining susceptible. resistance has been reported in methicillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni/coli, salmonella, shigella and escherichia coli. among nosocomial pathogens, the incidence of fluoroquinolone resistance varies between bacterial species, countries and periods of study, and is dependent on local epidemiological factors and antibiotic policies. the highest incidence of resistance is observed in serratia and acinetobacter spp., and particularly in methicillin-resistant s. aureus. surveillance programmes are needed to follow up trends in resistance to the fluoroquinolones and their possible association with clinical failures.

TI  == [bacterial pathogens in diarrhea: demonstration of verotoxin-producing escherichia coli using the polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == in 23% of 576 diarrhea patients we were able to demonstrate putative bacterial pathogens. not included in this number is clostridium difficile which was found in 8 of 48 (8.3%) specimens analyzed. in addition to salmonella (8.2%), campylobacter (6.0%), aeromonas (2.7%), shigella (1.9%) and yersinia (0.8%) we identified verotoxin-producing escherichia coli (vtec) in 10 patients (1.9%). vtec were found as frequently as shigella (occurring exclusively in patients returning from the tropics) and we propose that vtec should be routinely assayed  in patients with travel-associated diarrhea as well as in those with diarrhea presumably acquired in switzerland. established methods for identification of e.  coli o157:h7, which include screening for sorbitol-negative enterobacteriaceae and agglutination, are laborious and insensitive (only 1 of 10 patients with proven vtec infection positive). the other 9 patients were identified by means of the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). in 7 of these 9 patients we were able to isolate a verotoxigenic strain following a positive pcr result by screening large numbers of colonies. none of them belonged to the o157:h7 serogroup and, in addition, all were sorbitol-positive. the polymerase chain reaction as performed  in this study is easy to use, is applicable to large numbers of specimens, and can be regarded as the method of choice for demonstration of vtec in the clinical diagnostic laboratory.

TI  == antibacterial spectrum of lactoferricin b, a potent bactericidal peptide derived  from the n-terminal region of bovine lactoferrin.
AB  == a physiologically diverse range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria was found to be susceptible to inhibition and inactivation by lactoferricin b, a peptide produced by gastric pepsin digestion of bovine lactoferrin. the list of susceptible organisms includes escherichia coli, salmonella enteritidis, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus vulgaris, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, campylobacter jejuni, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans, corynebacterium diphtheriae, listeria monocytogenes and clostridium perfringens.  concentrations of lactoferricin b required to cause complete inhibition of growth varied within the range of 0.3 to 150 micrograms/ml, depending on the strain and  the culture medium used. the peptide showed activity against e. coli o111 over the range of ph 5.5 to 7.5 and was most effective under slightly alkaline conditions. its antibacterial effectiveness was reduced in the presence of na+, k+, mg2+ or ca2+ ions, or in the presence of various buffer salts. lactoferricin  b was lethal, causing a rapid loss of colony-forming capability in most of the species tested. pseudomonas fluorescens, enterococcus faecalis and bifidobacterium bifidum strains were highly resistant to this peptide.

TI  == degenerate pcr primers for the amplification of fragments from genes encoding response regulators from a range of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == many bacterial responses to environmental stimuli are mediated by response regulators which coordinately regulate genes involved in particular adaptive responses. degenerate oligonucleotide primers were used to amplify by the polymerase chain reaction (pcr), fragments from genes encoding eleven novel response regulators. sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that phob, phop  and creb gene fragments had been amplified from yersinia enterocolitica and yersinia pseudotuberculosis, and that a creb sequence had been amplified from campylobacter jejuni. four amplified fragments from c. jejuni, listeria monocytogenes, mycobacterium tuberculosis and escherichia coli clearly came from  response regulator genes, but were not closely related to any of the known genes. mutagenesis of the newly identified genes should allow us to determine their function and the genes under their control.

TI  == mononuclear cell response in the liver of mice infected with hepatotoxigenic campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == intragastric inoculation with hepatotoxigenic strains of campylobacter jejuni led to the death of mice during the late phase of infection. histological study disclosed a massive infiltration of mononuclear cells in the liver, mimicking intrahepatic hypersensitivity. neither enterotoxigenic nor enteroinvasive escherichia coli induced such a lesion. however, the same histopathological change was induced by injecting the hepatotoxic factor of hepatotoxigenic c. jejuni intravenously on two occasions separated by 14 days. neither a single injection of an increased dose of the hepatotoxic factor nor two injections, the  second of which was heat-inactivated, induced this change. pre-treatment with rabbit antibody to the hepatotoxic factor inhibited the development of the hepatic lesion. these results suggest that c. jejuni-induced hepatic lesions in mice may be caused, at least in part, by the active moiety of the hepatotoxic factor. the possible mechanisms by which the toxic factor induces hepatitis as a  consequence of hypersensitivity are discussed in relation to guillain-barre syndrome and reiter's syndrome associated with c. jejuni enteritis.

TI  == cloning and genetic characterization of a helicobacter pylori flagellin gene.
AB  == helicobacter pylori produces polar sheathed flagella, which are believed to be essential for the bacterial colonization of the human gastric mucosa. here we report on the cloning and genetic characterization of a h. pylori gene encoding the subunit of the flagellar filament, the flagellin. screening of a genomic library of h. pylori with an oligonucleotide probe derived from the n-terminal amino acid sequence of purified flagellin resulted in a recombinant plasmid clone carrying the flagellin-encoding gene flaa on a 9.3 kb bg/ii fragment. the nucleotide sequence of flaa revealed an open reading frame of 1530 nucleotides, encoding a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 53.2 kda, which is similar  in size with the purified flagellin protein in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. sequence alignment of h. pylori flagellin (flaa) with other bacterial flagellins demonstrates a high degree of similarity in the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal regions, including those of the closely related genus campylobacter (56% overall identity with campylobacter coli flaa),  but little homology in the central domain. southern hybridizations of chromosomal dna with flaa-specific probes did not reveal the presence of additional homologous flagellin genes in h. pylori. sequence analysis of the flaa flanking regions and mapping of the flaa mrna start site by a primer extension experiment  indicated that transcription of the gene is under the control of a sigma 28-specific promoter sequence in h. pylori. the region upstream of the flaa promoter is subject to local dna modification, resulting in the masking of two out of three closely linked hindiii restriction sites in the chromosome of strain 898-1. escherichia coli strains harbouring the recombinant plasmid did not produce full-length flagellin and data obtained with flaa fusion proteins using an e. coli plasmid expression system suggest that a distinct nucleotide sequence  in the gene interferes with productive translation of this protein in e. coli.

TI  == impact of zinc supplementation on intestinal permeability in bangladeshi children with acute diarrhoea and persistent diarrhoea syndrome.
AB  == zinc has been shown to enhance intestinal mucosal repair in patients suffering from acrodermatitis enteropathica; but the impact on mucosal integrity during acute (ad) or persistent (pd) diarrhoea is unknown. one hundred eleven children with ad and 190 with pd aged between 3 and 24 months received, randomly and blind to the investigators, either an elemental zinc supplement of 5 mg/kg body wt/day  or placebo in multivitamin syrup for 2 weeks while intestinal permeability and, biochemical and anthropometric markers were serially monitored. the permeability  test was administered as an oral dose of 5 g lactulose/l g mannitol in a 20-ml solution followed by a 5-h urine collection. the ratio of the urinary probe sugars was correlated to clinical, biochemical, and microbiological parameters. at presentation, lactulose excretion was increased and mannitol excretion decreased in both ad and pd as compared with age-matched asymptomatic children. the lactulose/mannitol ratio (l/m) was higher in subjects with mucosal invasive pathogens (rotavirus and enteropathogenic escherichia coli) compared with children excreting vibrio cholera and enterotoxigenic e. coli. two-week zinc supplementation significantly reduced lactulose excretion in both ad and pd, whereas the change in mannitol excretion and l/m was similar between study groups in both studies. changes in lactulose excretion were significantly influenced by  zinc supplementation in children with e. coli, shigella sp., and campylobacter jejuni stool isolates. the greatest reduction in total lactulose excretion was seen in supplemented children who on presentation were lighter (wt/age less than  80%), thinner (wt/ht less than 85%), and undernourished [middle upper arm circumference (muac) less than 12.5 cm] or with hypozincaemia (less than 14 mumol/l).(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == specific detection of campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli by using polymerase chain reaction.
AB  == development of a routine detection assay for campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli in clinical specimens was undertaken by using the polymerase chain reaction (pcr). an oligonucleotide primer pair from a conserved 5' region of the flaa gene of c. coli vc167 was used to amplify a 450-bp region by pcr. the primer pair specifically detected 4 strains of c. coli and 47 strains of c. jejuni; but it did not detect strains of campylobacter fetus, campylobacter lari, campylobacter upsaliensis, campylobacter cryaerophila, campylobacter butzleri, campylobacter hyointestinalis, wolinella recta, helicobacter pylori, escherichia  coli, shigella spp., salmonella spp., vibrio cholerae, citrobacter freundii, or aeromonas spp. by using a nonradioactively labeled probe internal to the pcr product, the assay could detect as little as 0.0062 pg of purified c. coli dna, or the equivalent of four bacteria. in stools seeded with c. coli cells, the probe could detect between 30 and 60 bacteria per pcr assay. the assay was also successfully used to detect c. coli in rectal swab specimens from experimentally  infected rabbits and c. jejuni in human stool samples.

TI  == in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of am-1155, a new 6-fluoro-8-methoxy quinolone.
AB  == am-1155 is a new quinolone with a wide spectrum of antibacterial activity against various bacteria including anaerobes and mycoplasma pneumoniae. am-1155 was 2- to 16-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin against staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant strains, staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis; its mics for 90% of strains  tested were 0.10 to 0.78 micrograms/ml. the activity of am-1155 was comparable to that of ciprofloxacin against members of the family enterobacteriaceae, branhamella catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria gonorrhoeae, but was fourfold less than that of ciprofloxacin against pseudomonas aeruginosa. against xanthomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and campylobacter jejuni, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin. at a concentration of 1.56 micrograms/ml, am-1155 inhibited 90% of bacteroides fragilis strains tested; its activity was 8- to 10-fold higher than those of ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. development of resistance to am-1155 in s. aureus and s. epidermidis occurred at a lower frequency than did that to ciprofloxacin after eight transfers in the presence of drug. in the oral treatment of mouse systemic infections, am-1155 was four- to eightfold more effective than ciprofloxacin against gram-positive cocci and was as active as ciprofloxacin against gram-negative rods. the efficacy of an oral or a subcutaneous dose of am-1155 was two- to fivefold greater than that of ofloxacin. against experimental pneumonia with klebsiella pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa, am-1155 was two- to fourfold more active than ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin. am-1155 also had good efficacy against mouse ascending urinary tract infections with escherichia coli and p. aeruginosa. these results suggest that am-1155 may be a potent antibacterial agent applicable to various infections.

TI  == use of polymerase chain reaction for detection of toxigenic vibrio cholerae o1 strains from the latin american cholera epidemic.
AB  == in january 1991, an outbreak of cholera started in peru and spread throughout most of latin america within 8 months. as of march 1992, over 450,000 cases and approximately 4,000 deaths have been reported to the pan american health organization. the causative organism is toxigenic vibrio cholerae o1 of the el tor biotype and is distinct from the u.s. gulf coast strains. a polymerase chain  reaction (pcr) that amplifies a 564-bp fragment of the cholera toxin a subunit gene (ctxa) was used to identify toxigenic v. cholerae o1 strains. a total of 150 v. cholerae o1 isolates were tested. they were of unknown toxin status, were associated with recent outbreaks, and were isolated from patients, food, and water. one hundred forty isolates were found to be toxigenic both by pcr and the  routine diagnostic enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. thirty-eight known toxigenic strains isolated worldwide from 1921 to 1991 were also positive in the  pcr. a collection of 18 nontoxigenic v. cholerae o1 strains, 35 escherichia coli  heat-labile-enterotoxin-i-producing strains, 26 campylobacter strains, and 8 strains of aeromonas hydrophila, previously reported to produce cholera toxin-like toxin, were all negative in the ctxa pcr. we conclude that this pcr is a diagnostic method that specifically detects toxin genes in v. cholerae o1 strains in a reference laboratory. it is more rapid and less cumbersome than other diagnostic methods for detection of toxicity in these strains.

AB  == the production of toxins by 79 strains of campylobacter jejuni isolated in costa  rica from children with campylobacter-induced diarrhoea (44 strains) and from chickens (35 strains) was studied. an enterotoxic effect giving a rounding of mouse adrenocortical tumour (y1) cells, which could be neutralised with antitoxin against escherichia coli heat-labile enterotoxin, was detected in supernates from 16 (62%) of 26 strains from children with watery diarrhoea, in 5 (28%) of 18 strains from children with bloody or inflammatory diarrhoea, and in 12 (34%) of the 35 strains from chickens. cytotoxic effects in human lung fibroblasts (mrc-5), african green monkey kidney (vero) cells and human cervical carcinoma (hela) cells were observed in none of the 26 strains from children with watery diarrhoea, in 2 (11%) of the 18 strains from children with bloody or inflammatory diarrhoea, and in 6 (17%) of the 35 strains from chickens. the simultaneous production of enterotoxin and cytotoxin was detected in four strains. the cytotoxic effect, which was most prominent in cells freshly seeded at a low density, appeared as a lethal rounding of the cells. fibroblasts were more sensitive than epithelial cells. the effects of the supernates were inactivated by heating at 100 degrees c for 10 min and decreased after 1 week at 4 degrees c. the production of toxins was lost after storage of the strains for one year at -70 degrees c.

TI  == variation in antigenicity and molecular weight of campylobacter coli vc167 flagellin in different genetic backgrounds.
AB  == campylobacter coli vc167 has been shown to undergo a reversible flagellar antigenic variation between antigenic type 1 (t1) and antigenic type 2 (t2). vc167 contains two flagellin genes, and the products of both genes are incorporated into a complex flagellar filament in both antigenic types. although  there are only minor amino acid changes in the flagellins expressed by t1 and t2  cells, the two antigenic types of flagellins can be distinguished by differences  in apparent m(r) on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and by immunoreactivity with t1-specific (lah1) or t2-specific (lah2) antiserum. the isolation of stable variants of t1 and t2 has allowed for the transfer via natural transformation of the flagellin structural genes from the t1 background into the t2 background and from the t2 background into the t1 background. in addition, the flagellin genes from vc167 t1 and t2 have been transferred into strains of campylobacter jejuni. the results indicate that the observed antigenic variations of vc167 flagellins are dependent on the host genetic background and independent of the primary amino acid sequence. these data provide evidence that  posttranslational modifications are responsible for the antigenic variation seen  in vc167 flagellins.

TI  == survival of bacterial enteric pathogens in traditional fermented foods.
AB  == the survival of strains of bacterial enteric pathogens was investigated in two traditional fermented foods (mahewu and sour porridge) and in unfermented porridge. the foods were inoculated with cell suspensions of salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, aeromonas species and pathogenic escherichia coli which  had a final concentration of 10(6)-10(7) cfu/ml of food. none of the strains of aeromonas and campylobacter were detected in mahewu and sour porridge 20 min after inoculation. the salmonellas were not found 4 h after inoculation in either fermented foods but the shigellas and pathogenic e. coli strains were more tolerant to the low ph of the fermented foods. some of the shigellas and pathogenic e. coli strains survived for 24 h after inoculation but showed a sharp decrease in numbers. all the strains of the enteric pathogens survived for 24 h in the unfermented porridge and increased in the numbers except for campylobacters, the numbers of which declined. these results suggest that the traditional fermented foods have bacteriostatic and bactericidal properties and are unlikely to play a major role in the transmission of bacterial enteric pathogens.

TI  == expression of helicobacter pylori urease genes in escherichia coli grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions.
AB  == helicobacter pylori produces a potent urease that is believed to play a role in the pathogenesis of gastroduodenal diseases. four genes (urea, ureb, urec, and ured) were previously shown to be able to achieve a urease-positive phenotype when introduced into campylobacter jejuni, whereas escherichia coli cells harboring these genes did not express urease activity (a. labigne, v. cussac, and p. courcoux, j. bacteriol. 173:1920-1931, 1991). results that demonstrate that h. pylori urease genes could be expressed in e. coli are presented in this article.  this expression was found to be dependent on the presence of accessory urease genes hitherto undescribed. subcloning of the recombinant cosmid pill585, followed by restriction analyses, resulted in the cloning of an 11.2-kb fragment  (pill753) which allowed the detection of urease activity (0.83 +/- 0.39 mumol of  urea hydrolyzed per min/mg of protein) in e. coli cells grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions. transposon mutagenesis of pill753 with mini-tn3-km  permitted the identification of a 3.3-kb dna region that, in addition to the 4.2-kb region previously identified, was essential for urease activity in e. coli. sequencing of the 3.3-kb dna fragment revealed the presence of five open reading frames encoding polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 20,701 (uree), 28,530 (uref), 21,744 (ureg), 29,650 (ureh), and 19,819 (urei). of the nine urease genes identified, urea, ureb, uref, ureg, and ureh were shown to be required for urease expression in e. coli, as mutations in each of these genes led to negative phenotypes. the urec, ured, and urei genes are not essential for  urease expression in e. coli, although they belong to the urease gene cluster. the predicted uree and ureg polypeptides exhibit some degree of similarity with the respective polypeptides encoded by the accessory genes of the klebsiella aerogenes urease operon (33 and 92% similarity, respectively, taking into account conservative amino acid changes), whereas this homology was restricted to a domain of the uref polypeptide (44% similarity for the last 73 amino acids of the k. aerogenes uref polypeptide). with the exception of the two urea and ureb structural polypeptides of the enzyme, no role can as yet be assigned to the nine proteins encoded by the h. pylori urease gene cluster.

AB  == little information concerning the genome of either campylobacter jejuni or campylobacter coli is available. therefore, we constructed genomic maps of c. jejuni ua580 and c. coli ua417 by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the genome sizes of c. jejuni and c. coli strains are approximately 1.7 mb, as determined by sali and smai digestion (n. chang and d. e. taylor, j. bacteriol. 172:5211-5217, 1990). the genomes of both species are represented by single circular dna molecules, and maps were constructed by partial restriction digestion and hybridization of dna fragments extracted from low-melting-point agarose gels. homologous dna probes, encoding the flaab and 16s rrna genes, as well as heterologous dna probes from escherichia coli, bacillus subtilis, and haemophilus influenzae, were used to identify the locations of particular genes.  c. jejuni and c. coli contain three copies of the 16s and 23s rrna genes. however, they are not located together within an operon but show a distinct split in at least two of their three copies. the positions of various housekeeping genes in both c. jejuni ua580 and c. coli ua417 have been determined, and there appears to be some conservation of gene arrangement between the two species.

TI  == [development of genetic and molecular approaches for the diagnosis and the study  of the pathogenic power of helicobacter pylori, agent of inflammatory gastric diseases].
AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a small gram negative bacillus, recently discovered, found in the stomach of patients with active chronic gastritis and duodenal ulcers. production of a potent urease has been described as a trait common to all h. pylori so far isolated. to clarify the role of urease in the pathogenic process, as well as to engineer genetic tools useful for the diagnosis of h. pylori, we cloned the genes responsible for urease activity. a genomic library was constructed in escherichia coli (e. coli) from the chromosomal dna of the h. pylori stain 85p using a shuttle cosmid vector that we constructed in vitro capable of replicating both in e. coli and campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni). the genes responsible for the urease biosynthesis were cloned into e. coli host, then mobilized into c. jejuni where they were expressed. at least six  different genes were shown to be required for the expression of the synthesis of  an active enzyme: these genes belong to the same cluster and are regulated at the transcriptional level. the two genes encoding the two subunits of the urease enzyme were identified and sequenced; the products of these genes were compared to be other bacterial ureases. the genetic approach allowed to determine the amino-acid sequence of the most immunogenic antigens of h. pylori. in addition, it provides us with genetic tools: a 294-base pairs (bp) dna fragment internal to one of the urease genes, was shown to be specific of h. pylori strains.(abstract  truncated at 250 words)

TI  == cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi.
AB  == the specificity of serological tests for lyme borreliosis is impaired by cross-reacting antibodies. in order to select antigens for more specific tests, specific and cross-reactive proteins of borrelia burgdorferi must be identified.  therefore, to analyze cross reactions of borrelia burgdorferi with other bacteria, rabbit immune sera against heterologous bacteria (borrelia hermsii, treponema pallidum, treponema phagedenis, leptospira interrogans (serogroup grippotyphosa), neisseria meningitidis, haemophilus influenzae, yersinia enterocolitica (serotypes o3 and o9), campylobacter jejuni, listeria monocytogenes o1, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri and legionella micdadei) were examined by western  blot using borrelia burgdorferi as antigen. broad cross reactivity was shown for  borrelia proteins of the 60-75 kda range. other broadly cross-reacting proteins were at the level of p40, p33 and two proteins in the range of 20 kda. some of the cross reactions were eliminated by absorption of the sera with treponema phagedenis. the absorbed antibodies were directed mainly against bands at the level of p33 and bands of the 60 to 75 kda range. showing the lowest potential for cross reactivity, p100, p41, ospa and pc seem to be the most suitable antigens for serodiagnosis. in contrast to p100 and ospa, however, p41 and pc showed cross reactivity with immune sera against bacteria not belonging to the genus borrelia.

TI  == diarrheal disease in cambodian children at a camp in thailand.
AB  == the etiology of acute diarrhea (less than or equal to 3 days duration) and persistent diarrhea (greater than or equal to 14 days duration) was determined in cambodian children under age 5 years in a refugee camp on the thai-cambodian border between may and october 1989; potential risk factors associated with persistent diarrhea were examined in an age-matched case-control study. specimens collected from children and environmental sources were examined by standard microbiologic methods; escherichia coli isolates were examined for hybridization  with specific dna probes and in tissue culture adherence assays. the same bacterial, viral, or parasitic agents were identified in 79 children with persistent diarrhea and in 408 children with acute diarrhea. only one of nine children with persistent diarrhea excreted the same organism, cryptosporidium, for that extended period. the most important risk factors identified for developing persistent diarrhea were living with other young children (odds ratio  (or) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (cl) 1.2-3.4) and being undernourished (or =  2.6, 95% cl 1.2-5.7). persistent diarrhea in children in this camp was associated with several different agents rather than persistent infections with a single organism.

TI  == treatment of traveler's diarrhea with ciprofloxacin and loperamide.
AB  == to determine the efficacy of loperamide given with long- and short-course quinolone therapy for treating traveler's diarrhea, 142 us military personnel were randomized to receive a single 750-mg dose of ciprofloxacin with placebo, 750 mg of ciprofloxacin with loperamide, or a 3-day course of 500 mg of ciprofloxacin twice daily with loperamide. culture of pretreatment stool specimens revealed campylobacters (41%), salmonellae (18%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec, 6%), and shigellae (4%). of the participants, 87% completely recovered within 72 h of entry. total duration of illness did not differ significantly among the three treatment groups, but patients in the 3-day  ciprofloxacin plus loperamide group reported a lower cumulative number of liquid  bowel movements at 48 and 72 h after enrollment compared with patients in the single-dose ciprofloxacin plus placebo group (1.8 vs. 3.6, p = .01; 2.0 vs. 3.9,  p = .01). while not delivering a remarkable therapeutic advantage, loperamide appears to be safe for treatment of non-etec causes of traveler's diarrhea. two of 54 patients with campylobacter enteritis had a clinical relapse after treatment that was associated with development of ciprofloxacin resistance.

TI  == existing and emerging foodborne diseases.
AB  == foodborne diseases, i.e. illnesses due to contaminated food, are one of the most  widespread problems of the contemporary world. they are toxic or infectious by nature and are caused by agents which enter the body through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. these agents can be chemical like pesticide residues  and toxic metals or biological like pathogenic microorganisms. foods contaminated by biological agents are, however, the major cause of foodborne disease. data recorded in different countries show that the incidence of some of these diseases has increased dramatically over the past few years, but because of under-reporting the data are of limited value and cannot be compared between countries. in most countries, individual cases of illness are usually not reported. a sentinel surveillance system, started as a pilot study in the netherlands, was shown to be feasible for the registration of some foodborne infections. based on this study, it can be estimated that each year salmonella and campylobacter cause respectively about 12,000 and 25,000 cases of acute enteritis per million. case-control studies clearly implicate poultry products as an important source of acute enteritis. new developments in food production and changing trends in food consumption lead to the emergence of new hazards. additionally, because the population is aging and there has been an increase in the number of individuals with underlying diseases, the state of public health is deteriorating. campylobacter, salmonella enteritidis and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli are examples of microorganisms that have the opportunity to increase as a consequence of intensive husbandry. listeria monocytogenes is an example of an organism that causes disease in immunosuppressed individuals.

TI  == reattachment of surface array proteins to campylobacter fetus cells.
AB  == campylobacter fetus strains may be of serotype a or b, a property associated with lipopolysaccharide (lps) structure. wild-type c. fetus strains contain surface array proteins (s-layer proteins) that may be extracted in water and that are critical for virulence. to explore the relationship of s-layer proteins to other  surface components, we reattached s-layer proteins onto s- template cells generated by spontaneous mutation or by serial extractions of s+ cells with water. reattachment occurred in the presence of divalent (ba2+, ca2+, co2+, and mg2+) but not monovalent (h+, nh4+, na+, k+) or trivalent (fe3+) cations. the 98-, 125-, 127-, and 149-kda s-layer proteins isolated from strains containing type a lps (type a s-layer protein) all reattached to s- template cells containing type a lps (type a cells) but not to type b cells. the 98-kda type b s-layer protein reattached to sap- type b cells but not to type a cells. recombinant 98-kda type a s-layer protein and its truncated amino-terminal 65- and 50-kda segments expressed in escherichia coli retained the full and specific  determinants for attachment. s-layer protein and purified homologous but not heterologous lps in the presence of calcium produced insoluble complexes. by quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, the s-layer protein copy number per c. fetus cell was determined to be approximately 10(5). in conclusion, c. fetus cells are encapsulated by a large number of s-layer protein molecules which may be specifically attached through the n-terminal half of the molecule to lps in the presence of divalent cations.

TI  == lysyl-trna synthetase gene of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == we report the cloning and complete nucleotide sequence of the campylobacter jejuni lysyl-trna synthetase gene (lyss). the c. jejuni lyss gene sequence shows  high homology to the two escherichia coli lysyl-trna synthetase genes, lyss and lysu. the campylobacter lysyl-trna synthetase protein (lysrs) shows 47.9 and 46.6% sequence identity to the e. coli enzymes encoded by the lyss and lysu genes, respectively. the lysrs encoded by the c. jejuni gene is a polypeptide of  501 amino acids with a deduced molecular weight of 57,867. the enzyme is active in e. coli. the gene is expressed from its own promoter, and the transcription start site has been mapped. the carboxyl-terminal codon of the c. jejuni lyss gene overlaps by 1 bp with the met initiation codon of the glya gene, which has been shown to have a promoter which is functional in e. coli (v.l. chan and h.l.  bingham, gene 101:51-58, 1991). c. jejuni, unlike e. coli, has only one lysyl-trna synthetase gene.

TI  == seasonal variation in etiology of travelers' diarrhea. finnish-moroccan study group.
AB  == the etiology of travelers' diarrhea was studied in 579 adult finnish tourists participating in two packaged tours to morocco in the winter (n = 233) and fall (n = 346) of 1989. a research team accompanied the travelers, and a laboratory for enteric pathogens was established in agadir. at least one pathogen was found  in 62% of the 60 diarrhea cases in winter and in 58% of the 111 diarrhea cases in fall. multiple pathogens were found less often in winter (8%) than in fall (21%,  p less than .05). campylobacter strains were the leading cause of travelers' diarrhea in winter, found alone or with other pathogens in 28% of the cases (but  in only 7% in fall), whereas enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) was the most common pathogen in fall, present in 32% of the cases (8% in winter). both differences are highly significant (p less than .001). salmonella enterica was almost as common as etec in fall (25% of diarrhea cases) but rare in winter (10%, p less than .05). thus, the etiology of travelers' diarrhea varied according to the season in the same tourist destination. this finding has relevance to both antimicrobial treatment and prophylaxis.

TI  == reduction of campylobacter jejuni colonization of chicks by cecum-colonizing bacteria producing anti-c. jejuni metabolites.
AB  == cecum-colonizing bacteria were isolated from campylobacter jejuni-free white leghorn (gallus domesticus) laying hens and screened for the ability to produce anti-c. jejuni metabolites. nine isolates were obtained that possessed this characteristic. the peroral administration of the nine isolates as a mixture (ca. 10(9) per chick) to 1-day-old chicks was followed 1 week later by peroral inoculation of campylobacter jejuni (ca. 10(9) per chick) to determine if the cecal isolates could protect chicks from colonization by campylobacters. the nine-strain mixture of cecal bacteria provided from 41 to 85% protection from c.  jejuni colonization. the protective bacteria were reduced to a mixture of three strains on the basis of their ability to utilize mucin as a sole substrate for growth. these strains included klebsiella pneumoniae 23, citrobacter diversus 22, and escherichia coli (o13:h-) 25. four feeding trials with this three-strain mixture provided from 43 to 100% (average, 78%) protection from c. jejuni colonization. the dominant cecal bacterium of chicks treated with the three-strain mixture was consistently e. coli o13:h-. similarly, three trials with only e. coli 25 used as the protective bacterium resulted in 49 to 72% (average, 59%) protection from c. jejuni colonization, with e. coli o13:h- being  the dominant cecal bacterium in all cases. although not completely effective, e.  coli 25 substantially reduced the incidence of c. jejuni colonization of chicks.  for all trials, fewer c. jejuni were present in the ceca of colonized chicks receiving the protective bacteria before exposure to c. jejuni than in chicks receiving only c. jejuni.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == [multicausal infectious respiratory tract disease of young fattening turkeys].
AB  == the outbreak of the disease occurred in a large multiple-age farm with about 50,000 meat turkeys, where groups of 6-8000 one-day-old birds were stalled up every 14 days. all the turkey poults housed were affected mostly in the 1.-3. week of the life. the respiratory disease spread rapidly within the flocks and were characterised clinically by inclination of huddle, ruffled feathers, anorexia, stunted growth, swelling of the infraorbital sinus and nasal discharge. the clinical apparent disease lasted 3 to 4 weeks on the average in the affected  flocks and were associated with a mortality from 7-20 percent. the main pathoanatomical lesions were catarrhal-fibrinopurulent rhinitis, sinusitis, tracheitis, bronchopneumonia and air sacculitis as well as atrophy of the thymus. fibrinous adhesive peri- and epicarditis, perihepatitis, miliary necrotic foci in the liver and diarrhea have been found less frequently. the results of cultural and serological examinations of moribund and dead turkey poults of 6 different flocks indicate that bordetella avium and chlamydia psittaci are the primary inciting agents of the respiratory disease. however, the following severe course  of the disease were mainly caused by concurrent infections with klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, escherichia coli and pseudomonas fluorescens. in some cases coccidiosis with lesions in ceca were additionally diagnosed. campylobacter jejuni could be always isolated culturally from the liquid cecal content of diseased birds.

TI  == alcohol dehydrogenase mediated acetaldehyde production by helicobacter pylori--a  possible mechanism behind gastric injury.
AB  == two standard helicobacter pylori strains showed significant cytosolic alcohol dehydrogenase activity and produced considerable amounts of acetaldehyde when incubated with an ethanol containing solution in vitro. the alcohol dehydrogenase activity of the helicobacter pylori strains was almost as high as that found in klebsiella pneumoniae and far greater than that in escherichia coli or campylobacter jejuni. the amount of acetaldehyde produced by cytosol prepared from helicobacter pylori exceeded that by any of the other bacteria studied. the  bacterial production of acetaldehyde--a highly toxic and reactive substance--could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of helicobacter pylori associated gastric injury and increased risk of gastric cancer.

TI  == cloning of campylobacter jejuni genes required for leucine biosynthesis, and construction of leu-negative mutant of c. jejuni by shuttle transposon mutagenesis.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is a gram-negative pathogen responsible for diarrhoeal diseases in humans. to date, very little is known about the genetic organization  and molecular biology of this microorganism. the cosmid vector phc79 was used to  construct a genomic library from the total genomic dna of c. jejuni strain c31 in escherichia coli and recombinant cosmids capable of complementing the auxotrophic defect in leucine biosynthesis of e. coli hb101 were identified. three of 400 clones tested were found to be capable of complementing the nutritional defect of e. coli hb101 as well as those of independent leub mutants of e. coli strains. these results indicated that the cloned genes responsible for leucine complementation encoded an enzyme analogous to the beta-isopropylmalate dehydrogenase specified by the leub gene in e. coli strains. the sizes of the recombinant cosmids which became stabilized in e. coli cells ranged from 12.9 to  15.4 kb compared to the expected, originally packaged, 45- to 50-kb molecules, attesting to major rearrangements occurring in this background. the recombinant plasmid pill547 was shown to carry genes that were analogous to the leub gene and also to the leuc and leud genes of e. coli. the gene required for leub complementation was subcloned on a 1.6-kb restriction fragment and was mapped more precisely by insertional mutagenesis using as transposon a newly constructed (minitn3-km) element engineered to mutagenize campylobacter genes. the leub gene  of c. jejuni was shown to be expressed from its own promoter in e. coli cells. in e. coli minicells, the cloned insert encoded a polypeptide with an apparent molecular weight of 40 kda. a leucine auxotrophic mutant of c. jejuni strain c31  was constructed in vitro by allelic exchange, replacing the original copy of the  leucine gene by an allele mutated by the insertion of the kanamycin transposable  element.

AB  == the study was undertaken to better understand the role of total gut transit time  (tgtt) on the absorption of nutrients in patients with persistent diarrhea. twenty-six boys aged 3-18 months with persistent diarrhea and 25 age-matched healthy controls were studied. their tgtt was measured with charcoal markers during their treatment with a diet made up with rice powder soya oil, glucose, and egg white. coefficients of absorption of nutrients were estimated in a 72-h balance study. the median tgtts in patients and controls were 5 and 11.6 h, respectively. among the patients, the tgt correlated significantly with absorption of total energy (p less than 0.01), absorption of fat (p less than 0.01), stool frequency (p less than 0.01), and stool weight during the 1st 24 h (p less than 0.01). coefficients of absorption of energy, fat, and carbohydrate were significantly different among the patients above or below the median transit time (5 h). none of these relationships was present among the healthy controls. the tgtt was negatively associated with the duration of clinical recovery. the results of this study suggested that intestinal transit time is an important factor for absorption of nutrients that may influence clinical recovery in patients with persistent diarrhea.

AB  == a survey of 77 normal and 326 diarrhoeic foals in britain and ireland from 1987 to 1989 revealed a significantly higher prevalence of group a rotaviruses and aeromonas hydrophila in diarrhoeic foals. the prevalence of cryptosporidia, potentially pathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica and clostridium  perfringens was similar in normal or diarrhoeic foals. rotaviruses had a similar  prevalence in all age groups of scouring foals up to three months of age, with an overall prevalence of 37 per cent among diarrhoeic foals. the number of cases of  diarrhoea varied considerably from year to year, but in all three years of the survey rotavirus was a significant pathogen. a comparison of diagnostic tests for rotavirus in the faeces showed electron microscopy (em) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (page) to have similar sensitivity. the rotazyme elisa test kit was found to have the same sensitivity as a combination of em and page. a. hydrophila had an overall prevalence of 9 per cent among diarrhoeic foals, although its prevalence was higher in some age groups. a. hydrophila has not been established previously as a significant enteric pathogen in foals. other putative pathogens found at very low prevalence were coronavirus, the putative picobirnavirus, campylobacter spp. and salmonella spp. no evidence was found of synergistic effects between rotavirus, cryptosporidia and potentially pathogenic  e. coli. neither coccidia nor non-group a rotaviruses were found in any of the samples examined.

TI  == survival of escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni in untreated and filtered lake water.
AB  == the survival of campylobacter jejuni and escherichia coli in lake water was studied using viable counts. escherichia coli survived better than c. jejuni in all the test conditions studied. both the species survived better in filtered than in untreated water. this suggests that predation and/or competition for nutrients affect the survival of both the species in an aquatic environment. campylobacter jejuni survived less well in filtered autoclaved water and in 0.9%  nacl than in filtered water without autoclaving. the lack of some essential nutrients, which may be degraded by autoclaving, might explain these results.

TI  == inhibition of acid secretion from parietal cells by non-human-infecting helicobacter species: a factor in colonization of gastric mucosa?
AB  == helicobacter pylori has been shown to produce a protein that inhibits acid secretion from parietal cells. we have examined other non-human-infecting helicobacter species for this property by measuring the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine into rabbit parietal cells as an indirect assessment of acid secretion. helicobacter felis and an isolate from a rhesus monkey were shown to inhibit acid secretion. isolates of helicobacter mustelae gave variable responses. whole bacteria and cell-free sonicates impaired the uptake of [14c]aminopyrine. we also tested other bacteria, including escherichia coli, proteus vulgaris, klebsiella oxytoca, and campylobacter jejuni. as whole organisms, these control bacteria had little effect on acid secretion, but sonicates caused pronounced inhibition that was partially heat labile. pronase treatment of h. pylori destroyed its inhibitory effect. these results suggest that most helicobacter species, but not all isolates, are able to inhibit acid secretion from rabbit parietal cells. this property may be a factor in the establishment of long-term infection by these species.

TI  == survival and injury of escherichia coli, campylobacter jejuni, and yersinia enterocolitica in stream water.
AB  == experiments were done to describe the survival and injury of three strains each of enteropathogenic escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, and campylobacter  jejuni in agricultural surface water. bacterial suspensions within membrane diffusion chambers were immersed in two large vessels of stream water that were held at 6 and 16 degrees c and changed daily. the results of daily plate counts,  using selective and nonselective media, revealed some variation among strains and genera. injury increased rapidly in all of the bacteria examined during an initial 4-day period of population stability. bacterial persistence was generally prolonged at 6 degrees c, while the occurrence of injury was directly related to  temperature. however, both survival and injury in c. jejuni were less dependent on temperature, while y. enterocolitica displayed the greatest survival at both 6 and 16 degrees c. these results suggest that surface water in the temperate zone  might serve as a persistent vehicle for the transmission of these enteropathogenic bacteria between animals and humans.

AB  == during 1984-1989, 655 diarrheic and 287 nondiarrheic stool specimens from adult u.s. citizens living in lima, peru were tested for presence of bacterial enteropathogens. frequencies of isolation among diarrheic specimens were: shigella 9.8%; campylobacter 6.1%; enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) 6.0%;  plesiomonas 2.0%; salmonella 1.4%; and vibrio 0.6%. isolates recovered from non-diarrheic stools were: shigella 4.5%; campylobacter 2.1%; salmonella 1.0%; etec 0.7%; plesiomonas 0.7%; and vibrio 0.3%. aeromonas, an unproven cause of diarrhea, was isolated from 9.2% of cases and 3.5% of controls. disease occurrence was strongly associated with isolation of shigella, etec, campylobacter, or aeromonas (p less than or equal to 0.01). during the 6-year period of study, shifts in the dominant phenotypes of shigella and campylobacter  occurred which may have important implications for vaccine development and intervention strategies.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of ofloxacin against recent isolates from patients with community-acquired infections].
AB  == in order to survey antibacterial activities of ofloxacin (oflx) against 1,440 bacterial strains isolated from patients with community-acquired infections in 1987 and 1990, minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of the drug as well as those of other new quinolones and oral cephems were determined. the following conclusions were reached. 1. comparison of the mic distribution for strains isolated in 1987 with those in 1990 suggested a tendency toward an increase in the frequency of oflx-resistant isolates with the passage of time of staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, citrobacter spp., klebsiella ssp., enterobacter spp., proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., and acinetobacter calcoaceticus. most common elevations of mic  values against these bacteria were observed in mic80 and mic90 values, while no significant alteration was observed in mic50 values. however, mic50's of oflx against serratia marcescens and pseudomonas aeruginosa were relatively high for strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. most of the oflx-resistant strains of s.  aureus seemed to be methicillin-resistant (mrsa). furthermore, mic80 of oflx against coagulase-negative staphylococci was high in strains isolated in both 1987 and 1990. 2. susceptibility of streptococcus spp. was evaluated only in strains isolated in 1990. the results were comparable to those reported by others in the early 1980s. 3. bacteria which showed no or infrequent emergence of oflx-resistant strains even in 1990 were proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria gonorrhoeae, campylobacter spp. and peptostreptococcus spp. 4. recently isolated strains from patients with community-acquired infections showed a tendency toward an increase of the frequency of oflx-resistant strains among many bacteria. however, the bacteria which contained high percentages of oflx-resistant strains except for mrsa were so-called less-virulent bacteria, and in the other bacteria elevations of mic values were only observed in mic80 and mic90. these results suggested that oflx preserved a potent antibacterial activity against bacteria which were major causative pathogens in community-acquired infections.

TI  == seasonal effects on the reported incidence of acute diarrhoeal disease in northeast thailand.
AB  == this paper examines the seasonal variation in the reported incidence of acute diarrhoea for selected areas in the northeast of thailand. charts are presented which show rainfall, temperature and reported incidence of acute diarrhoea for the period 1982 to 1987. incidence of diarrhoea appears to be inversely related to a sharp decrease in temperature around january each year. although rainfall does not appear to have a direct effect on the relative incidence of acute diarrhoea, there is always a consistent reduction during july or august, after the rains have begun. seasonal changes in climate may be indirectly related to other factors which have an important bearing on diarrhoeal disease. rainwater collection is an important water source in this region and the affect this has on water use is discussed in relation to faeco-oral disease transmission.

TI  == enterotoxigenic escherichia coli associated with infant diarrhoea in galicia, north-western spain.
AB  == to assess the role of enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) in infantile diarrhoea, 482 children with diarrhoea and 103 healthy controls, from three localities of galicia, north-western spain, were investigated between 1985 and 1988. rotavirus (37.3%) and salmonella spp. (12.8%) were the most common causal agents, followed by etec (3.9%), campylobacter jejuni (2.3%), shigella spp. (0.9%) and yersinia enterocolitica (0.5%). etec were significantly more frequently isolated from children with diarrhoea who were under 1 month of age (26.5%) than from older diarrhoeic children (2.2%) (p less than 0.001) or from healthy children who were under 1 month of age (0%) (p less than 0.05). among children who harboured etec, five of the nine children under 1 month of age developed diarrhoea in hospital, whereas none of the 10 children over 1 month of  age did so. seventeen etec isolates produced heat-stable enterotoxin (sta) only,  four produced only heat-labile enterotoxin (lt), and two produced both toxins. colonisation factor antigens cfa/i and cfa/ii were detected in 11 (55.0%) of the  20 etec isolates that remained enterotoxigenic after maintenance in the laboratory. most etec isolates belonged to serotypes o153:k-:h45 (nine sta+ cfa/i+ isolates), o27:k-:h7 (three sta+ isolates) or o6:k15:h16 (two lt+ sta+ cfa/ii+ isolates). our results suggest that etec constitute an important cause of neonatal diarrhoea in this part of spain.

AB  == babies, on admission into a neonatal ward at the lagos university teaching hospital, had their rectal swab specimens examined bacteriologically and screened for enteric bacterial pathogens over a one-year-period at two-week intervals. it  was found that on the average there were 3 (9.68%) enteric bacterial pathogens out of an average of 31 admissions at each screening period. the enteric bacterial pathogens isolated included: non-typhoid salmonellae, which accounted for 55 (80.88%) isolates out of the 68 enteric bacterial pathogens, salmonella typhi 2.94%, shigella dysenteriae 2.94%, shigella flexneri 4.41%, s. boydii 1.47%, s. sonnei 1.47%, campylobacter jejuni 1.47% and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) 2.94%. the main clinical conditions associated with those babies in whom the enteric pathogens were isolated included sepsis, prematurity,  neonatal jaundice and tetanus. it is concluded that the enteric bacterial pathogens, even though they were not directly associated with diarrhoeal disease  in the newborns in this study, might have contributed to other illnesses like sepsis and meningitis. it is also noteworthy that the enteric bacterial pathogens isolated sporadically from the babies could have been over-looked in view of the  fact that it is not conventional to search for enteric bacterial pathogens in babies without diarrhoea on admission. rectal swab investigations could provide additional information which might be of epidemiological importance in ill neonates in the clinical settings that prevail in developing countries.

AB  == helicobacter pylori (h. pylori) is a small gram-negative bacillus, recently discovered, found in the stomach of patients with active chronic gastritis and duodenal ulcers. production of a potent urease has been described as a trait common to all h. pylori so far isolated. to clarify the role of urease in the pathogenic process, as well as to engineer genetic tools useful for the diagnosis of h. pylori, we cloned the genes responsible for urease activity. a genomic library was constructed in escherichia coli (e. coli) from the chromosomal dna of the h. pylori strain 85p using a shuttle cosmind vector that we constructed in vitro capable of replicating both in e. coli and campylobacter jejuni (c. jejuni). the genes responsible for the urease biosynthesis were cloned into e. coli host, then mobilized into c. jejuni where they were expressed. at least six  different genes were shown to be required for the expression of the synthesis of  an active enzyme; these genes belong to the same cluster and are regulated at the transcriptional level. the two genes encoding the two subunits of the urease enzyme were identified and sequenced; the products of these genes were compared to the other bacterial ureases. the genetic approach allowed to determine the amino-acid sequence of the most immunogenic antigens of h. pylori. in addition, it provides us with genetic tools: a 294-base pairs (bp) dna fragment internal to one of the urease genes, was shown to be specific of h. pylori strains. this fragment was selectively amplified by polymerase chain reaction (p.c.r.) using two primers designed to target the urease region of all h. pylori isolates present in biological specimen. in addition, p.c.r. followed by direct dna sequencing of the 294-bp amplified product was shown to be useful to identify and to distinguish between different h. pylori isolates.

AB  == this article reviews current recommendations of therapy with antidiarrheal compounds and antimicrobial agents for acute infectious diarrhea in children. in  most infants and children with acute infectious diarrhea, treatment with antidiarrheal compounds is not indicated. many of these compounds interfere with  identification of enteropathogens in stool specimens, and the antimotility class  has an overdose potential. antimicrobial therapy is given to reduce symptoms and  to prevent the spread of infection by decreasing fecal shedding of organisms. although effective therapy is not available for patients with enteric viruses, cryptosporidium, and microsporidium, therapy is useful for children with amebiasis, antimicrobial-associated colitis, cholera, giardiasis, various forms of escherichia coli diarrhea and salmonella disease, isosporiasis, shigellosis, and strongyloidiasis. for several other conditions, antimicrobial therapy is of questionable benefit (infection with campylobacter jejuni or yersinia enterocolitica, intestinal salmonellosis and enterohemorrhagic e. coli infection). compounds such as the fluoroquinolones, which are effective in the treatment of acute infectious diarrhea in adults, are not approved for use in children because of potential side effects. many bacterial, viral, and parasitic  organisms cause acute infectious diarrhea; appropriate antimicrobial therapy requires the accurate, rapid identification of the offending enteropathogen. in children with an underlying illness such as acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, manifestations may be prolonged, severe, and recurrent despite appropriate therapy.

TI  == evaluation of 10 methods to distinguish epidemic-associated campylobacter strains.
AB  == we compared four phenotypic and six genotypic methods for distinguishing campylobacter jejuni strains from animals and humans involved in four epidemics.  based on a comparison with epidemiologic data, the methods that correctly identified all strains in three milkborne outbreaks and one waterborne outbreak were heat-stable and heat-labile serotyping; multilocus enzyme electrophoresis (mee); dna restriction endonuclease analysis with bglii, xhoi, pvuii, or psti; and southern blot and hybridization of pvuii- and psti-digested dna with escherichia coli 16s and 23s rrna (ribotyping). biotyping, phage typing, plasmid  analysis, and probing of bglii and xhoi dna digests with c. jejuni 16s rrna genes failed to correctly separate one or more strains. mee, restriction endonuclease analysis, and ribotyping were the most sensitive methods and identified nine types among the 22 strains. these methods were also capable of further distinguishing strains within the same serotype. data from mee were also analyzed to calculate genetic relatedness among strains. serotyping was the most discriminating phenotypic method, with eight and seven types distinguished by the heat-stable and heat-labile methods, respectively. mee and ribotyping had several advantages over the other methods because they measure relatively stable and significant chromosomal differences and are applicable to other species and genera. these methods, however, are complex and not easily quantified; they are currently limited to specialized laboratories. when antisera are available, serotyping appears to be an effective and more practical approach to the identification of epidemic-related strains.

TI  == use of quinolones in the treatment of gastrointestinal infections.
AB  == bacterial enteropathogens are responsible for between 40% and 80% of diarrheal illness depending upon the age of the persons affected and geographic areas where illness occurs. antibacterial agents will shorten the illness associated with enteric infection caused by enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, shigella spp. and campylobacter jejuni. these drugs also are effective in the therapy of certain clinical conditions (presumably because they are due to the same agents) which are characterized by moderate to severe diarrhea with one or more of the following: high fever, dysentery (passage of bloody mucoid stools), or high leukocyte counts in stools. antimicrobial agents are also effective in the therapy of travelers' diarrhea. the quinolone drugs have several advantages in the management of bacterial diarrhea where strains causing illness from nearly all regions of the world will show general susceptibility: high concentrations are achieved in the intestinal lumen following oral administration and resistance development is unusual. a quinolone probably represents the optimal agent for therapy of bacterial diarrhea in adults in areas where trimethoprim-resistant enteric pathogens are common.

TI  == epidemiologic aspects of shigellosis and other causes of dysentery in thailand.
AB  == nearly 20% of children seen in the outpatient department of children's hospital in bangkok, thailand, for diarrheal disease had bloody diarrhea. shigella species and enteroinvasive escherichia coli--isolated from 13% and 2% of children with diarrhea, respectively--were the most frequent causes of bloody diarrhea. campylobacter species and nontyphoidal salmonella species were also isolated frequently but were much less often associated with bloody diarrhea. shigella species were rarely isolated from patients who did not have diarrhea, while campylobacter and salmonella species were isolated frequently from well children. none of the species isolated always caused bloody diarrhea. studies on infection  with campylobacter suggest that natural immunity may prevent bloody diarrhea and  in fact may eventually prevent all disease due to this organism. studies of endemic shigella flexneri and epidemic shigella dysenteriae 1 in thailand have shown that immunity may also explain an age-related decrease in rates of s. flexneri infection but not in rates of s. dysenteriae 1 isolation.

TI  == relationship between the clostridium perfringens catq gene product and chloramphenicol acetyltransferases from other bacteria.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the clostridium perfringens chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (cat)-encoding resistance determinant, catq, was determined. an open reading frame encoding a protein of 219 amino acids with a molecular weight  of 26,014 was identified. although catq was expressed constitutively, sequences similar in structure to those found upstream of inducible cat genes were observed. the catq gene was distinct from the c. perfringens catp determinant. the deduced catq monomer had considerable amino acid sequence conservation compared with catp (53% similarity) and other known cat proteins (39 to 53%). phylogenetic analysis revealed that the catq monomer was as closely related to cat proteins from staphylococcus aureus and campylobacter coli as it was to cat monomers from the clostridia.

TI  == shuttle cloning and nucleotide sequences of helicobacter pylori genes responsible for urease activity.
AB  == production of a potent urease has been described as a trait common to all helicobacter pylori so far isolated from humans with gastritis as well as peptic  ulceration. the detection of urease activity from genes cloned from h. pylori was made possible by use of a shuttle cosmid vector, allowing replication and movement of cloned dna sequences in either escherichia coli or campylobacter jejuni. with this approach, we cloned a 44-kb portion of h. pylori chromosomal dna which did not lead to urease activity when introduced into e. coli but permitted, although temporarily, biosynthesis of the urease when transferred by conjugation to c. jejuni. the recombinant cosmid (pill585) expressing the urease  phenotype was mapped and used to subclone an 8.1-kb fragment (pill590) able to confer the same property to c. jejuni recipient strains. by a series of deletions and subclonings, the urease genes were localized to a 4.2-kb region of dna and were sequenced by the dideoxy method. four open reading frames were found, encoding polypeptides with predicted molecular weights of 26,500 (urea), 61,600 (ureb), 49,200 (urec), and 15,000 (ured). the predicted urea and ureb polypeptides correspond to the two structural subunits of the urease enzyme; they exhibit a high degree of homology with the three structural subunits of proteus mirabilis (56% exact matches) as well as with the unique structural subunit of jack bean urease (55.5% exact matches). although the ured-predicted polypeptide has domains relevant to transmembrane proteins, no precise role could be attributed to this polypeptide or to the urec polypeptide, which both mapped to a dna sequence shown to be required to confer urease activity to a c. jejuni recipient strain.

TI  == freeze-substitution of gram-negative eubacteria: general cell morphology and envelope profiles.
AB  == freeze-substitution was performed on strains of escherichia coli, pasteurella multocida, campylobacter fetus, vibrio cholerae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas putida, aeromonas salmonicida, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus pleuropneumoniae, caulobacter crescentus, and leptothrix discophora with a substitution medium composed of 2% osmium tetroxide and 2% uranyl acetate in anhydrous acetone. a thick periplasmic gel ranging from 10.6 to 14.3 nm in width  was displayed in e. coli k-12, k30, and his 1 (a k-12 derivative containing the k30 capsule genes), p. multocida, c. fetus, p. putida, a. salmonicida, h. pleuropneumoniae, and p. mirabilis. the other bacteria possessed translucent periplasms in which a thinner peptidoglycan layer was seen. capsular polysaccharide, evident as electron-dense fibers radiating outward perpendicular  to the cell surface, was observed on e. coli k30 and his 1 and p. mirabilis cells. a more random arrangement of fibers forming a netlike structure was apparent surrounding cells of h. pleuropneumoniae. for the first time a capsule,  distinct from the sheath, was observed on l. discophora. in all instances, capsular polysaccharide was visualized in the absence of stabilizing agents such  as homologous antisera or ruthenium red. other distinct envelope structures were  observed external to the outer membrane including the sheath of l. discophora and the s layers of a. salmonicida a450 and c. crescentus cb15a. we believe that the  freeze-substitution technique presents a more accurate image of the structural organization of these cells and that it has revealed complex ultrastructural relationships between cell envelope constituents previously difficult to visualize by more conventional means of preparation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of microgard against food spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms.
AB  == microgard, a commercially available fermented milk product containing antimicrobial metabolites, was a potent inhibitor for gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas, salmonella, and yersinia when 1% concentration was incorporated into agar media. gram-positive bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, and listeria monocytogenes were insensitive to microgard. kluyveromyces marxianus, an unidentified black yeast, and penicillium expansum were partially suppressed, whereas aspergillus niger and a yogurt spoilage yeast were tolerant to 5% microgard. optimum activity of microgard was at ph 5.3 and below; the concentration that gave complete inhibition depended upon the number of bacteria  present as well as the genus tested. blood agar base reversed the antagonistic activity of microgard against pseudomonas putida compared with plate count agar.

TI  == localization of immunogenic regions on the flagellin proteins of campylobacter jejuni 81116.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to localize antigenic regions on the flagellin protein of campylobacter jejuni 81116. this strain has two flagellin genes, flaa  and flab, which are 95% identical; only flaa seems to be expressed in motile c. jejuni 81116 cells. fragments of flaa and flab were cloned in the bacterial expression vector pex, and the expression products were incubated with flagellin-specific antibodies. monoclonal antibodies to broadly cross-reactive epitopes recognized fragments that are located in the termini (cf16 and cf17) and in the center (cf15) of both flagellin a and b proteins. most of the serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies (cf1, cf2, cd3, cf4, and cf13) reacted with only the center of flagellin a in an area where flagellin a and b differ in  6 amino acid residues. the epitopes in this area were further characterized by competitive binding experiments. the charge and molecular weight microheterogeneity of flagellin, as determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, were unrelated to the expression of both flagellin genes or parts thereof.

TI  == effects of high hydrostatic pressure on characteristics of pork slurries and inactivation of microorganisms associated with meat and meat products.
AB  == pork slurries inoculated with various test microorganisms were prepared and subjected to high hydrostatic pressure at 1000 to 6000 atm for 10 min at 25 degrees c to examine for the pressure effects on characteristics of the slurries  and the inactivation of the microorganisms associated with meat and meat products. pressure treatment at higher than 3000 atm caused coagulation and discoloration of the pork slurries. harder and more white coagulants were obtained by increasing the pressure. pressure treatment at 3000 to 6000 atm killed all the microorganisms tested by more than 6-log colony-forming units (cfu)/g except bacillus cereus spores. gram-negative microorganisms were more labile to pressure than gram-positive ones. campylobacter jejuni, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were inactivated at pressures higher than 3000 atm; escherichia coli, saccharomyces cerevisiae and candida utilis at pressures higher than 4000 atm; micrococcus luteus, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus faecalis at 6000 atm. only less than one-log cfu/g of b. cereus spores were inactivated at 6000 atm. ultraviolet absorption spectra and acridine orange staining suggested that e. coli became permeable and leaked cytoplasmic rna at lower pressure than s. aureus. from the present findings, the authors propose high hydrostatic pressure treatment as a promising means of preparing wholesome meat and meat products.

TI  == travelers' diarrhea among united states military personnel during joint american-egyptian armed forces exercises in cairo, egypt.
AB  == a study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a united states military population on deployment in cairo, egypt, during july and august 1987. acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. a possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (17% st-producers, 13% lt-producers, and 3% lt/st-producers); shigella (9%); campylobacter spp. (2%); salmonella (2%); and vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included aeromonas hydrophila group, plesiomonas shigelloides, and bacillus cereus. yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive e. coli, intoxications by clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not  found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. a survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in u.s. military personnel deployed to egypt.

TI  == the use of plasmid profiles and nucleic acid probes in epidemiologic investigations of foodborne, diarrheal diseases.
AB  == the application of nucleic acid analyses to investigations of infectious disease  outbreaks has resulted in useful molecular strain markers that distinguish the epidemic clone of a particular pathogen and help identify specific vehicles of infection. we have successfully used plasmid profile analysis, restriction endonuclease digestion of plasmid and whole-cell dnas, and nucleic acid hybridization to investigate recent outbreaks of foodborne diarrheal illness. plasmid analysis has been important in identifying epidemic strains of salmonella enteritidis and escherichia coli o157:h7. in a culture survey of s. enteritidis isolates from humans and a variety of animals, including chickens and chicken eggs, we identified 16 distinct plasmid profiles and used these to differentiate  strains, especially within commonly occurring phage types (colindale 8 and 13a).  hindiii digests of plasmid dna were useful in distinguishing plasmids of similar  mass but dissimilar enzyme target sequences; they clearly distinguished s. enteritidis strains causing systemic infections in children in parts of africa from u.s. isolates. investigations of outbreaks of hemorrhagic colitis have also  been assisted by plasmid analysis. restriction endonuclease digests of whole-cell dna and southern blot analysis, hybridizing with e. coli 16s and 23s rrna (ribotyping), have been effective subtyping techniques, especially for plasmidless isolates of campylobacter jejuni. in five outbreaks of c. jejuni infections, ribotyping of pvuii and clai digests distinguished individual epidemic strains within one commonly occurring c. jejuni serotype (penner 2, lior 4). preliminary data show that ribotyping of ncoi digests can also distinguish individual epidemic strains of e. coli o157:h7 and may provide a more stable marker than plasmid profiles. specific dna probes derived from cloned virulence genes of e. coli have been invaluable in epidemic investigations and surveys. using colony hybridization, we found in one survey of stool specimens from 174 dairy cattle that 11% of animals were asymptomatically carrying shiga-like toxigenic e. coli other than o157:h7. we also found that newly synthesized oligonucleotide probes for the shiga-like toxins i and ii agreed 100% with cloned gene probes in a study of 613 e. coli strains. future studies of these organisms  will include the use of additional synthetic oligonucleotides as primers to amplify the toxin genes directly in patient and animal specimens by the polymerase chain reaction. there is a continuing and expanding role for molecular approaches in epidemiological investigations. the dna methods described above are not based on the often complex expression of phenotypic characteristics, and, unlike sensitive and specific techniques such as phage typing, a single method can be used to study a variety of gram-positive and negative bacterial pathogens.

TI  == production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody specific for enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11.
AB  == a monoclonal antibody (mab 4e8c12) specific for escherichia coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 was produced by immunizing balb/c mice with a rough strain of e. coli o157:h7. the antibody reacted strongly by a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with each of 36 strains of e. coli o157:h7. no cross-reactivity was observed with strains of salmonella spp., yersinia enterocolitica, shigella dysenteriae, proteus spp., escherichia hermanii, klebsiella pneumoniae, campylobacter jejuni, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., enterobacter cloacae, hafnia alvei, aeromonas hydrophila, and all except five strains of e. coli other than serotype o157:h7 (including strains of serotype o157 but not h7). the e. coli strains (all of serotype o26:h11) that reacted with the antibody were enterohemorrhagic e. coli (ehec) that were isolated from patients with hemolytic  uremic syndrome or hemorrhagic colitis and produced verotoxin similar to that of  e. coli o157:h7. mab 4e8c12 belongs to the subclass immunoglobulin g2a and has a  kappa light chain. tricine-sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of outer membrane proteins of e. coli of different serotypes followed by western immunoblot analysis revealed that mab 4e8c12 reacted specifically with two proteins of ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11 with apparent molecular weights of 5,000 to 6,000. these proteins appeared to be  markers specific for ehec strains of serotypes o157:h7 and o26:h11. this mab, because of its specificity, may be a useful reagent of an immunoassay for the rapid detection of these types of ehec isolates in clinical and food specimens.

TI  == isolation and biochemical and molecular analyses of a species-specific protein antigen from the gastric pathogen helicobacter pylori.
AB  == a protein of mr 26,000 which was present in large quantities in extracts of cells of helicobacter pylori was purified to homogeneity by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by gel filtration and reversed-phase chromatography or anion-exchange chromatography. the protein appeared to be associated with the soluble fraction of the cell, and antibodies raised against the protein were reactive with whole-cell lysates of a variety of h. pylori strains in a simple immunodot blot assay. this reaction was species specific. protein sequence determination of the amino terminus and internal cyanogen bromide fragments and amino acid composition analysis were performed. an oligonucleotide derived from these data was used to clone a fragment encoding most of the coding sequence. expression in escherichia coli was dependent on vector promoters. the dna sequence of the fragment was determined. dna probes derived from the cloned fragment hybridized to genomic dna of all h. pylori strains tested, but not to dnas of helicobacter mustelae, wolinella succinogenes, various campylobacter species, and a panel of gram-negative enteric bacteria. the apparent uniqueness of this protein may be exploited for the development of species-specific diagnostics for this gastric pathogen.

TI  == enterotoxin-producing bacteria isolated from swedish travellers with diarrhoea.
AB  == the isolation rate of bacterial enteropathogens of different species, particularly enterotoxin-producing gram-negative bacteria, was determined in stool specimens from swedish travellers with diarrhoea. overall, bacterial enteropathogens were identified in 101 (47%) of the 217 travellers on their return home. the most common isolates were enterotoxin-producing bacteria (20%),  salmonellae (18%) and campylobacter (8%), whereas shigellae (3%) and yersinia (0.5%) were rarely identified. mixed infections were only found in 8 (4%) of the  stool specimens. enterotoxigenic bacteria of escherichia coli (etec), klebsiella, morganella, citrobacter, pseudomonas and ef-group 10 species were identified. etec accounted for 37/43 (86%) enterotoxin-producing strains, and among them 54%  produced heat-stable enterotoxin (st) alone, 16% heat-labile enterotoxin (lt) alone and 30% both lt and st. four of the enterotoxin-producing non-e. coli strains produced st and 2 produced lt alone. the isolation rate of enterotoxin-producing bacteria was somewhat higher in travellers visiting africa, asia and latin america (24%) than in those travelling to southern europe (14%). salmonellae, on the other hand, were identified in stools significantly more often after travel to southern europe (26%) than to various subtropical and tropical areas (12.5%).

TI  == modification to the ritard surgical model.
AB  == the removable intestinal tie-adult rabbit diarrhea (ritard) procedure is the surgical model of choice for studying pathogenesis of diarrheas of campylobacter, escherichia coli, and aeromonas origin. other than nonhuman primates, the ritard  rabbit is the only model that closely resembles human infection. classically, the ritard model is created by isolating the terminal ileum using umbilical tape placed in a slipknot fashion, and injecting the occluded segment with the organism of choice. the slipknot is removed at 4 h postinoculation and patency of the gut reestablished. we found removal of the umbilical tape to be extremely difficult, usually requiring a second surgery to gently untie the material and prevent destruction of the fragile intestinal tissue. this complication of the described procedure appeared to be related to the absorptive and abrasive nature  of the tape material. the modification described uses the same idea, but a different material and a different knot pattern. the tubing was easily removed at the prescribed 4 h postsurgery, without an additional surgery. the tubing did not adhere to or damage the gut, yet did provide the occlusive seal required for a 4-h static gut. histologically, no evidence of pressure could be found at the tie site.

TI  == cytotoxic effects of children's faeces: relation to diarrhoea due to clostridium  difficile and other enteric pathogens.
AB  == cytotoxicity of faecal extracts was demonstrated in 47 of 88 children (54%) referred for microbiological investigation of stools. cytotoxic clostridium difficile and vertotoxigenic escherichia coli (vtec) were the pathogens identified most commonly but cytotoxicity was also found in association with campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp, shigella sonnei, giardia lamblia, rotavirus, adenovirus and poliovirus type 1 which had been acquired by oral immunization. in two patients, one of whom had cystic fibrosis, cytotoxicity of faecal extracts was associated with isolation of pseudomonas aeruginosa. in five  of 13 patients with diarrhoea and cytotoxic c. difficile, other pathogens were also present, in agreement with the view that c. difficile are more readily recovered when the intestinal flora have been altered by colonization with other  micro-organisms. there was no correlation between previous treatment with antibiotics and isolation of c. difficile. cytotoxicity neutralized by antitoxin, usually to c. sordellii, is used to detect cytotoxic c. difficile. we suggest that cytotoxicity not neutralized in this way should be an indication for further investigation of stools for the presence of other pathogens such as vtec or viruses.

AB  == sixteen strains of atypical (catalase-weak or negative), hippurate-hydrolysing campylobacters from paediatric blood and faecal cultures were identified by dna-dna slot hybridization. all were closely related (greater than or equal to 67%) to campylobacter jejuni and representative strains had g + c contents of 30  +/- 1 mol%. numerical analysis of chromosomal dna haeiii digest patterns revealed two clusters of strains at the 55%s level corresponding to c. jejuni subsp. jejuni and c. jejuni subsp. doylei; most strains belonged to the latter subspecies. no two strains had identical patterns but within each subspecies two  subgroups were identifiable, corresponding to lior biotypes i and ii. southern blot hybridization analysis with a 16 + 23s rrna cistron probe from escherichia coli also showed differences between the various strains, and in a numerical analysis three groupings were formed at 70%s corresponding to c. jejuni subsp. jejuni lior biotypes i and ii, and c. jejuni subsp. doylei. four of the subspecies doylei strains contained a 3.4-mda plasmid. these analyses showed that catalase-negative c. jejuni subsp. jejuni were genomically distinguishable from c. jejuni subsp. doylei as were lior biotypes within subsp. jejuni. ability to produce catalase is not a feature common to all c. jejuni strains, and our results confirm that some strains of subspecies jejuni may be negative in that character although typical in other respects. dna pattern heterogeneity was consistent with serological differences between strains.

TI  == treatment of typhoid fever and infectious diarrhoea with ciprofloxacin.
AB  == ciprofloxacin and other related fluorinated 4-quinolones have microbiological and pharmacokinetic properties that suggest they could be useful agents in the management of typhoid fever and bacterial gastroenteritis. initial studies confirm that this is the case. against fully sensitive salmonella typhi ciprofloxacin is clinically as effective as chloramphenicol or co-trimoxazole. it is also effective treatment for antibiotic-resistant strains which cause epidemic and endemic infection throughout the world. furthermore, ciprofloxacin appears to eliminate chronic carriage of salm. typhi more efficiently than other antibiotics. ciprofloxacin has excellent in-vitro activity against all the bacterial pathogens that commonly cause infective diarrhoea. there are limited data concerning its use in the treatment of shigella dysentery but, in appropriate situations, ciprofloxacin is effective treatment for salmonella enteritis and is also effective in infections complicated by septicaemia and bone and liver abscesses. ciprofloxacin appears to be of benefit in campylobacter jejuni enteritis and is effective in the treatment of travellers' diarrhoea were  enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and shigellae are most important.

AB  == a double blind study of daily doxycycline (100 mg) vs. weekly mefloquine (250 mg) was performed on united states soldiers training in thailand to assess the effect of doxycycline malaria prophylaxis on the incidence of gastrointestinal infections. during a 5 week period, 49% (58/119) of soldiers receiving doxycycline and 48% (64/134) of soldiers receiving mefloquine reported an episode of diarrhea. infection with bacterial enteric pathogens was identified in 39% (47/119) of soldiers taking doxycycline and 46% (62/134) of soldiers taking mefloquine. forty-four percent (59/134) of soldiers receiving mefloquine and 36%  (43/119) of soldiers receiving doxycycline were infected with enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec), while 9% (12/134) of soldiers receiving mefloquine and 4% of soldiers receiving doxycycline were infected with campylobacter. side effects from either medication were minimal. after 5 weeks in thailand, the percent of non-etec strains resistant to greater than or equal to 2 antibiotics increased from 65% (77/119) to 86% (95/111) in soldiers on mefloquine and from 79% (84/106) to 93% (88/95) in soldiers on doxycycline. doxycycline prophylaxis did not prevent or increase diarrheal disease in soldiers deployed to thailand where etec and other bacterial pathogens are often resistant to tetracyclines.

TI  == hepatotoxic activity of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == hepatotoxic factor(s) were isolated from whole-cell lysates of campylobacter jejuni gifu 8734 and purified by chromatography. a single intravenous injection of 10 micrograms of this factor reproducibly produced hepatitis in mice, as determined by histology and liver function tests. the hepatic lesions were very similar to those evoked by c. jejuni infection. tissue-culture studies with mouse hepatocytes demonstrated that low concentrations of the factor caused release of  hepatic enzymes into the medium without appreciable cytolysis. high concentrations of the factor induced cytolysis. these effects were neutralised by antiserum to the factor, but not by antisera to the lipopolysaccharide of c. jejuni or to the heat-labile enterotoxin of escherichia coli. among 20 clinical isolates of c. jejuni, only four evoked hepatitis in mice and produced the hepatotoxic factor.

TI  == [a 3-year follow-up study of the incidence of campylobacteriosis in a pediatric population].
AB  == the authors investigated the incidence of campylobacteriosis in the population of five paediatric health communities of the jihlava policlinic (5831 children) for  a period of three years. a total of 2408 specimens faeces from 1501 subjects were examined. campylobacter jejuni was detected in 151 subjects (10.1%), salmonella sp. in 47 (3.1%), shigella sp. in 18 (1.2%), yersinia enterocolitica in 12 (0.8%) and enteropathogenic escherichia coli in five subjects (0.3%). the total incidence of campylobacteriosis in the investigated group was 863 cases per 100,000 subjects per year. the incidence of campylobacteriosis was seasonal with  a maximum during the summer months. to elucidate the source of infection and way  of transmission 323 smears from animals, animal products and from the environment were made. seventy were positive. campylobacterosis is transmitted to man most frequently by ingestion of primarily or secondarily contamined food, by contact with animals and even interhuman transmission cannot be ruled out. the most frequent clinical symptoms of campylobacteriosis were diarrhoea, fever, abdominal pain and vomiting. seventeen children were hospitalized. for treatment most frequently endiaron was used and dietotherapy. campylobacteriosis affects significantly more frequently children of gipsy origin.

TI  == structural and functional analysis of two campylobacter jejuni flagellin genes.
AB  == the purpose of this study was to characterize the flagellin gene of campylobacter jejuni and to study the structure of this protein and the regulation of its synthesis. a part of the flagellin gene of c. jejuni strain 81116 was recently cloned by us. this dna fragment was used as a probe to isolate the other homologous flagellin sequences from genomic libraries. the flagellin nucleotide sequence was determined from overlapping clones. two copies of the flagellin gene were identified: genes fla a and fla b consisted of 1731 base pairs each, occurred as tandem repeats, and were 95% identical. only mrna that was transcribed from gene a was detected in flagellate cells. sigma 28-specific promoter sequences were found upstream of the transcription initiation site. analysis of the flagellin protein sequence showed that the amino-terminal and the carboxyl-terminal regions were highly similar to other bacterial flagellins. the  conserved regions can form alpha-helices with a nonpolar backbone at one side. we suggest that because these domains were conserved (i) they may be involved in polymerization or transport of flagellins or both, and (ii) they are important for maturation and stability of the flagellum.

TI  == infection with bacterial enteropathogens in swedish travellers to south-east asia--a prospective study.
AB  == infection with potential bacterial enteropathogens was studied prospectively in 94 swedish travellers. three faecal samples were collected, regardless of diarrhoeal symptoms, after each of three 1-week stays in singapore, hong kong and japan. the specimens were analyzed for salmonella, shigella, yersinia, campylobacter and different enterotoxin-producing bacteria. a potential enteropathogen was identified in 30% (28/94) of the participants, i.e. in 26% of  the healthy and in 39% of the travellers with diarrhoea. the most common isolates were enterotoxigenic bacteria of different species (14%), salmonella (11%) and campylobacter (7%). by performing enterotoxin-tests on six different colonies from the primary culture of each specimen enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) as well as enterotoxin-producing klebsiella sp., citrobacter sp. and morganella morganii were identified. the latter strains were as prevalent as etec. in the 33 participants with diarrhoea enterotoxigenic bacteria (18%) and campylobacter (18%) were the most common isolates. campylobacter-infected travellers developed  symptomatic disease (6/7) significantly (p less than 0.02) more often than those  infected with salmonella (3/10) or enterotoxigenic bacteria (6/13; 2 etec, 4 other species).

TI  == chloramphenicol resistance in campylobacter coli: nucleotide sequence, expression, and cloning vector construction.
AB  == a chloramphenicol-resistance determinant (cmr), originally cloned from campylobacter coli plasmid pnr9589 in japan, was isolated and the nucleotide sequence determined, which contained an open reading frame of 621 bp. the gene product was identified as cm acetyltransferase (cat), which had a putative amino  acid sequence that showed 43% to 57% identity with other cat proteins of both gram+ and gram- origin. although expression of the cat gene was constitutive in both c. coli and escherichia coli, results of primer extension experiments indicated that transcription was initiated at different sites in these two species. a kanamycin-resistance determinant, identified as the apha-3 gene, was located downstream from the cat gene. the codon usage of the cat gene is very different from that used in e. coli, however, the cat polypeptide was synthesized in large amounts in e. coli maxicells. therefore, the codon usage bias is not one of the obstacles which affects campylobacter spp. gene expression in e. coli. new campylobacter cloning vectors were constructed in this study.

TI  == [basic and clinical studies on norfloxacin in the pediatric field].
AB  == pharmacokinetic , bacteriological and clinical studies on norfloxacin (nflx), a quinolone-carboxylic acid antibacterial agent, were conducted in the pediatric field. 1. serum concentrations and urinary excretion of nflx after single dose of 2.2 approximately 5.6 mg/kg (mean 4.4 +/- 1.2 mg/kg) were determined in 13 children with ages between 6 and 11 years. the mean peak serum concentration of the drug was 0.37 +/- 0.20 micrograms/ml at 2 hours after administration. the mean half-life of the drug in serum was 2.8 +/- 0.4 hours and the serum concentration at 8 hours was 0.11 +/- 0.06 micrograms/ml. the mean urinary concentration reached a maximum of 125.2 +2- 166.2 micrograms/ml in pooled urine  from 0 to 2 hours and the mean urinary recovery rate in the first 8 hours after administration was 22.1 +/- 6.0%. a dose-response relationship was observed between doses/body weight and peak serum concentrations. 2. the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and the safety of nflx were evaluated in 65 pediatric patients with ages between 2 years 10 months and 15 years 7 months with infections. in 62 assessable cases (acute purulent tonsillitis 9 cases, acute pneumonia 3 cases, chronic rhinitis 1 case, urinary tract infections 15 cases, and acute colitis 34 cases), clinical efficacies were excellent in 48 cases, good in 13 cases, and fair in 1 case with an overall efficacy rate of 98.4%. staphylococcus aureus 1 strain, staphylococcus epidermidis 1 strain, escherichia  coli 10 strains, salmonella sp. 5 strains, morganella morganii 1 strain, pseudomonas aeruginosa 3 strains, haemophilus parainfluenzae 1 strain and campylobacter jejuni 12 strains were isolated from the patients as pathogens. bacteriologically, all of these strains were eradicated except that 3 strains of  c. jejuni only decreased. with regard to side effects, dizziness and nausea were  observed in 1 case each but they were slight and the continuation of the treatment was possible. no abnormal laboratory test data were observed. from the  above results, nflx was considered to be a useful drug for the treatment of pediatric infections.

TI  == [the pathogenicity of campylobacter jejuni as a monoinfection and as a mixed infection with escherichia coli 078:k80 in broilers].
AB  == two week old broilers (n = 61) with a monoinfection with campylobacter jejuni (0.5 ml of suspension containing 10(5) cfu/ml per os) showed reduced increase in  weight during week 3 after infection compared to the control group. an other group of chickens (n = 31) was additionally infected with a suspension of escherichia (e.) coli o78:k80 via drinking water from day 4 to 6 after the primary infection. this mixed infection provoked clinical signs of a disease and  reduced increase in weight during the first two weeks of the experiment. seven broilers of this group showed a fibrinous pericarditis and/or perihepatitis. four of these chickens died. it can be concluded from the experiment that an infection with campylobacter causes reduced weight gain and supports a systemic infection with e. coli.

TI  == surface array protein of campylobacter fetus. cloning and gene structure.
AB  == the high molecular mass (97-149 kda) surface array proteins (sap) of campylobacter fetus are critical to virulence. we created a bank of 160,000 random 1.0-6.5-kilobase (kb) chromosomal dna fragments of c. fetus strain 84-32 (23d) using lambda gt11. screening this bank in escherichia coli y1090 with antibody raised against purified sap permitted isolation and purification of a clone with a 4.0-kb insert. subcloning this insert in the e. coli vector, puc9, permitted expression of a protein of approximately 100 kda, not fused with beta-galactoside or inducible by isopropyl-beta-d-thiogalactopyranoside. digestion with restriction endonucleases, and construction of deletion mutations  indicated that the gene extended over 2.8 kb, proceeding toward the start of the  beta-galactosidase gene. taking advantage of a unique psti site at 1.7 kb, we subcloned psti-ecori fragments in both orientations into m13 vectors, then generated and sequenced 48 deletion mutants. in the 3974-base insert, an open reading frame, beginning at nucleotide 24 and terminating at 2825, was found to encode a 933-amino acid polypeptide having a calculated molecular mass of 96,758  daltons. the first 20 amino acids exactly match those determined from amino-terminal sequencing, indicating that this protein is secreted without a leader sequence. the deduced amino acid composition matches that of the purified  sap. we identified a ribosomal binding site 9 bases upstream, and a putative transcription terminator (delta g = -12.4) 21 bases downstream. there is partial  homology of primary and secondary structure with five other bacterial s-layer proteins.

TI  == a method for detecting shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin-i in pure and mixed culture.
AB  == shiga toxin and shiga-like toxins (slts, syn. verotoxins) are currently detected  by tissue culture assays that are expensive, time-consuming and require specialised facilities and experienced personnel. we have developed a rapid method to detect shiga toxin and slt-i (verotoxin 1) based on their binding to globotriosyl ceramide (gb3). bound toxin was then detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibodies. the direct detection of cytotoxins from pure culture plates and from a mixed bacterial culture was studied. using polymyxin extraction (0.1 g/l, 30 min, 37 degrees c) and gb3-based elisa we detected toxin from reference strains shigella dysenteriae 1 strain 60r  (shiga toxin) and escherichia coli o26:h11 strain h30 (slt-i), and from clinical  isolates of e. coli o157:h7 and o26:h11 (both slt-i) from 11 patients with diarrhoea, haemorrhagic colitis or haemolytic uraemic syndrome. toxin production  by these strains was confirmed by a radiolabelled hela cell assay and the structural genes were detected by dna hybridisation. the gb3-based elisa could detect slt-i in extracts of a mixed culture even when the toxin-positive strains  represented only 1% of the mixture. no cross-reactivity was found with bacteria that produce other cytotoxins, such as other e. coli and shigella, salmonella, aeromonas and campylobacter spp.

TI  == characterization of an rrna gene-specific cdna probe: applications in bacterial identification.
AB  == discontinuous dna complementary to escherichia coli 16s + 23s ribosomal rna was synthesized by random oligonucleotide priming using reverse transcriptase. cdna generated from native or denatured rrna template was labelled by incorporation of either [alpha-32p]dctp or digoxigenin-labelled dutp during synthesis, followed by template hydrolysis. the specific activity of the radiolabelled cdna was 10(7)-10(8) c.p.m. (micrograms rrna template)-1 with 60-92% incorporation after 5 h. the length of the reverse transcript was between 20 and 1140 nucleotides and was unaffected by exclusion of primer. the cdna probe could detect 3 pg rrna by quantitative slot blot. in the non-radiolabelling digoxigenin system 3 micrograms template gave 0.5-2.0 micrograms cdna after 24 h with a length of between 100 and 1225 bases. this probe could detect 50 pg rrna. probes were evaluated in the comparison of pasteurella haemolytica biotypes by hybridization to southern blots of restriction-endonuclease-digested total dna. the digoxigenin-labelled probe was used to identify clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni to demonstrate its potential use in laboratories requiring high-sensitivity detection without the use of radioisotopes.

AB  == during a survey examining the causes of diarrhea in the east african country of djibouti, 140 bacterial pathogens were recovered from 209 diarrheal and 100 control stools. the following pathogens were isolated at comparable frequencies from both diarrheal and control stools: enteroadherent escherichia coli (eaec) (10.6 versus 13%), enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) (11 versus 10%), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (7.7 versus 12%), salmonella spp. (2.9 versus 3%), and campylobacter jejuni-c. coli (3.3 versus 5%). surprisingly, the eaec strains isolated did not correspond to well-recognized epec serogroups. no yersinia spp., enteroinvasive e. coli, or enterohemorrhagic e. coli were isolated during the course of this study. only the following two genera were recovered from diarrheal stools exclusively: shigella spp. (7.7%) and aeromonas hydrophila  group organisms (3.3%). shigella flexneri was the most common shigella species isolated. patients with shigella species were of a higher average age than were controls (27 versus 13 years), while subjects with campylobacter or salmonella species belonged to younger age groups (2.6 and 1.6 years, respectively). salmonella cases were more often in females. shigella diarrhea was associated with fecal blood or mucus and leukocytes. etec was not associated with nausea or  vomiting. anorexia, weight loss, and fever were associated with the isolation of  salmonella and aeromonas species. eaec, etec, epec, and shigella species were resistant to most drugs used for treating diarrhea in africa, while the antibiotic most active against all bacteria tested was norfloxacin. we conclude that in djibouti in 1989, shigella and aeromonas species must be considered as potential pathogens whenever they are isolated from diarrheal stools and that norfloxacin should be considered the drug of choice in adults for treating severe shigellosis and for diarrhea prophylaxis in travelers.

TI  == search for campylobacter species in the public water supply of a large urban community.
AB  == a survey of the water distribution network of a large urban community was performed during a one year period. in addition to standard indicator bacteria, campylobacter species were looked for after filtration of 500 ml water samples by enrichment of the original filter followed by subculture on a skirrow's medium as well as a direct filtration procedure on a non selective agar. all steps were performed at 37 degrees c. specimens collected at the springs (206), treatment stations (206) and at different points along the network (479) were tested. fourteen strains of campylobacter were isolated. they were cephalothin resistant  and hippurate negative but they did not grow at 42 degrees c. none of them was part of the enteropathogenic campylobacters. all except one were found in untreated water; in 11 cases among 13 tested, standard indicator bacteria were positive. we conclude that there is a low incidence of campylobacter species in the water supply tested, that they are sensitive to chlorination and that testing standard indicator bacteria is an effective indicator for campylobacter species.

TI  == risk of diarrhea during the first year of life associated with initial and subsequent colonization by specific enteropathogens.
AB  == the incidence of colonization by enteropathogenic, enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, and enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli (detected by dna hybridization with specific radiolabeled probes), salmonella sp., shigella sp., campylobacter jejuni, and rotavirus was related to the presence of diarrhea in a  cohort of 75 rural infants followed longitudinally during the first year of life. the study was carried out between august 1985 and february 1987 in the village of lugar sobre la tierra blanca, in the state of morelos, 180 km southwest of mexico city. intestinal colonization by specific enteropathogens was followed with fecal cultures taken every fortnight and every time a child had diarrhea. pathogens isolated from cultures taken in the 48 hours prior to the initiation of the diarrheal episode were considered to be associated with the disease. diarrhea was detected in 82% of the children with initial isolation of enterohemorrhagic e. coli and in 64% of the children with enteropathogenic e. coli or shigella sp. the risk of diarrhea associated with the initial isolation of other pathogens was lower, at 41% for rotavirus and approximately 25% for enterotoxigenic e. coli, salmonella sp., and c. jejuni. initial colonization by the enteropathogens studied, whether or not they were associated with diarrhea, prevented disease, but not colonization by the same organism, when the children were reinfected during the first year of life. enteropathogenic e. coli adherence factor, human or porcine heat-stable enterotoxins, fimbrial colonization factor antigens, and shiga-like toxins i and ii were important pathogenic characteristics related to the presence of diarrhea and to protection against subsequent infection by the same organisms.

TI  == aetiology of diarrhoea in pre-term neonates at kenyatta national hospital nursery, nairobi, kenya.
AB  == the aetiology of two outbreaks of diarrhoea in pre-term neonates (march-august; september, 1987), at kenyatta national hospital was studied. the first outbreak involved 98 neonates and enteropathogenic e. coli of different serotypes were the most commonly isolated agents (54%), with serotype 086a:k61 dominating. these were followed by salmonella (16%) also of different groups, and then rotavirus (6%). two campylobacter and two shigella were isolated from four individual neonates. mixed infections were mainly those of salmonella and e. coli (5 cases). e. coli serotype 086 was found to be in circulation throughout the study period (march-august, 1987), whilst 044:0125 and 0128 circulated for a limited period. salmonella and some strains of e. coli caused persistent diarrhoea despite antibiotic therapy. nosocomial infections were found to play a role in subsequent diarrhoeas. in the second diarrhoea outbreak, again enteropathogenic e. coli and  salmonella were the most frequently isolated. however, in this outbreak, there was no single e. coli serotype revealed that some possessed plasmids of 120-160 megadalton. however, a search for human immunodeficiency viral antibodies in 120  stools produced negative results.

TI  == microbiological quality and safety of zoo food.
AB  == two types of commercial products for feeding zoo animals (a frozen meat product,  referred to as zoo food, and a dry product, referred to as dry food) were microbiologically examined for spoilage organisms (aerobic, psychrotrophic, coliform, escherichia coli, mold, and yeasts) and pathogens (salmonella spp., listeria monocytogenes, and campylobacter jejuni). levels of microorganisms in frozen ground zoo food were compared with those in frozen ground beef and frozen  ground turkey meat. the level of microbial contaminants in frozen ground zoo meat was found to be similar to that in frozen ground beef and higher than that in frozen ground turkey meat. sixty percent of the frozen zoo meat samples were salmonella positive, and all of the samples were l. monocytogenes positive. dry zoo food was documented to have microbial levels lower than those in frozen zoo meat; the pathogen levels were less than 1/25 g of food. defrosting zoo meat at 10, 25, and 37 degrees c for 24 h showed that 10 degrees c is the best temperature for defrosting frozen ground zoo meat loaves (length, 9 in. [22.8 cm]; radius, 2 in. [5.1 cm]) without affecting the microbiological quality or safety of the product.

TI  == microbiological agents associated with childhood diarrhoea in the dry zone of sri lanka.
AB  == between march and july, 1987, faecal specimens from 371 diarrhoeal children reporting to four hospitals in the district of kurunegala, sri lanka and from 121 controls with other diseases were investigated for enteric pathogens. all specimens were tested for shigella spp, salmonella spp and enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec). in addition, parasitic pathogens, heat labile enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec lt), campylobacter and rotavirus were sought among subsamples of the cases and controls. one or more pathogens were detected in the faecal specimens of 53.7% of the diarrhoeal children and 19.6% of the controls (p less than 0.001). rotavirus was the most frequently identified pathogen. cases (21.9%) were more likely to be positive for rotavirus than controls (6.5%) (p less than 0.05). among children with diarrhoea the peak prevalence of rotavirus occurred in the 6-11 months age group. shigella spp were  the second most frequently isolated pathogens and the single most common cause of diarrhoea in children over two years of age. again, cases (16.4%) were more likely to be infected than controls (1.7%) (p less than 0.001). salmonella spp were isolated from 7.5% of diarrhoeal children and 3.3% of the controls (p greater than 0.10). other pathogens had prevalence rates of less than 5%. vomiting was associated with rotavirus diarrhoea (p less than 0.001), and fever with shigellosis (p = 0.02). in view of the different transmission routes and characteristics of the most important pathogens detected in this study it appears unlikely that a single environmental intervention can solve the public health problem posed by diarrhoeal diseases in sri lanka.

TI  == prospective study of diarrheal diseases in venezuelan children to evaluate the efficacy of rhesus rotavirus vaccine.
AB  == the efficacy of a rhesus rotavirus vaccine (mmu 18006, serotype 3) against infantile diarrhea was evaluated by active home surveillance of a group of 320 children 1-10 months of age in caracas, venezuela. during a 1 year period following oral administration of vaccine or placebo under a double-masked code, over 600 diarrheal episodes were detected. etiologic studies revealed that heat-stable toxin (st) producing enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) was the most common diarrheal agent detected (34%) followed by enteropathogenic e. coli (epec, 10.9%), heat-labile toxin (lt) producing etec (7.6%), rotavirus (6.9%), cryptosporidium (4.8%) and campylobacter (1.3%). st-producing etec were also recovered from over 20% of control stool specimens obtained during diarrhea-free  periods, whereas epec, rotavirus, cryptosporidium, and campylobacter were rarely  detected in such control specimens. rotavirus was responsible for about one-half  of the more severe cases of diarrhea. twenty-two of 151 infants who received placebo (14.6%) and eight of 151 receiving a 10(4) pfu dose of vaccine (5.3%) had rotavirus diarrhea during the follow-up period for an efficacy level of 64% against any rotavirus diarrhea. however, vaccine efficacy reached 90% against the more severe cases of rotavirus diarrhea and was noticeably high in the 1-4 month  age group. serotypic analysis of the rotaviruses detected suggests that the resistance induced by the vaccine was type specific since significant protection  was only evident against serotype 3 rotaviruses. a 10(3) pfu dose tested initially in 18 children did not appear to protect against rotavirus diarrhea.

TI  == natural transformation in campylobacter species.
AB  == growing cells of campylobacter coli and c. jejuni were naturally transformed by naked dna without the requirement for any special treatment. transformation frequencies for homologous chromosomal dna were approximately 10(-3) transformants per recipient cell in c. coli and 10(-4) in c. jejuni. maximum competence was found in the early log phase of growth. campylobacters preferentially took up their own dna in comparison with escherichia coli chromosomal dna, which was taken up very poorly. three new campylobacter spp.-to-e. coli shuttle plasmids, which contained additional cloning sites and selectable markers, were constructed from the shuttle vector pill550a. these plasmid dnas were taken up by campylobacters much less efficiently than was homologous chromosomal dna, and transformation into plasmid-free cells was very rare. however, with the use of recipients containing a homologous plasmid, approximately 10(-4) transformants per cell were obtained. the tetm determinant,  originally obtained from streptococcus spp. and not heretofore reported in campylobacter spp., was isolated from an e. coli plasmid and was introduced, selecting for tetracycline resistance, by natural transformation into c. coli.

TI  == epidemiology of travelers' diarrhea and relative importance of various pathogens.
AB  == each year 12 million persons travel from an industrialized country to a developing country in the tropics or subtropics. these travelers experience a high rate of diarrhea caused by a wide variety of enteric pathogens acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. one or more pathogens can be found in the stool of a majority of ill individuals. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli generally are the most frequently identified pathogens, having been found in a median of 42% of travelers' diarrheal episodes in studies in latin america, 36% in africa, and 16% in asia. other pathogens that cause diarrhea in a smaller fraction of ill travelers include shigella species, salmonella species, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio, aeromonas hydrophila, entamoeba histolytica, giardia lamblia, rotavirus, and 27-nm viruses, including norwalk virus. other organisms that may cause a fraction of the episodes of travelers' diarrhea include plesiomonas shigelloides, enteroadherent e. coli, adenovirus or other viruses, and cryptosporidium. mixed infections of two or more of these pathogens  also occur.

TI  == diarrhea in developed and developing countries: magnitude, special settings, and  etiologies.
AB  == diarrheal diseases are major causes of morbidity, with attack rates ranging from  two to 12 or more illnesses per person per year in developed and developing countries. in addition, diarrheal illnesses account for an estimated 12,600 deaths each day in children in asia, africa, and latin america. the causes of diarrhea include a wide array of viruses, bacteria, and parasites, many of which  have been recognized only in the last decade or two. while enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and rotaviruses predominate in developing areas, norwalk-like viruses, campylobacter jejuni, and cytotoxigenic clostridium difficile are seen with increasing frequency in developed areas; and shigella, salmonella, cryptosporidium species, and giardia lamblia are found throughout the world. the  rational management of infectious diarrhea requires the highly selective use of laboratory tests for these varied etiologic agents, depending on the clinical and epidemiologic setting. the purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the magnitude, special settings, and etiologies of diarrhea endemic to developed  and developing countries. this information permits a practical approach to the diagnosis and management of common diarrheal illnesses in different settings.

TI  == factors influencing the duration of acute diarrheal disease in infancy.
AB  == the majority of episodes of acute infectious diarrhea in infancy are of relatively short duration. prolongation of the diarrhea presents problems in management, deterioration of the infant's nutritional status, and an increased mortality. as part of a prospective study of the etiology of acute infectious diarrhea, some factors associated with the probability (more or less) of having self-limiting disease have been identified. the well-nourished infant over 6 months of age is more likely to have self-limiting disease, whereas this outcome  is least likely in the very young infant under 3 months of age, particularly if underweight for age. with the exception of shigella, bacterial enteropathogens (campylobacter fetus jejuni, salmonella b, and certain enteropathogenic escherichia coli types) were also associated with a decreased likelihood of self-limiting disease. rotavirus infection was associated with self-limiting disease except in the infant under 3 months of age, where the probability of self-limiting disease was decreased.

TI  == serum antibody responses to bacterial enteropathogens in swedish travelers to south-east asia.
AB  == the possibility that serological analysis may be more sensitive than bacteriological examinations of stool samples to detect enteric infections was evaluated in 80 swedish travellers to south-east asia. serum and faecal specimens were collected before, during and after their travel. serological analyses of pre-travel and any later serum specimen identified infection with enterotoxinogenic escherichia coli (etec), salmonella or campylobacter jejuni in  28% of the travellers. the seroconversion rate was 72% in travellers excreting the homologous pathogen in their stool; all symptomatic cases and half of those who had an asymptomatic infection seroconverted. bacteriological examinations of  stool samples collected repeatedly during travel identified an enteropathogen in  20% of the travellers. however, the isolation rate decreased to 11%, when only a  single routine faecal specimen was examined. our findings suggest that serological analyses of pre- and post-travel specimens are sufficiently specific  and may be at least as sensitive as conventional bacteriology to identify infections with bacterial enteropathogens in travellers. however, reliable serodiagnosis requires collection of pre-travel sera and might therefore only be  useful in prospective studies of travellers' diarrhoea.

TI  == campylobacter pylori interactions with gastric cell tissue culture.
AB  == many investigators have reported that gastric mucosal biopsies of patients with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease show the presence of campylobacter pylori in a large majority of cases. histologic examinations of such tissues indicate a close approximation of c. pylori with gastric surface epithelial cells. a recent report has described both adherence and cell invasion of gastric  cells by c. pylori. using a transmission electron microscope, we have examined the interaction between c. pylori, c. jejuni, and e. coli in vitro with a gastric cancer cell line, kato iii. our results indicate marked toxicity of e. coli and moderate toxicity of c. jejuni for kato iii cells. c. pylori had only a minor effect on tissue culture viability. c. pylori was found to have a strong association with the kato iii cell membranes and evidence of occasional cell invasion. both c. jejuni and e. coli showed no attachment or association with the kato iii cells. we interpret these findings as indicating that c. pylori may have a specific adhesion for gastric cells.

TI  == molecular studies on the mechanism of tetracycline resistance mediated by tet(o).
AB  == the mechanism of resistance to tetracycline in escherichia coli mediated by the campylobacter jejuni-derived resistance determinant tet(o) was investigated. the  cloned tet(o) protein had no detectable effect on the intracellular accumulation  of tetracycline. the presence of tet(o) markedly diminished the inhibitory effect of tetracycline on protein synthesis both in vivo and in vitro. ribosomes prepared from tetracycline-resistant and susceptible e. coli cells bound almost identical amounts of radiolabeled tetracycline. thus, a reduction in the binding  of the antibiotic to its target site on the ribosome is not the primary mechanism of resistance. poly(u)-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis revealed that an s-100 fraction prepared from tetracycline-resistant cells made the ribosomes prepared from susceptible cells considerably more resistant to the inhibitory action of tetracycline. the n-terminal portion (1 to 150 residues) of tet(o) is highly homologous to the gtp-binding domain of elongation factor tu and to elongation factor g, indicating that the tet(o) protein has the potential to bind gtp. these data suggest that the tet(o) protein could function either as a tetracycline-resistant analog of this elongation factor(s) or by modifying the target sites on the ribosomes in a catalytic fashion.

TI  == binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate.
AB  == bismuth subsalicylate (bss) is a compound without significant aqueous solubility  that is widely used for the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. bss was able to bind bacteria of diverse species, and these bound bacteria were subsequently killed. a 4-log10 reduction of viable bacteria occurred within 4 h after a 10 mm  aqueous suspension of bss was inoculated with 2 x 10(6) escherichia coli cells per ml. binding and killing were dependent on the levels of inoculated bacteria,  and significant binding but little killing of the exposed bacteria occurred at an inoculum level of 2 x 10(9) e. coli per ml. intracellular atp decreased rapidly after exposure of e. coli to 10 mm bss and, after 30 min, was only 1% of the original level. extracellular atp increased after exposure to bss, but the accumulation of extracellular atp was not sufficient to account for the loss of intracellular atp. the killing of bacteria exposed to bss may have been due to cessation of atp synthesis or a loss of membrane integrity. bactericidal activity of bss was also investigated in a simulated gastric juice at ph 3. killing of e.  coli at this ph was much more rapid than at ph 7 and was apparently due to salicylate released by the conversion of bss to bismuth oxychloride. it is proposed that the binding and killing observed for bss contribute to the efficacy of this compound against gastrointestinal infections such as traveler's diarrhea.

AB  == a community-based study was undertaken to compare the organisms responsible for diarrhoea in children living in formal housing with indoor water supply and sanitation with those from a deprived environment. the role of "home remedies" was also assessed. among 373 children with diarrhoea, rotavirus was detected in 15% (in 371 symptom-free controls, 9%), and proved to be the single most common causative agent. bacterial pathogens were found in 20% of patients, with enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) being isolated most frequently (9%; controls 3%), followed by shigella species (4%; controls 1%), campylobacter jejuni (4%; controls 1%), salmonella species (2%; controls 1%) and enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) (2%; controls 1%). giardia lamblia and cryptosporidium were detected in 6% (controls 6%) and 3% (controls 1%) of patients, respectively; 7% (controls 1%) harboured more than one enteropathogen and no pathogens were detected in 58% (controls 78%). the vast majority (greater  than 90%) of both patients and controls received some form of "home remedy" which included disinfectants and traditional herbs. the findings of this study therefore confirm the extremely complex nature of diarrhoea in developing communities and indicate that environmental factors are compounded by other issues.

TI  == oligonucleotide probe for detection and identification of campylobacter pylori.
AB  == we have developed a novel and practical dna-rna hybridization assay for the detection and identification of campylobacter pylori in the gastric mucosa. this  technique utilizes a [32p]ddatp-labeled synthetic oligonucleotide probe complementary to a nucleotide sequence present in c. pylori 16s rrna. this probe  is very sensitive and reacted with all 23 strains of c. pylori tested. it is also highly specific, since there was no cross-reactivity with the heterologous organisms campylobacter coli, c. fetus subsp. fetus, c. jejuni, and c. laridis or with escherichia coli. hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe with c. pylori  rna was completely inhibited by treatment of the membrane filters with rnase but  not dnase. although a gastric mucosa tissue homogenate slightly inhibited the hybridization, as few as 10(4) c. pylori cells could be detected even in the presence of 5 mg of gastric mucosa. gastric biopsy specimens obtained from patients referred for upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy were tested for c. pylori infection by direct oligonucleotide hybridization, and the results were compared with those of bacteriological cultures, the urease test, and histological observations. a comparison of the urease test and the oligonucleotide hybridization results showed an excellent correlation between the two methods. the clinical usefulness of this oligonucleotide-rna hybridization method is discussed.

TI  == [causes of infectious gastro-enteritis in children in dakar].
AB  == between february 1983 and may 1988, 1,157 stools from children aged under 15 years presenting with diarrhoea and admitted to a paediatric hospital in dakar, senegal, were examined for the presence of bacterial and parasitic agents. we looked for campylobacter and rotavirus in only 245 and 111 samples respectively.  enterobacteria were detected most frequently (162/264; 61.3 per cent). among these, we found 92 (34.8 per cent) strains of enteropathogenic e. coli; 40 strains (15.1 per cent) of salmonella spp. and 30 strains (11.3 per cent) of shigella spp. v. cholerae was present in only 2 faecal specimens (0,7 per cent).  eighty-one (30.6 per cent) parasitic agents were isolated, including a high proportion (13.6 per cent) of flagellae. campylobacter jejuni and retroviruses were found in 2 (0.8 percent) and 15 (13.5 percent) stool respectively. the frequency with which these enteropathogenic agents were isolated remains in keeping with the global situation usually observed in dakar for several years.

TI  == incidence of sporadic infections due to enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) in the population of hamburg, north germany.
AB  == in two studies (1982 and 1985/86), the presence of enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec) and other enteropathogenic bacteria was investigated in 779 stool specimens from  children and adults with and without diarrhoeal disease. etec was isolated from 2% of diseased children and 1.6% of adult patients, but also from 0.5% of asymptomatic persons. mixed infections with two different etec strains or with other enteropathogenic bacteria were identified in 4 of 9 infected persons. the etec strains belonged to 10 different serovars, eight of which produced only heat-stable enterotoxin. one infection had been contracted in a tropical country. after salmonella and campylobacter, etec was more frequently isolated than yersinia and shigella; the difference of etec infections in diseased and asymptomatic persons was, however, not statistically significant (p greater than  0.05). analysis of the isolated serovars suggests that most etec strains implicated in sporadic cases of diarrhoea in hamburg are unrelated to those which are widely spread in the developing world.

TI  == effect of endotoxin on colonisation of campylobacter jejuni in infant mice.
AB  == an infant mouse model has been used to investigate the colonisation of the intestine by campylobacter jejuni and the effect of endotoxin (escherichia coli o26: b6) on the initial stage of this process. endotoxin injected 1 or 16 h before the bacterial challenge had no effect on the growth of campylobacters but  endotoxin injected 4 to 10 h before the bacterial challenge caused a bacteriostatic effect on the growth of campylobacters which lasted for one day. the bacteriostatic effect was evident both in the small intestine and in the distal part of the intestine containing caecum and colon. the mechanism of the bacteriostatic effect of endotoxin could not be explained in the study, but is thought to be non-immunological because it developed so rapidly. oral and parenteral iron administered as ammonium ferric citrate or iron dextran, respectively, were used in an attempt to reverse the bacteriostatic effect. high  oral doses of iron (0.5 mg per animal) were effective but small doses (0.5 mg per animal) were ineffective. parenteral iron administration had a delayed effect on  the reversal of the bacteriostatic effect of endotoxin. transferrin administered  orally caused a clear bacteriostatic effect in both endotoxin pretreated and untreated mice. campylobacter counts were always lower in the small intestine than in the large intestine both in control and in endotoxin pretreated mice. this indicates that the large intestine is the primary ecological niche where campylobacters colonise mice.

TI  == endotoxic activity and enterotoxigenicity of human strains of campylobacter jejuni isolated from patients in a nigerian hospital.
AB  == limulus gelation assay and dermal schwartzman reaction provided a sensitive and reproducible means of testing the endotoxic activity of hospital strains of campylobacter jejuni in lagos, nigeria. all the 22 isolates of campylobacter jejuni tested for the limulus gelation assay were positive for the production of  endotoxin. furthermore, the campylobacter suspensions caused a positive dermal schwartzman reaction in rabbits. the area of skin reaction was less extensive than that produced by escherichia coli 01114b and e7539/77 which served as positive controls. five local strains of campylobacter jejuni tested for enterotoxin production showed negative reaction in the infant mouse test whereas  enterotoxin production was observed in campylobacter jejuni strain 11168 and escherichia coli e7539/77. consequently, the infant mouse test may not be suitable for enterogenicity testing of our local isolates of campylobacter jejuni.

TI  == mixed infections in childhood diarrhoea: results of a community study in kiambu district, kenya.
AB  == one thousand four hundred and twenty diarrhoea specimens from 846 children aged 0 to 60 months were collected and analysed for bacteria, parasites and rotavirus over a 16 month period, from june 1985 to september 1986 inclusive. the study was conducted in 4 villages situated in kiambu district, kenya. all the specimens were analysed for rotavirus and parasites, including cryptosporidium. the majority of the specimens were analysed for enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec), shigella, salmonella, campylobacter and aeromonas. only 387 specimens were analysed for enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec). however, of this proportion analysed for etec, 33% were positive. a total of 344 specimens were negative for  any organisms while a further 140 were only positive for parasites which have been implicated as being pathogenic, including ascaris lumbricoides, hymenolepis  nana, trichomonas hominis and blastocysts hominis were considered to be at least  potentially pathogenic and capable of causing diarrhoea. an average of only 29.4% of these organisms occurred as single isolates. the remaining infections were mixed, with a maximum of 7 potentially pathogenic organisms occurring together in a single specimen. the associations of certain organisms were significant, notably campylobacter with giardia lamblia. campylobacter with epec, epec with ascaris, and g. lamblia with rotavirus. the latter was a negative association.

AB  == between november 1982 and april 1985, 2228 children under the age of 5 years with acute gastroenteritis were admitted to the paediatric isolation ward of queen mary hospital, department of paediatrics, university of hong kong. in 56.2% the causative agent was identified as rotavirus, salmonella, campylobacter, shigella, escherichia coli or a combination of these pathogens. our isolation procedures included cohort nursing of all diarrhoeal patients in two separate rooms (each accommodating 6 patients), barrier gowns and stringent handwashing with chlorhexidine. a total of 163 cases (13.4% of all positive cases) were identified as nosocomial infections. rotavirus was the responsible agent for nosocomial infection in 128 cases (20% of all rotavirus infection). there were 35 patients with bacterial nosocomial infection, (7% of all the bacterial positive cases). nosocomial rotavirus gastroenteritis was 3.4 times more frequent than nosocomial  gastroenteritis due to bacterial pathogens. we conclude that modification of our  present isolation procedures is necessary in order to reduce rotavirus nosocomial infection.

TI  == applications of a new method for devising bacteriological serotyping schemes.
AB  == greatly simplified serotyping schemes were devised for two organisms, escherichia coli and campylobacter jejuni. the mathematical approach developed to improve the e. coli serotyping routine at the national health institute in new zealand was used on three previously published data sets. it had been considered possible that the mathematical method used in the first study was specific to that data set and therefore not applicable elsewhere. this paper verifies that the mathematical method works on two other e. coli collections and on another bacterium, c. jejuni, and therefore greatly strengthens the assertion made in the earlier paper (c.j. thompson, j. clin. microbiol. 25:774-780, 1987) that this mathematical approach has general applications and can be used to produce efficient and effective serotyping schemes in any laboratory choosing to apply the method to its set of sera.

AB  == eleven strains comprising representatives of different subspecies, biotypes, and  serotypes of campylobacter jejuni and reference strains of c. coli, c. fetus subsp. fetus, c. hyointestinalis, and c. sputorum subsp. sputorum were studied to assess the utility of different dna profiles for measuring fine differences between allied bacteria. strains were compared by analyses of haeiii and xhoi digest patterns of chromosomal dna and southern blot hybridization patterns of xhoi digests obtained with an escherichia coli 16s + 23s rrna gene probe. visual  comparisons and numerical analyses of the haeiii and xhoi digest patterns both revealed clear differences between the five campylobacter species and between representatives of c. jejuni subspecies and biotypes. only strains with the same  penner serotype gave identical total digest polymorphisms. the advantages of xhoi total digests and southern blot hybridization patterns were that they were less complex than the haeiii patterns and easier to compare visually. however, numerical analysis of xhoi data resulted in reduced discrimination. we conclude that dna fingerprinting using either haeiii or xhoi fragment polymorphisms has considerable potential as a generally applicable method for identification of campylobacter isolates, especially at the infrasubspecific level.

AB  == a novel kanamycin phosphotransferase gene, apha-7, was cloned from a 14-kb plasmid obtained from a strain of campylobacter jejuni and the nucleotide sequence of the gene was determined. the presumed open reading frame of the apha-7 structural gene was 753 bp in length and encoded a protein of 251 amino acids with a calculated weight of 29,691 da. a 29-kda protein was demonstrated in escherichia coli maxicells containing the cloned apha-7 gene. a ribosomal binding site corresponding to 5 of 8 bases of the 3' end of the e. coli 16s rrna was 8 bp upstream of the start codon. sequences corresponding to the -35 and -10 regions of the consensus promoter sequences of e. coli were upstream of the presumed initiation codon of the gene. the dna sequence was most closely related to the apha-3 gene from streptococcus faecalis, showing 55.4% sequence similarity. there was 45.6% identity at the amino acid level between the apha-3 and the apha-7 proteins. of the three conserved regions noted previously in phosphotransferase genes, the apha-7 amino acid sequence was identical to the six conserved amino acids in motif 3, but differed in one of the five conserved amino acids in motif  1 (if gaps are permitted) and 3 of the 10 conserved residues in motif 2. the 32.8% g + c ratio in the open reading frame of the apha-7 kanamycin resistance gene, which is similar to that of the c. jejuni chromosome, suggests that the apha-7 may be indigenous to campylobacters.

AB  == recent work by epidemiologists and microbiologists has uncovered several hitherto unrecognized food-borne bacterial pathogens of public health significance. one of these, listeria monocytogenes, has attracted considerable attention because of two major cheese-related outbreaks of listeriosis that were characterized by cases of meningitis, abortion, and perinatal septicemia. thus far, l. monocytogenes has been responsible for well over 300 reported cases of food-borne listeriosis, including about 100 deaths, and has cost the dairy industry alone more than 66 million dollars as a result of product recalls. the ability of l. monocytogenes to grow at refrigeration temperatures, coupled with appearance of the pathogen in raw and processed meats, as well as poultry, vegetables, and seafood, makes this bacterium a serious threat to susceptible consumers and to the entire food industry. yersinia enterocolitica, another psychrotrophic food-borne pathogen of recent concern, was linked to several outbreaks of yersiniosis associated with consumption of both raw and pasteurized milk, as well as contaminated water. food-borne infections involving y. enterocolitica typically result in enterocolitis, which may be mistaken for acute appendicitis.  unfortunately, inadvertent removal of healthy appendixes from victims of food-borne yersiniosis is all too common. although known for many years, campylobacter jejuni has only recently been recognized as a food-borne pathogen and a leading cause of gastroenteritis in the united states. notable outbreaks of campylobacteriosis linked to consumption of raw milk, cake icing, eggs, poultry,  and beef have underscored the need for thorough cooking and proper handling of raw products.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == etiology of childhood diarrhea in korea.
AB  == to assess the role of recently recognized enteropathogens in childhood diarrhea in korea, 231 children with diarrhea admitted to and 104 children without diarrhea seen at the well-baby clinic or the outpatient department of hanyang university hospital in seoul, korea, were evaluated during a 14-month period. stools were cultured for bacterial pathogens, including enterotoxigenic (heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxin-producing) and enteroadherent organisms. only those stools obtained from patients with diarrhea were examined for rotavirus. all escherichia coli isolates were screened for shiga-like toxin (slt) i, slt-ii, enterohemorrhagic e. coli fimbriae, and enteroinvasiveness by colony hybridization. one or more pathogens were identified in 75.8% of the children with diarrhea. rotavirus was the most frequently identified pathogen, accounting  for 47% of the cases. other major enteropathogens were enterotoxigenic e. coli (22%), clostridium difficile (16%), enteroadherent e. coli (15%), and enteropathogenic e. coli (6%). shigella spp., campylobacter jejuni, salmonella spp., slt-i-and enterohemorrhagic-e. coli-fimbria-probe-positive e. coli serotype o26:h11 and enteroinvasive e. coli were isolated from only a few patients. aeromonas hydrophila and e. coli o157 were not isolated. compared with those of the controls, the isolation rates of heat-stable-enterotoxin-producing e. coli (p less than 0.05), c. difficile (p less than 0.025), and enteroadherent e. coli (p  less than 0.05) were significantly higher in the patients with diarrhea. the greatest number of rotavirus, enterotoxigenic e. coli, and c. difficile cases were identified during the cool, dry months of october and november.

TI  == rapid method to detect shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin i based on binding to globotriosyl ceramide (gb3), their natural receptor.
AB  == shiga toxin and the closely related shiga-like toxins produced by escherichia coli represent a group of very similar cytotoxins that may play an important role in diarrheal disease and hemolytic uremic syndrome. these toxins have the same biologic activities and according to recent studies also share the same binding receptor, globotriosyl ceramide (gb3). they are currently detected, on the basis  of their ability to damage several cell lines, by using expensive and tedious assays that require facilities for and experience with tissue cultures and are therefore most suitable for research laboratories. we have developed a rapid method to detect shiga toxin and shiga-like toxin i based on specific binding to  their gb3 natural receptor, which was coated onto microdilution plates. bound toxin was then detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) with monoclonal antibodies. the sensitivity of the gb3 elisa was 0.2 ng (2 ng/ml) of purified toxin. the assay was positive with sonic extracts of shigella dysenteriae serotype 1 strain 6or (a shiga toxin producer), e. coli serotype o26:h11 strain h30, and e. coli serotype o157:h7 (both shiga-like toxin i producers). the assay was very specific in that no cross-reactivity was noted with purified cholera toxin, e. coli heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins, and clostridium difficile cytotoxin, or sonic extracts of other cytotoxin-producing organisms, such as other shigellae, pathogenic and nonpathogenic e. coli, salmonella spp., campylobacter spp., and aeromonas spp. these results were in complete agreement with a [3h]thymidine-labeled hela cell cytotoxicity assay and with detection of the structural genes by dna hybridization studies with a shiga-like toxin i probe. quantitative analysis showed a high correlation between gb3 elisa and hela cell assay when fractions obtained at various stages of toxin purification were examined by both methods (r = 0.99, p < 0.01). this rapid gb3 elisa is sensitive and specific and may be diagnostically useful in cytotoxin-related infections.

TI  == enteroaggregative escherichia coli associated with persistent diarrhea in a cohort of rural children in india.
AB  == a cohort of 452 rural children was followed longitudinally for 13 mo to ascertain the role of hep-2 cell adherent escherichia coli and other pathogens in causing acute (less than or equal to 14 d) and persistent (greater than 14 d) diarrhea. aeromonas, campylobacter jejuni, e. coli manifesting localized adherence to hep-2 cells and enterotoxigenic e. coli were significantly associated with acute diarrhea. e. coli strains that exhibit aggregative adherence, so-called enteroaggregative e. coli, a newly-described category of diarrheagenic e. coli distinct from enterotoxigenic, enteroinvasive, enterohemorrhagic, and enteropathogenic e. coli, were found significantly more often in patients with persistent diarrhea (29.5%) than with acute diarrhea (12.8%) (p = .0052) or controls (9.9%) (p = .0006).

TI  == cloning of ureaplasma urealyticum dna sequences showing genetic homology with urease genes from gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == dna chromosomic sequences from ureaplasma urealyticum were shown, by dna hybridization, to possess homology with providencia stuartii urease genes. the homologous ureaplasma dna fragment was cloned in escherichia coli and a dna probe, designated ic61 probe was specific for only the urease-producing u. urealyticum among the mollicutes. genetic homology shown between the ic61 probe and urease genes from campylobacter pylori, e. coli and p. stuartii suggests that (1) the cloned dna fragment from u. urealyticum contains urease encoding sequences, and that (2) the urease genes possess conserved sequences among phylogenetically distant prokaryotes.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of lomefloxacin, a difluoro-quinolone.
AB  == lomefloxacin is a new difluoro-quinolone. in this study, we have determined the in vitro activity of lomefloxacin against a wide range of clinical bacterial isolates and compared it with that of other fluoro-quinolones and some unrelated  antimicrobials. lomefloxacin was very active against enterobacteriaceae (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) with activity comparable to that of ofloxacin (mic90, 0.25 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was moderately active against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), and again the activity was comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml) but was eightfold less than ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was also active against isolates of staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 1 micrograms/ml), irrespective of methicillin susceptibility, and this activity was most comparable to ofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml) and ciprofloxacin (mic90, 0.5 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was fourfold less active than either ofloxacin or ciprofloxacin against isolates of enterococcus faecalis (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml) and streptococcus pneumoniae (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). in common with ofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin was very active against isolates of neisseria spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), haemophilus spp. (mic90, less  than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), legionella spp. (mic90, less than or equal  to 0.06 micrograms/ml), vibrio spp. (mic90, less than or equal to 0.06 micrograms/ml), and campylobacter jejuni (mic90, 1 microgram/ml). lomefloxacin showed poor activity against isolates of bacteroides spp. (mic90, 16 micrograms/ml) or clostridium difficile mic90, 32 micrograms/ml) and was only moderately active against isolates of clostridium perfringens (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), peptostreptococcus spp. (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), chlamydia trachomatis (mic90, 4 micrograms/ml), mycoplasma hominis (mic90, 2 micrograms/ml), and urea-plasma urealyticum (mic90, 8 micrograms/ml). lomefloxacin was found to be bactericidal at concentrations generally close to the mic with greater than 3 log10 reduction in viability of exponentially dividing cultures of escherichia coli and s. aureus within 5 hr of exposure to concentrations at eight times the mic. these results indicate a potential clinical role for lomefloxacin in the treatment of genitourinary tract infections caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respiratory tract infections  caused by susceptible organisms, and soft tissue infections caused by s. aureus.

AB  == between 1982 and 1985 the cadavers of 50 guillemots (uria aalge), 41 kittiwakes (rissa tridactyla), 26 herring gulls (larus argentatus) and 34 black-headed gulls (larus ridibundus) were examined pathological, bacteriological and virological. the probable cause of death was established. parasitosis were particularly prevalent in herring gulls (49%), where the main infection--as in black-headed gulls--was with cestoides. in kittiwakes and guillemots mainly spiruroideae were  recorded. the commonest bacterium isolated in organs and intestinal tract was escherichia coli, followed by aeromonas hydrophila and clostridium perfringens. salmonella were found in the organs of 5% and in the intestinal tract of 3% of the birds. the species of salmonella most frequently isolated was salmonella typhimurium varieties copenhagen. also recorded were yersinia intermedia serovar  0:17 (1x), pseudomonas spp. (2x), bacteria of the haemophilus-pasteurella-actinobacillus group (1x), pasteurella multocida (2x), moraxella septicaemiae (1x), campylobacter spec. (1x), mycoplasma spec. (6x), dnase positive staphylococcus spec. (4x) and streptococcus spec. (6x). less in evidence among the birds examined were fungus diseases with aspergillus spec. (4x) and blastomyces spec. (4x). as for viruses one guillemot was found to have an adenovirus and another one to have a paramyxovirus. from one of the herring gulls there also was isolated a paramyxovirus, from a second one to a reovirus. three other species isolated have get to be identified. the chief cause of sickness and death in the guillemots was oil-contamination. the majority of the examined kittiwakes and herring gulls were victims of pathogenic agents. many of  the black-headed gulls died through traumata as gunshots or road traffic etc. in  order to establish the causes of sickness and death in seabirds and to ascertain  the importance of the various species as possible carriers of infectious diseases, a systematic series of investigation will be necessary. without this it will not be possible to assess their epidemiological relevance for other wild birds, domestic poultry and humans.

AB  == susceptibilities of various clinical isolates to ofloxacin (oflx) and other antibacterial drugs were examined at 128 hospital laboratories in 36 prefectures  throughout japan between april, 1986 and march, 1987. the results were totalized  with an emphasis mainly on oflx and were compared with data obtained in the previous year. in this study, identification and susceptibility tests of the isolates were carried out at each hospital laboratory and the tests were performed according to the 1-dilution or 3-dilution disc method in which susceptibilities are classified into 4 grades: , ++, +, and -. similarly to the study performed in the previous year, species showing susceptibilities to oflx included staphylococcus aureus (4,205 strains), staphylococcus epidermidis (2,009 strains), entercoccus faecalis (1,697 strains), streptococcus pneumoniae (702 strains), escherichia coli (4,097 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (1,375 strains), enterobacter cloacae (762 strains), enterobacter aerogenes (296 strains), citrobacter freundii (406 strains), proteus mirabilis (613 strains), morganella morganii (320 strains), serratia marcescens (869 strains), haemophilus influenzae (1,282 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4,206 strains), acinetobacter calcoaceticus (351 strains), acinetobacter sp. (415 strains), and campylobacter jejuni (151 strains). neisseria gonorrhoeae (26 strains) were exceptional due to  their smaller number this time than that of the previous year and only the susceptibility to oflx was investigated with this species. as results, oflx showed strong antibacterial activities (similar to the previous year) against s.  aureus, s. epidermidis, n. gonorrhoeae, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, c. freundii, p. mirabilis, m. morganii, h. influenzae, a. calcoaceticus, acinetobacter sp., and c. jejuni. however, when these susceptibilities shown in the present study were compared to those obtained in the previous year, many species showed decreases in the occurrence of or increases in -, though they were rather small changes. the following species were not totalized in the previous year due to their low numbers but were summarized in combination with those examined in this study: streptococcus pyogenes (944 strains), streptococcus agalactiae (815 strains), enterococcus faecium (146 strains), branhamella catarrhalis (135 strains), citrobacter diversus (128 strains), klebsiella oxytoca (873 strains), proteus vulgaris (438 strains), serratia liquefaciens (266 strains), pseudomonas cepacia (433 strains), pseudomonas putida (154 strains), xanthomonas maltophilia (272 strains), vibrio parahaemolyticus (120 strains), bacteroides fragilis (98 strains),

TI  == incidence and etiology of infantile diarrhea and major routes of transmission in  huascar, peru.
AB  == community-based studies of diarrhea etiology and epidemiology were carried out from july 1982-june 1984 in 153 infants residing in a poor peri-urban community near lima, peru. study infants had nearly 10 episodes of diarrhea in their first  year of life. diarrhea episodes were associated with organisms such as campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic and enteropathogenic escherichia coli, shigella, rotavirus, and cryptosporidium. these organisms appeared to be transmitted to infants in the home through animal feces, through contaminated water and food, and by direct person-to-person contact. a particularly important  route of transmission may have been weaning foods, which were often contaminated  because of improper preparation and inadequate cleaning of utensils. improved feeding practices, along with avoidance of animal feces and improved personal and domestic hygiene, should be considered important interventions in reducing the high incidence of diarrhea in infants in developing countries.

TI  == [recent bacterial risks in foods].
AB  == knowledge about bacterial foodborne diseases has broadened over the last 15 years. to this development have contributed improved isolation and identification methods but also the application of systematic epidemiological studies. in principle, no "new" bacteria have been discovered but their occurrence in foods was not known (e.g. campylobacter jejuni/coli) or their detection in foods could  not be firmly linked with disease in man (e.g. listeria monocytogenes, e. coli o157:h7). for campylobacteriosis, listeriosis and yersiniosis foods are considered to be the main source of infection. many of these "new" agents cannot  only be detected in diseased, but also in healthy man and the environment. frequently importance of foods as source of infection can only be proved by epidemiological studies. traditional isolation and identification procedures are  not sufficient to differentiate between virulent and avirulent strains. molecular genetic methods as applied for e.g. enterotoxigenic e. coli allow the detection of virulence factors, however, in many instances relationship is lacking between  the frequency of detection of a certain strain in food and clinical manifestation of disease. in particular, the recent listeriosis problems reveal the importance  of individual host defence mechanisms and infectious doses for the evaluation. these aspects challenge the ideal complete absence (i.e., zero tolerance) of a certain microorganism in a specific food.)

AB  == the coumamidines are novel antibiotics with activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. all microbiological studies were performed on coumamidine gamma 1. the mic90s (micrograms/ml) of coumamidine  are as follows: staphylococcus aureus 1.0, streptococcus pyogenes 8, enterobacteriaceae 2.0, pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli 1, legionella pneumophila 8, haemophilus influenzae 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater 0.5, neisseria gonorrhoeae 0.5. coumamidine had mics ranging from 8 to greater than 64 for most anaerobes, except some peptostreptococcus strains. the aminoglycoside super-sensitive strain, p. aeruginosa bmh 10, was also super-sensitive to coumamidine (mic 0.2 micrograms/ml). coumamidine was rapidly bactericidal for s.  aureus. the viable bacterial count in logarithmic phase cultures was reduced to less than 10 cfu within 2 hours after exposure to 4 times the mic (3.12 micrograms/ml) of coumamidine. the frequency of resistance development was less than 1 x 10(-9) for escherichia coli and s. aureus when selected at 4 and 8 times the mic. the cmax in mouse serum after a single subcutaneous dose of 25 mg/kg of  coumamidine was 4.5 micrograms/ml and t1/2 was 1 hour. coumamidine is stable in serum. in mouse protection tests against s. aureus nctc 10649 the ed50 was less than 0.6 mg/kg/day when it was administered subcutaneously at 1 and 5 hours after infection. coumamidine was not absorbed after oral administration. the antibacterial spectrum, bactericidal activity, stability in serum and low frequency of resistance make this an interesting new class of antibiotics.

AB  == campylobacter jejuni is one of the main etiologic agents of gastrointestinal illness in developing and developed areas throughout the world. isolation of enterotoxin-producing c. jejuni has been associated with clinical symptoms of a watery-secretory type of diarrhea. although physiological and immunological relatedness has been demonstrated between the c. jejuni enterotoxin (cjt), the vibrio cholerae enterotoxin (ct), and the heat-labile cholera-like escherichia coli enterotoxin (lt), nucleotide sequence similarity between c. jejuni dna and either the toxa, toxb, elta or eltb genes remained to be shown. we found that binding to ganglioside gm1 prevented recognition of cjt by monoclonal antibodies  directed to either ct or lt. this indicates antigenic similarity between the three enterotoxins in the ganglioside gm1-binding site. therefore we searched for corresponding similarities at the dna level and found, by oligodeoxynucleotide hybridization, c. jejuni chromosomal nucleotide sequences similar to the coding region for a postulated ganglioside gm1-binding site on toxb and eltb.

AB  == a gene bank of campylobacter pylori dna in escherichia coli was constructed by cloning sau3a-cleaved dna fragments into the bacteriophage vector lambda embl3. the expression of c. pylori antigens was determined by screening the gene library with adsorbed c. pylori whole-cell rabbit antisera. one recombinant clone which reacted positively (lambda cp2) was studied further. immunoblot analysis with lambda cp2 showed a polypeptide band of 66 kilodaltons (kda) reacting antigenically with the adsorbed antiserum. extraction of dna from lambda cp2 and  digestion with sali revealed a dna insert of 17 kilobases (kb). subcloning with sali and the e. coli vector puc18 showed that the dna also encoded a 31-kda antigen. the cloned antigens were shown by immunoblotting to have the same molecular weight in e. coli as in c. pylori and to be present in all c. pylori strains. antiserum was raised against the cloned polypeptides and found to react  only with c. pylori when analyzed by dot blotting and indirect immunofluorescence. the cloned antigens were determined to be expressed from the  puc18 lac promoter. the dna encoding these antigens was radiolabeled with 32p and found to hybridize only to c. pylori strains. immunoblotting with affinity-purified polyclonal antibody to the urease enzyme of c. pylori revealed  that the cloned antigens may be part of the urease enzyme.

AB  == few data exist in bangladesh on longitudinal, community-based studies of bacterial or parasitic pathogens identified in routine and diarrhoeal stools of urban dwelling children. we undertook the following study on 343 children of age  less than 6 years who resided in one of 51 slum settings in dhaka, bangladesh, between october 1984 and february 1986. specimens from diarrhoeal episodes and from routine stools obtained at 3-monthly intervals were examined for parasites,  rotavirus and pathogenic bacteria. parasites were isolated from 509 (51%) of the  1006 routine stools and from 95 (42%) of the 225 diarrhoeal stools. isolation rates steadily increased with age. ascaris lumbricoides and trichuris trichiura accounted for approximately 80% of all parasitic isolates in routine and diarrhoeal stools. giardia lamblia was isolated from 11% diarrhoeal stools. entamoeba histolytica was an uncommon isolate (less than 1%). bacterial pathogens were identified in 55 (24%) of the diarrhoeal stools but were identified in only  164 (16%) of the 1028 routine stools examined (p less than 0.01). toxigenic escherichia coli, shigellae and campylobacter were the most frequent isolates from diarrhoeal and routine specimens. this pathogen profile appears to be more in keeping with that from urban settings in other developing countries than from  rural bangladesh, suggesting that extrapolations from rural-based data should not be made for urban settings.

AB  == the results are presented of the second part of the studies conducted for monitoring of the variability of bacterial factors causing diarrhoea in the youngest children. the presently reported study comprised 42 babies aged from 7 days to 18 months treated in hospital in january 1987. the number of children with diarrhoea hospitalized in this period was relatively smaller than in january 1985, while the incidence of enteropathogenic bacteria in stools was very similar. they included mainly klebsiella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli strains, especially in the youngest children. in only one case salmonella arizonae was found while in 1985 a very high number of salmonella agona strains were cultured, especially from newborns. in both parts of the study campylobacter jejuni and yersinia enterocolitica were never found in stools. in both parts of the study the course of bacterial diarrhoea was mostly moderately severe, loose stools continued usually for 3-4 days, but in the second part more cases of severe diarrhoea were noted, which, however, could not have been related to the bacterial species cultured from stools or to the presence of mixed bacterial flora. the importance is stressed of the carrier state of enteropathogenic bacteria which was observed in three-fourths of patients in january 1987, while in january 1985 this was present in nearly all cases without diarrhoea.

AB  == in order to determine the descriptive epidemiology of persistent diarrhoea in rural northern india, a cohort of 963 children aged 0-71 months was followed prospectively for 12 months through weekly household visits. the incidence of persistent diarrhoea was 6.3 per 100 child-years among those aged 0-71 months, and was highest (31 per 100 child-years) among those aged 0-11 months. there were no significant sex-related differences in the incidence of the disease, and the overall seasonal distribution of acute and persistent diarrhoea was similar. the  persistence of diarrhoeal symptoms was significantly correlated with a higher initial mean stool frequency (p less than 0.01) and passage of gross blood with stools (p less than 0.001). persistent diarrhoea was an important problem among children during the first 2 years of life. established enteric pathogens were isolated during the initial illness in 46.4% of persistent and 55.4% of acute episodes. pathogens isolated during persistent episodes included enterotoxigenic  escherichia coli (etec 9.3%), salmonella spp. (4.7%), as well as campylobacter (4.7%), shigella spp. (2.3%), entamoeba histolytica (2.3%), and rotavirus (2.3%). similar proportions of these pathogens were isolated also during episodes of acute diarrhoea. multiple pathogens were isolated in 7% of the persistent and 5%  of the acute episodes. e. coli that manifested aggregative adherence (eaec-a) was more common (34.9% versus 12.3%) in persistent than acute episodes (p less than 0.01), and initial faecal excretion of eaec-a was significantly associated with the persistence of a diarrhoeal episode.

TI  == microbiologic and clinical study of acute diarrhea in children in aswan, egypt.
AB  == children with diarrhea presenting to a government rehydration center in aswan, egypt, were investigated to determine the etiology and clinical presentation of acute childhood diarrhea in southern egypt. among 126 outpatients and 25 inpatients with diarrhea (mean age 18 months), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) (17% of cases), cryptosporidium (9%), salmonella spp. (7%), campylobacter  jejuni/coli (7%), and shigella spp. (5%) were the most common enteropathogens identified during the high incidence season of july. enteropathogens were isolated as often from inpatients as outpatients, except for salmonella spp. and  cryptosporidium, which were recovered more often from inpatients. salmonella-infected children, in particular, were more ill, feverish, and dehydrated on presentation than other children, resulting in more frequent hospitalization. except for salmonella-infected children, children with acute diarrhea usually presented without severe dehydration, which may have been due to frequent initiation of oral rehydration therapy (ort) by mothers trained by local health care providers. a potential environmental source of etec was identified in clay water storage containers commonly used in this area.

TI  == cloning and expression of the campylobacter jejuni glya gene in escherichia coli.
AB  == genetic studies of campylobacter jejuni are greatly hampered by the lack of genetic markers and an established classical gene transfer mechanism between strains of this species. to facilitate future genetic studies and to provide a recombinant dna approach for analyzing genes of c. jejuni, we constructed an extensive genomic library of a pathogenic c. jejuni strain tgh9011 (serotype 0:3) using pbr322. we report the isolation of a number of recombinant plasmids containing the complete structural gene of glya, that encodes serine hydroxymethyltransferase (shmt) of c. jejuni. escherichia coli cells containing this multicopy recombinant plasmid with the glya gene produce high levels of shmt. the shmt-encoding fragment was identified by subcloning and functional complementation. the expression of the c. jejuni glya gene was probably via transcription initiated from its own promoter.

TI  == survival of coliforms and bacterial pathogens within protozoa during chlorination.
AB  == the susceptibility of coliform bacteria and bacterial pathogens to free chlorine  residuals was determined before and after incubation with amoebae and ciliate protozoa. viability of bacteria was quantified to determine their resistance to free chlorine residuals when ingested by laboratory strains of acanthamoeba castellanii and tetrahymena pyriformis. cocultures of bacteria and protozoa were  incubated to facilitate ingestion of the bacteria and then were chlorinated, neutralized, and sonicated to release intracellular bacteria. qualitative susceptibility of protozoan strains to free chlorine was also assessed. protozoa  were shown to survive and grow after exposure to levels of free chlorine residuals that killed free-living bacteria. ingested coliforms escherichia coli,  citrobacter freundii, enterobacter agglomerans, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella  pneumoniae, and klebsiella oxytoca and bacterial pathogens salmonella typhimurium, yersinia enterocolitica, shigella sonnei, legionella gormanii, and campylobacter jejuni had increased resistance to free chlorine residuals. bacteria could be cultured from within treated protozoans well after the time required for 99% inactivation of free-living cells. all bacterial pathogens were  greater than 50-fold more resistant to free chlorine when ingested by t. pyriformis. escherichia coli ingested by a cyclidium sp., a ciliate isolated from a drinking water reservoir, were also shown to be more resistant to free chlorine. the mechanism that increased resistance appeared to be survival within  protozoan cells. this study indicates that bacteria can survive ingestion by protozoa. this bacterium-protozoan association provides bacteria with increased resistance to free chlorine residuals which can lead to persistence of bacteria in chlorine-treated water. we propose that resistance to digestion by predatory protozoa was an evolutionary precursor of pathogenicity in bacteria and that today it is a mechanism for survival of fastidious bacteria in dilute and inhospitable aquatic environments.

TI  == immune response to acute diarrhea seen as circulating antibody-secreting cells.
AB  == we studied the immune response to acute diarrhea by examining antibody-secreting  cells among peripheral blood lymphocytes, which are believed to be derived from the intestinal mucosa and to be on their way back there. in 23 of 24 patients, a  dramatic increase in the total number of cells actively secreting immunoglobulins was detected one week after onset of diarrhea, and most of the cells were secreting iga. cells secreting antibody specific to the pathogen (campylobacter jejuni or salmonella spp.) also appeared at this time but accounted for only a part of the total response. the data suggest that diarrhea induces a vigorous, apparently polyclonal response, including antibodies to normal intestinal flora.  the response to the infective agent was outstanding and suggests that this method can be used to identify the causative agent of an infection.

TI  == shigella flexneri invasion plasmid antigens b and c: epitope location and characterization with monoclonal antibodies.
AB  == invasion plasmid antigens b (ipab) and c (ipac) are associated with the ability of shigellae to invade cultured mammalian cells. monoclonal antibodies against ipab and ipac polypeptides were produced and used in a whole-cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to show that both ipab and ipac polypeptides were exposed on  the surface of virulent shigellae. moreover, these surface epitopes were shown to be highly conserved among different serotypes of shigella spp. and enteroinvasive escherichia coli. cross-reactive epitopes were not found on noninvasive shigella  strains or on other enteric bacteria including salmonella, yersinia, campylobacter, vibrio, and aeromonas spp. and various pathogenic strains of e. coli. the monoclonal antibodies were used in competitive binding assays to define three unique epitopes of the ipab polypeptide and four unique epitopes of the ipac polypeptide. epitope locations and their corresponding dna-encoding regions  were defined by examining the ipab and ipac products expressed by lambda gt11 recombinants and by constructing a genetic map of the insert dnas of these recombinants. three ipab epitopes (2f1, 1h4, 4c8) were found to be encoded on three contiguous dna regions comprising a 700-base-pair (bp) segment that corresponded to the amino-terminal end of the ipab polypeptide. similarly, a 640-bp dna segment that corresponded to the amino-terminal end of the ipac polypeptide was found to encode three clustered ipac epitopes (5h1, 9b6, 5b1). approximately 50 bp downstream from this region a fourth ipac epitope-encoding region (2g2) was found. the effect of the monoclonal antibodies on plaque formation by virulent shigella flexneri on a monolayer of cultured mammalian cells (a sensitive measure of invasiveness) was determined. only the ipab-specific monoclonal antibody 2f1 was able to reduce the plaque-forming capacity by greater than 50%, suggesting that this epitope of the ipab polypeptide is involved in the invasion process.

TI  == management and prevention of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the etiology, pathogenesis, transmission and communicability, diagnosis, and management of infectious diarrhea are reviewed. infectious diarrhea is common in  both industrialized and unindustrialized areas of the world. better understanding of the etiology and pathogenesis and identification of "new" enteric pathogens has resulted in the use of a variety of drugs to relieve symptoms or to effect a  clinical cure. both host and microbial virulence factors are key in the acquisition of diarrheal illness. host factors such as extreme age, a dysfunctional gastrointestinal tract, or underlying immunodeficiency enhance the  risk of illness after ingestion of a pathogen or its toxins. microbial virulence  factors (the pathogen's ability to invade or produce enterotoxins, neurotoxins, or cytotoxins) characterize the type of illness manifested and the symptom complex (e.g., acute watery diarrhea versus chronic dysentery). supportive care is indicated in the majority of cases of infectious enteritis, and rehydration is considered the mainstay of therapy in any diarrheal illness accompanied by dehydration. antimicrobial therapy is beneficial in the treatment of severe diarrhea caused by shigella, campylobacter spp., vibrio cholerae, escherichia coli, and clostridium difficile. infectious diarrhea is common but is often self-limited and of short duration. therapy frequently consists of symptomatic relief and fluid replacement.

AB  == cell lysates and culture supernatants of 36 campylobacter isolates from patients  with enteritis were tested for cytotoxic activity on hela cells. cytotoxic activity was considered shiga-like if neutralized by monoclonal antibody to the b subunit of shiga-like toxin i of escherichia coli and rabbit anti-shiga toxin. fifteen of the campylobacter isolates produced no detectable cytotoxin, 10 produced a non-neutralizable cytotoxin, and 11 produced low levels of a cell-associated slt. however, under low stringency conditions no hybridization was observed between a dna fragment containing cloned slt-i genes and restriction enzyme-digested total dna from a campylobacter strain that produced low levels of a shiga-like toxin i. the shiga-like toxin neutralizing titers in sera from 15 patients with c. jejuni infections, 5 patients infected with s. sonnei, and 20 healthy persons were then determined. no rise in neutralizing titer between acute and convalescent sera of patients with c. jejuni infection or s. sonnei infection was observed, although 27% of c. jejuni-infected patients, 40% of s. sonnei-infected patients, and 30% of the healthy controls had neutralizing activity in their sera. these data indicate that low levels of shiga-like toxin are produced by some campylobacter isolates but that slt is genetically distinct  from the slt-i toxin produced at high levels by certain e. coli. the findings also suggest that exposure to slts is common in the adult population but not as a consequence of infection with c. jejuni or s. sonnei.

TI  == gastro-enteritis in australian children: studies on the aetiology of acute diarrhoea.
AB  == a prospective, year-long study of the microbiology of childhood gastro-enteritis  in perth showed that (i) aeromonas-associated diarrhoea was the commonest recognized bacterial cause for acute diarrhoea, especially in summer, (ii) campylobacter infections were the next most common bacterial cause, (iii) rotavirus and parasites were not significant causes of sporadic acute childhood diarrhoea, and (iv) enteric bacterial pathogens and intestinal parasites were often isolated from aboriginal children, whether they had diarrhoea or not. infections with enterotoxigenic bacteria, including enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) and enterotoxigenic aeromonas spp., were important causes of acute diarrhoea in aboriginal children. this is probably due to faecal pollution of their living environment and inadequate personal and community hygiene. infections with enterotoxigenic bacteria, especially etec, are major causes of acute diarrhoea where living conditions are unsatisfactory, as in many developing countries. simple and cheap methods are needed to identify these infections. a biotyping method was used to screen for etec which could improve the efficiency of recognizing these bacteria and help to reduce the number of tests needed to identify etec.

TI  == diarrheal infections.
AB  == infectious agents usually cause diarrhea by invading and damaging the intestinal  mucosa or by producing enterotoxins that alter the secretory and absorptive capacities of the intestinal mucosa. some infectious agents may do both. physical malabsorption produced by proliferative outgrowth of bacteria or protozoa may also occur. rotavirus is the most common cause of pediatric infectious diarrhea in the united states. escherichia coli and campylobacter species are the most common bacterial agents.

AB  == direct electron microscopy (em) and enzyme-immunoassay (rotazyme) results for the detection of rotaviruses in 346 enteric specimens from calves, lambs, piglets and foals were compared. the rotazyme test was at least 3 times more sensitive than direct em in diagnosing infection. rotavirus antigen was demonstrated by rotazyme in 22% of 280 scour samples and in 27% of 66 samples from non-scouring animals. there was an association between diarrhoea and higher amounts of rotavirus antigen. this prevalence of rotaviruses detected in animals with diarrhoea highlights the significant involvement of other pathogens identified in the study including eimeria, cryptosporidia, escherichia coli, campylobacter, and other viruses.

TI  == the ultrastructure and atpase nature of polar membrane in campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == polar membrane in campylobacter jejuni has been visualized on membrane vesicles.  it was composed of doughnut-shaped particles 5-6 nm in diameter, with stalks, arranged in a hexagonal array. this structure was stabilized on the membrane by a high ionic strength buffer in the presence of 2-mercaptoethanol. histochemical staining indicated localized atpase activity at the poles of the cells. an atpase with distinctive properties has been isolated and purified from this organism; it gives a specific activity of approximately 0.3 units/mg of protein. electron microscopy showed doughnut-shaped particles 5-6 nm in diameter. nondissociating and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of the purified enzyme revealed, respectively, a single band with atpase activity and a molecular weight of ca. 75,000 da. the enzyme was cold labile and activity was abolished by trypsin. dicyclohexylcarbodiimide inhibited the membrane-bound form of the enzyme, but did not inhibit the soluble form. oligomycin had no inhibitory activity on either form of the enzyme. the enzyme specifically hydrolysed atp, but other nucleotide substrates were not degraded. the enzyme was activated by mg2+ and inhibited by ca2+, whereas other ions had no effect on activity. antibodies prepared to this enzyme bound to the polar regions of whole cells as shown by protein a - colloidal gold immunoelectron microscopy. the antibodies to  this atpase cross reacted (shown by western blotting) with four proteins from a whole-cell extract of this organism, two proteins in aquaspirillum serpens mw5, and three proteins from escherichia coli k12. they did not cross-react with any proteins from spirillum volutans, methanococcus voltae, vibrio cholerae, or rat liver mitochondria. antibodies raised against the f1-atpase of e. coli k12 cross  reacted with six proteins in a whole-cell extract of this organism, and one protein species in each of the whole-cell extracts of v. cholera, a. serpens mw5, s. volutans, and rat liver mitochondria. these antibodies did not recognize any whole cell proteins from either c. jejuni or m. voltae. these results along with  the atpase activity localized by histochemical staining suggest that polar membrane is an assembly of atpase molecules at the poles of the cell and that the atpase isolated from c. jejuni is serologically and structurally unusual.

TI  == gene disruption and replacement as a feasible approach for mutagenesis of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli are important causes of human enteric infections. several determinants of pathogenicity have been proposed based on the clinical features of diarrheal disease and on the phenotypic properties of campylobacter strains. to facilitate an understanding of the genetic determinants of campylobacter virulence, we have developed a method for constructing c. jejuni mutants by shuttle mutagenesis. in the example described here, a kanamycin resistance gene was inserted into campylobacter dna fragments encoding 16s rrna cloned in escherichia coli. these disrupted, modified sequences were returned to  c. jejuni via conjugation. through the apparent process of homologous recombination, the kanamycin resistance-encoding sequences were rescued by chromosomal integration, resulting in the simultaneous gene replacement of one of the 16s sequences of c. jejuni and the loss of the vector. we propose that campylobacter isogenic mutants could be developed by using this system of shuttle mutagenesis.

TI  == a specific dna probe for the identification of campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == a 6.1 kb dna probe for the human enteric pathogen campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from a genomic library constructed in the plasmid vector pbr322 in escherichia coli. the dna sequence used as a probe was identified from recombinant plasmids following immunological screening of transformants using polyclonal antisera to whole cells and to membrane antigens of c. jejuni. restriction endonuclease fragment mapping of c. jejuni dna inserts from three of  the recombinant plasmids showed an overlapping dna fragment. one of these recombinant plasmids, when used as a dna probe in southern hybridization, specifically hybridized with chromosomal dna from all of the c. jejuni strains tested. hybridization was not detected at high stringency between the dna probe and chromosomal dna from any other campylobacter species tested except weakly with the chromosomal dna of strains of campylobacter coli. hybridization was also not detected with chromosomal dna from a range of other enteric bacteria likely to be encountered in faecal material. the intensity of hybridization with c. coli could be increased by reducing the stringency of hybridization.

TI  == development and testing of invasion-associated dna probes for detection of shigella spp. and enteroinvasive escherichia coli.
AB  == genetic determinants of the invasive phenotype of shigella spp. and enteroinvasive escherichia coli (eiec), two common agents of bacillary dysentery, are encoded on large (180- to 210 kilobase), nonconjugative plasmids. several plasmid-encoded antigens have been implicated as important bacterial ligands that mediate the attachment and invasion of colonic epithelial cells by the bacteria.  selected invasion plasmid antigen (ipa) genes have recently been cloned from shigella flexneri serotype 5 into the lambda gt11 expression vector. portions of  three ipa genes (ipab, ipac, and ipad) were tested as dna probes for diagnostic detection of bacillary dysentery. under stringent dna hybridization conditions, all three dna sequences hybridized to a single 4.6-kilobase hindiii fragment of the invasion plasmids of representative virulent shigella spp. and eiec strains.  no hybridization was detected in isogenic, noninvasive shigella mutants which had lost the invasion plasmid or had deleted the ipa gene region. furthermore, these  probes did not react with over 300 other enteric and nonenteric gram-negative bacteria tested, including salmonella, yersinia, edwardsiella, campylobacter, vibrio, klebsiella, aeromonas, enterobacter, rickettsia, and citrobacter spp. and various pathogenic e. coli strains. the use of unique invasion-essential gene segments as probes for the specific detection of invasive dysentery organisms should benefit both epidemiologic and diagnostic analyses of shigella spp. and eiec.

TI  == enteropathogens associated with acute infantile diarrhoea in cape town.
AB  == the results of a year-long controlled study on the causation of acute infectious  diarrhoea in infants are reported. campylobacter fetus subspecies jejuni, rotavirus and certain enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) types were identified as the most common enteropathogens. shigella, salmonella group b and yersinia enterocolitica were significant but less common pathogens. campylobacter, rotavirus, the significant epec types and shigella infections were more frequent in the warm summer and autumn months. this only partially accounts  for the marked summer peak of diarrhoea, since at this time the percentage of cases of undetermined causation is highest (61%). over the year an identifiable cause of the diarrhoea was found in 49% of the patients studied. a specific epec  type, 0126:k71(b16), appeared to vary in pathogenicity on a seasonal basis. multiple enteropathogens occurred relatively frequently.

AB  == the motility of four strains of campylobacter jejuni in solutions of varying viscosity was measured and compared to that of a number of conventional rod-shaped bacteria (crsb). all the bacteria tested showed an initial increase in velocity in the low viscosity solutions--between 1 and 3 centipoise (1 p = 0.1 pa s). however, only the campylobacters were actively motile in highly viscous solutions with velocities ranging from 60 to 100 micron s-1. all strains of c. jejuni tested showed three separate peaks of motility as the viscosity of the solution was increased. a higher proportion of c. jejuni cells exhibited longer path lengths when the viscosity of the surrounding medium was increased from 1.4  to 57 cp. the findings of the study suggest that c. jejuni has a motility suited  to movement in a viscous environment, and that this ability might provide the organism with an ecological advantage when in intestinal mucus. it is proposed that the mechanism of motility changes depending on the viscosity of the supporting environment.

(9%). rotavirus occurred largely during winter, whereas salmonellas and campylobacter sp. occurred more commonly during summer and autumn, respectively. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli was rarely isolated (1%), and the isolates were clonally diverse. a small percentage (2.8%)  of e. coli had serological specificities commonly associated with enteropathogenic e. coli, but only two of the isolates were also positive for hep-2 adhesive factor. pure or heavy and predominant growth of e. coli was obtained in repeated stool cultures of 432 (19%) of these episodes, which did not yield any of the above-mentioned pathogens. although associated with diarrhea, these e. coli isolates possess neither the pathogenic attributes of enterotoxigenic e. coli nor the properties commonly associated with enteropathogenic e. coli. enteroinvasive e. coli and enterohemorrhagic e. coli were considered unlikely causes on clinical grounds.

AB  == enteroinvasive salmonella, shigella, and escherichia coli strains were found to exert an effect which rendered campylobacter jejuni capable of intracellular localization in epithelial cells in vitro. when monolayers of hep-2 or a-549 cells were challenged with pure cultures of c. jejuni or campylobacter coli, none of the eight strains tested invaded the cells. in contrast, four of these strains were able to localize intracellularly when the cells were challenged with a mixture of campylobacters and enteroinvasive salmonella typhimurium, shigella flexneri, shigella boydii, shigella sonnei, or e. coli strains. invasiveness of campylobacters was also induced by one nonenteroinvasive strain of e. coli o124.  coinfection with other nonenteroinvasive e. coli strains did not induce invasiveness in c. jejuni. the degree of internalization induced by s. typhimurium was significantly higher than that induced by shigella or e. coli strains. the invasive capacity of c. jejuni was found to differ considerably between strains. no evidence of an invasive potential was demonstrable for two c. coli strains or for two enterotoxigenic isolates of c. jejuni examined. c. jejuni was only able to localize intracellularly in cell cultures when the interaction occurred in a microaerobic atmosphere. none of the strains tested evoked keratoconjunctivitis in guinea pig eyes (sereny test), regardless of the presence of coinfectants. the results indicate that a synergistic interaction that exists  between c. jejuni and other enteropathogens facilitates invasion by c. jejuni.

TI  == production of a unique cytotoxin by campylobacter jejuni.
AB  == campylobacter jejuni is an important diarrheal pathogen worldwide; the mechanisms by which it causes disease remain unclear. because of its association with inflammatory diarrhea, we postulated that c. jejuni might produce a cytotoxin similar to that produced by shigella sp., enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli o157, or clostridium difficile. filtrates of 12 polymyxin-treated isolates of c.  jejuni were placed on hela cells (sensitive to shiga toxin cytotoxicity) and chinese hamster ovary (cho) cells. of 12 isolates of c. jejuni tested, 5 killed 50% of the cells at greater than or equal to 1:4 dilutions of filtered suspensions of 10(9) bacteria per ml; killing was similar in hela and cho cells (the cho cells being insensitive to shiga cytotoxin). one isolate produced a titer of 1:32 to 1:128. the relative potency in hela cells was comparable to that of e. coli strains that produce intermediate amounts of shiga-like toxin. the other seven strains showed no cytotoxic effect, nor did the control diluents, polymyxin b, or supernatants of c. jejuni not treated with polymyxin b. sonication also released active cytotoxin, but slightly less well than did polymyxin. the cytotoxic effect was dose dependent. concentration of the c. jejuni in suspension by 10-fold before treatment with polymyxin b resulted in a 10-fold increase in the 50% cytotoxic dose. the cytotoxin effect was not neutralized by shiga toxin immune serum against either shiga-like toxin i or ii or by anti-clostridium difficile antiserum. the c jejuni cytotoxin was partially  labile to trypsin (0.25%) and to heating to greater than or equal to 60 degrees c. cytotoxicity was retained in scientific products dialysis tubing d1615-1 (mr cutoff, 12,000 to 14,000). some isolates of c. jejuni release a substance lethal  to hela or cho cells in vitro that is distinct from shiga-like or clostridium difficile toxin. this cytotoxin may contribute to the colonic mucosal invasive process that characterizes c. jejuni enteritis.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of lysozyme against bacteria involved in food spoilage and food-borne disease.
AB  == egg white lysozyme was demonstrated to have antibacterial activity against organisms of concern in food safety, including listeria monocytogenes and certain strains of clostridium botulinum. we also found that the food spoilage thermophile clostridium thermosaccharolyticum was highly susceptible to lysozyme  and confirmed that the spoilage organisms bacillus stearothermophilus and clostridium tyrobutyricum were also extremely sensitive. several gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from food poisoning outbreaks, including bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter jejuni, escherichia coli o157:h7, salmonella typhimurium, and yersinia enterocolitica, were all resistant. the results of this study suggest that lysozyme may have selected applications in food preservation, especially when thermophilic sporeformers are problems, and as a safeguard against food poisoning caused by c. botulinum and l. monocytogenes.

AB  == the tetracycline resistance gene (tet) from the campylobacter jejuni plasmid pfkt1025 was cloned into both puc18 and pbr322 and was expressed when the chimeric plasmids were introduced into escherichia coli. the location of the tet  determinant on the chimeric plasmids was determined by bal 31 deletion mapping within a 2.25-kilobase (kb) rsai-hincii fragment. a protein of approximately 70 kilodaltons was consistently produced by e. coli maxicells harboring the cloned tet determinant. a 500-base-pair restriction fragment from within the 2.25-kb tet region was shown to hybridize only to dna from tetracycline-resistant strains of  c. jejuni and c. coli, but not to the dna of organisms known to carry the streptococcal tetm determinant. no homology was noted between the dna of 10 tetracycline-resistant isolates of campylobacter and the streptococcal tetl, tetm, or tetn determinants when tested under conditions of high stringency. however, homology was noted between a 5.0-kb hincii restriction fragment containing the tetm determinant and two c. jejuni tet r factors under conditions  of reduced stringency.

TI  == characterization and expression of a cloned tetracycline resistance determinant from campylobacter jejuni plasmid pua466.
AB  == a tetracycline resistance (tcr) determinant previously cloned from the campylobacter jejuni plasmid pua466 (d. e. taylor, j. bacteriol. 165:1037-1039, 1986) was localized by restriction endonuclease mapping, subcloning, and tn1000 insertion mutagenesis to a 2-kilobase region consisting of 1.8- and 0.2-kilobase  hincii fragments. tcr encoded by the cloned fragment (puoa1) was expressed constitutively in escherichia coli. a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 68,000 encoded by puoa1 was produced in an in vitro transcription-translation  system and in minicells. tn1000 insertions which resulted in inactivation of tcr  expression also resulted in an alteration in the 68,000-molecular-weight protein. some mutants specified a truncated protein, whereas others completely lost the ability to specify the protein. the protein which appears to be involved in the expression of tcr specified by c. jejuni plasmids is of approximately the same molecular weight as the protein specified by the streptococcal class m determinant. this finding is consistent with our previous results which indicate  that homology exists between the tcr determinant from c. jejuni and a 5-kilobase  hincii probe derived from the streptococcal class m determinant.

TI  == acquisition by a campylobacter-like strain of apha-1, a kanamycin resistance determinant from members of the family enterobacteriaceae.
AB  == a campylobacter-like organism, bm2196, resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin-spectinomycin was isolated from the feces of a patient with acute enteritis. the kanamycin and streptomycin-spectinomycin resistances were not transferable to camplylobacter sp. or to escherichia coli, and no plasmid dna was detected in this strain. the resistance genes were therefore tentatively assigned to a chromosomal locality. analysis by the phosphocellulose paper-binding assay of extracts from bm2196 indicated that resistance to kanamycin and structurally related antibiotics was due to the synthesis of 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase type i [aph(3')-i], an enzyme specific for gram-negative bacteria, and that resistance to streptomycin-spectinomycin was secondary to the  presence of a 3",9-aminoglycoside adenylyltransferase. homology between bm2196 and an aph(3')-i probe was detected by dna-dna hybridization. a 2.2-kilobase bm2196 dna fragment conferring resistance to kanamycin was cloned in e. coli and  was sequenced partially. the resistance gene appeared nearly identical to that of tn903 from e. coli and was adjacent to is15-delta, an insertion sequence widespread in gram-negative bacteria, thus indicating that campylobacter species  can act as a recipient for genes originating in members of the family enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == a total of 111 clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni and 10 clinical isolates of campylobacter coli were characterized by their susceptibility to nine antimicrobial agents and by their plasmid profiles on agarose gel electrophoresis. all of the c. jejuni isolates were susceptible to chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, kanamycin, and nalidixic acid, but  55% were tetracycline resistant. in the 10 c. coli isolates, a high prevalence of multiple-antibiotic resistance was noted. plasmids were found in 82% of the tetracycline-resistant and 15% of the tetracycline-susceptible c. jejuni isolates. tetracycline resistance in six randomly selected c. jejuni isolates, which contained 50- or 135-kilobase (kb) plasmids, was transferred by conjugation to a campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus recipient with recovery of a 50- or a 45-kb plasmid from transconjugants. from one multiple-antibiotic-resistant c. coli isolate, resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, and chloramphenicol was transferred concomitantly with a 58-kb plasmid, pnr9589. nonconjugative 98-kb plasmids, pnr9131 and pnr9581, from c. coli isolates with resistance to tetracycline, kanamycin, and erythromycin were shown by cloning experiments to code for at least kanamycin resistance. restriction digests revealed that 50-kb plasmids from tetracycline-resistant c. jejuni isolates were identical, although  plasmids from multiple-antibiotic-resistant c. coli isolates shared partial dna homology to each other. cloning of the kanamycin and chloramphenicol resistance genes of pnr9589 into escherichia coli showed that the two genes are closely linked or clustered. double-digestion analysis of the fragments encoding the kanamycin resistance of pnr9131, pnr9581, and pnr9589 showed that these three plasmids contain a common fragment related to kanamycin resistance.

TI  == current problems in antimicrobial therapy for bacterial enteric infection.
AB  == trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is currently considered the treatment of choice for shigellosis and severe travelers' diarrhea. the problem with this combination regimen is inactivity against campylobacter jejuni strains and other bacterial enteropathogens showing in vitro resistance to the drug. resistance to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole among enteric pathogens has occurred frequently in  certain areas of the world. a study of the in vitro susceptibility of enteric bacterial pathogens isolated from multiple countries was recently performed. the  minimal inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin required to inhibit 90 percent  of the 210 bacterial enteropathogens ranged from 0.25 micrograms/ml for c. jejuni to 0.016 micrograms/ml for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, salmonella, and shigella. in a clinical trial carried out in a united states student population that acquired diarrhea while in mexico, it was shown that ciprofloxacin was as effective as trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and both were significantly (p less than 0.001) more effective than placebo. the average duration of diarrhea was 29  or 20 hours after initiation of treatment with ciprofloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively, compared with 81 hours in the placebo group. the antimicrobial agents were more efficacious than placebo in treating diarrhea caused by enterotoxigenic e. coli, invasive enteropathogens, and unknown pathogens. ciprofloxacin and the quinolone derivatives are uniquely suited to the therapy of acute bacterial diarrhea in areas where c. jejuni is commonly found and where trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole-resistant strains regularly occur.

AB  == for the purpose of making inventories, the chemical and microbiological composition of samples of flocculated sludge of poultry, pig and cattle-stock slaughter-houses were examined. this was required to study the possibilities of using flocculated sludge as raw material in animal feed. chemical studies showed  that the dry matter (dm) levels of the various specimens of sludge varied markedly. (broiler sludge 7.1% of dm, pig sludge 7.5%, cattle-stock sludge 5.5% and laying-hen sludge 13.3%). broiler- and laying-hen sludge contained more crude fat than did the other samples of sludge. measured by the concentrations of lysine, methionine and cystine, the sludge product was most similar to the protein of meal-and-bone meal and soy-bean meal. the iron content of almost all samples examined was very high. in view of the current standards for concentrations of metal in complete animal feeds, the concentrations of iron and  lead will have to be taken into account in using this sludge product. the proportion of total polymers in the fat fractions of samples of sludge varied from 2.4% to 39.2%, less than 10% only being observed in two samples. the microbiological composition of broiler and pig sludge did not differ. both the total aerobic bacterial count and the number of enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli and salmonella were found to be high. species of campylobacter were not isolated; however, a number of samples were found to be positive for adenovirus.  prior to deciding to use flocculated sludge in livestock feeding, the product will have to undergo thorough decontamination.

AB  == human infections caused by aeromonas spp. are being reported with increased frequency. we examined 1012 unselected stool specimens from 799 children for various pathogens, including aeromonas spp., to evaluate the clinical associations of aeromonas spp. in the stools of children in the east end of london. a total of 33 children had positive cultures for aeromonas spp. these were identified as: aeromonas hydrophila (16), a. sobria (9), a. caviae (8). aeromonas spp. were identified by being oxidase positive in character, a property that distinguishes aeromonas spp. from enterobacteriaceae. associated pathogens included salmonella typhimurium (1), campylobacter spp. (3), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (2), and giardia lamblia (1). electron microscopic examination of the stool of 13 children revealed viral particles in two, rotavirus (1), and coronavirus-like particles (1). the associated clinical features in the 25 children with only aeromonas excretion were diarrhea (21), vomiting (10), abdominal pain (9), fever (4), and mild dehydration (2). five patients had macroscopic blood loss in the stools. the illness was generally mild and lasted only a short time.

TI  == substrate utilization by campylobacter jejuni and campylobacter coli.
AB  == an attempt was made to elucidate in campylobacter spp. some of the physiologic characteristics that are reflected in the kinetics of co2 formation from four 14c-labeled substrates. campylobacter jejuni and c. coli were grown in a biphasic medium, and highly motile spiral cells were harvested at 12 h. of the media evaluated for use in the metabolic tests, minimal essential medium without glutamine, diluted with an equal volume of potassium sodium phosphate buffer (ph  7.2), provided the greatest stability and least competition with the substrates to be tested. the cells were incubated with 0.02 m glutamate, glutamine, alpha-ketoglutarate, or formate, or with concentrations of these substrates ranging from 0.0032 to 0.125 m. all four substrates were metabolized very rapidly by both species. a feature of many of these reactions, particularly obvious with  alpha-ketoglutarate, was an immediate burst of co2 production followed by co2 evolution at a more moderate rate. these diphasic kinetics of substrate utilization were not seen in comparable experiments with escherichia coli grown and tested under identical conditions. with c. jejuni, co2 production from formate proceeded rapidly for the entire period of incubation. the rate of metabolism of glutamate, glutamine, and alpha-ketoglutarate by both species was greatly enhanced by increased substrate concentration. the approach to the study  of the metabolism of campylobacters here described may be useful in detecting subtle changes in the physiology of cells as they are maintained past their logarithmic growth phase.

AB  == the nucleotide sequence of the tetracycline resistance gene tetm encoded by streptococcal conjugative shuttle transposon tn1545 has been determined. the resistance gene was identified as a coding sequence of 1917 base pairs corresponding to a protein with a mr of 72,500 daltons. this value is in good agreement with that, 68,000 daltons, estimated by sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of escherichia coli minicell extracts. the tetm gene product does not exhibit any sequence homology with either the gram-negative (teta, tetb and tetc), or the bacillus and staphylococcus tetracycline resistance proteins. the average hydropathy value of the tetm gene product (-0.21) contrasts with those calculated for the other tet proteins which are markedly hydrophobic (0.76 to 0.93). hybridization experiments performed with an intragenic tetm probe do not support the claim [taylor, d. (1986), j. bact. 165, 1037-1039)] that tetracycline resistance in campylobacter is due to acquisition of tetm.

AB  == in 8 villages of rural northeastern egypt, a 2-year study of the etiologic agents associated with episodes of diarrhea was carried out. stool specimens (3,243) from 3,513 episodes of diarrhea were processed for enteropathogens. the most commonly identified agents in the group with diarrhea were giardia lamblia (44%), heat stable enterotoxin (st)-producing enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) (15%), heat labile toxin (lt)-producing etec (12%), enteropathogenic e. coli (epec) (4%), rotavirus (3%), shigella (2%) and salmonella (1%). isolation rates were increased in cases compared to controls for all agents except g. lamblia and epec strains. rotavirus, salmonella and st-producing etec were more frequently isolated during cooler months and shigella and lt-etec occurred more commonly in  warmer months. campylobacter, epec, giardia and e. histolytica did not show a discernable seasonal pattern. rotavirus was primarily associated with diarrhea in infants only. forty-four percent of children experienced at least 1 bout of rotavirus diarrhea by the age of 3 years. vomiting was reported in 65% of cases of rotavirus infection. dehydration was reported in greater than 40% of those with rotavirus-, salmonella-, campylobacter-, lt-etec- and epec-associated illness and in those without an identifiable agent. while rotavirus was implicated in 3% of cases overall, when vomiting or vomiting plus dehydration occurred, rotavirus was identified with a rate of 10% and 12%, respectively. dysentery was common only in shigella cases, occurring in 24%. a decrease in occurrence of rotavirus, campylobacter and possibly epec illness was seen in the  infants less than 6 months of age who were breast-fed when compared to those who  were not.

TI  == preparation of oligodeoxynucleotide-alkaline phosphatase conjugates and their use as hybridization probes.
AB  == short synthetic oligonucleotides have been covalently cross-linked to alkaline phosphatase using the homobifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate. the oligomers, twenty-one to twenty-six bases in length, are complementary to unique  sequences found in herpes simplex virus, hepatitis b virus, campylobacter jejuni  and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli. each oligomer contains a single modified base with a 12-atom "linker arm" terminating in a reactive primary amine. cross-linking through this amine results in oligomer-enzyme conjugates composed of one oligomer per enzyme molecule that have full alkaline phosphatase activity  and can hybridize to target dna fixed to nitrocellulose within 15 minutes. the hybrids are detected directly with a dye precipitation assay at a sensitivity of  10(6) molecules (2 x 10(-18) mol) of target dna in 4 hours development time. the  enzyme has no apparent effect on selectivity or kinetics of oligonucleotide hybridization and the conjugates can be hybridized and melted off in a conventional manner.

TI  == [enteropathogens in travellers returning from the tropics].
AB  == diarrhea is not only the most common health hazard during travel in the tropics but also the most frequent condition which prompts returning travellers to see a  physician. the prevalence of bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens in people attending our outpatient department after returning from the tropics has been studied and the laboratory results of stool examinations have been compared with  clinical symptoms. of the 173 persons enrolled, 19 (11%) harboured bacterial pathogens and pathogenic protozoans (giardia lamblia and entamoeba histolytica) were found in 26 (15%). the data of 156 patients were evaluated. enteropathogenic bacteria and/or protozoa were found in 29 (46%) of the 63 patients presenting with diarrhea at the time of investigation. in contrast, 10 (11%) of the 93 asymptomatic subjects had enteropathogenic organisms in the feces (p less than 0.01). the results appear to confirm that bacteriological stool examinations of travellers returning from the tropics without diarrhea are not usually indicated, even if a history of transient travellers' diarrhea is reported. parasitological  investigations are justified in this group only if asymptomatic carriage of giardia or e. histolytica is considered an indication for specific treatment.

TI  == bacterial toxins and diarrhoea.

AB  == fecal samples from calves on 78 randomly selected holstein dairy farms in southwestern ontario were screened for salmonella, campylobacter jejuni/coli, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, rotavirus and coronavirus. based on the observed prevalence, 22% of farms had calves infected with salmonella, 13% with campylobacter jejuni/coli, 41% with enteropathogenic e. coli, 19% with rotavirus  and 5% with coronavirus. these estimates can be modified, using a method developed by mullen and prost (1983) for the world health organization, to account for the nature of the laboratory test used. if the test is assumed to have no false positives (that is, if an organism is detected it must be there), then the observed prevalence estimates seen on this study may greatly underestimate the true prevalence of infected premises. the use of nipple feeders for calves was associated with an increased probability of farms having calves shedding detectable fecal levels of salmonella, e. coli, or one of the two viruses. the use of group pens was associated with an increased odds of finding c. jejuni. calves with diarrhea on these farms tended to have increased odds of shedding rotavirus, and e. coli with the k99 antigen. however, at the farm level, none of the organisms was associated with above median levels of morbidity. farms positive for one or other of the viruses had increased odds of experiencing calf  mortality relative to virus-negative farms, and farms positive for c. jejuni/coli had decreased odds of mortality.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == bacterial contamination of the small intestine of infants with enteropathogenic escherichia coli and other enteric infections: a factor in the aetiology of persistent diarrhoea?
AB  == the duodenal microflora was studied during the first week of diarrhoea in 40 infants with acute infectious diarrhoea of different aetiologies and compared with that in a convalescent group and a group in whom diarrhoea of known aetiology had persisted for more than 14 days after an acute onset. in the acute  phase 16 of the 40 infants had more than 10(4) colony forming bacteria/ml, predominantly upper respiratory commensals. in over half of the infants infected  with enteropathogenic escherichia coli a faecal type flora was found in the duodenum. this flora included the enteropathogenic e coli serotype isolated from  the stool in three quarters of cases. infants with persisting diarrhoea had significantly more faecal type bacteria in the duodenum than either those with acute diarrhoea or the convalescent group. in addition, there was a significant further increase in enterobacteriaceae in infants whose persistent diarrhoea occurred after infection with enteropathogenic e coli. infections with enteropathogenic e coli may have a predilection for disturbing the duodenal microflora, which may contribute to the development of persistent diarrhoea.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy for infectious diarrhea.

TI  == pathogens that cause travelers' diarrhea in latin america and africa.
AB  == with the advent of rapid and convenient means of transportation, millions of persons travel each year from industrialized to developing countries in the tropics and subtropics. these travelers are at risk for a variety of infectious diseases that are endemic in these areas; the most frequently occurring of these  is diarrhea. studies of groups of travelers to latin america and africa have found that approximately one-half develop diarrhea during their stay abroad. etiologic investigations of these illnesses have demonstrated that the important  agents that cause travelers' diarrhea are similar to those that cause diarrhea in children in the developing countries. one-third of the cases are associated with  enterotoxin-producing strains of escherichia coli. smaller proportions appear to  be due to rotavirus, norwalk virus, shigella, salmonella, giardia lamblia, and entamoeba histolytica. although they have not been fully evaluated in travelers'  illnesses in latin america or africa, campylobacter jejuni, aeromonas hydrophila, other viruses, and cryptosporidium probably cause some of the currently unexplained cases of diarrhea.

TI  == campylobacter pyloridis, gastritis, and peptic ulceration.
AB  == campylobacter pyloridis is a spiral bacterium which was seen by histopathologists several years before it was cultured in 1982 in perth, western australia. it has  unique cellular fatty acids, predominantly tetradecanoic acid and cis-11, 12 methylene octadecanoic acid. it also has a unique ultrastructure which is different from that of other campylobacters. c pyloridis possesses a powerful urease enzyme and produces large amounts of extracellular catalase. both these features may be important virulence factors, allowing it to occupy a protected niche in the stomach below the mucus layer but above the gastric mucosa. specific lesions are found in the gastric mucosa, and ultrastructural studies show the presence of adherence pedestals identical with those found with enteropathogenic  escherichia coli of the intestine. histological examination of gastric biopsy tissue has shown that c pyloridis is strongly associated with active chronic gastritis, when polymorphonuclear leucocytes are present, and is not found on normal mucosa except when a biopsy specimen from elsewhere in the stomach shows active chronic gastritis. when patients with symptoms caused by gastritis are identified dual antibacterial treatment, combining the action of bismuth in the stomach with a systemic antibiotic, can eradicate c pyloridis, with remission of  symptoms and restoration of normal epithelial morphology. most peptic ulcers relapse after modern acid reducing treatment, and antibacterial treatment may be  beneficial in preventing relapse.

AB  == to determine whether lipopolysaccharide (lps) structures of campylobacter species are immunologically related to those of 11 other gram-negative organisms, we immunoblotted from polyacrylamide gels the lps of these strains with immune rabbit serum raised against six campylobacter jejuni strains and two campylobacter fetus strains. the lps studied were from salmonella minnesota wild  type and ra to re mutants, salmonella typhi, escherichia coli, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio cholerae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. none of the 11 lps preparations was recognized by the eight antisera, but antisera to each of the campylobacter strains recognized core determinants of some lps preparations. antiserum directed against the most serum-sensitive c. jejuni strain, 79-193, was the only antiserum sample that recognized core regions of the rough salmonella mutants. in converse experiments, when lps preparations from five campylobacter strains were blotted with antiserum to salmonella lipid a, recognition of core structures of each was shown; data from an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay confirmed this result. in contrast, antiserum to salmonella typhimurium re lps showed no reactivity. we conclude that lps of campylobacter strains share lipid a antigenic determinants with the core region of lps of several other gram-negative organisms.

TI  == prevalence of various enteropathogens in the feces of diarrheic and healthy calves.
AB  == the presence of various enteropathogens was examined in the feces of homebred dairy calves reared in a restricted geographical area of france (north west of county of indre-et-loire) during winter 1983-1984. two distinct surveys were carried on: a case-control study including 32 diarrheic calves and 21 healthy calves bred in 53 different farms; and a separate study on nine diarrheic calves  in another farm. the following infectious agents were looked for, by specific methods of detection: escherichia coli k99 and e. coli lethal for mice, salmonella species, yersinia enterocolitica, campylobacter jejuni, enterotoxigenic clostridium perfringens, chlamydia psittaci, rotaviruses, coronaviruses, cryptosporidium. in the case-control survey, no enterotoxigenic e. coli (k99+) was detected in either group of calves. four agents were more often detected in diarrheic calves than in healthy calves, i.e. rotavirus (12/32 vs 1/21), lethal e. coli (6/32 vs 1/21), cryptosporidium (2/32 vs 0/21) and salmonella typhimurium (1/32 vs 0/21). one at least of these four agents was present in 16 diarrheic calves (50%) vs only 2 healthy calves (10%) (p less than  0.01). on the other hand, the occurrence of campylobacter jejuni and of c. perfringens, enterotoxin was similar in both groups of calves, accounting respectively for about 20% and 10% of total calves. moreover, coronavirus-like particles were significatively associated with healthy calves (7/32 vs 11/21; p less than 0.05). in the other study, all the main categories of enteropathogens were detected throughout the period of observation in the same farm with the exception of enterotoxigenic e. coli. but each calf taken individually was rarely shedding more than two agents at a time. in addition, specific antibodies against c. perfringens enterotoxin, as tested in an elisa test, were present in the serum of all the calves examined in both surveys. this study confirms the primary role  of rotavirus and cryptosporidium as agents of diarrhea in calves under three weeks. it also suggests the possible participation of e. coli strains that are lethal for mice and underlines the potential hazard for human health of bovine reservoirs of campylobacter jejuni and enterotoxigenic c. perfringens.

TI  == in vivo transfer of genetic information between gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == a 1427-bp dna fragment containing the kanamycin resistance gene, apha-3, of plasmid pip1433 from campylobacter coli was inserted into a shuttle vector. full  expression of apha-3 was obtained in bacillus subtilis and in escherichia coli. this dna fragment was sequenced in its entirety and the starting point for apha-3 transcription in b. subtilis, c. coli and e. coli was determined by s1 nuclease mapping. the sequence of the promoter consists of the hexanucleotides ttgaca and  tataat, with a spacing of 17 bp. the nucleotide sequence of the apha-3 gene from  c. coli and from the streptococcal plasmid pjh1 are identical whereas they differ by two substitutions and deletion of a codon from that cloned from the staphylococcal plasmid psh2. these results indicate a recent extension of the resistant gene pool of gram-positive cocci to gram-negative bacilli. from an analysis of the dna sequences surrounding the promoter region, we concluded that  the dna fragment containing the apha-3 gene in plasmid pjh1 has evolved by deletions from a sequence similar to that found in plasmid pip1433.

TI  == [epidemiology, etiology and laboratory diagnosis of infectious diarrhea diseases  in the tropics].
AB  == diarrhoeal diseases belong to the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical countries, especially in infants and small children. about one billion episodes are estimated for this group of age with 4.6 million fatalities. many causes are discussed to explain the high incidence: bottle feeding of infants, protein malnutrition, unsafe drinking water and unsafe disposal of excrements and sewage, unsufficient consciousness of personal and domestic hygiene, lack of knowledge on the origin of disease, and inadequate food hygiene. among the viral  infectious agents rotavirus is isolated from 30-40% of enteritis cases in infants and small children; norwalk virus, adenovirus and human calicivirus, too, appear  to occur worldwide. enteropathogenic (epec) and, especially, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) are of primary importance as bacterial pathogens. campylobacter jejuni and c. coli primarily cause disease in infants and small children. shigellae are important whereas salmonellae are less frequently identified as a cause for diarrhoeal illness. yersinia enterocolitica is rare in  tropical countries. cholera and infections with other vibrionaceae (v. cholerae non-01, v. mimicus, v. parahaemolyticus, aeromonas, plesiomonas shigelloides) mainly occur in coastal areas. clostridium perfringens type c is the causal agent of enteritis necroticans in several countries, especially new guinea. c. difficile appears to be of minor importance. among the parasites giardia lamblia  and entamoeba histolytica are the most important organisms causing diarrhoeal disease. macroscopic (visible blood) and microscopic stool examination (faecal leukocytes) may be helpful in dysenteric disease to distinguish between shigella  and e. histolytica infections; it is, however, of limited usefulness to discriminate between organisms causing watery diarrhoea.

TI  == pathogenic properties of campylobacter jejuni: assay and correlation with clinical manifestations.
AB  == the pathogenic properties of 20 strains of campylobacter jejuni isolated from persons with clearly defined clinical manifestations were determined. cell-free broth filtrates were examined for (i) enterotoxin production by chinese hamster tissue culture assay and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) employing gm1 ganglioside and affinity-purified antiserum to escherichia coli heat-labile toxin, (ii) cytotoxin production by vero and hela cell tissue culture lines, and  (iii) their ability to cause fluid secretion in rat ligated ileal loops. viable bacteria were examined for invasive properties by an elisa with the immunoglobulin fraction of antiserum to formalin-killed bacteria of an invasive strain, and by their effect on fluid secretion and morphology in rat ligated ileal loops. none of the eight isolates obtained from asymptomatic carriers had any detectable pathogenic properties. all six strains isolated from persons with  bloody invasive-type diarrhea elaborated a cytotoxin; their viable bacteria had high titers in the elisa for invasive properties and caused fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops, although consistent morphologic abnormalities and evidence of mucosal invasion, examined by immunofluorescence techniques, were not detected. all six strains isolated from persons with watery secretory-type diarrhea produced an enterotoxin, one elaborated a cytotoxin, and broth filtrates of all strains caused fluid secretion in ligated ileal loops; viable bacteria had low titers in the elisa for invasive properties and evoked fluid secretion in ligated loops by means of enterotoxin production. these observations show (i) that a correlation exists between the pathogenic properties of the infective c. jejuni strain and gastrointestinal manifestations in the infected host, and (ii)  that these pathogenic properties can be identified by in vitro assays, including  elisas.

TI  == dna hybridization in the diagnosis of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == dna hybridization with either cloned genes for enteropathogenic determinants or dna segments that are species-specific is a valuable tool to identify certain bacterial enteric pathogens. thus far, only e. coli and v. cholerae enterotoxin gene probes have been used to identify etec and v. cholerae in clinical specimens. dna probes developed for salmonella, shigella, campylobacter, and enteroinvasive and enteropathogenic e. coli need to be evaluated with clinical specimens. the major contribution of this system so far has been to examine large numbers of specimens in epidemiologic studies. once nonradioactive dna probes are developed, this system will have potential application in clinical laboratories and in research laboratories in the developing world where diarrheal disease causes its greatest impact.

AB  == campylobacter coli strain bm2509 resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, erythromycin, kanamycin, spectinomycin, streptomycin and tetracycline was isolated from a patient with hospital-acquired diarrhoea. resistance to kanamycin has not been thus far described in campylobacter. phosphocellulose paper-binding  assay indicated that resistance to kanamycin and structurally related antibiotics in strain bm2509 was due to synthesis of a 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase of type iii (aph(3')-iii), an enzyme so far confined to gram-positive cocci. the  kanamycin and tetracycline resistances were transferable en bloc by conjugation to c. fetus but not to escherichia coli. analysis by agarose gel electrophoresis  of crude bacterial lysates revealed the presence, in bm2509 and in the transconjugants, of a plasmid, pip1433, with a size of 47.2 kilobases (kb). strain bm2509 also harboured a 4.5-kb cryptic plasmid. dna annealing studies indicated a close structural relationship between the kanamycin resistance gene of c. coli bm2509 and that representative of this type of resistance determinant  in gram-positive cocci. these results indicate that emergence of resistance to kanamycin in campylobacter is due to acquisition in vivo of a gene or a plasmid from gram-positive bacteria.

TI  == evaluation and diagnosis of acute infectious diarrhea.
AB  == the appropriate approach to the diagnosis and management of acute infectious diarrhea is determined by the frequency and setting of the illness, the recognizable causes or syndromes, the cost and yield of available diagnostic tests, and the treatability of the disease. acute diarrhea affects everyone throughout the world from one to more than six times each year, depending on age, location, and living conditions. the range of identifiable viral, bacterial, and  parasitic etiologies is great, and the cost of indiscriminate use of etiologic studies for diagnosis is prohibitive. because of its insensitivity for many organisms and poor selection of cases for testing, routine stool culture has been one of the most costly and ineffective microbiologic tests; the cost per positive result has traditionally exceeded $900 to $1,000. the appropriate treatment for the vast majority of cases (independent of their cause) is simple and effective:  oral glucose- and electrolyte-containing rehydration solution. on the basis of an appropriate history and understanding of pathogenesis, fecal specimens can be selectively obtained and promptly examined for leukocytes and parasites, and the  common noninflammatory diarrheas can be separated from the inflammatory infections in order to focus further studies on the latter group. the bacteria for which specific antimicrobial therapy should be considered usually cause inflammatory diarrhea in the united states. therefore, only when the history or fecal leukocyte findings indicates an inflammatory process is it appropriate to culture for the routine invasive bacterial pathogens. in sporadic inflammatory diarrhea, culture methods should include those for campylobacter jejuni as well as salmonella and shigella. several special circumstances may prompt a consideration of parasites (including giardia, entamoeba, strongyloides, cryptosporidium), vibrio, yersinia, clostridium difficile, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, food-borne agents, or sexually transmitted pathogens. the practical value of specific identification of rotaviruses (by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, rotazyme, or electron microscopy) is primarily epidemiologic, particularly in hospitalized infants or young children. using such a selective approach to fecal culture will greatly increase its yield and can reduce the cost per positive result from $1,000 to less than $150.

TI  == nonfluid therapy and selected chemoprophylaxis of acute diarrhea.
AB  == various available forms of therapy can decrease morbidity and mortality associated with acute diarrhea. oral fluids represent the cornerstone of therapy  of all cases. a variety of agents acting nonspecifically can decrease diarrhea and improve other worrisome symptoms associated with enteric infection. kaopectate makes the stool more formed but has little additional effects. bismuth subsalicylate, an antisecretory agent, reduces the number of stools passed by about 50 percent and improves other associated symptomatology. the drugs that affect motility such as loperamide and diphenoxylate are the most active of the nonspecifically acting drugs. they must be avoided in patients with significant fever and dysentery. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is now considered the drug of  choice for shigellosis due to the presence of ampicillin-resistant shigella strains in most regions of the world. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole is also an effective form of therapy for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli infection and for  traveler's diarrhea without definable cause. erythromycin, although not proved to be effective against campylobacter, probably shortens the disease. furazolidone,  although not dramatically effective, has a spectrum of activity that includes shigella, enterotoxigenic e. coli, campylobacter, and giardia lamblia. it may not be effective in severely ill (hospitalized) patients with diarrhea. the various forms of available therapy can be administered empirically, depending on symptomatology. mildly ill patients (one to three unformed stools in 24 hours with minimal additional symptoms) probably are best treated with fluids only. mild to moderately ill persons (three to six unformed stools in 24 hours) can be  treated with a drug that acts nonspecifically, such as bismuth subsalicylate or loperamide. those with severe diseases (six or more unformed stools with moderate to severe associated symptoms), particularly when associated with fever and the passage of bloody mucoid stools, may be given an antimicrobial agent. the antimicrobial drug given will be determined by ancillary laboratory tests (dark-field examination or examination of a wet-mount preparation for motile campylobacter or stool culture for shigella, campylobacter, or salmonella) or may be administered on an empiric basis. traveler's diarrhea can be eliminated in selected persons by the administration of a pharmacologic agent. liquid bismuth subsalicylate is effective in large doses, which may be impractical. studies with the tablet formulation suggest that it is partially effective in preventing the illness. doxycycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole are more effective, particularly when admini

TI  == etiology and epidemiology of diarrheal diseases in the united states.
AB  == accurate data on the frequency of acute diarrheal illness and the distribution of pathogens are not available for several reasons, including the facts that only a  small fraction of cases come to the attention of physicians and that available diagnostic tests establish an etiology in only about half of these. in a survey of three groups of patients in a community (upper-middle class and lower class outpatients and hospitalized infants), a possible cause was found in fewer than 20 percent of outpatients, and rotavirus accounted for the majority. however, asymptomatic colonization with rotavirus is very common in early infancy, and demonstration of the antigen correlates with a causative role in diarrhea in only about one half of cases. data on cases of shigellosis over a 15-year period in dallas compared with the centers for disease control national data demonstrate that epidemiologic patterns in any given community can differ substantially from  the national data. day-care centers are important sources of giardia and shigella infections in the community. the epidemiologic roles of newly reported causes of  diarrhea (campylobacter laridis, blastocystis hominis, cryptosporidium species, and aeromonas hydrophila) are being explored. generalizations about etiology and  epidemiology of pathogens in diarrheal disease are invalid unless the population  group is defined socioeconomically and geographically.

AB  == stool cultures of 188 children hospitalized for gastroenteritis in a two-year period (1981-1982) yielded salmonella in 25.5%, campylobacter in 16.0%, and y. enterocolitica in 3.7% of cases. rotavirus was identified in 22.3% of cases. out  of 82 lactose-positive microorganisms isolated from as many cases, three (one e.  coli and two klebsiella) produced heat-labile enterotoxin and two e. coli strains a "cytotoxic" toxin (in an hep-2 in vitro model); two other e. coli strains possessed adhesive properties for hep-2 cells in vitro; none revealed enteroinvasive for hep-2 cells. two out of 70 e. coli strains were epec. from stools of 643 childhood out-patients salmonella was isolated in 9.6% of cases; campylobacter and y. enterocolitica in 9.0% and in 0.6% of cases respectively. rotavirus was not looked for. shigella strains were not isolated. among 622 children without gastrointestinal symptoms, five (0.8%) excreted campylobacters and one (0.16%) salmonella. children of 18-24 months of age were significantly more often infected with campylobacter. gross blood in feces, body temperature greater than 38 degrees c, and peripheral leukocytosis were significantly more often associated with salmonella infection; vomiting and absence of blood in stools and of leukocytosis with rotavirus infection. other features were not significantly associated with the etiological agent of the illness. except for salmonella infections, the enteritis cases did not show any pronounced seasonal pattern.

TI  == a two-year longitudinal study on the etiology of acute diarrhea in young children in northern italy.
AB  == during a 24-month period, 561 young children (6 months-2 years of age) hospitalized for acute diarrhea were studied for enteric pathogens. patients positive for one or more pathogens were 359 (64.0%). infection with one pathogen  was found in 266 (47.4%) patients, whereas multiple infection was detected in 93  (16.6%) patients. enteropathogens associated with disease were rotaviruses: 150 (26.7%), adenoviruses: 99 (17,6%), non-polio enteroviruses: 48 (8.5%), coronaviruses: 10 (1.8%), parvoviruses: 5 (0.9%), salmonella sp.: 41 (7.3%), campylobacter fetus: 45 (8.0%), giardia lamblia: 8 (1.4%), and "enteropathogenic" e. coli: 63 (11.2%) of which 15 (3%) produced heat labile enterotoxin. seasonal occurrence of enteropathogens is also described.

TI  == [pathogenesis, clinical aspects and diagnosis of the most important enteric bacterial diseases in animals].
AB  == there are adhesive and invasive species among enteropathogenic bacteria for animals. most frequently isolated adhesive bacteria are enterotoxigenic e. coli (etec). salmonella, t. hyodysenteriae, m. paratuberculosis, y. enterocolitica, cl. perfringens and c. jejuni bacteria represent the most important invasive germs. the main clinical finding connected with bacterial enteritis is diarrhoea  resp. dysentery. evaluation of feces consistency, time of appearance and accompanying symptoms (e.g. fever, colic) allow a clinical suspective diagnosis,  however a definitive diagnosis must be based on the demonstration of the causative agent. in addition to known cultural, microscopic, biochemical and serological diagnostic methods, the demonstration of virulence factors (enterotoxin formation, adhesive pili) plays an important role in diagnosis of enteropathogenic bacteria.

AB  == the in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of mt-141 were compared with those of cefoxitin, cefmetazole, moxalactam, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone. the mics of mt-141 for 90% of bacterial isolates were lower than the reference drugs  against clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni, clostridium difficile, and bacteroides fragilis, whereas against clinical isolates of other gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, the mics of mt-141 were similar to or higher than those of the reference drugs. in contrast, the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 after 6- and 24-h exposures was superior to all of the reference drugs  against 9 to 10 of the 12 bacterial strains studied, including escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, indol-positive proteus species, serratia marcescens, yersinia enterocolitica, pseudomonas cepacia, and clostridium perfringens. in the treatment of systemic infections in mice, mt-141  was again superior against 9 of the 12 strains tested, showing a good correlation with the bactericidal activity. it was found that the 50% effective doses of the  six cephalosporins studied correlated better with the mbcs than with the mics. as the serum levels of mt-141 in mice after subcutaneous administration were similar to those of the reference drugs, it was concluded that the bactericidal activity  of mt-141 was a dominant factor in its in vivo activity.

AB  == an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) technique was modified and used to detect heat-labile (lt) enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (etec) from specimens of faeces sent to a routine diagnostic laboratory. strains of lt etec were detected  in eight of 250 (3.2%) diarrhoeal stools but were not found in 110 non-diarrhoeal stools. all eight patients found to have lt etec were travellers returning with diarrhoea. lt etec was the most common bacterial pathogen found (15.4%) in this group of patients, exceeding campylobacter sp. (5.8%) and salmonella sp. (7.7%).  the elisa technique was simple to perform and visual readings were found to be reliable.

TI  == micro-organisms in gastroenteritis.
AB  == we present bacteriological and virological findings together with salient clinical features from a prospective study of 447 children aged under 2 years admitted to hospital with infectious gastroenteritis. putative pathogenic micro-organisms were identified in the stools of 75% of these children. eight identifiably distinct groups of viruses, found on electron microscopy and tissue  culture were present in 67% of patients--rotavirus was detected most frequently.  pathogenic bacteria (salmonellas, shigellas, escherichia coli, and campylobacter  jejuni--but excluding clostridium difficile) were found in 16% only. altogether 4 x 9% of 390 patients had gastroenteritis associated with cl difficile toxin. the  mean duration of diarrhoea was shortest in patients with identifiable virus, with rotavirus having a mean of 5 x 01 days, and was longest in patients with pathogenic bacteria in the stools (11 x 14 days). the finding of more than one type of virus did not seem to be associated with a significantly increased duration of diarrhoea. there are few clinical features which can be associated specifically with any particular micro-organism or groups of these. multiple organism isolation was common, but the severity of the illness in those patients  with at least two types of organism was not greater. certain viruses, including the norwalk-like virus, known to be associated with outbreaks of gastroenteritis  were found as frequently in a group of patients who did not have diarrhoea studied for comparison. virus was still detectable in the stools of up to 40% of  asymptomatic children on the day of discharge.

TI  == aetiology of diarrhoea in adequately nourished young african children in durban,  south africa.
AB  == two inter-related hospital-based studies on the causes of diarrhoea in african children who were not overtly malnourished, were performed over a period of two years in durban, south africa. the first study involved 126 inpatients selected for previously untreated diarrhoea of less than 96 h duration. on examination and culture of the stools of these children bacteria were identified in 60%, rotavirus in 20% and parasites in 4%. no pathogens were identified in 33%. the bacteria most frequently encountered were campylobacter jejuni (21%), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (epec) (18%), enterotoxigenic escherichia coli  (etec) (11%) and salmonella (8%). of those cases having an identifiable cause 16% had more than one organism. the majority of children had mild disease and recovered clinically in 5.4 (1.3) days (mean (s.d.]. the second study included 352 outpatients with diarrhoea who were randomly selected without regard to duration of disease or prior treatment. the results of faecal investigations were as follows: 28% had bacterial pathogens, 34% rotavirus, 15% parasites and 61% no  pathogens. the bacteria most frequently detected were c. jejuni 7%, epec 7%, salmonella 6%, and shigella 5%. ten per cent of positive cases had more than one  pathogen. the most likely reason for the higher percentage with no identifiable pathogen is the prolonged duration of diarrhoea in 19% for more than seven days.  in 128 control children with diarrhoea, stool samples were investigated during the same period as the two studies: 13% had bacteria, 2% rotavirus and 14% parasites. the bacteria involved were c. jejuni (5%). epec (5%), salmonella (2%)  and shigella (2%).

TI  == properties of crude campylobacter jejuni heat-labile enterotoxin.
AB  == the amount of crude campylobacter jejuni enterotoxin present in culture products  was quantitated by comparing the response of these preparations with that of pure escherichia coli heat-labile toxin (lt) in the chinese hamster ovary assay and in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays that used gm ganglioside or antisera to lt or  both. maximum c. jejuni enterotoxin production was achieved by growth at 42 degrees c for 24 h under agitation in supplemented gc medium. adding polymyxin separately to either the broth supernatant or the cells enhanced the recovery of  toxin; the yield from cell lysates was much lower. the quantity of c. jejuni enterotoxin produced by clinical isolates obtained locally or provided from mexico varied widely, over a spectrum from none to large amounts; quantitative values for the amount of c. jejuni enterotoxin determined by the chinese hamster  ovary and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays correlated with the degree of secretory potency of this material in ligated rat ileal loops. the cytotonic activity of c. jejuni enterotoxin in chinese hamster ovary cells was abolished by heating at 96 degrees c for 10 min and by preincubation either with gm ganglioside or with lt or cholera toxin antisera. the secretory activity of c. jejuni enterotoxin in ligated rat ileal loops was passively neutralized by antiserum to lt, and immunizing rats with either lt or its b subunit significantly (p less than 0.001) reduced fluid response to active challenge with c. jejuni enterotoxin in ligated ileal loops. these observations indicate that strains of c. jejuni vary in their capacity to elaborate a heat-labile enterotoxin that has close immunological homology with lt and cholera toxin.

AB  == ninety-four u.s. students who acquired diarrhea in mexico were treated with furazolidone (47 subjects) or ampicillin (47 subjects) on a double-blind random basis. of 47 students, 26 (55%) who received furazolidone (100 mg four times daily for 5 days) recovered from illness within 48 h after initiation of therapy, in contrast to 15 of 47 (32%) who received ampicillin (500 mg four times daily for 5 days) (p less than 0.05). altogether, 74% of students treated with furazolidone and 49% of those receiving ampicillin were well within 72 h (p less  than 0.05). when furazolidone was compared with ampicillin, clinical illness was  shortened on the average from 65 to 61 h for enterotoxigenic escherichia coli diarrhea, from 83 to 58 h for shigellosis, from 82 to 51 h for diarrhea unassociated with a detectable agent, and from 72 to 57 h for all cases irrespective of etiology. although not dramatically effective in the current trial, the broad spectrum of activity of furazolidone is of interest. because of  in vitro activity against campylobacter strains and known effectiveness in treating giardiasis, furazolidone should be considered in therapy for diarrhea of unknown etiology in certain settings when laboratory processing of stools for etiological agent is not feasible.

AB  == fecal specimens from 136 healthy beef calves (1 day to 12 weeks of age) were examined for the presence of infectious agents known to cause enteric disease in  calves. the calves were selected from 22 herds in which all calves were free of clinically apparent enteric disease. salmonella sp, enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, cryptosporidium, and coronavirus were not detected in any of the calves. three calves were infected with rotavirus and 1 calf was infected with yersinia enterocolitica. campylobacter-like bacteria were isolated from 50 of 130 calves,  with 36 of the calves positive for c jejuni. seemingly, clinically normal calves  may be infected more often with enterotoxigenic e coli, cryptosporidium, coronavirus, or rotavirus in herds in which some calves have enteric disease than in herds free of major enteric disease. campylobacter jejuni was well adapted to  the bovine host and was of similar prevalence in diarrheal and nondiarrheal calves. the k99 positive, nonenterotoxigenic e coli was isolated from the feces of 16 healthy calves. information in addition to the presence of k99 antigen is useful when diagnosing enterotoxic colibacillosis in calves.

AB  == gnotobiotic pigs were dosed orally with campylobacter sputorum subspecies mucosalis, either alone, or combined with rotavirus or non-pathogenic escherichia coli and streptococcus bovis to study the behaviour of c s mucosalis in defined conditions, to assess intracellular parasitism of enterocytes by c s mucosalis, and if possible to establish an experimental model of porcine intestinal adenomatosis. c s mucosalis colonised the gut of gnotobiotic pigs, persisting for up to 47 days after infection, but did not induce adenomatosis. despite evidence  of limited penetration of the mucosa up to two days after infection, the majority of c s mucosalis remained in the gut lumen. rotavirus did not enhance invasion of enterocytes by c s mucosalis. the presence of e coli and s bovis caused an increase in the total numbers of c s mucosalis in the gut, but did not affect their distribution. thus c s mucosalis was largely non-pathogenic in gnotobiotic  pigs.

AB  == diarrhea is a leading cause of death in tropical countries. one of the highest childhood mortalities is in northeastern brazil, where little is known about the  morbidity, etiology, and risk factors of diarrhea. prospective village surveillance over 30 months revealed diarrhea attack rates of more than seven episodes per child-year at six to 11 months of age among the children of the poorest families. other risk factors included early weaning and the lack of toilets. diarrhea led to weight loss and stunted growth. enterotoxigenic escherichia coli and rotaviruses were the most common pathogens, accounting for 21% and 19% of cases, respectively, followed by shigella species (8.0%), campylobacter jejuni (7.5%), giardia species (6.7%), strongyloides species (5.3%), and enteropathogenic e coli serotypes (4.6%). most (84%) enterotoxigenic  e coli were isolated during the rainy season of october to march (p less than 0.03), whereas 71% of rotaviral illnesses occurred during the drier months of june to october (p less than 0.03). in the present study, the early occurrence and nutritional impact of diarrhea and weaning, as well as the major etiologic agents of diarrhea and their different seasonal patterns have been defined for this region in which life-threatening diarrhea is endemic.

TI  == diarrhea.
AB  == the four major mechanisms of diarrhea are osmotic forces, secretory forces, exudation from a disrupted intestinal mucosa, and disturbed intestinal motility.  in many illnesses, more than one mechanism produces diarrhea. the rotaviruses and the norwalk viruses have recently been recognized as common causes of viral gastroenteritis. also, the major cause of antibiotic-associated colitis is now known to be an overgrowth of clostridium difficile. campylobacter has also been identified as a common cause of acute bacterial diarrhea both abroad and in canada. most cases of travellers' diarrhea are caused by strains of escherichia coli to which the traveller has little immunity. most travellers who develop diarrhea benefit from treatment with diphenoxylate, loperamide or bismuth subsalicylate. the few patients who develop more severe, incapacitating diarrhea  are candidates for treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. antibiotics should not be used to prevent travellers' diarrhea, because antibiotic resistance is becoming a problem.

AB  == one-hundred eighty-five clinical isolates of salmonella sp., shigella sp., escherichia coli, and campylobacter sp. were tested for their ability to absorb the lymphocytotoxic activity of an antiserum (anti-klebsiella sp. k43) directed against a specific hla-b27-associated cell surface determinant on the lymphocytes of patients with ankylosing spondylitis (as). seven of these isolates (three salmonella sp., two shigella sp., one e. coli, and one campylobacter sp.) were found to cross-react with the b27-positive cells of as patients (b27+ as+); an e. coli organism isolated from the rectal swab of an hla-b27-negative clinically normal individual also cross-reacted with b27+ as+ cells. these cross-reactive enteric organisms elaborate a factor (modifying factor) which specifically modifies the b27-positive lymphocytes of normal individuals; this factor is structurally and antigenically related to a functionally similar factor secreted  by certain isolates of klebsiella sp. these data suggest that certain enteric organisms share a common determinant which cross-reacts with b27+ as+ cells. it is suggested that this cross-reactivity is somehow related to an early event in the pathogenesis of as and possibly of other seronegative arthropathies.

AB  == a prospective, 12-month study of 975 non-aboriginal children with diarrhea and age- and sex-matched children without diarrhea, in perth, western australia, was  designed to investigate the significance of enterotoxigenic aeromonas species as  a cause of diarrhea. enterotoxigenic aeromonas species were found in the fecal specimens of 10.8% of the patients with diarrhea but in only 0.7% of those without diarrhea. most aeromonas species were isolated during the summer. other important bacterial pathogens included campylobacter, salmonella, shigella, and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli; rotavirus infections appeared to be much less important in the western australian environment. most of the patients were younger than two years of age and about one-quarter had mixed bacterial and/or viral intestinal infections. enterotoxigenic aeromonas species can be identified  with 97% accuracy using a simple hemolysin assay which should be considered for use by routine diagnostic laboratories, particularly in children's hospitals.

TI  == treatment of acute nonspecific gastroenteritis of infants and young children with erythromycin.
AB  == a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of erythromycin ethylsuccinate was conducted in 65 infants and young children hospitalized with acute nonspecific gastroenteritis. etiologic agents included rotaviruses (29%), campylobacter jejuni (17%), "classical" enteropathogenic escherichia coli (12%), enterotoxigenic e. coli (11%), salmonella (9%), shigella (2%), and giardia lamblia (2%). no pathogens were obtained from 25 (38%) children. treatment with erythromycin had no effect on the course of the illness in terms of the time required for hydration, stool frequency and temperature to return to normal, or for vomiting to be abolished. children treated with erythromycin, however, experienced a marginally, but significantly (p less than 0.05), shorter period of abnormal stool consistency compared with control subjects. this effect was most pronounced in children from whom no enteropathogens were isolated.

TI  == value of stool examination in patients with diarrhoea.
AB  == findings of stool examinations in 1593 patients with diarrhoea due to a single enteric pathogen--enterotoxigenic escherichia coli rotavirus, shigella, campylobacter jejuni, vibrio cholerae 0:1, entamoeba histolytica, or giardia lamblia--were reviewed to determine how well they predicted the agent associated  with the diarrhoea. specimens were examined visually for blood and mucus, tested  for ph, and examined under a microscope for the presence of red and white blood cells, parasites, and stool fat. although visible blood was more common in specimens from patients infected with shigella (51%) and ent histolytica (39%) than in those from patients infected with other agents (6%; p less than 0.01), patients infected with shigella were most likely to have numerous faecal leucocytes (greater than 50/high power field: 39% v 8% of all patients and 7% of  patients infected with ent histolytica, p less than 0.01 in both cases). patients infected with enterotoxigenic e coli, rotavirus, v cholerae 0:1, or c jejuni had  loose stools with fewer red or white cells. patients infected with rotavirus and  c jejuni were more likely to have acid stools with 3 to 4+ fat, but these findings were related to young age and breast feeding. stool examination is most  useful in establishing a diagnosis of dysentery and in helping to distinguish between patients infected with shigella and ent histolytica; it is of limited usefulness in discriminating between pathogens causing watery diarrhoea.

TI  == infectious diarrhea. which culprit? what strategy?
AB  == the patient with diarrhea is generally looking for prompt relief, not a prolonged diagnostic workup. in many cases effective treatment can be initiated after careful review of the clinical symptoms and of the patient's recent travel or other activities. stool examination, sigmoidoscopy, or other studies may be necessary for definitive diagnosis or in refractory cases. drugs are useful to combat many of the causative organisms, but in mild, self-limited infections, supportive therapy may suffice. indeed, antimotility agents are contraindicated in some types of infectious diarrhea.

TI  == recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.

TI  == enteropathogenicity: recent developments.
AB  == recent studies have added important new information to our understanding of the pathogenesis and ethiology of diarrheal disease. vibrio cholerae produces a heat-labile enterotoxin, affecting cyclic amp. a very similar heat-labile enterotoxin is produced also by certain strains of escherichia coli, as well as by citrobacter, klebsiella, and aeromonas. e. coli may also produce a heat-stable enterotoxin, stimulating guanylate cyclase activity. in order to produce the pathologic effects, e. coli first attaches to epithelial cells of the intestinal  tract by means of pili or surface antigens. enterotoxin can be demonstrated by both in vivo and in vitro tests, but none are yet suitable for routine diagnostic laboratories. a third mechanism whereby e. coli causes diarrheal disease consists of enteroinvasiveness. campylobacter, yersinia, and clostridium difficile have been added to the list of enteric pathogens of man.

AB  == tetracycline resistance in clinical isolates of campylobacter jejuni was shown to be plasmid mediated. intra- and interspecies transfers to c. fetus subsp. fetus were demonstrated. the frequency of transfer was increased by approximately 100-fold on a solid surface by using a plate- or filter-mating procedure, as compared with a liquid-mating method. results of experiments in which cell-free filtrates were used to replace the donor strain in mating experiments tend to rule out bacteriophage-mediated transduction in the transfer of tetracycline resistance. the plasmid-transfer frequency was not affected when deoxyribonuclease was added to the agar used in the mating experiments, indicating that transformation was not involved. four transmissible plasmids from different tetracycline-resistant strains of c. jejuni each had a molecular weight of 38 x 10(6). transfer of these plasmids to escherichia coli was not demonstrated.

TI  == [clinical evaluation of cefotiam therapy in children (author's transl)].
AB  == cefotiam (ctm) was evaluated for its safety and efficacy in children. twenty-six  patients were treated with 40 to 200 mg/kg per day of ctm by intravenous administrations. the diagnosis of the patients were acute pharyngitis (2), acute  bronchitis (1), pneumonia (4), empyema (2), urinary tract infection (2), typhoid  fever (1), acute enterocolitis (2), partially-treated purulent meningitis (1), and suspected septicemia in neuroblastoma (1); and the remaining ten patients were considered to have nonbacterial infections. the pathogens recovered were streptococcus pyogenes (1), streptococcus pneumoniae (1), staphylococcus aureus (4), haemophilus influenzae (4), escherichia coli (1), enteropathogenic escherichia coli (1), salmonella typhi (1), and campylobacter jejuni (1). all but two patients of bacterial infections were cured after the ctm therapy, and the rate of efficacy was 87.5%. diarrhea (3), urticaria (1), transient elevation of got and gpt (1), and transient eosinophilia (3) were found to be associated with  the ctm therapy. however, no severe adverse reactions were encountered. half life of the serum ctm level was 0.93 +/- 0.13 hours, and excretion into the urine was  rapid. csf concentration obtained 1 hour after an intravenous injection of 21 mg/kg of ctm in a case with inflamed meninges was 1.5 mcg/ml, and the csf/serum ratio was 9.0%. from these data, ctm appears to be a safe and effective antibiotic when used in children with susceptible bacterial infections.

TI  == erythromycin. new indications and toxicities.
AB  == although erythromycin was introduced into clinical medicine more than 28 years ago, the indications for its use continue to expand. this antibiotic has emerged  as appropriate therapy for legionnaires' disease, chronic bacterial prostatitis caused by escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus species, enteritis and colitis produced by campylobacter fetus, and soft tissue and pleuropulmonary  anaerobic infections in which bacteroides fragilis plays no role. in combination  with an aminoglycoside, erythromycin has proven to be effective for perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients undergoing elective colon surgery. additional  therapeutic indications continue to be explored. the renewed interest in erythromycin has resulted in a closer examination of its potential for toxicity.  new untoward events attributed to erythromycin administration have been described. this antibiotic has produced both reversible hearing loss and pseudomembranous colitis. erythromycin also possesses the ability to inhibit the  degradation of theophylline.

TI  == chronic excretion of enteropathogenic bacteria in the faeces--a possible association with allergy to cow's milk.
AB  == two children with protracted gastrointestinal symptoms were found to be chronically excreting enteropathogenic bacteria in their faeces. withdrawal of cows' milk protein from their diets resulted in clinical recovery and stool cultures became negative, suggesting that allergy to cows' milk may have contributed to their bacterial carrier state.

TI  == campylobacter enteritis in johannesburg.
AB  == in order to establish a reasonable protocol for a diagnostic laboratory we conducted a survey during which we confined the routine culture of stool samples  for campylobacter fetus to two groups--all infants under 2 years of age, and older children and adults with obviously diarrhoeic stools. camp. fetus was isolated from 100 of 2323 stool specimens (4,3%). this is within the 3 - 8% isolation rates previously reported from surveys in which all specimens were cultured. camp. fetus isolates represented 16,9% of all bacterial pathogens isolated, and black infants showed a significantly greater isolation rate than white infants. we feel that culture for camp. fetus is an essential part of any routine bacteriological investigation of diarrhoea. a partially selective culture policy for camp. fetus will result in a recovery rate at least equal to that of salmonella and enteropathogenic escherichia coli.

TI  == summer diarrhoea in african infants and children.
AB  == of 70 black south african infants and children with acute summer diarrhoea, 30 (43%) were infected with enteropathogenic serogroups of escherichia coli (epec),  13 (19%) with enterotoxigenic gram-negative bacilli, 12 (17%) with salmonella sp., 6 (9%) with shigella sp., and 3 (4%) with rotaviruses. 13 (19%) patients were infected simultaneously with more than one enteropathogen, and no pathogen was detected in 22 (31%). in addition, 6 (15%) of 41 unselected patients were excreting campylobacter fetus. of 30 age-matched controls drawn from the same population, 5 (17%) were infected with epec serotypes, and 1 each with salmonella sp. and rotavirus. this study stresses the polymicrobial nature of paediatric diarrhoea in a developing community and shows the continued importance of epec in this setting.

TI  == etiology of infantile enteritis in south africa.
AB  == infantile enteritis constitutes a major health problem in developing countries. several investigations into the etiology of this condition among various south african populations have been undertaken during the past few years. recent studies of black urban infants have revealed that salmonellae, shigellae, enterotoxigenic enterobacteriaceae, and rotaviruses play a relatively minor role  in infantile enteritis. on the other hand, all studies, including a number performed several years ago, have demonstrated that escherichia coli strains belonging to traditional enteropathogenic serotypes are more frequently recovered from patients with diarrhea than from matched control subjects. these bacteria are particularly prominent during the summer months at the height of the annual gastroenteritis epidemic. recent studies have indicated the importance of campylobacter fetus in infantile enteritis, especially in children younger than nine months. the data point to a complex multiple etiology of infantile enteritis in south africa, which will require clarification before specific preventive measures can be instituted.

TI  == experimental hamster enteritis: an electron microscopic study.
AB  == hamster enteritis (he) was experimentally produced in weanling hamsters by orally inoculating healthy hamsters with suspensions of ilea obtained from hamsters with he. control groups of hamsters were inoculated orally with suspensions of ilea from healthy hamsters. electron microscopy was done on ilea from 6 control hamsters, 31 hamsters with experimentally produced he, and 4 hamsters with naturally occurring he. ultrastructural changes were not observed in the absorptive epithelium of control animals. two different intracytoplasmic bacterial organisms were observed in epithelial cells of hamsters with experimentally produced he. organisms that were observed early in the disease process were identified as escherichia coli. organisms ultrastructurally similar  to campylobacter spp were observed later in the disease and were only within hyperplastic epithelial cells. the hyperplastic ileal epithelium of hamsters with naturally occurring he contained campylobacter-like organisms.

AB  == escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide produced blastogenic transformation in whole-blood leukocytes from heifers that had been infected and immunized with campylobacter fetus, but not in cells from control animals. this suggests that lipopolysaccharide dose not function as a b-cell mitogen in cattle and that its stimulation of cells from immunized animals occurred through another mechanism.

TI  == major outer membrane protein of campylobacter fetus: physical and immunological characterization.
AB  == the outer membrane proteins of campylobacter fetus have been isolated by extraction of cell envelopes both in triton x-100 and ethylenediaminetetraacetate (edta) and in sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). each method yielded a major protein component, which migrated identically in sds-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) and proved comparable in electrophoretic and molecular weight characteristics to the analagous protein from escherichia coli. in addition, the  surface of sds-extracted c. fetus cells displayed a subunit structure similar to  that observed in e. coli. the major envelope protein isolated with sds appeared antigenically identical with one of the proteins isolated with trition-edta on the basis of immunodiffusion reactions with specific antisera. antibodies directed to the major envelope protein were not reactive in agglutination, immobilization, bactericidal, or opsonization reactions. strains of c. fetus belonging to each of the three o serotypes possessed major envelope proteins comparable in sds-page but distinguished antigencally in a fashion paralleling the o serotype classification.

TI  == infections associated with ovine perinatal mortality in victoria.
AB  == the occurrence of infections associated with perinatal mortality was investigated. in 1970, carcasses from 94 flocks distributed throughout victoria were examined by microbiological and histopathological techniques. carcasses from 4 of the same flocks were similarly examined in 1971. widespread occurrence of listeria monocytogenes and campylobacter fetus was demonstrated with l. monocytogenes being recognised in 25% of the flocks examined. no other bacterial  pathogens commonly associated with ovine perinatal mortality were isolated, but adequate techniques for recognition of toxoplasma gondii were not used. e. coli was isolated from a majority of the carcasses and in heavy pure culture from the  liver of 26 cases. evidence of non-specific bacterial infection was recognised histopathologically in carcasses from 30% of flocks in which specific infection was not recognised. specific infections were demonstrated culturally or histologically in 16% of the 582 carcasses submitted to detailed laboratory examination. the reported findings suggest that further investigation into the incidence of specific congenital infections is required.
