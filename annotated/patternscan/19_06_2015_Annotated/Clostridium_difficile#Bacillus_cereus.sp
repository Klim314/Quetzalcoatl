TI  == protein composition of the outermost exosporium-like layer of clostridium difficile 630 spores.
AB  == clostridium difficile spores are considered the morphotype of infection, transmission and persistence of c. difficile infections. there is a lack of information on the composition of the outermost exosporium layer of c. difficile  spores. using recently developed exosporium removal methods combined with ms/ms,  we have established a gel-free approach to analyze the proteome of the exosporium of c. difficile spores of strain 630. a total of 184 proteins were found in the exosporium layer of c. difficile spores. we identified 7 characterized spore coat and/or exosporium proteins; 6 proteins likely to be involved in spore resistance; 6 proteins possibly involved in pathogenicity; 13 uncharacterized proteins; and 146 cytosolic proteins that might have been encased into the exosporium during assembly, similarly as reported for bacillus anthracis and bacillus cereus spores. we demonstrate through flag-fusions that cota and cotb are mainly located in the spore coat, while the exosporium collagen-like glycoproteins (i.e. bcla1,  bcla2 and bcla3), the exosporium morphogenetic proteins cdec and cdem, and the uncharacterized exosporium proteins cdea and cdeb are mainly located in the exosporium layer of c. difficile 630 spores. this study offers novel candidates of c. difficile exosporium proteins as suitable targets for detection, removal and spore-based therapies. biological significance: this study offers a novel strategy to identify proteins of the exosporium layer of c. difficile spores and  complements previous proteomic studies on the entire c. difficile spores and spore coat since it defines the proteome of the outermost layer of c. difficile spores, the exosporium. this study suggests that c. difficile spores have several proteins involved in protection against environmental stress as well as putative  virulence factors that might play a role during infection. spore exosporium structural proteins were also identified providing the ground basis for further functional studies of these proteins. overall this work provides new protein target for the diagnosis and/or therapeutics that may contribute to combat c. difficile infections.

TI  == spirotetronate antibiotics with anti-clostridium activity from actinomadura sp. 2eps.
AB  == the rare actinomycetes strain 2eps was isolated from soil and analysis of cultural, morphological characteristics, diaminopimelic acid content of its cell  wall, and 16s rrna gene sequence indicates that 2eps belongs to genus actinomadura. in addition, neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree also confirmed the  relationships of this strain to other members of actinomadura. a butanol extract  with antibacterial activity was purified by reversed-phase chromatography to obtain three bioactive compounds, designated as compounds 1, 2 and 3. the structures of these compounds were determined using spectroscopic analysis ((1)h-nmr and (13)c-nmr) and mass spectrometric analysis (hr-tof-ms). compounds 1-3 were identified and found to be the same as those included in the japanese patent number jp 09227587 for spirotetronate antibiotics and are be-45722a (1), be-45722b (2) and be-45722c (3), respectively. all compounds were active against  gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus aureus atcc 25923, bacillus cereus atcc 14579, and b. subtilis atcc 6633) with low mic values between 0.08 and 5.0 microg/ml. moreover, both 1 and 3 also exhibited strong activity, with similar mic values, against clostridium perfringens s107 at 0.63 microg/ml and c. difficile 630 at 0.08 microg/ml. these results suggest the identified spirotetronate compounds may have potential in the treatment of clostridium infections. overall, this analysis demonstrates that rare actinomycetes are a promising source for discovery of antimicrobial compounds.

TI  == clostridium and bacillus binary enterotoxins: bad for the bowels, and eukaryotic  being.
AB  == some pathogenic spore-forming bacilli employ a binary protein mechanism for intoxicating the intestinal tracts of insects, animals, and humans. these gram-positive bacteria and their toxins include clostridium botulinum (c2 toxin), clostridium difficile (c. difficile toxin or cdt), clostridium perfringens (iota-toxin and binary enterotoxin, or bec), clostridium spiroforme (c. spiroforme toxin or cst), as well as bacillus cereus (vegetative insecticidal protein or vip). these gut-acting proteins form an ab complex composed of adp-ribosyl transferase (a) and cell-binding (b) components that intoxicate cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis and endosomal trafficking. once inside the cytosol, the a components inhibit normal cell functions by mono-adp-ribosylation  of globular actin, which induces cytoskeletal disarray and death. important aspects of each bacterium and binary enterotoxin will be highlighted in this review, with particular focus upon the disease process involving the biochemistry and modes of action for each toxin.

TI  == in pursuit of protein targets: proteomic characterization of bacterial spore outer layers.
AB  == bacillus cereus, responsible for food poisoning, and clostridium difficile, the causative agent of clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (cdad), are both spore-forming pathogens involved in food spoilage, food intoxication, and other infections in humans and animals. the proteinaceous coat and the exosporium layers from spores are important for their resistance and pathogenicity characteristics. the exosporium additionally provides an ability to adhere to surfaces eventually leading to spore survival in food. thus, studying these layers and identifying suitable protein targets for rapid detection and removal of spores is of the utmost importance. in this study, we identified 100 proteins  from b. cereus spore coat, exosporium and 54 proteins from the c. difficile coat  insoluble protein fraction. in an attempt to define a universal set of spore outer layer proteins, we identified 11 superfamily domains common to the identified proteins from two bacilli and one clostridium species. the evaluated orthologue relationships of identified proteins across different spore formers resulted in a set of 13 coat proteins conserved across the spore formers and 12 exosporium proteins conserved in the b. cereus group, which could be tested for quick and easy detection or targeted in strategies aimed at removal of spores from surfaces.

TI  == sporicidal effects of high-intensity 405 nm visible light on endospore-forming bacteria.
AB  == resistance of bacterial endospores to treatments, including biocides, heat and radiation is a persistent problem. this study investigates the susceptibility of  bacillus and clostridium endospores to 405 nm visible light, wavelengths which have been shown to induce inactivation of vegetative bacterial cells. suspensions of b. cereus endospores were exposed to high-intensity 405 nm light generated from a light-emitting diode array and results demonstrate the induction of a sporicidal effect. up to a 4-log(10) cfu ml(-1) reduction in spore population was achieved after exposure to a dose of 1.73 kj cm(-2). similar inactivation kinetics were demonstrated with b. subtilis, b. megaterium and c. difficile endospores. the doses required for inactivation of endospores were significantly  higher than those required for inactivation of b. cereus and c. difficile vegetative cells, where ca 4-log(10) cfu ml(-1) reductions were achieved after exposure to doses of 108 and 48 j cm(-2), respectively. the significant increase  in dose required for inactivation of endospores compared with vegetative cells is unsurprising due to the notorious resilience of these microbial structures. however, the demonstration that visible light of 405 nm can induce a bactericidal effect against endospores is significant, and could have potential for incorporation into decontamination methods for the removal of bacterial contamination including endospores.

TI  == antibacterial properties of a glycolipid-rich extract and active principle from nunavik collections of the macroalgae fucus evanescens c. agardh (fucaceae).
AB  == this study investigated the antibacterial activity of glycolipid-rich extracts of the brown macroalga fucus evanescens in cell culture. accessions were collected on the arctic coast of ungava bay, nunavik, quebec. the crude ethyl acetate extract of these accessions showed strong antibacterial activity (>/=4 log(10) cfu) against hemophilus influenzae , legionella pneumophila , propionibacterium acnes (atcc and clinical isolate), and streptococcus pyogenes at 100 microg/ml. this algal extract inhibited by 3 log(10) clostridium difficile and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus , whereas bacillus cereus , escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , and pseudomonas aeruginosa were not significantly affected. further investigations of the activity of a glycolipid-rich fraction, extracted with dichloromethane, against propionibacterium acnes showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml, with an inhibition of more than 99% at only 7.8 microg/ml. the main active compound, a beta-d-galactosyl o-linked glycolipid, was synthesized for the bioassay and showed an mic(100) of 50 microg/ml but lost its activity more quickly with only 50% of inhibition at 12.5 microg/ml. therefore, the semipurified f. evanescens extract could be a good choice for future research into the development of alternative treatments for acne therapy.

TI  == studies with bioengineered nisin peptides highlight the broad-spectrum potency of nisin v.
AB  == nisin a is the most thoroughly investigated member of the lantibiotic family of antimicrobial peptides. in addition to a long history of safe use as a food antimicrobial, its activity against multi-drug resistant pathogens has resulted in a renewed interest in applying nisin as a chemotherapeutic to treat bacterial  infections. the wealth of nisin-related information that has been generated has also led to the development of the biotechnological capacity to engineer novel nisin variants with a view to improving the function and physicochemical properties of this already potent peptide. however, the identification of bioengineered nisin derivatives with enhanced antimicrobial activity against gram-positive targets is a recent event. in this study, we created stable producers of the most promising derivatives of nisin a generated to date [m21v (hereafter nisin v) and k22t (hereafter nisin t)] and assessed their potency against a range of drug-resistant clinical, veterinary and food pathogens. nisin  t exhibited increased activity against all veterinary isolates, including streptococci and staphylococci, and against a number of multi-drug resistant clinical isolates including mrsa, but not vancomycin-resistant enterococci. in contrast, nisin v displayed increased potency against all targets tested including hvisa strains and the hyper-virulent clostridium difficile ribotype 027 and against important food pathogens such as listeria monocytogenes and bacillus  cereus. significantly, this enhanced activity was validated in a model food system against l. monocytogenes. we conclude that nisin v possesses significant potential as a novel preservative or chemotherapeutic compound.

TI  == testing standards for sporicides.
AB  == sporicidal products are of considerable importance in healthcare environments due to the requirement for products that are capable of dealing with contamination with clostridium difficile spores. sporicidal testing standards to validate the claims of sporicidal activity are an important tool in the evaluation of commercial sporicides. within europe there are a number of sporicidal testing standards which are often used to validate the claims of commercial sporicides. however, the extent to which these standards reflect the practical application of sporicides in healthcare settings is limited since they employ long contact times (>/=30min) and do not involve surface contamination. alternative international standards are available which employ contaminated carriers rather than spore suspensions, and the organisation for economic co-operation and development is currently developing a unified set of standards which are more realistic in their design than the currently available european standards. this paper reviews the currently available testing standards for sporicides, highlighting the key procedural differences between them and the extent to which they reflect the practical application of sporicidal products. some of the common problems and errors associated with the application of the european sporicidal standard methods are also highlighted and discussed. finally gaps in the currently available testing standards are identified and discussed.

TI  == [diarrhea from the infectologist's point of view].
AB  == gastroenteritis is a nonspecific term for various pathologic states of the gastrointestinal tract. gastroenteritis causing pathogens are the second leading  cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. in the developed countries diarrhea is the most common reason for missing work, while in the developing world, it is  a leading cause of death. internationally, the mortality rate is 5-10 million deaths each year. "traveller's diarrhea" is a polyetiologic common health problem of international travellers which affects travellers generally for days, but it can result in chronic postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome as well. infectious agents usually cause acute gastroenteritis either by adherence of the intestinal  mucosa, or by mucosal invasion, enterotoxin production, and/or cytotoxin production. the incubation period can often suggest the cause of etiology. when symptoms occur within 6 hours of eating, ingestion of preformed toxin of s. aureus or bacillus cereus should be suspected. the incidence of hypervirulent c.  difficile associated colitis is an emerging problem as a healthcare system associated infection. while infectious agents do not commonly cause chronic diarrhea, those that do include c. difficile, giardia lamblia, entamoeba histolytica, cryptosporidium, aeromonas and yersinia . amoebiasis is the second to malaria as a protozoal cause of death. infection with hiv is also a common cause of diarrhea.

TI  == riboswitches in eubacteria sense the second messenger cyclic di-gmp.
AB  == cyclic di-guanosine monophosphate (di-gmp) is a circular rna dinucleotide that functions as a second messenger in diverse species of bacteria to trigger wide-ranging physiological changes, including cell differentiation, conversion between motile and biofilm lifestyles, and virulence gene expression. however, the mechanisms by which cyclic di-gmp regulates gene expression have remained a mystery. we found that cyclic di-gmp in many bacterial species is sensed by a riboswitch class in messenger rna that controls the expression of genes involved  in numerous fundamental cellular processes. a variety of cyclic di-gmp regulons are revealed, including some riboswitches associated with virulence gene expression, pilus formation, and flagellum biosynthesis. in addition, sequences matching the consensus for cyclic di-gmp riboswitches are present in the genome of a bacteriophage.

TI  == qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins in gram-positive bacteria.
AB  == objectives: to study the role of qnr-like pentapeptide repeat proteins (prps) from several gram-positive species with quinolone resistance in vitro. methods: a pcr-based strategy was used to clone and express genes coding for qnr-like prps in enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, clostridium perfringens, c. difficile, bacillus cereus and b. subtilis in escherichia coli dh10b. mic values of nalidixic acid and fluoroquinolones were determined for reference strains and e. coli dh10b harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for prps. results: amino acid identity of qnr-like prps in gram-positive strains compared with that of the plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants qnra1, qnrb1 and qnrs1 was in the range of 16%  to 22%. recombinant plasmids coding for qnr-like prps conferred reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones (in the range of 0.016 to 0.064 mg/l for ciprofloxacin) and nalidixic acid (from 6 to 12 mg/l), depending on the antimicrobial agent and prp. the prp from b. subtilis showed no protective effect. conclusions: the prps analysed conferred a reduced susceptibility phenotype in e. coli; the data provide further evidence of the possible roles in  quinolone resistance of prps from different gram-positive species. these gram-positive species may constitute a reservoir for qnr-like quinolone resistance proteins.

TI  == high resolution fesem and tem reveal bacterial spore attachment.
AB  == transmission electron microscopy (tem) studies in the 1960s and early 1970s using conventional thin section and freeze fracture methodologies revealed ultrastructural bacterial spore appendages. however, the limited technology at that time necessitated the time-consuming process of imaging serial sections and  reconstructing each structure. consequently, the distribution and function of these appendages and their possible role in colonization or pathogenesis remained unknown. by combining high resolution field emission electron microscopy with tem images of identical bacterial spore preparations, we have been able to obtain images of intact and sectioned bacillus and clostridial spores to clearly visualize the appearance, distribution, resistance (to trypsin, chloramphenicol,  and heat), and participation of these structures to facilitate attachment of the  spores to glass, agar, and human cell substrates. current user-friendly commercial field emission scanning electron microscopes (fesems), permit high resolution imaging, with high brightness guns at lower accelerating voltages for  beam sensitive intact biological samples, providing surface images at tem magnifications for making direct comparisons. for the first time, attachment structures used by pathogenic, environmental, and thermophile bacterial spores could be readily visualized on intact spores to reveal how specific appendages and outer spore coats participated in spore attachment, colonization, and invasion.

TI  == binary bacterial toxins: biochemistry, biology, and applications of common clostridium and bacillus proteins.
AB  == certain pathogenic species of bacillus and clostridium have developed unique methods for intoxicating cells that employ the classic enzymatic "a-b" paradigm for protein toxins. the binary toxins produced by b. anthracis, b. cereus, c. botulinum, c. difficile, c. perfringens, and c. spiroforme consist of components  not physically associated in solution that are linked to various diseases in humans, animals, or insects. the "b" components are synthesized as precursors that are subsequently activated by serine-type proteases on the targeted cell surface and/or in solution. following release of a 20-kda n-terminal peptide, the activated "b" components form homoheptameric rings that subsequently dock with an "a" component(s) on the cell surface. by following an acidified endosomal route and translocation into the cytosol, "a" molecules disable a cell (and host organism) via disruption of the actin cytoskeleton, increasing intracellular levels of cyclic amp, or inactivation of signaling pathways linked to mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases. recently, b. anthracis has gleaned much notoriety as a biowarfare/bioterrorism agent, and of primary interest has been the edema and lethal toxins, their role in anthrax, as well as the development of efficacious vaccines and therapeutics targeting these virulence factors and ultimately b. anthracis. this review comprehensively surveys the literature and discusses the similarities, as well as distinct differences, between each clostridium and bacillus binary toxin in terms of their biochemistry, biology, genetics, structure, and applications in science and medicine. the information may foster future studies that aid novel vaccine and drug development, as well as a better understanding of a conserved intoxication process utilized by various gram-positive, spore-forming bacteria.

TI  == attenuation regulation of amino acid biosynthetic operons in proteobacteria: comparative genomics analysis.
AB  == candidate attenuators were identified that regulate operons responsible for biosynthesis of branched amino acids, histidine, threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine in gamma- and alpha-proteobacteria, and in some cases in low-gc gram-positive bacteria, thermotogales and bacteroidetes/chlorobi. this allowed us not only to describe the evolutionary dynamics of regulation by attenuation of transcription, but also to annotate a number of hypothetical genes. in particular, orthologs of ygea of escherichia coli were assigned the branched chain amino acid racemase function. three new families of histidine transporters  were predicted, orthologs of yuif and yvsh of bacillus subtilis, and lysq of lactococcus lactis. in pasteurellales, the single bifunctional aspartate kinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene thra was predicted to be regulated not only  by threonine and isoleucine, as in e. coli, but also by methionine. in alpha-proteobacteria, the single acetolactate synthase operon ilvih was predicted to be regulated by branched amino acids-dependent attenuators. histidine biosynthetic operons his were predicted to be regulated by histidine-dependent attenuators in bacillus cereus and clostridium difficile, and by histidine t-boxes in l. lactis and streptococcus mutans.

TI  == the role of bacterial and non-bacterial toxins in the induction of changes in membrane transport: implications for diarrhea.
AB  == bacterial toxins induce changes in membrane transport which underlie the loss of  electrolyte homeostasis associated with diarrhea. bacterial- and their secreted toxin-types which have been linked with diarrhea include: (a) vibrio cholerae (cholera toxin, e1 tor hemolysin and accessory cholera enterotoxin); (b) escherichia coli (heat stable enterotoxin, heat-labile enterotoxin and colicins); (c) shigella dysenteriae (shiga-toxin); (d) clostridium perfringens (c. perfringens enterotoxin, alpha-toxin, beta-toxin and theta-toxin); (e) clostridium difficile (toxins a and b); (f) staphylococcus aureus (alpha-haemolysin); (g) bacillus cereus (cytotoxin k and haemolysin bl); and (h)  aeromonas hydrophila (aerolysin, heat labile cytotoxins and heat stable cytotoxins). the mechanisms of toxin-induced diarrhea include: (a) direct effects on ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells, i.e. direct toxin interaction with intrinsic ion channels in the membrane and (b) indirect interaction with ion transport in intestinal epithelial cells mediated by toxin binding to a membrane  receptor. these effects consequently cause the release of second messengers, e.g. the release of adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate/guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate, ip(3), ca2+ and/or changes in second messengers that are the result of toxin-formed ca2+ and k+ permeable channels, which increase ca2+ flux and augment changes in ca2+ homeostasis and cause depolarisation of the membrane  potential. consequently, many voltage-dependent ion transport systems, e.g. voltage-dependent ca2+ influx, are affected. the toxin-formed ion channels may act as a pathway for loss of fluid and electrolytes. although most of the diarrhea-causing toxins have been reported to act via cation and anion channel formation, the properties of these channels have not been well studied, and the available biophysical properties that are needed for the characterization of these channels are inadequate.

TI  == interaction of the rho-adp-ribosylating c3 exoenzyme with rala.
AB  == rhoa, -b, and -c are adp-ribosylated and biologically inactivated by clostridium  botulinum c3 exoenzyme and related c3-like transferases. we report that rala gtpase, which is not adp-ribosylated by c3, inhibits adp-ribosylation of rhoa by  c3 from c. botulinum (c3bot), clostridium limosum (c3lim), and bacillus cereus (c3cer) but not from staphylococcus aureus (c3stau) in human platelet membranes and rat brain lysate. inhibition by rala occurs with the gdp- and guanosine 5'-3-o-(thio)triphosphate-bound forms of rala and is overcome by increasing concentrations of c3. a direct interaction of rala with c3 was verified by precipitation of the transferase with gst-rala-sepharose. the affinity constant (k(d)) of the binding of rala to c3lim was 12 nm as determined by fluorescence titration. rala increased the nad glycohydrolase activity of c3bot by about 5-fold. although rala had no effect on glucosylation of rho gtpases by clostridium difficile toxin b, c3bot and c3lim inhibited glucosylation of rala by clostridium sordellii lethal toxin. furthermore, c3bot decreased activation of phospholipase d by rala. the data indicate that several c3 exoenzymes directly interact with rala without adp-ribosylating the gtpase. the interaction is of high affinity and interferes with essential functions of c3 and rala.

TI  == phospholipases stimulate secretion in rbl mast cells.
AB  == roles for glycerophospholipids in exocytosis have been proposed, but remain controversial. phospholipases are stimulated following the activation of the high-affinity receptor for immunoglobulin e (ige) in mast cells. to study the biochemical sequelae that lead to degranulation, broken cell systems were employed. we demonstrate that the addition of three distinct types of exogenous phospholipases (i.e., bcplc, scpld, and tfpla(2)), all of which hydrolyze phosphatidylcholine (pc), trigger degranulation in permeabilized rbl-2h3 cells, a mucosal mast cell line. production of bioactive lipids by these phospholipases promotes release of granule contents through the plasma membrane and acts downstream of pkc, pip(2), and rho subfamily gtpases in regulated secretion. these exogenous phospholipase-induced degranulation pathways circumvent specific  factors activated following stimulation of the ige receptor as well as in atp- and gtp-dependent intracellular pathways. taken together, these results suggest that regulated secretion may be achieved in vitro in the absence of cytosolic factors via phospholipase activation and that products of pc hydrolysis can promote exocytosis in mast cells.

TI  == intracellular transport and processing of protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria.
AB  == bacterial toxins are associated with disease in humans and animals. toxins can either be preformed in food or produced by bacteria in the intestine. there are two types of toxins: heat-labile protein toxins and heat stabile toxins. heat labile toxins are produced by bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens, escherichia coli, and vibrio cholerae, and heat-stabile enterotoxins consisting of relatively few amino acids are produced by escherichia coli and acts by activation of guanylate cyclase. similarly, heat-stabile entero-toxins are also produced by staphylococcus aureus, a common cause of food poisoning in the united states, and yersenia enterocolitica. protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria  can intoxicate intestinal cells and can also be taken up from the gut and reach other cells in the body. for example the shiga-like toxins (vero-toxins) can intoxicate endothelial cells in the kidney and cause kidney failure. intracellular transport and processing of a few of the protein toxins produced by enteric bacteria, namely clostridium difficile toxin a and b, cholera toxin and the related heat-labile toxin produced by escherichia coli, and shiga toxin and shiga-like toxins are presented.

TI  == incidence of diarrhea with antibiotics and the increase of clostridia in rabbits.
AB  == rabbits were treated with a single intravenous injection of various antibiotics.  more than 40 per cent of the animals showed diarrhea after being treated with sulbactam/cefoperazone, cefmetazole, clindamycin, piperacillin or aspoxicillin. clostridium difficile was isolated from sulbactam/cefoperazone-treated diarrheic  rabbits, with their cecal contents showing positive reaction in a latex agglutination test for c. difficile enterotoxin. however, 27 cefmetazole-induced  diarrheic cases were not associated with c. difficile. other enteropathogenic bacteria, such as campylobacter spp., bacillus cereus, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, coagulase positive staphylococcus aureus, salmonella spp., vibrio spp., clostridium perfringens and clostridium spiroforme, were not isolated from either of diarrheic rabbit. however, the counts of clostridia remarkably increased in the intestine of cefmetazole-associated diarrheic rabbits. this was ascribed to the overgrowth of clostridium innocuum and clostridium sporogenes. there were no remarkable differences in changes in other  bacterial population between diarrheic and non-diarrheic rabbits.

AB  == the synthesis and evaluation of a non-radioactive hybridization probe is described, specific detecting the clostridium perfringens alphatoxin gene (plc) by colony blot hybridization assay. a vector free digoxigenin-dutp-labelled probe was generated by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) targeting the cloned plc gene of c.perfringens strain atcc 13124. in a colony blot hybridization assay 296 strains of c.perfringens were tested for plc. none of the strains failed in hybridization. presence of plc was even demonstrated in c.perfringens strains reported to lack lecithinase activity. specificity of the probe was shown with various strains of other bacterial species. none different clostridia sp. tested, e.g. c.bifermentans, c.tertium, c.novyi, c.chauvoei, c.sporogenes, c.difficile, c.putrifucum, c.sordellii, c.botulinum, c. septicum and c.histolyticum, hybridized with the plc specific probe. strains expressing an enzymatically related phospholipase like bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes and staphylococcus aureus gave also negative results. comparing the results of conventionally used egg yolk turbidity assay and those gained with dna hybridization, the plc probe proved to be a much more sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the detection of c.perfringens plc.

AB  == faecal samples from 123 infants who died with sudden infant death syndrome (sids) and from a comparative group of 52 age-matched babies were analysed for toxigenic bacteria and their toxins. serum samples from the sids infants were also analysed for these toxins. a significantly higher proportion of toxigenic bacteria and their toxins were found in faecal samples of sids babies than in samples from the comparative group. these toxins were also found in serum from the sids babies. clostridium perfringens was found in 54 (45.4%) of 119 sids cases compared with 10 (19.6%) of 51 healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.1, p < 0.01); c. difficile in 33 (27.7%) of 119 sids cases compared with 8 (14.8%) of 54 healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.43ns, p < 0.1); staphylococcus aureus in 12 (27.3%; 66.7% enterotoxigenic) of 44 sids cases compared with 12 (85.7%; non-enterotoxigenic) of 14 healthy babies  (chi 2 = 14.9, p < 0.001); c. botulinum in 6 (5.0%) of 120 sids cases compared with 0 of 53 healthy babies (chi 2 = 2.74, p < 0.1). campylobacter jejuni, yersinia enterocolitica, vibrio parahaemolyticus, salmonellae and bacillus cereus were not detected. heat-labile toxin, lethal to mice (hlml) was found in 32 (27.1%) of 118 sids faecal samples compared with 5 (10.6%) of 47 healthy babies (chi 2 = 5.24, p < 0.05); cytotoxins in 38 (30.9%) of 123 sids faecal samples compared with 0 of 21 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 8.8, p < 0.01) and 24 (27.6%) of 87 sids serum samples. c. perfringens enterotoxin was detected in 33 (34.4%) of 96 sids faecal extracts compared with 0 of 23 of healthy babies (chi 2 = 10.94, p < 0.001), and in 27 (24.5%) of 110 sids serum samples. c. perfringens alpha-toxin (presumptive) was detected in 14 (17.5%) of 80 sids faecal extracts compared with 0 of 17 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 3.5ns, p congruent to 0.05) and in 2 (2.3%)  of 87 sids serum samples. c. difficile toxin was detected in four sids faecal samples and two serum samples. c. botulinum toxin was detected in only one of 120 sids faecal samples compared with none of 49 from healthy babies. staphylococcal  enterotoxins were detected in 8 (19.5%) of 41 sids faecal samples compared with 0 of 19 from healthy babies (chi 2 = 4.278, p < 0.05), and in 4 (10.8%) of 37 sids  serum samples.(abstract truncated at 400 words)

TI  == travelers' diarrhea among united states military personnel during joint american-egyptian armed forces exercises in cairo, egypt.
AB  == a study was conducted of travelers' diarrhea in a united states military population on deployment in cairo, egypt, during july and august 1987. acute diarrhea requiring medical attention developed in 183 (4%) of 4,500 troops. a possible etiologic agent was identified in 49% of all diarrhea cases. enteric pathogens associated with cases of diarrhea included: enterotoxigenic escherichia coli (17% st-producers, 13% lt-producers, and 3% lt/st-producers); shigella (9%); campylobacter spp. (2%); salmonella (2%); and vibrio cholerae non-01 serogroup (2%). other enteric pathogens isolated from one episode each of diarrhea included aeromonas hydrophila group, plesiomonas shigelloides, and bacillus cereus. yersinia enterocolitica, enteroinvasive e. coli, intoxications by clostridium perfringens and clostridium difficile, and pathogenic enteric parasites were not  found in any of the 183 patients with diarrhea. a survey of military personnel not requesting medical care indicated that up to 40% of troops may have had diarrhea during this deployment. acute gastroenteritis is a potential cause of substantial morbidity in u.s. military personnel deployed to egypt.

TI  == [comparison of the sporocidal effects of two different disinfectants i a model experiment with pathogenic and nonpathogenic clostridial spore as well as with bacillus cereus].
AB  == official methods concerning the examination of sporocidal effects of disinfectants are presently lacking in the federal republic of germany. spore resistance of selected clostridial species towards formaldehyde and peracetic acid was examined by suspension tests and germ-carrier tests in comparison to spores of bacillus cereus. formaldehyde in concentrations between 5% and 20% as well as peracetic acid in concentrations between .004% and .125% were tested. spore concentration of 10(6) spores/ml in the suspension-tests and 10(4) spores/ml in the germ-carrier tests with wooden germ-carriers were used. against  formaldehyde spores of cl. septicum had the lowest resistance in the suspension tests followed by cl. difficile, cl. tertium, cl. bifermentans and cl. perfringens. cl. sporogenes strain nctc 532 had the most resistant spores. concerning peracetic acid the situation was nearly the same. the resistance of all spores of pathogenic species under investigation towards chemical disinfectants was covered by those of cl. sporogenes nctc 532 treated with isopropanol. isopropanol treated spores of b. cereus offer an alternative solution for practical disinfectant testing because spore production as well as growth of clostridia entail great expense. in order to cover the resistance of spores of cl. perfringens a, the most resistant pathogenic clostridial species tested here, increased spore concentrations of b. cereus would be necessary.

TI  == comparative study of the nature and biological activities of bacterial enterotoxins.
AB  == it is apparent that there are considerable similarities between many of the enterotoxins produced by enteric pathogens. although the effect of most of these  toxins is restricted to the intestine in vivo, many cells are also sensitive to intoxication in vitro. the resultant in-vitro biochemical changes may have no pathological significance but serve to underline the central role of cyclic nucleotides in cellular fluid regulation. the biological activity of these enterotoxins is the result of interaction with membrane-bound adenylate cyclase,  leading to persistent elevation of intracellular levels of camp. stimulation of adenylate cyclase occurs consistently after a characteristic lag phase which varies somewhat between toxins. the duration and degree of stimulation of adenylate cyclase by the various toxins may point to possible differences in affinity, dissociation and mechanism of activation of the cyclase molecule. subtle events at, or within, the cell membrane must occur during intoxication and may include complex associations of toxin with membrane lipid and protein components. the heat-labile toxins of v. cholerae, e. coli, salmonella spp., a. hydrophila and y. enterocolitica have much in common in their structures, membrane receptors and biochemical modes of action. similarly the heat-stable toxins of e. coli and y. enterocolitica, match each other in their biological activities. classified along with the enterotoxin of c. perfringens, the enterotoxin produced by sh. dysenteriae (and possibly some strains of e. coli) appears to differ from the other enterotoxins by acting on protein biosynthesis primarily and not on the nucleotide cyclase activation systems. in another category must be placed the various enterotoxins produced by staph. aureus until  more is known. surprisingly little research has been directed towards the elucidation of their mode of action, although much is known of their serological  and structural differences. evidence to date suggests that staphylococcal enterotoxins differ from the other diarrhoeagenic agents discussed in this review. the structural and immunological similarities between the various heat-labile enterotoxins suggest a common genetic origin with gene transfer between the different bacterial species being responsible for the spread of enterotoxigenicity. it is possible that many of the "newer" enterotoxins owe their origin to genetic recombination with the "older" enteropathogens like v. cholerae.

TI  == recent advances in management of bacterial diarrhea.
AB  == the number of recognized infectious causes of diarrhea potentially treatable with specific antibiotics has markedly increased within the past ten years. laboratories are developing and expanding their abilities to deal with these new  pathogens. neither prophylaxis nor specific treatment of diarrhea in travelers is simple, practical, and safe. although enterotoxigenic escherichia coli is the most important cause of diarrhea in u.s. travelers to tropical areas, campylobacter jejuni causes acute diarrhea in persons in the united states about  as often as do salmonella and shigella. vibrio parahemolyticus is an important cause of outbreaks of gastroenteritis following ingestion of improperly cooked shellfish; bacillus cereus is important in outbreaks of diarrhea after ingestion  of improperly cooked and stored rice in chinese restaurants. although yersinia enterocolitica is probably an important cause of severe enteritis in the united states, imperfect techniques for its isolation and lack of good serologic tests have hampered recognition of its importance. practical means for diagnosing antibiotic-associated colitis and the role of clostridium difficile toxins in this disease are now available. vancomycin, metronidazole, bacitracin, and cholestyramine are useful in treatment of antibiotic-associated colitis.
