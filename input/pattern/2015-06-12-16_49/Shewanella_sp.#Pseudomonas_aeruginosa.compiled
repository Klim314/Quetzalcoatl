TI  - Culturable Aerobic and Facultative Anaerobic Intestinal Bacterial Flora of Black  Cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) in Southern Pakistan.
AB  - Using morphological analysis and biochemical testing, here for the first time, we determined the culturable gut bacterial flora (aerobes and facultative anaerobes) in the venomous Black Cobra (Naja naja karachiensis) from South Asia. The findings revealed that these snakes inhabit potentially pathogenic bacteria including Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Shewanella putrefaciens, Aeromonas hydrophila, Salmonella sp., Moraxella sp., Bacillus sp., Ochrobactrum anthropi, and Providencia rettgeri. These findings are of concern, as injury from snake bite can result in wound infections and tissue necrosis leading to sepsis/necrotizing fasciitis and/or expose consumers of snake meat/medicine in the community to infections.
TI  - Antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of the Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria.
AB  - Surface-associated marine bacteria are an interesting source of new secondary metabolites. The aim of this study was the isolation and identification of epiphytic bacteria from the marine brown alga, Bifurcaria bifurcata, and the evaluation of the antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of bacteria extracts. The identification of epiphytic bacteria was determined by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Bacteria extracts were obtained with methanol and dichloromethane (1:1) extraction. The antioxidant activity of extracts was performed by quantification of total phenolic content (TPC), 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity and oxygen radical absorbance capacity (ORAC). Antimicrobial activities were evaluated against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, Salmonella enteritidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Candida albicans. A total of 39 Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria were isolated and 33 were identified as Vibrio sp. (48.72%), Alteromonas sp. (12.82%), Shewanella sp. (12.26%), Serratia sp. (2.56%), Citricoccus sp. (2.56%), Cellulophaga sp. (2.56%), Ruegeria sp. (2.56%) and Staphylococcus sp. (2.56%). Six (15.38%) of the 39 bacteria Bifurcaria bifurcata-associated bacteria presented less than a 90% Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) match, and some of those could be new. The highest antioxidant activity and antimicrobial activity (against B. subtilis) was exhibited by strain 16 (Shewanella sp.). Several strains also presented high antimicrobial activity against S. aureus, mainly belonging to Alteromonas sp. and Vibrio sp. There were no positive results against fungi and Gram-negative bacteria. Bifurcaria bifurcata epiphytic bacteria were revealed to be excellent sources of natural antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds.
TI  - Tolerance of anaerobic bacteria to chlorinated solvents.
AB  - The aim of this research was to evaluate the effects of four chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons (CAHs), perchloroethene (PCE), carbon tetrachloride (CT), chloroform (CF) and 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCA), on the growth of eight anaerobic bacteria: four fermentative species (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella sp., Clostridium sp. and Paenibacillus sp.) and four respiring species (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Geobacter sulfurreducens, Shewanella oneidensis and Desulfovibrio vulgaris). Effective concentrations of solvents which inhibited growth rates by 50% (EC50) were determined. The octanol-water partition coefficient or log Po/w of a CAH proved a generally satisfactory measure of its toxicity. Most species tolerated approximately 3-fold and 10-fold higher concentrations of the two relatively more polar CAHs CF and 1,2-DCA, respectively, than the two relatively less polar compounds PCE and CT. EC50 values correlated well with growth rates observed in solvent-free cultures, with fast-growing organisms displaying higher tolerance levels. Overall, fermentative bacteria were more tolerant to CAHs than respiring species, with iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria in particular appearing highly sensitive to CAHs. These data extend the current understanding of the impact of CAHs on a range of anaerobic bacteria, which will benefit the field of bioremediation.
TI  - Biodegradation and microbial community changes upon shrimp shell wastes amended in mangrove river sediment.
AB  - Chitin, a homopolymer of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc) residues linked by beta  1-4 bonds, is the most abundant renewable natural resource after cellulose. It is widely distributed in nature as the integuments of crustaceans and insects and as a component of fungi and algae. This study investigated the effects of a bifunctional chitinase/lysozyme-producing strain, Pseudomonas aeruginosa K-187, on degradation of shrimp shells and the survival conditions of bacterial strains in mangrove river sediment of Tamsui River. The structures of the whole bacterial community of the samples were measured by using polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) technique. Results show that three bacterial strains (Acrobacter sp., Shewanella sp., and Marinobacterium sp.) which originated from the mangrove river sediment were found predominant in the 6 days-incubation sample of P. aeruginosa K-187 amended mangrove river sediment. Meanwhile, biomass, reducing sugar, and total sugar were found highest in the 6 weeks-incubation sample of shrimp shell powder and P. aeruginosa K-187-amended mangrove river sediment. According to the results, we assumed that the amendment of P. aeruginosa K-187 can enhance the biodegradation of shrimp shells in the seawater containing mangrove river sediment. We hope that these findings may provide some useful information for the reclamation of chitin-containing wastes in our environment.
TI  - Expression of chromate resistance genes from Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The plasmidic chromate resistance genes chrBAC from Shewanella sp. strain ANA-3 were transferred to Escherichia coli. Expression of chrA alone, on a high- or low-copy number plasmid, conferred increased chromate resistance. In contrast, expression of the complete operon chrBAC on a high-copy number plasmid did not result in a significant increase in resistance, although expression on a low-copy number plasmid made the cells up to 10-fold more resistant to chromate. The chrA gene also conferred increased chromate resistance when expressed in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The chrR gene from the P. aeruginosa chromosome was necessary for full chromate resistance conferred by chrA. A diminished chromate uptake in cells expressing the chrA gene suggests that chromate resistance is due to chromate efflux.
TI  - Identification of genes regulated by changing salinity in the deep-sea bacterium  Shewanella sp. WP3 using RNA arbitrarily primed PCR.
AB  - The differential gene transcription of a deep-sea bacterium Shewanella sp. WP3 in response to changing salinity was analyzed by RNA fingerprinting using arbitrarily primed PCR (RAP-PCR). Ninety primer sets were used to scan two different RNA pools derived from cultures of 1% and 7% NaCl concentrations. Forty-three putative differential-expressed fragments were identified, cloned, and sequenced. Six out of the 43 fragments were confirmed to be truly differentially transcribed in terms of changing salinity. The deduced amino acid sequences of the six gene fragments showed highest identities (66-96%) with ribosomal protein L24, ATP binding protein, and chaperon protein HscA of Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 (Y6, Y9, and Y29); isocitrate lyase of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Y15); peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase of Shewanella sp. SIB1 (Y21), glutamine synthetase of Shewanella violacea (Y25), respectively. Four genes (Y6, Y15, Y21, and Y25) were up regulated in 7% NaCl, while the other two (Y9 and Y29) contained more abundant transcripts in 1% NaCl. The data suggested that strategies involved in controlling protein synthesis, protein folding and/or trafficking, glutamate concentration, fatty acid metabolism, and substance transporting were used for salt adaptation in Shewanella sp. WP3. The expression patterns of the six genes in response to transient stress shocks including salt shock (3% NaCl shift to 12%), cold shock (15 degrees C shift to 0 degrees C), and high-hydrostatic pressure shock (0.1 MPa shift to 50 MPa) were further examined. Y29 encoding the putative HscA chaperon protein was indicated to be involved in adaptation of all the stresses tested.
TI  - Prevalence of nonfermenters in clinical specimens.
AB  - One hundred and thirty three non fermenting gram negative bacilli isolated out of 625 different clinical specimens were identified and characterised. Samples were exudate from chronic suppractive otits media (341), diabetic foot (117) wound (116) and blood (51). Of these isolates Pseudomonas aeruginosa 105(78.94%) predominated followed by Acinetobacter sp 8 [6.1%], Pseudomonas putrifaciens 6(4.5%), Flavobacterium sp 6(4.5%), Xanthomonas maltophilia 5(3.75%), Alkaligenes sp 3 (2.25). 31 (23.30%) were resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Amikacin 85 (63.90%) was found to be more effective than fluoroquinolones (27.8-48.12%).
