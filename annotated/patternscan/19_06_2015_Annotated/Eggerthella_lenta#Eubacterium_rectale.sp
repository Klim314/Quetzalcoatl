TI  == influence of red wine polyphenols and ethanol on the gut microbiota ecology and biochemical biomarkers.
AB  == background: few studies have investigated the effect of dietary polyphenols on the complex human gut microbiota, and they focused mainly on single polyphenol molecules and select bacterial populations. objective: the objective was to evaluate the effect of a moderate intake of red wine polyphenols on select gut microbial groups implicated in host health benefits. design: ten healthy male volunteers underwent a randomized, crossover, controlled intervention study. after a washout period, all of the subjects received red wine, the equivalent amount of de-alcoholized red wine, or gin for 20 d each. total fecal dna was submitted to polymerase chain reaction(pcr)-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time quantitative pcr to monitor and quantify changes in fecal microbiota. several biochemical markers were measured. results: the dominant bacterial composition did not remain constant over the different intake  periods. compared with baseline, the daily consumption of red wine polyphenol for 4 wk significantly increased the number of enterococcus, prevotella, bacteroides, bifidobacterium, bacteroides uniformis, eggerthella lenta, and blautia coccoides-eubacterium rectale groups (p < 0.05). in parallel, systolic and diastolic blood pressures and triglyceride, total cholesterol, hdl cholesterol, and c-reactive protein concentrations decreased significantly (p < 0.05). moreover, changes in cholesterol and c-reactive protein concentrations were linked to changes in the bifidobacteria number. conclusion: this study showed that red wine consumption can significantly modulate the growth of select gut microbiota in humans, which suggests possible prebiotic benefits associated with  the inclusion of red wine polyphenols in the diet. this trial was registered at controlled-trials.com as isrctn88720134.

TI  == rapid detection of human fecal eubacterium species and related genera by nested pcr method.
AB  == pcr procedures based on 16s rdna gene sequence specific for seven eubacterium spp. and eggerthella lenta that predominate in the human intestinal tract were developed, and used for direct detection of these species in seven human feces samples. three species of eggerthella lenta, eubacterium rectale, and eubacterium eligens were detected from seven fecal samples. eubacterium biforme was detected  from six samples. it was reported that e. rectale, e. eligens, and e. biforme were difficult to detect by traditional culture method, but the nested pcr method is available for the detection of these species. this result shows that the nested pcr method utilizing a universal primer pair, followed by amplification with species-specific primers, would allow rapid detection of eubacterium species in human feces.
