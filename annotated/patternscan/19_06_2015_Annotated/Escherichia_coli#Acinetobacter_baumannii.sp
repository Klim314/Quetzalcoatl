TI  == bacterial epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance in the surgery wards of a large teaching hospital in southern italy.
AB  == objectives: surgical infections represent an increasingly important problem for the national health system. in this study we retrospectively evaluated the bacterial epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility of the microorganisms concerned as well as the utilization of antibiotics in the general and emergency  surgery wards of a large teaching hospital in southern italy in the period 2011-2013. methods: data concerning non-duplicate bacterial isolates and antimicrobial susceptibility were retrieved from the vitek 2 database. the pharmacy provided data about the consumption of antibiotics in the above reported wards. chi-square or fisher's exact test were used. results: in all, 94 gram-negative were isolated in 2011, 77 in 2012, and 125 in 2013, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa always being the most frequently isolated microorganisms. a. baumannii showed high rates of resistance  to carbapenems (with values of 100% in 2011 and 2012) and low rates of resistance to tigecycline, colistin and amikacin. in the same years, there were respectively 105, 93, and 165 gram-positive isolated. the rate of mrsa isolates ranged from 66% to 75% during the study period. conclusions: our results show no significant  increase in antimicrobial resistance over the period in question, and a higher rate of both mrsa isolates and resistance to carbapenems in a. baumannii compared with other european data.

TI  == crystallization and preliminary x-ray diffraction analysis of the csu pili csuc-csua/b chaperone-major subunit pre-assembly complex from acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the attachment of many gram-negative pathogens to biotic and abiotic surfaces is  mediated by fimbrial adhesins, which are assembled via the classical, alternative and archaic chaperone-usher (cu) pathways. the archaic cu fimbrial adhesins have  the widest phylogenetic distribution, yet very little is known about their structure and mechanism of assembly. to elucidate the biogenesis of archaic cu systems, structural analysis of the csu fimbriae, which are used by acinetobacter baumannii to form stable biofilms and cause nosocomial infection, was focused on. the major fimbriae subunit csua/b complexed with the csuc chaperone was purified  from the periplasm of escherichia coli cells co-expressing csua/b and csuc, and the complex was crystallized in peg 3350 solution using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. selenomethionine-labelled csuc-csua/b complex was purified and crystallized under the same conditions. the crystals diffracted to 2.40 a resolution and belonged to the hexagonal space group p6422, with unit-cell parameters a = b = 94.71, c = 187.05 a, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees .  initial phases were derived from a single anomalous diffraction (sad) experiment  using the selenomethionine derivative.

TI  == ndm-1-producing citrobacter freundii, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii identified from a single patient in china.
AB  == we identified ndm-1-producing citrobacter freundii gb032, escherichia coli gb102  and acinetobacter baumannii gb661 from the urine and stool of a single patient in china. plasmid profiling and southern blotting indicated blandm-1 from gb032 and  gb102 were likely located on the same plasmid, while blandm-1 from gb661 was located on a very large plasmid (> 400-kb). the case underscores the broad host range of blandm-1 and its potential to spread between enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii.

TI  == influence of 4'-o-glycoside constitution and configuration on ribosomal selectivity of paromomycin.
AB  == a series of 20 4'-o-glycosides of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin were  synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis by bacterial, mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. target selectivity, i.e., inhibition of the bacterial ribosome over eukaryotic mitochondrial and cytosolic  ribosomes, which is predictive of antibacterial activity with reduced ototoxicity and systemic toxicity, was greater for the equatorial than for the axial pyranosides, and greater for the d-pentopyranosides than for the l-pentopyranosides and d-hexopyranosides. in particular, 4'-o-beta-d-xylopyranosyl paromomycin shows antibacterioribosomal activity comparable to that of paromomycin, but is significantly more selective showing considerably reduced affinity for the cytosolic ribosome and for the a1555g mutant mitochondrial ribosome associated with hypersusceptibility to drug-induced ototoxicity. compound antibacterioribosomal activity correlates with antibacterial activity, and the ribosomally more active compounds show activity against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia, enterobacter cloacae, acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa).  the paromomycin glycosides retain activity against clinical strains of mrsa that  are resistant to paromomycin, which is demonstrated to be a consequence of 4'-o-glycosylation blocking the action of 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases by the use of recombinant e. coli carrying the specific resistance determinant.

TI  == [bloodstream infections in southwestern china: 2012 whire union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  == objective: to test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. methods: blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the whire union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in southwestern china in 2012. we performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using whonet5. 5 and spss19.0. results: a total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 gram-positive (50.26%); 868 gram-negative (49.74%). coagulase-negative staphylococcius (cns, 541 strains, 31.00%), escherichia coli (eco, 379 strains, 21.72%), klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and staphylococcus aureus (sau, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of s. aureus and 85.4% of cns, respectively. zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9%  resistance to linezolid, respectively. imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% e. coli, 3.6% klebsiella spp., and 11.1% enterobacter spp.. nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in p.  aeruginosa and 79.1% in acinetobacter baumannii. antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for mrsa and multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections. patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant a. baumannii infections than others. conclusion: cns, e. coli,klebsiella spp., enterococcus spp. and s. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in southwestern china. low methicillin-resistant rate was found in staphylococcus aureus. but vancomycin-resistant rate was high in e. faecium. imipenem-resistant rates varied in enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in acinetobacter spp. use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.

TI  == reinforcing lipid a acylation on the cell surface of acinetobacter baumannii promotes cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance and desiccation survival.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging gram-negative pathogen found in hospitals  and intensive care units. in order to persist in hospital environments, a. baumannii withstands desiccative conditions and can rapidly develop multidrug resistance to conventional antibiotics. cationic antimicrobial peptides (camps) have served as therapeutic alternatives because they target the conserved lipid a component of the gram-negative outer membrane to lyse the bacterial cell. however, many gram-negative pathogenic bacteria, including a. baumannii, fortify  their outer membrane with hepta-acylated lipid a to protect the cell from camp-dependent cell lysis. whereas in escherichia coli and salmonella, increased  production of the outer membrane acyltransferase pagp results in formation of protective hepta-acylated lipid a, which reinforces the lipopolysaccharide portion of the outer membrane barrier, a. baumannii does not carry a gene that encodes a pagp homolog. instead, a. baumannii has evolved a pagp-independent mechanism to synthesize protective hepta-acylated lipid a. taking advantage of a  recently adapted a. baumannii genetic recombineering system, we characterized two putative acyltransferases in a. baumannii designated lpxlab (a. baumannii lpxl) and lpxmab (a. baumannii lpxm), which transfer one and two lauroyl (c12:0) acyl chains, respectively, during lipid a biosynthesis. hepta-acylation of a. baumannii lipid a promoted resistance to vertebrate and polymyxin camps, which are prescribed as last-resort treatment options. intriguingly, our analysis also  showed that lpxmab-dependent acylation of lipid a is essential for a. baumannii desiccation survival, a key resistance mechanism for survival in hospital environments. compounds that inhibit lpxmab-dependent hepta-acylation of lipid a  could act synergistically with camps to provide innovative transmission prevention strategies and treat multidrug-resistant infections. importance: acinetobacter baumannii infections can be life threatening, and disease can progress in a variety of host tissues. current antibiotic regimen and disinfectant strategies have failed to limit nosocomial a. baumannii infections.  instead, the rate of a. baumannii infection among health care communities has skyrocketed due to the bacterium's adaptability. its aptitude for survival over extended periods on inanimate objects, such as catheters, respirators, and surfaces in intensive care units, or on the hands of health care workers and its  ability to rapidly develop antibiotic resistance make a. baumannii a threat to health care communities. emergence of multidrug- and extremely drug-resistant a.  baumannii illustrates the ineffectiveness of current prevention and treatment options. our analysis to understand how a. baumannii resists cationic antimicrobial peptide (camp)-mediated and desiccative killing revealed two lipid  a acyltransferases that produce protective hepta-acylated lipid a. our work suggests that inhibiting lipid a biosynthesis by targeting the acyltransferase lpxmab (a. baumannii lpxm) could provide a novel target to combat this pathogen.

TI  == development of two real-time multiplex pcr assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  == the frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (lrti) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but, because these  are often slow, negative, or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. the aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two multiplex real-time pcr assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, staphylococcus aureus, moraxella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. we found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum specimens down to a concentration of 100 cfus/reaction (8333 cfus/ml). furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. the specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in lrti.  concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputum specimens, and 90%  for bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens, and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. in conclusion, a quantitative  molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of lrti has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time-point of patient admission than current standard methods. this should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.

TI  == hydroxy tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone oxabicyclooctane-linked novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents-sar of rhs moiety (part-3).
AB  == novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (nbtis) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial gyrase a and parc and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (r)-hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (lhs) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (rhs) containing nbtis showed a potent gram-positive antibacterial profile. sar around the rhs moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. a fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an mic against staphylococcus aureus of 0.5mug/ml with reduced functional herg activity (ic50 333mum) and good in vivo efficacy [ed90 12mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. a pyridodioxane-containing nbti showed a s. aureus mic of 0.5mug/ml, significantly improved herg ic50 764mum and strong efficacy of 11mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). a phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent herg binding activity. many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against escherichia coli and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best rhs moiety  for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked nbtis.

TI  == analysis of microbial load on surgical instruments after clinical use and following manual and automated cleaning.
AB  == background: we aimed to monitor the microbial load and identify the microorganisms recovered from surgical instruments after clinical use and following manual and automated cleaning. methods: this experimental study was carried out in the laboratory of oral microbiology and anaerobes at the federal university of minas gerais in brazil. microbial samples were taken from 125 surgical instruments used in 25 types of gastrointestinal surgeries. results: the average microbial load was 93.1 cfu/100 ml after clinical use and 41 cfu/100 ml and 8.24 cfu/100 ml on instruments following 2 sequential steps of manual cleaning, respectively, and 75 cfu/100 ml and 16.1 cfu/100 ml on instruments after automated cleaning. surgical wound classification significantly affected the microbial load recovered on instruments. coagulase-negative staphylococcus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas spp, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and acinetobacter baumannii complex were recovered. conclusions: the average microbial load observed after the cleaning steps decreased, and the decrease in microbial load was more pronounced using the manual method compared with that observed using the automated method.

TI  == inhibition of aminoglycoside acetyltransferase resistance enzymes by metal salts.
AB  == aminoglycosides (ags) are clinically relevant antibiotics used to treat infections caused by both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, as well as mycobacteria. as with all current antibacterial agents, resistance to ags is an increasing problem. the most common mechanism of resistance to ags is the presence of ag-modifying enzymes (ames) in bacterial cells, with ag acetyltransferases (aacs) being the most prevalent. recently, it was discovered that zn(2+) metal ions displayed an inhibitory effect on the resistance enzyme aac(6')-ib in acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. in this study, we explore a wide array of metal salts (mg(2+), cr(3+), cr(6+), mn(2+), co(2+), ni(2+), cu(2+), zn(2+), cd(2+), and au(3+) with different counter ions) and their inhibitory effect on a large repertoire of aacs [aac(2')-ic, aac(3)-ia, aac(3)-ib, aac(3)-iv, aac(6')-ib', aac(6')-ie, aac(6')-iid, and eis]. in addition, we determine the mic values for amikacin and tobramycin in combination  with a zinc pyrithione complex in clinical isolates of various bacterial strains  (two strains of a. baumannii, three of enterobacter cloacae, and four of klebsiella pneumoniae) and one representative of each species purchased from the  american type culture collection.

TI  == functional categorization of carbapenemase-mediated resistance by a combined genotyping and two-tiered modified hodge test approach.
AB  == the functional relationship between the detection of carbapenemase activity and phenotypic resistance in gram-negative bacterial pathogens is often ill-defined.  to address this issue, we developed a two-tiered modified hodge test approach for carbapenemase detection and typing, in which the use of pseudomonas aeruginosa strain pao1 and escherichia coli as indicator strains conferred two levels of sensitivities to carbapenemases. when applied alongside pcr genotyping tests for  existence of known carbapenemase genes in 92 carbapenem resistant clinical isolates, this method is extremely useful in elucidating the relative role by which different enzymes contributed to the prevalent carbapenem-resistance phenotypes. with this study approach, we showed that the proportion of p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii strains whose carbapenem resistance phenotypes could at least be partially attributed to carbapenemase were 34 and 89%, respectively. our data also facilitates detailed functional categorization of carbapenem resistance phenotypes on the basis of the types and activities of detectable carbapenemase produced by the test organism. for example, six a. baumannii isolates harboring the bla oxa-51/23-like gene without detectable enzymatic activities were identified, suggesting that other resistance mechanisms may be involved. on the other hand, there were seven p. aeruginosa strains which  produced carbapenemase phenotype without harboring known carbapenemase genes, inferring the existence of some hitherto unknown resistance determinants. findings in this work therefore provide a comprehensive view on the cellular basis of carbapenem resistance phenotypes in major gram-negative bacterial species, paving the way for development of novel strategies to reverse the effects of the major resistance mechanisms concerned.

TI  == susceptibility trends and molecular characterization of gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract and intra-abdominal infections in jordan and lebanon: smart 2011-2013.
AB  == objectives: to investigate phenotypic and genotypic patterns of antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacilli associated with urinary tract infection (uti) and intra-abdominal infection (iai) in medical centres of jordan and lebanon. methods: gram-negative bacilli from the smart study, collected between the years 2011 and 2013, were first identified at local laboratories. these isolates were shipped to a central laboratory where re-identification, susceptibility testing, and molecular characterization were performed using standard methods. results: among the 523 uti-associated isolates, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis were the most frequent (70%, 14%, and 5%, respectively). e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most frequent species among the 527 iai-associated isolates (46%, 14%, and 12%, respectively). incidence rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers among uti-associated e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. mirabilis were 43%, 54%, and 4%, respectively. corresponding rates among iai-associated isolates were 49%, 56%, and 12%, respectively. acinetobacter baumannii and p. aeruginosa isolates showed very disturbing low susceptibility patterns. ctx-m-15  was the most prevalent esbl produced. seventeen isolates were non-susceptible to  carbapenems (estimated prevalence of 1.6%). conclusions: the alarmingly high rates of esbl production and emergence of carbapenemases emphasize the urgent need to develop antimicrobial stewardship initiatives and to maintain antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems.

TI  == microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a university hospital.
AB  == background: microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in state university of campinas, no data has been published yet. methods: the main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. the blood culture records requested from  4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. the samples were processed using the bact/alert system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. results: a total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). there were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). the prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative staphylococcus (cns) (15.87%), escherichia coli (13.0%), staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), enterobacter sp (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and candida sp (5.1%). examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of  the s. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and 80% of the cns isolates were oxacillin-resistant. for a. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs  were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for p. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. when all gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to  beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. conclusions: eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. for empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.

TI  == trends in paediatric bloodstream infections at a south african referral hospital.
AB  == background: the epidemiology of paediatric bloodstream infection (bsi) in sub-saharan africa is poorly documented with limited data on hospital-acquired sepsis, impact of hiv infection, bsi trends and antimicrobial resistance. methods: we retrospectively reviewed paediatric bsi (0-14 years) at tygerberg children's hospital between 1 january 2008 and 31 december 2013 (excluding neonatal wards). laboratory and hospital data were used to determine bsi rates, blood culture contamination, pathogen profile, patient demographics, antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with mortality. fluconazole resistant candida species, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), multi-drug resistant acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial resistant pathogens. results: of 17001 blood cultures over 6 years, 935 cultures isolated 979 pathogens (5.5% yield; 95% ci 5.3-5.7%). contamination rates were high (6.6%, 95% ci 6.4-6.8%), increasing over time (p = 0.003). discrete bsi episodes were identified (n = 864) with median patient age of 7.5 months, male predominance (57%) and 13% hiv prevalence. bsi rates declined significantly over time (4.6-3.1, overall rate 3.5 per 1000 patient days; 95% ci 3.3-3.7; chi square for  trend p = 0.02). gram negative pathogens predominated (60% vs 33% gram positives  and 7% fungal); klebsiella pneumoniae (154; 17%), staphylococcus aureus (131; 14%) and escherichia coli (97; 11%) were most prevalent. crude bsi mortality was  20% (176/864); hiv infection, fungal, gram negative and hospital-acquired sepsis  were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. hospital-acquired bsi was common (404/864; 47%). overall antimicrobial resistance rates were high (70% in hospital vs 25% in community-acquired infections; p < 0.0001); hospital-acquired infection, infancy, hiv-infection and gram negative sepsis were associated with resistance. s. pneumoniae bsi declined significantly  over time (58/465 [12.5%] to 33/399 [8.3%]; p =0.04). conclusion: although bsi rates declined over time, children with bsi had high mortality and pathogens exhibited substantial antimicrobial resistance in both community and hospital-acquired infections. blood culture sampling technique and local options  for empiric antimicrobial therapy require re-evaluation.

AB  == bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial dna replication enzymes dna gyrase and topoisomerase iv. it was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium clostridium difficile. we have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. we report the mic50s, mic90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. we confirm the gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (mic90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the gram-negative nonfermenter acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa. we confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. we also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in pseudomonas, though it is in escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.

TI  == influence of antimicrobial consumption on gram-negative bacteria in inpatients receiving antimicrobial resistance therapy from 2008-2013 at a tertiary hospital  in shanghai, china.
AB  == background: irrational use of antimicrobial agents is a major cause of increased  antimicrobial resistance. effective antibiotic stewardship strategies nationwide  or in local health care settings are necessary to reduce antibiotic use and bacteria resistance. methods: we evaluated the effectiveness of china's antimicrobial stewardship policy on antimicrobial use and applied time-series analysis methodology to determine the temporal relationship between antibiotic use and gram-negative bacteria resistance at changhai hospital from 2008-2013. isolates investigated included escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. results: consumption of 7 restricted-use antibiotics was dramatically reduced. resistance to ceftazidime in p aeruginosa and a baumannii and resistance to ciprofloxacin in p aeruginosa significantly decreased. by using cross-correlation analysis, associations between ciprofloxacin resistance in p aeruginosa and fluoroquinolones consumption (r = 0.48; lag = 0; p = .02), ceftazidime resistance in p aeruginosa and third-generation cephalosporins consumption (r = 0.54; lag = -1; p = .01) were identified. no substantial association between other pairs was found. conclusions: enhanced nationwide antimicrobial stewardship campaigns launched in  2011 have made great achievements in regard to antibiotic use but have had limited effects on the reversal of gram-negative bacteria resistance in health care settings. sound infection prevention and control programs to reduce the transmission of resistant pathogens for hospitals in china are urgently needed.

TI  == the challenge of antimicrobial resistance in managing intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == background: in recent years, there has been a worldwide increase in infections caused by microorganisms resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. methods: in  the past few decades, an increased prevalence of infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including enterococcus spp., carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., carbapenemase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, and resistant candida spp., also has been observed among intra-abdominal infections (iais). results: the increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistance is responsible for a substantial increase in morbidity and mortality rates associated with iais. conclusions: it is necessary for every surgeon treating iais to understand the underlying epidemiology and clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance. emergence of  drug resistance, combined with the lack of new agents in the drug development pipeline, indicates that judicious antimicrobial management will be necessary to  preserve the utility of the drugs available currently.

TI  == n-acetylcysteine selectively antagonizes the activity of imipenem in pseudomonas  aeruginosa by an oprd-mediated mechanism.
AB  == the modulating effect of n-acetylcysteine (nac) on the activity of different antibiotics has been studied in pseudomonas aeruginosa. our results demonstrate that, in contrast to previous reports, only the activity of imipenem is clearly affected by nac. mic and checkerboard determinations indicate that the nac-based  modulation of imipenem activity is dependent mainly on oprd. sds-page of outer membrane proteins (omps) after nac treatments demonstrates that nac does not modify the expression of oprd, suggesting that nac competitively inhibits the uptake of imipenem through oprd. similar effects on imipenem activity were obtained with p. aeruginosa clinical isolates. our results indicate that imipenem-susceptible p. aeruginosa strains become resistant upon simultaneous treatment with nac and imipenem. moreover, the generality of the observed effects of nac on antibiotic activity was assessed with two additional bacterial species, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. caution should be taken during treatments, as the activity of imipenem may be modified by physiologically attainable concentrations of nac, particularly during intravenous and nebulized regimes.

TI  == the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), a simple and low-cost alternative for the carba np test to assess phenotypic carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods.
AB  == a new phenotypic test, called the carbapenem inactivation method (cim), was developed to detect carbapenemase activity in gram-negative rods within eight hours. this method showed high concordance with results obtained by pcr to detect genes coding for the carbapenemases kpc, ndm, oxa-48, vim, imp and oxa-23. it allows reliable detection of carbapenemase activity encoded by various genes in species of enterobacteriaceae (e.g., klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli and  enterobacter cloacae), but also in non-fermenters pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the cim was shown to be a cost-effective and highly robust phenotypic screening method that can reliably detect carbapenemase activity.

TI  == in vitro susceptibility of tigecycline against multidrug-resistant gram-negative  strains: etest versus agar dilution.
AB  == background and aim: tigecycline is a semi-synthetic tetracycline with activity against most multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria. methods: we studied in vitro activity of tigecycline by agar dilution (ad) and etest methods to evaluate their correlation. the study included 206 isolates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase  (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and mdr acinetobacter baumannii recovered from blood cultures of patients of baskent university between 2008 and 2010. results: esbl-producing e. coli had mic50/mic90 values of 0.5/0.5  microg/ml by ad and 0.25/0.5 microg/ml by etest. esbl-producing k. pneumoniae had mic50/mic90 values of 1/2 microg/ml by ad and 0.75/2 microg/ml by etest, whereas  mdr a. baumannii had mic50/mic90 values of 4/4 microg/ml by ad and 2/4 microg/ml  by etest. the correlation between ad and etest was weak for esbl-producing e. coli and strong for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and mdr a. baumannii. tigecycline mic values for esbl-producing e. coli were lower than the tigecycline concentration, while they were higher than the concentrations attainable by treatment doses for a. baumannii. conclusion: tigecycline is an appropriate agent in the treatment of e. coli bacteremia, but it is not for treating a. baumannii bacteremia. tigecycline could be used for k. pneumoniae bacteremia treatment after determining its mic value. determining the mic value by gold-standard methods is more appropriate due to the correlation between etest and ad at high mic values.

TI  == in vitro activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam alone and in combination with avibactam against european gram-negative and gram-positive clinical isolates.
AB  == recent clinical isolates of key gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria were collected in 2012 from hospitalised patients in medical centres in four european  countries (france, germany, italy and spain) and were tested using standard broth microdilution methodology to assess the impact of 4mg/l avibactam on the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam. against enterobacteriaceae, addition of avibactam significantly enhanced the level of activity of these antimicrobials. mic90 values (minimum inhibitory concentration that inhibits 90%  of the isolates) of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam for escherichia coli,  klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, citrobacter  freundii and morganella morganii were reduced up to 128-fold or greater when combined with avibactam. a two-fold reduction in the mic90 of ceftazidime to 8mg/l was noted in pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates when combined with avibactam,  whereas little effect of avibactam was noted on the mic values of the test compounds when tested against acinetobacter baumannii isolates. avibactam had little effect on the excellent activity of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against haemophilus influenzae. it had no impact on the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and ceftaroline against staphylococci and streptococci. this study demonstrates that addition of avibactam enhances the activities of ceftazidime, ceftaroline and aztreonam against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa but not against a. baumannii.

TI  == white and blue light induce reduction in susceptibility to minocycline and tigecycline in acinetobacter spp. and other bacteria of clinical importance.
AB  == minocycline (min) and tigecycline (tig) are antibiotics currently used for treatment of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. in this work, we show that blue light, as well as white light, modulates susceptibility to these antibiotics in a temperature-dependent manner. the modulation of susceptibility by light depends on the content of iron; an increase in iron results in a reduction in antibiotic susceptibility both under light and in the dark, though the effect is  more pronounced in the latter condition. we further provide insights into the mechanism by showing that reduction in susceptibility to min and tig induced by light is likely triggered by the generation of (1)o2, which, by a yet unknown mechanism, would ultimately lead to the activation of resistance genes such as those coding for the efflux pump adeabc. the clinical relevance of these results  may lie in surface-exposed wound infections, given the exposure to light in addition to the relatively low temperatures recorded in this type of lesion. we further show that the modulation of antibiotic susceptibility occurs not only in  acinetobacter baumannii but also in other micro-organisms of clinical relevance such as escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. overall, our findings allow us to suggest that min and tig antibiotic treatments may be improved by the inclusion of an iron chelator, in addition to keeping the wounds in the dark, a condition that would increase the effectiveness in the control of infections involving these micro-organisms.

TI  == hydrophilic/hydrophobic characters of antimicrobial peptides derived from animals and their effects on multidrug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  == multidrug resistant (mdr) pathogen infections are serious threats to hospitalized patients because of the limited therapeutic options. a novel group of antibiotic  candidates, antimicrobial peptides (amps), have recently shown powerful activities against both gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. unfortunately,  the viability of using these amps in clinical settings remains to be seen, since  most still need to be evaluated prior to clinical trials and not all of amps are  potent against mdr clinical isolates. to find a connection between the characteristics of several of these amps and their effects against mdr pathogens, we selected 14 amps of animal origin with typical structures and evaluated their  in vitro activities against clinical strains of extensive drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli. our results showed that these peptides' hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics, rather than their secondary structures, may explain their antibacterial effects on these clinical isolates. peptides that are amphipathic along the longitudinal direction seemed to be effective against gram-negative pathogens, while peptides with hydrophilic terminals separated by a hydrophobic intermediate section appeared to be effective against both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens. among these, cathelicidin-bf was found to inhibit all of the gram-negative pathogens tested at dosages of no more than 16 mg/l, killing a pandrug-resistant a. baumannii strain  within 2 h at 4xmics and 4 h at 2xmics. tachyplesin iii was also found capable of inhibiting all gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens tested at no more than 16 mg/l, and similarly killed the same a. baumannii strain within 4 h at 4xmics and 2xmics. these results suggest that both cathelicidin-bf and tachyplesin iii are likely viable targets for the development of amps for clinical uses.

TI  == transcriptional regulation of the iac locus from acinetobacter baumannii by the phytohormone indole-3-acetic acid.
AB  == the iac locus is involved in indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) catabolism in acinetobacter baumannii. nine structural genes of iac are transcribed in the same direction, whereas iacr, which encodes a marr-type transcriptional regulator, is  transcribed in the opposite direction. the iaca protein, which is encoded by the  second structural gene of the iac locus, is expressed in an iaa-dependent manner. here, we characterized gene expression from this locus in wild type a. baumannii  and in an iacr mutant; this revealed that the iach promoter is negatively regulated by iacr. the transcriptional site of iach was determined by using 5' rapid amplification of cdna ends; one iacr-binding site was identified between positions -35 and +28 of the iach promoter. sequence analysis and an electrophoretic mobility shift assay indicated that recombinant iacr binds specifically to a sequence with dyad symmetry in the iacr-iach overlapping promoters in the absence of iaa. in addition, a two-plasmid expression system in  escherichia coli showed that iaa probably serves as a ligand that binds to iacr and releases it from the iach promoter, thereby allowing rna polymerase to transcribe iac. thus, iac is expressed in order to promote iaa degradation, whereas free iacr is required for iac repression. we conclude that iacr serves as a key regulator of iaa degradation in a. baumannii in the rhizosphere. these results provide new insights into the possible role of a. baumannii in the environment.

AB  == ac-gf(a6c)g(a6c)k(a6c)g(a6c)f(a6c)g(a6c)gk(a6c)kkkk-amide (a6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (amp) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter aerogenes, and enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43mum. spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this  amp interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. cd and 2d-(1)h nmr experiments indicated this amp  on binding to sds and dpc micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages  of helical and random coil conformers. cd investigations in the presence of three phospholipid suvs consisting of popc, 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc revealed: (1) the interactions occurring with popc suvs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the amp yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) the interactions with 4:1 popc/popg, and 60% pope/21%popg/19%popc suvs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the cd spectra. (3) the presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of suvs as was the case with micelles. this data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this amp are very different from the diversity of  conformations adopted by this amp on insertion into the lipid bilayer. cd spectra of this amp in the presence of suvs consisting of lps isolated from p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae and escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.

AB  == background: clinically important gram-positive and -negative isolates were collected from patients in france between 2004 and 2012 as a part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial. methods: mics were determined using methodology described by the clinical and laboratory standards institute. results: in total, 17,135 isolates were contributed by 29 medical centres; respiratory (25.1%) and cardiovascular (20.3%) sources predominated. high susceptibility was observed among enterococcus spp. and staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant s. aureus [mrsa]) to linezolid (100%), tigecycline (>/=99.8%) and vancomycin (>/=94.6%). the percentage of mrsa decreased from 34.3% in 2004 to 20.0% in 2009 before increasing to 34.7% in 2012. vancomycin, linezolid, levofloxacin and carbapenems were highly active (>/=99.6%) against streptococcus pneumoniae; 3.2% were prsp. escherichia coli showed peak susceptibility to the carbapenems (>/=99.9%), tigecycline (99.3%) and amikacin (97.9%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in susceptibility were observed for ampicillin, cefepime and ceftriaxone between 2004 and 2012. esbl production among e. coli increased from 3.0% (2004) to 14.9% (2012). high susceptibility was noted among haemophilus influenzae to levofloxacin (100%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (99.2%), carbapenems (>/=98.7%) and ceftriaxone (98.5%); beta-lactamase production fluctuated with no notable trend between 18.1% (2007) and 27.7% (2011). klebsiella spp. were highly susceptible to carbapenems (>/=99.6%) and amikacin (>/=96.4%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefepime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and tigecycline susceptibility were observed among k. pneumoniae between 2004 and 2012. only imipenem was highly active (96.5% susceptible) against acinetobacter baumannii. imipenem and amikacin (87.7% and 87.1% susceptible) were the most active agents against p. aeruginosa; 10.2% of isolates were categorized as multidrug resistant. conclusions: carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin conserved good in vitro activity against most pathogens (according to their spectrum of activity) in france between 2004 and 2012.

AB  == background: data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (icus) in taiwan are lacking. methods: we surveyed the mic distribution patterns  of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (icus) of  major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan in 2007. we also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. mic breakpoints recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute in 2014 were applied. results: colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against acinetobacter baumannii isolates but  moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and e. cloacae. the ceftobiprole mic90 value was 4 mug/ml for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/ml for p. aeruginosa. the  phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the mic value of ceftobiprole among s. aureus isolates. interestingly, the proportion of isolates  that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among p. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. conclusion: continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of icu pathogens to  important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens  against infections in the icu.

AB  == the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (test) was designed to monitor  susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents among important pathogens. we report here on susceptibility among gram-negative pathogens collected globally from pediatric patients between 2004 and 2012. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). most enterobacteriaceae showed high rates of susceptibility (>95%) to amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem); 90.8% of acinetobacter baumannii isolates were susceptible to minocycline, and susceptibility rates were highest in north america, europe, and asia/pacific rim. amikacin was the most active agent against pseudomonas aeruginosa (90.4% susceptibility), with susceptibility rates being highest in north america. extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were reported for 11.0% of escherichia  coli isolates and 24.2% of klebsiella pneumoniae isolates globally, with rates reaching as high as 25.7% in the middle east and >43% in africa and latin america, respectively. statistically significant (p<0.01) differences in susceptibility rates were noted between pediatric age groups (1 to 5 years, 6 to  12 years, or 13 to 17 years of age), globally and in some regions, for all pathogens except haemophilus influenzae. significant (p<0.01) differences were reported for all pathogens globally and in most regions, considerably more frequently, when pediatric and adult susceptibility results were compared. amikacin, tigecycline, and the carbapenems were active in vitro against most gram-negative pathogens collected from pediatric patients; a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to fewer antimicrobial agents. susceptibility rates among isolates from pediatric patients were frequently different from those among isolates collected from adults.

TI  == tn5/7-lux: a versatile tool for the identification and capture of promoters in gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == background: the combination of imaging technologies and luciferase-based bioluminescent bacterial reporter strains provide a sensitive and simple non-invasive detection method (photonic bioimaging) for the study of diverse biological processes, as well as efficacy of therapeutic interventions, in live animal models of disease. the engineering of bioluminescent bacteria required for photonic bioimaging is frequently hampered by lack of promoters suitable for strong, yet stable luciferase gene expression. results: we devised a novel method for identification of constitutive native promoters in gram-negative bacteria. the method is based on a tn5/7 transposon that exploits the unique features of tn5 (random transposition) and tn7 (site-specific transposition). the transposons are designed such that tn5 transposition will allow insertion of a promoter-less  bacterial luxcdabe operon downstream of a bacterial gene promoter. cloning of dna fragments from luminescent isolates results in a plasmid that replicates in pir (+) hosts. sequencing of the lux-chromosomal dna junctions on the plasmid reveals transposon insertion sites within genes or operons. the plasmid is also a mini-tn7-lux delivery vector that can be used to introduce the promoter-lux operon fusion into other derivatives of the bacterium of interest in an isogenic  fashion. alternatively, promoter-containing sequences can be pcr-amplified from plasmid or chromosomal dna and cloned into a series of accompanying mini-tn7-lux  vectors. the mini-tn5/7-lux and mini-tn7-lux vectors are equipped with diverse selection markers and thus applicable in numerous gram-negative bacteria. various mini-tn5/7-lux vectors were successfully tested for transposition and promoter identification by imaging in acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and burkholderia pseudomallei. strong promoters were captured for lux expression in e. coli and a. baumannii. some mini-tn7-lux vectors are also equipped with attb sites for swapping of the lux operon with other reporter genes using gateway technology. conclusions: although mini-tn5-lux and mini-tn7-lux elements have previously been developed and used for bacterial promoter identification and chromosomal insertion of promoter-lux gene fusions, respectively, the newly developed mini-tn5/7-lux and accompanying accessory plasmids streamline and accelerate the promoter discovery and bioluminescent strain engineering processes. availability of vectors with diverse selection markers greatly extend  the host-range of promoter probe and lux gene fusion vectors.

AB  == increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against gram-positive pathogens was optimized.  generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the n-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium. interestingly, the potency against escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the gram-negative acinetobacter baumannii. despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short peg-like chain had no significant effect on activity. introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.

TI  == drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  == puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). the most common species was escherichia coli (n=98), followed by enterococcus faecalis (n=54), staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), proteus mirabilis (n=32), staphylococcus aureus (n=27), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and enterobacter cloacae (n=21). s.  aureus and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while e. coli, e. cloacae, and k. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections.  resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blactx-m-1 group beta-lactamases. the ctx-m gene in e. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blactx-m-15, and phylogroup b2 isolates with blactx-m-15 were classified into st131 with o25b allele, harboring  aac(6')-ib-cr and various virulence factors. carbapenemase genes blandm-1 and blandm-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup a e. coli. methicillin-resistant s. aureus isolates had type iv or v sccmec, including isolates of st361 (cc672), which is related to an emerging st672 clone in the indian subcontinent. this study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.

TI  == effect of asparagine substitutions in the yxn loop of a class c beta-lactamase of acinetobacter baumannii on substrate and inhibitor kinetics.
AB  == class c cephalosporinases are a growing threat, and inhibitors of these enzymes are currently unavailable. studies exploring the yxn loop asparagine in the escherichia coli ampc, p99, and cmy-2 enzymes have suggested that interactions between c6' or c7' substituents on penicillins or cephalosporins and this asn are important in determining substrate specificity and enzymatic stability. we sought to characterize the yxn loop asparagine in the clinically important adc-7 class c beta-lactamase of acinetobacter baumannii. mutagenesis at the n148 position in adc-7 yields functional mutants (n152g, -s, -t, -q, -a, and -c) that retain cephalosporinase activity. using standard assays, we show that n148g, -s, and -t  variants possess good catalytic activity toward cefoxitin and ceftaroline but that cefepime is a poor substrate. because n152 variants of cmy-2, another class  c beta-lactamase, are more readily inhibited by tazobactam due to higher rates of inactivation, we also tested if the n148 substitutions in adc-7 would affect inactivation by sulfone inhibitors, sulbactam and tazobactam, class a beta-lactamase, and a. baumannii penicillin-binding protein (pbp) inhibitors with in vitro activity against adc-7. the 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) for tazobactam and sulbactam were improved, with 7-fold and 2-fold reductions, respectively, for the n148s variant. a homology model of the n148s adc-7 enzyme in a michaelis-menten complex with tazobactam showed a loss of interaction between n148 and the sulfone moiety of the inhibitor. we postulate that this may  result in more-rapid secondary ring opening of the inhibitor, as the unbound sulfone is an excellent leaving group, leading to more-rapid formation of the stable linearized inhibitor.

TI  == gram-negative infections in adult intensive care units of latin america and the caribbean.
AB  == this review summarizes recent epidemiology of gram-negative infections in selected countries from latin american and caribbean adult intensive care units (icus). a systematic search of the biomedical literature (pubmed) was performed to identify articles published over the last decade. where appropriate, data also were collected from the reference list of published articles, health departments  of specific countries, and registries. independent cohort data from all countries (argentina, brazil, chile, colombia, cuba, mexico, trinidad and tobago, and venezuela) signified a high rate of icu infections (prevalence: argentina, 24%; brazil, 57%). gram-negative pathogens, predominantly acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli, accounted for >50% of icu infections, which were often complicated by the presence of multidrug-resistant strains and clonal outbreaks. empirical use of antimicrobial  agents was identified as a strong risk factor for resistance development and excessive mortality. infection control strategies utilizing hygiene measures and  antimicrobial stewardship programs reduced the rate of device-associated infections. to mitigate the poor health outcomes associated with infections by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, urgent focus must be placed on infection control strategies and local surveillance programs.

TI  == exploring the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria in west london and the utility of routinely collected hospital microbiology data.
AB  == objectives: the objective of this study was to identify carbapenem-resistant organisms using routinely collected local microbiology data and describe the epidemiology of carbapenem resistance in two london teaching hospitals. methods:  data on inpatients infected or colonized with gram-negative organisms between march 2009 and february 2012 were extracted. a computer algorithm was developed incorporating internationally recognized criteria to distinguish carbapenem-resistant organisms. multivariable analysis was conducted to identify  factors associated with infection or colonization with carbapenem-resistant organisms. binomial regression was performed to detect changes in resistance trends over time. results: yearly incidence of carbapenem resistance was observed to be increasing, with significant increasing trends in acinetobacter baumannii (47.1% in 2009-10 to 77.2% in 2011-12; p<0.001) and enterobacter spp. (2.2% in 2009-10 to 11.5% in 2011-12; p<0.001). single-variable and multivariable analysis demonstrated differences in the proportion of carbapenem-resistant isolates across all variables investigated, including age, sex and clinical specialty; in  the latter organism-specific niches were identified. patients in the youngest age group (16-24 years old) had the highest odds of being infected or colonized with  carbapenem-resistant isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella spp. or pseudomonas aeruginosa. furthermore, proportions of carbapenem-resistant organisms differed between the hospitals. conclusions: carbapenem resistance is an emerging problem  within the uk inpatient healthcare setting. this is not an issue confined to the  enterobacteriaceae and fine-resolution surveillance is needed to identify at-risk groups. regular analysis of routinely collected data can provide insight into the evolving carbapenem-resistance threat, with the ability to inform efforts to prevent the spread of resistance.

TI  == abuo, a tolc-like outer membrane protein of acinetobacter baumannii, is involved  in antimicrobial and oxidative stress resistance.
AB  == although acinetobacter baumannii is well accepted as a nosocomial pathogen, only  a few of the outer membrane proteins (omps) have been functionally characterized. in this study, we demonstrate the biological functions of abuo, a homolog of tolc from escherichia coli. inactivation of abuo led to increased sensitivity to high  osmolarity and oxidative stress challenge. the deltaabuo mutant displayed increased susceptibility to antibiotics, such as amikacin, carbenicillin, ceftriaxone, meropenem, streptomycin, and tigecycline, and hospital-based disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine. the reverse transcription (rt)-pcr analysis indicated increased expression of efflux pumps (resistance nodulation cell division [rnd] efflux pump acrd, 8-fold; smr-type emre homolog, 12-fold; and major facilitator superfamily [mfs]-type ampg homolog, 2.7-fold) and two-component response regulators (baer, 4.67-fold; ompr, 10.43-fold) in the deltaabuo mutant together with downregulation of rsta (4.22-fold) and the pilin chaperone (9-fold). the isogenic mutant displayed lower virulence in a nematode model (p<0.01). experimental evidence for the binding of  merr-type transcriptional regulator soxr to radiolabeled abuo promoter suggests regulation of abuo by soxr in a. baumannii.

TI  == antibacterial properties of acinetobacter baumannii phage abp1 endolysin (plyab1).
AB  == background: acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as one of the most important hospital-acquired pathogens in the world, because of its resistance to almost all available antibiotic drugs. endolysins from phages are attracting increasing interest as potential antimicrobial agents, especially for drug-resistant bacteria. we previously isolated and characterized abp1, a virulent phage targeting the multidrug-resistant a. baumannii strain, ab1. methods: to evaluate  the antimicrobial potential of endolysin from the abp1 phage, the endolysin gene  plyab1 was cloned and over-expressed in escherichia coli, and the lytic activity  of the recombinant protein (plyab1) was tested by turbidity assessment and bacteria counting assays. results: plyab1 exhibits a marked lytic activity against a. baumannii ab1, as shown by a decrease in the number of live bacteria following treatment with the enzyme. moreover, plyab1 displayed a highly specific lytic effect against all of the 48 hospital-derived pandrug-resistant a. baumannii isolates that were tested. these isolates were shown to belong to different st clones by multilocus sequence typing. conclusions: the results presented here show that plyab1 has potential as an antibiotic against drug-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
AB  == the purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest china. antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients  per day (ddds/100 pds). hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 ddds/100 pds (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). the resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. the medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. autoregressive integrated moving average (arima) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of p. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of p. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and k. pneumoniae  to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). the decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. it also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.

TI  == impact of ertapenem on antimicrobial resistance in a sentinel group of gram-negative bacilli: a 6 year antimicrobial resistance surveillance study.
AB  == objectives: to determine the association between ertapenem and resistance of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex to different antimicrobials while adjusting for relevant hospital factors. methods: this was a retrospective time-series study conducted at a tertiary care centre from september 2002 to august 2008. the specific impact of ertapenem on the resistance of these gram-negative bacilli (gnb) was assessed by multiple linear regression analysis, adjusting for the average length of stay, rate of hospital-acquired infections and use of 10 other  antimicrobials, including type 2 carbapenems. results: unadjusted analyses revealed significant increases over the duration of the study in the number of gnb resistant to meropenem/imipenem among 1000 isolates each of e. coli (0.46 +/- 0.22, p < 0.05), p. aeruginosa (6.26 +/- 2.26, p < 0.05), k. pneumoniae (8.06 +/- 1.50, p < 0.0005) and a. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (25.39 +/- 6.81, p < 0.0005). increased resistance to cefepime (and other extended-spectrum cephalosporins) was observed in e. coli (9.55 +/- 1.45, p < 0.0005) and k. pneumoniae (15.21 +/- 2.42, p < 0.0005). a. baumannii-calcoaceticus complex showed increased resistance to all antimicrobials except amikacin. after controlling for confounders, ertapenem was not significantly associated (p > 0.05) with changes in resistance for any pathogen/antimicrobial combination. conclusions: after controlling for confounders, ertapenem was not associated with changes in resistance in a group of sentinel gnb, although significant variations in resistance to different antimicrobials were observed in the unadjusted analyses. these results emphasize the importance of implementation of local resistance surveillance platforms and stewardship programmes to combat the global emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == fast and effective photodynamic inactivation of multiresistant bacteria by cationic riboflavin derivatives.
AB  == photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (pib) proves to be an additional method to  kill pathogenic bacteria. pib requires photosensitizer molecules that effectively generate reactive oxygen species like singlet oxygen when exposed to visible light. to allow a broad application in medicine, photosensitizers should be safe  when applied in humans. substances like vitamin b2, which are most likely safe, are known to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. in the present study, we added positive charges to flavin derivatives to enable attachment of these molecules to the negatively charged surface of bacteria. two of the synthesized flavin derivatives showed a high quantum yield of singlet oxygen of approximately 75%. multidrug resistant bacteria like mrsa (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus), ehec (enterohemorrhagic escherichia coli), pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii were incubated with these flavin derivatives in vitro and were subsequently irradiated with visible light for seconds only. singlet oxygen  production in bacteria was proved by detecting its luminescence at 1270 nm. after irradiation, the number of viable bacteria decreased up to 6 log10 steps depending on the concentration of the flavin derivatives and the light dosimetry. the bactericidal effect of pib was independent of the bacterial type and the corresponding antibiotic resistance pattern. in contrast, the photosensitizer concentration and light parameters used for bacteria killing did not affect cell  viability of human keratinocytes (therapeutic window). multiresistant bacteria can be safely and effectively killed by a combination of modified vitamin b2 molecules, oxygen and visible light, whereas normal skin cells survive. further work will include these new photosensitizers for topical application to decolonize bacteria from skin and mucosa.

TI  == stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins mediate selective broad-spectrum photoinactivation of drug-resistant pathogens at nanomolar concentrations.
AB  == three stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins (bc37, bc38 and bc39) were recently reported to show exceptional activity (low nanomolar) in mediating photodynamic killing of human cancer cells after a 24h incubation upon  excitation with near-infrared light (730 nm). the presence of cationic quaternary ammonium groups in each compound suggested likely activity as antimicrobial photosensitizers. herein this hypothesis was tested against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms that have all recently drawn attention due to increased drug-resistance (gram-positive bacteria, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis; gram-negative bacteria, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii; and fungal yeasts, candida albicans and cryptococcus neoformans). all three bacteriochlorins were highly effective against both gram-positive species (>6 logs of eradication at 200 nm and 10 j/cm(2)). the dicationic bacteriochlorin (bc38) was best against the gram-negative species (>6 logs at 1-2 mum) whereas the lipophilic monocationic bacteriochlorin (bc39) was best against the fungi (>6 logs at 1 mum). the bacteriochlorins produced substantial singlet oxygen (and apparently less type-1 reactive-oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical) as judged by activation of fluorescent probes and comparison with 1h-phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid; the order of activity was bc37 > bc38 > bc39.  a short incubation time (30 min) resulted in selectivity for microbial cells over hela human cells. the highly active photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells  may stem from the amphiphilic and cationic features of the bacteriochlorins.

AB  == pseudhymenochirin-1pb (ps-1pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2pa (ps-2pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog pseudhymenochirus merlini (pipidae). ps-1pb and ps-2pa are highly cytotoxic (lc50<12 mum) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma mda-mb-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma ht-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (lc50=28+/-2 mum for ps-1pb and lc50=6+/-1 mum for ps-2pa). ps-2pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (lc50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (huvec) cells=68+/-2 mum). ps-1pb and ps-2pa (5 mug/ml) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 and the multifunctional cytokine il-6 from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from c57bl/6 mice and  enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine il-23 from both unstimulated and lps-stimulated macrophages. ps-1pb potently (mic</=10 mum) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus epidermidis, and the gram-negative bacteria acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. ps-2pa shows the same high potency (mic</=10 mum) against the gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the gram-negative isolates. ps-1pb at 4xmic kills 99.9% of escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of s. aureus within 180 min. in conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the ps-1pb and ps-2pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

AB  == microorganisms can colonize a wide variety of medical devices, putting patients in risk for local and systemic infectious complications, including local-site infections, catheter-related bloodstream infections, and endocarditis. these microorganisms are able to grow adhered to almost every surface, forming architecturally complex communities termed biofilms. the use of natural products  has been extremely successful in the discovery of new medicine, and mushrooms could be a source of natural antimicrobials. the present study reports the capacity of wild mushroom extracts to inhibit in vitro biofilm formation by multi-resistant bacteria. four gram-negative bacteria biofilm producers (escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) isolated from urine were used to verify the activity of russula delica, fistulina hepatica, mycena rosea, leucopaxilus giganteus, and lepista nuda extracts. the results obtained showed that all tested mushroom extracts presented some extent of inhibition of biofilm production. pseudomonas aeruginosa was the microorganism with the highest capacity of biofilm production, being also the most susceptible to the extracts inhibition capacity (equal or higher than 50%). among the five tested extracts against e. coli, leucopaxillus giganteus (47.8%) and mycenas rosea (44.8%) presented the highest inhibition of biofilm formation. the extracts exhibiting the highest inhibitory effect upon p. mirabilis biofilm formation were sarcodon imbricatus (45.4%) and russula delica (53.1%). acinetobacter baumannii was the microorganism with the lowest susceptibility to mushroom extracts inhibitory effect on biofilm production (highest inhibition-almost 29%, by russula delica extract). this is a pioneer study since, as far as we know, there are no reports on the inhibition of biofilm production by the studied mushroom extracts and in particular against multi-resistant clinical isolates; nevertheless, other studies are required to elucidate the mechanism of action.

TI  == gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  == wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. however, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. for this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis)  were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. by applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; mycobacterium bolletii, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus and clostridium botulinum. the genus treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified  at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. using specific real-time pcr on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria bartonella spp. borrelia spp., coxiella burnetii and tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. we estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.

TI  == active screening of multi-drug resistant bacteria effectively prevent and control the potential infections.
AB  == our objective is to determine if actively screen the multi-drug resistant bacteria (mdrb) infection in intensive care unit (icu) to prevent, control, and decrease the infection rate and transmission of mdrb. the patients admitted in icu of one hospital in 2013 were analyzed. the throat swab, blood, defecation, and urine of patients were actively collected for bacteria cultures to screen pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and acinetobacter baumannii in patients. all patients received screening  of mdrb infection and colonization within 2 days and after 2 days of admission, the results showed that there were 418 infectious bacterial strains in total and  p. aeruginosa was the main bacterium. the asymptomatic infection rates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumonia, e. coli, s. aureus, and a. baumannii were 39.02, 24.74, 44.00, 29.17, and 33.33 %, respectively; the symptomatic infection rates were 60.98, 75.26, 56.00, 70.83, and 66.67 %. 59.70 % patients received antibiotics treatment, 27.45 % patients received trachea cannula, 32.95 % patients received mechanism ventilation, 2.27 % patients received arterial cannula or venous cannula and 4.00 % patients received indwelling urinary catheters. the main mdrb  in icu is p. aeruginosa. the active screening of mdrb infection and colonization  can provide the opportunity to take the life-saving measure against mdrb and treat patients. this can decrease the infection risk and the nosocomial transmission of mdrb.

TI  == crystal structure of peptidyl-trna hydrolase from a gram-positive bacterium, streptococcus pyogenes at 2.19 a resolution shows the closed structure of the substrate-binding cleft.
AB  == peptidyl-trna hydrolase (pth) catalyses the release of trna and peptide components from peptidyl-trna molecules. pth from a gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes (sppth) was cloned, expressed, purified and crystallised.  three-dimensional structure of sppth was determined by x-ray crystallography at 2.19 a resolution. structure determination showed that the asymmetric unit of the unit cell contained two crystallographically independent molecules, designated a  and b. the superimposition of c(alpha) traces of molecules a and b showed an r.m.s. shift of 0.4 a, indicating that the structures of two crystallographically independent molecules were identical. the polypeptide chain of sppth adopted an overall alpha/beta conformation. the substrate-binding cleft in sppth is formed with three loops: the gate loop, ile91-leu102; the base loop, gly108-gly115; and  the lid loop, gly136-gly150. unlike in the structures of pth from gram-negative bacteria, the entry to the cleft in the structure of sppth appeared to be virtually closed. however, the conformations of the active site residues were found to be similar.

TI  == blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in warsaw.
AB  == establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. a total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of  two transplantation wards of a large hospital in warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, bact/alert (biomerieux, france). the 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. the highest proportion were bacteria from the family enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with escherichia coli (61 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. the non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). most frequent gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). of 77 staphylococcal strains,  56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 staphylococcus aureus. other gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). among all enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (esbls). resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of s aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples,  2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. both were enterococcus faecium. resistant strains of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.

TI  == update on acinetobacter species: mechanisms of antimicrobial resistance and contemporary in vitro activity of minocycline and other treatment options.
AB  == among acinetobacter species, a. baumannii and other closely related species are commonly implicated in nosocomial infections. these organisms are usually multidrug resistant (mdr), and therapeutic options to treat a. baumannii infections are very limited. clinicians have been resorting to older antimicrobial agents to treat infections caused by mdr a. baumannii, and some of  these agents have documented toxicity and/or are not optimized for the infection  type to be treated. recent clinical experience supported by antimicrobial susceptibility data suggests that minocycline has greater activity than other tetracyclines and glycylcyclines against various mdr pathogens that have limited  therapeutic options available, including acinetobacter species. an intravenous formulation of minocycline has recently become available for clinical use, and in contrast to most older tetracyclines, minocycline has high activity against acinetobacter species. in this report, we summarized some of the characteristics  of the tetracycline class, and quantified the minocycline activity against contemporary (2007-2011) isolates and its potential therapeutic role against a collection of 5477 a. baumannii and other relevant gram-negative organisms when compared directly with tetracycline, doxycycline, and other broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents. acinetobacter baumannii strains were highly resistant to all agents tested, with the exception of minocycline (79.1% susceptible) and colistin (98.8% susceptible). minocycline (minimum inhibitory concentration that  inhibits 50% and 90% of the isolates [mic(50/90)]: 1/8 microg/ml) displayed greater activity than doxycycline (mic(50/90): 2/>8 microg/ml) and tetracycline hydrochloride (hcl) (only 30.2% susceptible) against a. baumannii isolates, and was significantly more active than other tetracyclines against burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli, serratia marcescens, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia  isolates. in vitro susceptibility testing using tetracycline hcl as a surrogate for the susceptibility other tetracyclines fails to detect minocycline-susceptible isolates and the potential utility of minocycline for the treatment of many mdr a. baumannii infections and other difficult-to-treat species, where there are often limited choices of antimicrobials.

TI  == characterisation of pellicles formed by acinetobacter baumannii at the air-liquid interface.
AB  == the clinical importance of acinetobacter baumannii is partly due to its natural ability to survive in the hospital environment. this persistence may be explained by its capacity to form biofilms and, interestingly, a. baumannii can form pellicles at the air-liquid interface more readily than other less pathogenic acinetobacter species. pellicles from twenty-six strains were morphologically classified into three groups: i) egg-shaped (27%); ii) ball-shaped (50%); and iii) irregular pellicles (23%). one strain representative of each group was further analysed by brewster's angle microscopy to follow pellicle development, demonstrating that their formation did not require anchoring to a solid surface.  total carbohydrate analysis of the matrix showed three main components: glucose,  glcnac and kdo. dispersin b, an enzyme that hydrolyzes poly-n-acetylglucosamine (pnag) polysaccharide, inhibited a. baumannii pellicle formation, suggesting that this exopolysaccharide contributes to pellicle formation. also associated with the pellicle matrix were three subunits of pili assembled by chaperon-usher systems: the major csua/b, a1s_1510 (presented 45% of identity with the main pilin f17-a from enterotoxigenic escherichia coli pili) and a1s_2091. the presence of both pnag polysaccharide and pili systems in matrix of pellicles might contribute to the virulence of this emerging pathogen.

TI  == origin in acinetobacter guillouiae and dissemination of the aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme aph(3')-vi.
AB  == the amikacin resistance gene apha6 was first detected in the nosocomial pathogen  acinetobacter baumannii and subsequently in other genera. analysis of 133 whole-genome sequences covering the taxonomic diversity of acinetobacter spp. detected apha6 in the chromosome of 2 isolates of a. guillouiae, which is an environmental species, 1 of 8 a. parvus isolates, and 5 of 34 a. baumannii isolates. the gene was also present in 29 out of 36 a. guillouiae isolates screened by pcr, indicating that it is ancestral to this species. the pnative promoter for apha6 in a. guillouiae and a. parvus was replaced in a. baumannii by papha6, which was generated by use of the insertion sequence isaba125, which brought a -35 sequence. study of promoter strength in escherichia coli and a. baumannii indicated that papha6 was four times more potent than pnative. there was a good correlation between aminoglycoside mics and apha6 transcription in a.  guillouiae isolates that remained susceptible to amikacin. the marked topology differences of the phylogenetic trees of apha6 and of the hosts strongly support  its recent direct transfer within acinetobacter spp. and also to evolutionarily remote bacterial genera. concomitant expression of apha6 must have occurred because, contrary to the donors, it can confer resistance to the new hosts. mobilization and expression of apha6 via composite transposons and the upstream is-generating hybrid papha6, followed by conjugation, seems the most plausible mechanism. this is in agreement with the observation that, in the recipients, apha6 is carried by conjugative plasmids and flanked by is that are common in acinetobacter spp. our data indicate that resistance genes can also be found in susceptible environmental bacteria. importance: we speculated that the apha6 gene for an enzyme that confers resistance to amikacin, the most active aminoglycoside for the treatment of nosocomial infections due to acinetobacter spp., originated  in this genus before disseminating to phylogenetically distant genera pathogenic  for humans. using a combination of whole-genome sequencing of a collection of acinetobacter spp. covering the breadth of the known taxonomic diversity of the genus, gene cloning, detailed promoter analysis, study of heterologous gene expression, and comparative analysis of the phylogenetic trees of apha6 and of the bacterial hosts, we found that apha6 originated in acinetobacter guillouiae,  an amikacin-susceptible environmental species. the gene conferred, upon mobilization, high-level resistance to the new hosts. this work stresses that nonpathogenic bacteria can act as reservoirs of resistance determinants, and it provides an example of the use of a genomic library to study the origin and dissemination of an antibiotic resistance gene to human pathogens.

TI  == molecular characterization and in vitro susceptibilities of beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli, klebsiella species, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa and staphylococcus aureus to cse1034 and other beta-lactams.
AB  == objective: to study the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) among 663 clinical isolates obtained from various parts of india and to study the occurrence of different variants of esbls among these isolates. methods: phenotypic characterization and susceptibility studies were performed according to the methods described in clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. the occurrence of esbl variants was analyzed with pcr using the previously reported primers. results: among the six hundred sixty three isolates, the identified isolates were acinetobacter baumannii (72), escherichia coli (218), klebsiella pneumoniae (30), klebsiella oxytoca (63), pseudomonas aeruginosa (264) and staphylococcus aureus (16). pcr results revealed that approximately 89.0% of pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were positive for esbl followed by escherichia coli (85.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (76.6%), klebsiella oxytoca (73.0%), acinetobacter baumannii (72.2%) and staphylococcus aureus (31.2%). the overall prevalence of esbl was 82.5%. the presence of tem type esbls were the predominant (in 186 isolates), followed by shv (138), oxa (92), ctx-m (65), ampc (33), kpc (28) and blaz (5). of the drugs involved in the study, cse1034 was found to be the most efficacious against all of esbl positive clinical isolates showing susceptibility approximately 95.7% with minimal inhibitory concentration values between 0.125 and 8.000 mug/ml for all strains tested. the susceptibilities of penems (meropenem and imipenem and cilastatin) ranged between 83% and 93% for all the isolates. the susceptibilities of other drugs like piperacillin and tazobactam, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, cefoperazone and sulbactam were <45% for all the isolates. conclusions: results of the present study indicated that majority of the isolates was susceptible to cse1034 and it could be a potent antibacterial agent for the treatment of severe  bacterial infections caused by such organisms.

TI  == one-step species-specific high resolution melting analysis for nosocomial bacteria detection.
AB  == nosocomial infections are a major public health concern worldwide. early and accurate identification of nosocomial pathogens which are often multidrug resistant is crucial for prompt treatment. hence, an alternative real-time polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting-curve analysis (hrma) was developed for identification of five nosocomial bacteria. this assay targets species-specific regions of each nosocomial bacteria and produced five distinct melt curves with each representing a particular bacterial species. the melting curves were characterized by peaks of 78.8 +/- 0.2 degrees c for acinetobacter baumannii, 82.7 +/- 0.2 degrees c for escherichia coli, 86.3 +/- 0.3 degrees c for klebsiella pneumoniae, 88.8 +/- 0.2 degrees c for pseudomonas aeruginosa and 74.6 +/- 02 degrees c for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the assay was able to specifically detect the five bacterial species with an overall detection limit of 2 x 10(-2) ng/mul. in conclusion, the hrm assay developed is a simple and rapid method for identification of the selected nosocomial pathogens.

TI  == relationship between the gold combined copd assessment staging system and bacterial isolation.
AB  == background: acute exacerbations, which are a significant cause of mortality and morbidity, adversely affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (copd) prognosis by accelerating loss of lung function. it is important to know the microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics for fast and accurate treatment of acute exacerbations. objectives: the last global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease (gold) publication recommended a new staging system containing obstruction degree, frequency of exacerbations, and quality of  life questionnaires. this study is designed to analyze the relationship between the bacteria isolated in acute exacerbations and new gold stages. methods: potentially pathogenic bacteria (ppb) isolation with culture and polymerase chain reaction methods were obtained from 114 acute exacerbation copd patients, classified into a, b, c, and d groups by analyzing the forced expiratory volume in 1 second (fev1) value, copd assessment test (cat) score, and exacerbation frequency according to the new gold staging system. results: there was a significant correlation between exacerbation frequency and ppb isolation (p=0.002). there was no relationship between gold stage, fev1, and cat score with ppb isolation. the isolated bacteria diversity and mixed infection frequency were higher in the gold stage d group. pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii were isolated only from d group patients. conclusion: bacterial infection may cause an acute exacerbation equally in each stage for copd. the difference in bacterial etiology is more related to exacerbation frequency than fev1 and cat scores for an acute exacerbation. determining exacerbation frequency is significant for treatment success in empirical antibiotic selection.

AB  == the 89,977 bp nucleotide sequence of pacm1, isolated from a 1993 outbreak strain  of cephalosporin-resistant klebsiella oxytoca, has been completed and assigned genbank accession number kj541681. the plasmid has a single 31,842 bp mosaic multi-drug resistance-encoding (mdr) region comprising the mer resistance module  of tn1696, two integrons with a total of seven cassettes, one complete copy each  of is1r and is26, and the bla(shv-5)-carrying tn2003 (with defective is26 termini), all within a tn1721-like element inserted into the mucb gene of the incl/m plasmid backbone. the tn1721-tn1696 combination resembles sequence found in the chromosomal mdr islands of some acinetobacter baumannii isolates. among the completely sequenced incl/m resistance plasmids, the tn1721-based mdr region  is unique, but data from older studies suggest that this type of plasmid was widespread in the 1990s. since resistance gene dosage is affected by plasmid copy number (pcn), we used a relatively simple new "efficiency-corrected" qpcr assay to measure the pcn of pacm1. there are approximately three copies per chromosome  in an escherichia coli dh5alpha host, and two in the original klebsiella oxytoca  isolate. we could not find similar pcn data for other medically important plasmids for comparison. the study of this plasmid property and its effect on resistance levels should be facilitated in the future by the availability of qpcr instruments and complete genome sequences.

TI  == properties of adeabc and adeijk efflux systems of acinetobacter baumannii compared with those of the acrab-tolc system of escherichia coli.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii contains rnd-family efflux systems adeabc and adeijk, which pump out a wide range of antimicrobial compounds, as judged from the mic changes occurring upon deletion of the responsible genes. however, these studies  may miss changes because of the high backgrounds generated by the remaining pumps and by beta-lactamases, and it is unclear how the activities of these pumps compare quantitatively with those of the well-studied acrab-tolc system of escherichia coli. we expressed adeabc and adeijk of a. baumannii, as well as e. coli acrab, in an e. coli host from which acrab was deleted. the a. baumannii pumps were functional in e. coli, and the mic changes that were observed largely  confirmed the substrate range already reported, with important differences. thus, the adeabc system pumped out all beta-lactams, an activity that was often missed  in deletion studies. when the expression level of the pump genes was adjusted to  a similar level for a comparison with acrab-tolc, we found that both a. baumannii efflux systems pumped out a wide range of compounds, but adeabc was less effective than acrab-tolc in the extrusion of lipophilic beta-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was more effective at tetracycline  efflux. adeijk was remarkably more effective than a similar level of acrab-tolc in the efflux of beta-lactams, novobiocin, and ethidium bromide, although it was  less so in the efflux of erythromycin. these results thus allow us to compare these efflux systems on a quantitative basis, if we can assume that the heterologous systems are fully functional in the e. coli host.

TI  == in vitro activity of wq-3810, a novel fluoroquinolone, against multidrug-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens.
AB  == the aim of this study was to examine the in vitro antibacterial activity of wq-3810, a new fluoroquinolone, against clinically relevant pathogens such as acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant (mdr) and fluoroquinolone-resistant (fqr) isolates, compared  with those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. wq-3810 demonstrated the most potent activity against the antimicrobial-resistant pathogens tested. against a. baumannii, including mdr isolates, the potency of wq-3810 [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=1 mg/l] was more than eight-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin (64 mg/l) and levofloxacin (8 mg/l). against e. coli and s. pneumoniae, including fqr isolates, wq-3810 (mic(90)=4 mg/l and 0.06 mg/l, respectively) was also more active than ciprofloxacin (64 mg/l and 2 mg/l) and levofloxacin (32 mg/l and 2 mg/l). furthermore, wq-3810 was the most potent among the fluoroquinolones tested against meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and neisseria gonorrhoeae, including fqr isolates. in particular, wq-3810 demonstrated highly potent activity against fqr isolates of a. baumannii, e. coli and s. pneumoniae with amino acid mutation(s) in the quinolone resistance-determining region of dna gyrase and/or topoisomerase iv, which are the target enzymes of fluoroquinolones. an enzyme inhibition study performed using fqr e. coli dna gyrase suggested that  the potent antibacterial activity of wq-3810 against drug-resistant isolates partly results from the strong inhibition of the target enzymes. in conclusion, this study demonstrated that wq-3810 exhibits extremely potent antibacterial activity over the existing fluoroquinolones, particularly against mdr and fqr pathogens.

AB  == outer membrane vesicles (omvs) are produced by various pathogenic gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. in this study, we isolated omvs from a representative soil bacterium,  pseudomonas putida kt2440, which has a biodegradative activity toward various aromatic compounds. proteomic analysis identified the outer membrane proteins (omps) oprc, oprd, opre, oprf, oprh, oprg, and oprw as major components of the omv of p. putida kt2440. the production of omvs was dependent on the nutrient availability in the culture media, and the up- or down-regulation of specific omps was observed according to the culture conditions. in particular, porins (e.g., benzoate-specific porin, benf-like porin) and enzymes (e.g., catechol 1,2-dioxygenase, benzoate dioxygenase) for benzoate degradation were uniquely found in omvs prepared from p. putida kt2440 that were cultured in media containing benzoate as the energy source. omvs of p. putida kt2440 showed low pathological activity toward cultured cells that originated from human lung cells, which suggests their potential as adjuvants or omv vaccine carriers. our results suggest that the protein composition of the omvs of p. putida kt2440 reflects the characteristics of the total proteome of p. putida kt2440.

TI  == preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  == the ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (cdh) to produce hydrogen peroxide (h(2)o(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. a recombinantly produced cdh from myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mm or 2 mm cellobiose as substrate. biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by cdh when supplemented with 1mm cellobiose. the cdh/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant s. aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, proteus mirabilis, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. interestingly, cdh was also able to produce h(2)o(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exps) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. the h(2)o(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exps were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for cdh as well as destabilises the biofilm. furthermore, cdh suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. incorporation of the cdh/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore  makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.

TI  == [prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in peking union medical college hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in peking union medical college  hospital. method: the incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. results: there were 449  positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. samples separated from patients with  community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. most community-aquired infections were caused by gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples.  respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were gram-negative (66.9%). the most common gram-negative bacteria included escherichia coli (13.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common gram-positive  bacteria. gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). the detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumonia/klebsiella oxytoca, escherichia coli, and proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. the resistance to acinetobacter baumannii was serious. multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant a. baumannii acountted for 74% of all a. baumannii infections. stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. also, 22 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant staphylococcus epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. all patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. fourteen  of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. there were 61  samples proved to be bacteria colonization. nonfermenters such as acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. conclusions: the pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly gram-negative bacteria. the incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.

TI  == antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  == background: biosurfactants (bs) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. bs exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. in this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of bs produced by lactobacillus jensenii and lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical multidrug  resistant (mdr) strains of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). cell-bound bs from both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. the surface activities of crude bs samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. the antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both bs against the above mentioned mdr pathogens were determined. results: surface activities for both bs ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml  with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. bs of both l. jensenii and l. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against a. baumannii, e. coli and s. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the bs caused membrane damage for  a. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in s. aureus. conclusion: our results indicate that bs isolated from two lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against mdr strains of a. baumannii, e. coli and mrsa. both bs also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against a. baumannii, e. coli  and s. aureus. together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for bs as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.

TI  == waging war against extended spectrum beta lactamase and metallobetalactamase producing pathogens- novel adjuvant antimicrobial agent cse1034- an extended hope.
AB  == preamble: in the visage of multidrug resistance among gram negative bacilli, we look forward to carbapenem group of drugs as empiric choice in seriously ill patients. however increasing resistance to carbapenems, the last resort, is of growing concern for all. it's high time to look beyond carbapenems and emphasize  on carbapenem sparers. objective: this study is to find the susceptibility pattern of the novel adjuvant antimicrobial cse 1034 a combination of ceftriaxone+sulbactam+disodium edetate for the current esbl and mbl isolates in a tertiary care centre. materials and methods: a total of 823 gram negative bacterial isolates were obtained from different clinical specimens during the period of march, 2013 to october, 2013. the overall prevalence of metallobetalactamase producing gram negative organisms was 11 percent (n=91). we  included a total of 141 clinical isolates for this study. results: among 141 clinical isolates, 50 isolates (35%) were esbl producers and 91 (65%) were mbl producers. maximum numbers of esbl producers were identified in escherichia coli  followed by klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and proteus spp. maximum numbers of mbl producers were identified in klebsiella pneumoniae followed by pseudomonas aeruginosa. cse 1034 (ceftriaxone+sulbactam+disodium edetate) showed fairly good in-vitro susceptibility for these esbl and mbl producing isolates. it exhibited 64 % to 100% susceptibility and 18% to 22% intermediate sensitivity to esbl producing isolates and 42 % to 89 % susceptible  and 10 % to 51 % intermediate response to mbl producing isolates. conclusion: with increasing resistance to the commonly prescribed drugs used to treat infections caused by variety of gram negative organisms, ceftriaxone+sulbactam+disodium edetate, a novel antibiotic adjuvant entity (aae)  may be a promising option.

TI  == gram-negative infections in pediatric and neonatal intensive care units of latin  america.
AB  == in order to review the epidemiology of gram-negative infections in the pediatric  and neonatal intensive care units (picus and nicus) of latin america a systematic search of pubmed and targeted search of scielo was performed to identify relevant articles published since 2005. independent cohort data indicated that overall infection rates were higher in latin american picus and nicus versus developed countries (range, 5%-37% vs 6%-15%, respectively). approximately one third of latin american patients with an acquired picu or nicu infection died, and crude mortality was higher among extremely low-birth-weight infants and those with an infection caused by gram-negative bacteria. in studies reporting > 100 isolates,  the frequency of gram-negative pathogens varied from 31% (colombia) to 63% (mexico), with klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli the predominant pathogens in almost all countries, and acinetobacter spp. and serratia spp. isolated sporadically. the activity of quinolones and third-generation cephalosporins against p. aeruginosa, acinetobacter spp., and enterobacteria was seriously compromised, coincident with a high prevalence of circulating extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. furthermore, we identified two observational studies conducted in chile and brazil reporting infections by p. aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii in picus, demonstrating resistance to carbapenems, and two outbreaks of carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae in colombia  and brazil. the endemicity of multidrug-resistant gram-negative infections in latin american picus and nicus is punctuated by intermittent clonal outbreaks. the problem may be alleviated by ensuring icus are less crowded, increasing staffing levels of better-trained health care personnel, and implementing antimicrobial stewardship and surveillance programs.

AB  == filamentous hemagglutinin adhesins (fha) are key factors for bacterial attachment and subsequent cell accumulation on substrates. here an fha-like outer membrane (om) adhesin of acinetobacter baumannii atcc19606(t) was displayed on escherichia coli. the candidate autotransporter (at) genes were identified in a. baumannii atcc19606(t) genome. the exoprotein (fhab1) and transporter (fhac1) were produced independently within the same cell (fhab1c1). the fhac1 was mutated. in vitro adherence to epithelial cells of the recombinant fhab1c1 and the mutant strains were compared with a. baumanni atcc19606(t). a bivalent chimeric protein (k) composed of immunologically important portions of fhab1 (b) and fhac1 (c) was constructed. the mice vaccinated with chimeric protein were challenged with a. baumannii atcc19606(t) and fhab1c1 producing recombinant e. coli. mutations in the fhac1 resulted in the absence of fhab1 in the om. expression of fhab1c1 enhanced the adherence of recombinant bacteria to a546 bronchial cell line. the results revealed association of fhab1 with bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation. immunization with a combination of recombinant b and k proteins proved protective against a. baumanni atcc19606(t). the findings may be applied in active and passive immunization strategies against a. baumannii.

TI  == lethal synergy involving bicyclomycin: an approach for reviving old antibiotics.
AB  == background: one way to address the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance is to revive old compounds that may have intrinsic lethal activity that is obscured  by protective factors. bicyclomycin is an old inhibitor of the rho transcription  terminator that by itself shows little rapid lethal activity. however, bicyclomycin participates in bacteriostatic synergy, which raises the possibility that conditions for lethal synergy may exist, perhaps through a suppression of protective factors. methods: bicyclomycin was combined with bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression, and bactericidal activity was measured with several cultured gram-negative pathogens. results: when used alone, bicyclomycin  failed to rapidly kill growing cultures of escherichia coli; however, the additional presence of bacteriostatic concentrations of tetracycline, chloramphenicol or rifampicin led to rapid killing. four other pathogen species,  acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and shigella dysenteriae, also exhibited enhanced killing when bicyclomycin was combined with tetracycline or rifampicin. this lethal synergy was achieved at low concentrations (slightly above the mic) for all agents tested in combinations. follow-up work with e. coli indicated that lethal synergy arose  from a blockage of transcription elongation. moreover, lethal synergy was reduced when bicyclomycin was added 60 min before tetracycline, suggesting that bicyclomycin induces a protective factor. conclusions: the action of bicyclomycin illustrates the potential present in a largely abandoned antibacterial agent; it  exhibits lethal synergy when coadministered with known, bacteriostatic inhibitors of gene expression. the identification of protective factors, which are currently uncharacterized, may reveal new ways to promote the lethal action of some old antibiotics.

TI  == rapid identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria with an oligonucleotide microarray-based assay.
AB  == rapid molecular identification of carbapenemase genes in gram-negative bacteria is crucial for infection control and prevention, surveillance and for epidemiological purposes. furthermore, it may have a significant impact upon determining the appropriate initial treatment and greatly benefit for critically  ill patients. a novel oligonucleotide microarray-based assay was developed to simultaneously detect genes encoding clinically important carbapenemases as well  as selected extended (esbl) and narrow spectrum (nsbl) beta-lactamases directly from clonal culture material within few hours. additionally, a panel of species specific markers was included to identify escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, citrobacter freundii/braakii, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii. the assay was tested using a panel of 117 isolates collected from urinary, blood and stool samples. for these isolates, phenotypic identifications  and susceptibility tests were available. an independent detection of carbapenemase, esbl and nsbl genes was carried out by various external reference  laboratories using pcr methods. in direct comparison, the microarray correctly identified 98.2% of the covered carbapenemase genes. this included blavim (13 out of 13), blagim (2/2), blakpc (27/27), blandm (5/5), blaimp-2/4/7/8/13/14/15/16/31 (10/10), blaoxa-23 (12/13), blaoxa-40-group (7/7), blaoxa-48-group (32/33), blaoxa-51 (1/1) and blaoxa-58 (1/1). furthermore, the test correctly identified additional beta-lactamases [blaoxa-1 (16/16), blaoxa-2 (4/4), blaoxa-9 (33/33), oxa-10 (3/3), blaoxa-51 (25/25), blaoxa-58 (2/2), ctx-m1/m15 (17/17) and blavim (1/1)]. in direct comparison to phenotypical identification obtained by vitek or  maldi-tof systems, 114 of 117 (97.4%) isolates, including acinetobacter baumannii (28/28), enterobacter spec. (5/5), escherichia coli (4/4), klebsiella pneumoniae  (62/63), klebsiella oxytoca (0/2), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12/12), citrobacter freundii (1/1) and citrobacter braakii (2/2), were correctly identified by a panel of species specific probes. this assay might be easily extended, adapted and transferred to point of care platforms enabling fast surveillance, rapid detection and appropriate early treatment of infections caused by multiresistant  gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == recombinant scorpine produced using sumo fusion partner in escherichia coli has the activities against clinically isolated bacteria and inhibits the plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro.
AB  == scorpine, a small cationic peptide from the venom of pandinus imperator, which has been shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities, has potential important applications in the pharmaceutical industries. however, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in  escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (sumo) fusion partner. the fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in e. coli, and expression was verified by sds-page and western blotting analysis. the fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni2+-nta) resin chromatography. after the sumo-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the sumo protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a ni2+-nta column. tricine/sds-page gel results indicated that scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. the recombinantly expressed scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including staphylococcus aureus atcc 29213 and acinetobacter baumannii atcc 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including s. aureus s, s. aureus r, a. baumannii s, and a. baumannii r. it also produced 100%  reduction in plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro. thus, the expression strategy presented in this study allowed convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant scorpine for pharmaceutical applications in the future.

AB  == lipid a is the essential component of endotoxin (gram-negative lipopolysaccharide), a potent immunostimulatory compound. as the outer surface of the outer membrane, the details of lipid a structure are crucial not only to bacterial pathogenesis but also to membrane integrity. this work characterizes the structure of lipid a in two psychrophiles, psychromonas marina and psychrobacter cryohalolentis, and also two mesophiles to which they are related using maldi-tof ms and fatty acid methyl ester (fame) gc-ms. p. marina lipid a is strikingly similar to that of escherichia coli in organization and total acyl size, but incorporates an unusual doubly unsaturated tetradecadienoyl acyl residue. p. cryohalolentis also shows structural organization similar to a closely related mesophile, acinetobacter baumannii, however it has generally shorter acyl constituents and shows many acyl variants differing by single methylene (-ch2-) units, a characteristic it shares with the one previously reported psychrotolerant lipid a structure. this work is the first detailed structural characterization of lipid a from an obligate psychrophile and the second from a psychrotolerant species. it reveals distinctive structural features of psychrophilic lipid a in comparison to that of related mesophiles which suggest constitutive adaptations to maintain outer membrane fluidity in cold environments.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility pattern of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria causing nosocomial urinary tract infections in  an iranian referral teaching hospital.
AB  == objective: gram-negative bacilli are the most important cause of nosocomial urinary tract infections (utis). the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) enzymes is a common mechanism of resistance among these bacteria. the aim of this study was to determine the rate of esbl producing gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial uti in a referral hospital as well as their susceptibility pattern to the most commonly used antibiotics. methods: in a prospective cross-sectional study performed over a 6-month period, urinary specimens obtained from hospitalized patients with documented culture-proved nosocomial uti (age range of 1-87 years). isolated aerobic gram-negative bacteria underwent further microbiologic tests for detection of esbl, as well as antimicrobial susceptibility test using kirby-bauer (disk diffusion) and e-test methods. findings: during the study period, 213 urine samples were detected to have growth of gram-negative organism. escherichia coli was the most frequently isolated organism (61%). esbl was detected in 102 isolates including 38.5% of e.  coli, 39.5% of klebsiella pneumonia, 88.5% of pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 100% of acinetobacter baumannii strains. imipenem and meropenem were the most effective antibiotics on e. coli and k. pneumoniae strains. p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii  strains showed high resistance to all tested antibiotics. conclusion: large numbers of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial utis produce esbl with most  being multidrug-resistant. therefore, routine esbl detection testing and subsequent antibiogram with disk diffusion method could be useful to determine the best treatment options for uti.

TI  == a broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant eskape (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species) pathogens. combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus. furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature p. aeruginosa biofilms. in addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced p. aeruginosa pa14 preexisting biofilms. pcr studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii in mediterranean countries.
AB  == the emergence and global spread of carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii are of great concern to health services worldwide. these  beta-lactamases hydrolyse almost all beta-lactams, are plasmid-encoded, and are easily transferable among bacterial species. they are mostly of the kpc, vim, imp, ndm, and oxa-48 types. their current extensive spread worldwide in enterobacteriaceae is an important source of concern. infections caused by these  bacteria have limited treatment options and have been associated with high mortality rates. carbapenemase producers are mainly identified among klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and a. baumannii and still mostly in hospital settings and rarely in the community. the mediterranean region is of interest due to a great diversity and population mixing. the prevalence of carbapenemases is particularly high, with this area constituting one of the most important reservoirs. the types of carbapenemase vary among countries, partially depending  on the population exchange relationship between the regions and the possible reservoirs of each carbapenemase. this review described the epidemiology of carbapenemases produced by enterobacteria and a. baumannii in this part of the world highlighting the worrisome situation and the need to screen and detect these enzymes to prevent and control their dissemination.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase rates in aerobic gram-negative bacteria causing intra-abdominal infections in vietnam: report from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart 2009-2011).
AB  == treatment options for multidrug-resistant pathogens remain problematic in many regions and individual countries, warranting ongoing surveillance and analysis. limited antimicrobial susceptibility information is available for pathogens from  vietnam. this study determined the bacterial susceptibility of aerobic gram-negative pathogens of intra-abdominal infections among patients in vietnam during 2009-2011. a total of 905 isolates were collected from 4 medical centers in this investigation as part of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends. antimicrobial susceptibility and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) rates among the appropriate species were determined by a central laboratory using clinical and laboratory standards institute methods. among the species collected, escherichia coli (48.1% esbl-positive) and klebsiella pneumoniae (39.5% esbl-positive) represented the majority (46.4%) of the isolates submitted for this study. ertapenem mic90 values were lowest for these 2 species at 0.12 and 0.25mug/ml and remained unchanged for esbl-positive isolates. imipenem mic90 values were also the same for all isolates and esbl-positive strains at 0.25 and 0.5mug/ml, respectively. ertapenem mic90 values for additional species with sufficient numbers for analysis, including enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were 1, 0.06, >4, and >4mug/ml, respectively. analysis of beta-lactamases in a subset of 132 phenotypically esbl-positive enterobacteriaceae demonstrated that ctx-m variants, particularly ctx-m-27 and ctx-m-15, were the predominant enzymes. high resistance rates in vietnam hospitals dictate continuous monitoring as antimicrobial inactivating enzymes continue to spread throughout asia and globally.

TI  == development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-lipl32-coupled gold nanoparticles for leptospira detection.
AB  == detection of antibody specific to leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. however, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. molecular techniques  are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. in this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to lipl32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic leptospira. this coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for leptospira detection. we demonstrated that the sensitivity of leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). there was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic leptospira, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus group b, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, salmonella typhi, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis or enterococcus faecium. these data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to lipl32 could  be used for leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.

TI  == broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  == bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppgpp, an important signal in biofilm development. at concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth,  peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial pathogens including pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, salmonella typhimurium and burkholderia cenocepacia. low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. we hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppgpp synthesis through the enzymes rela and spot, was targeted. consistent with this, increasing (p)ppgpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of rela led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. furthermore, rela and spot mutations blocking production of (p)ppgpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. also, eliminating (p)ppgpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing rela behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. nmr and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppgpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with  ppgpp. we thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppgpp and marks it for degradation in cells. targeting (p)ppgpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug  resistance.

AB  == paenibacterin, produced by paenibacillus thiaminolyticus osy-se, is active both against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecalis. paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (atcc crl-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (ic50)>/=109mug/ml. the cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. in a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of p. aeruginosa. considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that  this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.

TI  == control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  == background: non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. this study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. methods: alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. at 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4-  nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2h-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (xtt) assay. the anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the  treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. the proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. scanning  electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. the treated gel was tested against acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, candida albicans, and c. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [cfu]/ml), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. results: non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) cfu/ml and within 15 sec of treatment. the treated gel inactivated 10(9) cfu/ml of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. the plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. conclusion: a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.

TI  == micro-patterned surfaces reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro: potential for enhancing endotracheal tube designs.
AB  == background: ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a leading hospital acquired  infection in intensive care units despite improved patient care practices and advancements in endotracheal tube (ett) designs. the ett provides a conduit for bacterial access to the lower respiratory tract and a substratum for biofilm formation, both of which lead to vap. a novel microscopic ordered surface topography, the sharklet micro-pattern, has been shown to decrease surface attachment of numerous microorganisms, and may provide an alternative strategy for vap prevention if included on the surface of an ett. to evaluate the feasibility of this micro-pattern for this application, the microbial range of performance was investigated in addition to biofilm studies with and without a mucin-rich medium to simulate the tracheal environment in vitro. methods: the top five pathogens associated with ett-related pneumonia, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumonia, acinetobacter baumannii, and escherichia coli, were evaluated for attachment to micro-patterned and un-patterned silicone surfaces in a short-term colonization assay. two key pathogens, mrsa and pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated for biofilm formation in a nutrient rich broth for four days and minimal media for 24 hours, respectively, on each surface type. p. aeruginosa was further evaluated for biofilm formation on each surface type in a mucin-modified medium mimicking tracheal mucosal secretions. results are reported as percent reductions and significance is based on t-tests and anova models of log reductions. all experiments were replicated at least three times. results: micro-patterned surfaces demonstrated reductions in microbial colonization for a broad range of species, with up to 99.9% (p < 0.05) reduction compared to un-patterned controls. biofilm formation was also reduced, with 67% (p = 0.12) and 52% (p = 0.05) reductions in mrsa and p. aeruginosa biofilm formation, respectively. further, a  58% (p < 0.01) reduction was demonstrated on micro-patterned surfaces for p. aeruginosa biofilms under clinically-simulated conditions when compared to un-patterned controls. conclusions: this engineered micro-pattern reduces the colonization and biofilm formation of key vap-associated pathogens in vitro. future application of this micro-pattern on endotracheal tubes may prevent or prolong the onset of vap without the need for antimicrobial agents.

TI  == prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms and risk factors for carriage in long-term care facilities: a nested case-control study.
AB  == background: long-term care facilities (ltcfs) are a potentially important reservoir of multidrug-resistant (mdr) organisms; however, limited data exist. methods: a point-prevalence study was conducted in four co-located ltcfs in australia. nasal and rectal swabs were cultured for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) and mdr gram-negative bacilli (gnb). molecular typing and resistance detection were performed. risk factors for colonization with an mdr organism were determined using a nested case-control study. results: consent was obtained from 115 (85%) of 136 eligible participants. forty-one (36%) residents carried at least one type of mdr organism. the prevalence was 16% mrsa (n = 18), 6% vre (n = 7) and 21% mdr gnb [n = 24; including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 12) and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6)]. the majority of esbl-producing e. coli and a. baumannii were clonal. current wound management [adjusted or (aor) 8.81 (95% ci 2.78-27.94), p < 0.001], medical device in situ [aor 5.58 (95% ci 1.34-23.32), p = 0.018] and pressure ulcer [aor 3.69 (95% ci 1.06-12.86), p = 0.04] were independent risk factors for mdr organism colonization. advanced dementia [aor 3.54 (95% ci 1.23-10.23), p = 0.02] and prolonged antibiotic use [aor 2.95 (95% ci 1.01-8.60), p = 0.047] were independently associated with mrsa colonization, whilst current wound management  [aor 15.59 (95% ci 4.85-50.10), p < 0.001] and fluoroquinolone use [aor 4.27 (95% ci 1.20-15.25), p = 0.025] were risk factors for mdr gnb colonization. conclusions: ltcfs are an important reservoir of mdr organisms, with person-to-person transmissions being a potential issue. we have identified several predictors of colonization with mdr organisms, allowing a more targeted management of high-risk residents.

TI  == are community environmental surfaces near hospitals reservoirs for gram-negative  nosocomial pathogens?
AB  == background: hospital visitors and staff visit neighboring businesses, creating the potential for contamination of surfaces with hospital flora. methods: cultures were obtained from environmental surfaces in hospital lobbies and the surrounding community of 6 hospitals in brooklyn, ny. as a control, cultures were taken from surfaces >1.5 miles from any hospital. screening for beta-lactamases was done by polymerase chain reaction (pcr), and select isolates were fingerprinted by the repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr method. results: of 493 cultures, most (70%) involved doors from local businesses. cephalosporin-resistant citrobacter freundii (n = 3), escherichia coli (n = 2), and enterobacter sp (n = 2) were recovered from surfaces near hospitals, but not  from control sites. one isolate of stenotrophomonas maltophilia harbored an integron-associated vim-2. acinetobacter baumannii was recovered in 15 samples, including 4.5% of swabs from </=0.5 miles of the hospitals versus 0% from >/=0.6  miles (p = .004). eleven a baumannii isolates were clonally related by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-pcr and were also related to a known clinical isolate. conclusions: strains of a baumannii and cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae can be recovered from environmental surfaces surrounding hospitals. finding these pathogens in the perihospital environment suggests hand  cleansing should be emphasized for all people entering and leaving hospitals. the finding of integron-associated vim-2 in our region is disconcerting, and further  vigilance is warranted.

TI  == prevalence and antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative pathogens in saudi arabia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative bacteria is a worldwide problem, including in the kingdom of saudi arabia, with major concerns regarding pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacteriaceae. although over half of the isolates of p. aeruginosa remain susceptible to carbapenems, quinolones, and aminoglycosides in most reports from saudi arabia, resistance is  on increase, with a worrying high prevalence of multidrug resistance. ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, and aminoglycosides remain active against a. baumannii isolates in some studies from the kingdom, but recent data suggest increased resistance. carbapenems are now the treatment of choice for acinetobacter infections but their activity too is being eroded. among enterobacteriaceae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and enterobacter spp. are the most clinically relevant species. rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production by these species vary among studies but are generally high in saudi arabia, with many esbl-producing isolates multiresistant  to other agents, except carbapenems and nitrofurantoin. a similar pattern is seen for klebsiella, although with more resistance to quinolones, aminoglycosides, and to nitrofurantoin than in e. coli. enterobacter is commonly resistant to penicillins, monobactams, and cephalosporins but mostly susceptible to carbapenems. carbapenemases are beginning to emerge in enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == inhibition of rnd-type efflux pumps confers the ftsz-directed prodrug txy436 with activity against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacterial pathogens are often difficult to treat, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains further restricting clinical treatment options. as a result, there is an acute need for the development of new therapeutic agents active against gram-negative bacteria. the  bacterial protein ftsz has recently been demonstrated to be a viable antibacterial target for treating infections caused by the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus in mouse model systems. here, we investigate whether an ftsz-directed prodrug (txy436) that is effective against s. aureus can also target gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli. we find that the conversion product of txy436 (pc190723) can bind e. coli ftsz and inhibit its polymerization/bundling in vitro. however, pc190723 is intrinsically inactive against wild-type e. coli, with this inactivity being derived from the actions of the efflux pump acrab. mutations in e. coli acrab render the mutant bacteria susceptible to txy436. we further show that chemical inhibition of acrab in e. coli, as well as its homologs in klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii, confers all three gram-negative pathogens with susceptibility to txy436. we demonstrate that the activity of txy436 against e. coli and k. pneumoniae is bactericidal in nature. evidence for ftsz-targeting and inhibition  of cell division in gram-negative bacteria by txy436 is provided by the induction of a characteristic filamentous morphology when the efflux pump has been inhibited as well as by the lack of functional z-rings upon txy436 treatment.

TI  == an emerging public health problem: acquired carbapenemase-producing microorganisms are present in food-producing animals, their environment, companion animals and wild birds.
AB  == worldwide, the emergence and global spread of microorganisms with acquired carbapenemases is of great concern. the reservoirs for such organisms are increasing, not only in hospitals, but also in the community and environment. a new and important development is the presence of such organisms in livestock, companion animals and wildlife. during the last three years, carbapenemase-producing escherichia coli, salmonella spp. (vim-1 producers) and acinetobacter spp. (producing oxa-23 and ndm-1) in livestock animals (poultry, cattle and swine) and their environment have been reported. in addition, the isolation of ndm-1-producing e. coli, oxa-48 in e. coli and klebsiella pneumoniae or oxa-23 in acinetobacter spp. from companion animals (cats, dogs or horses) has also been observed. other reports have described the presence of ndm-1-producing  salmonella isolated from wild birds, as well as oxa-23-like-producing acinetobacter baumannii in ectoparasites. however, until now carbapenemase producers from foods have not been detected. for humans in contrast carbapenem-producing salmonella isolates are increasingly reported. the real prevalence of carbapenemase-encoding genes in zoonotic bacteria or commensals from animals is unknown. consequently, there is a need for intensified surveillance on the occurrence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria in the food chain and other animal sources in order to assist in the formulation of measures  to prevent their potential spread.

TI  == an unusual class of anthracyclines potentiate gram-positive antibiotics in intrinsically resistant gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objectives: an orthogonal approach taken towards novel antibacterial drug discovery involves the identification of small molecules that potentiate or enhance the activity of existing antibacterial agents. this study aimed to identify natural-product rifampicin adjuvants in the intrinsically resistant organism escherichia coli. methods: e. coli bw25113 was screened against 1120 actinomycete fermentation extracts in the presence of subinhibitory (2 mg/l) concentrations of rifampicin. the active molecule exhibiting the greatest rifampicin potentiation was isolated using activity-guided methods and identified using mass and nmr spectroscopy. susceptibility testing and biochemical assays were used to determine the mechanism of antibiotic potentiation. results: the anthracycline antibiotic 301a(1) was isolated from the fermentation broth of a strain of streptomyces (wac450); the molecule was shown to be highly synergistic  with rifampicin (fractional inhibitory concentration index = 0.156) and moderately synergistic with linezolid (fic index = 0.25) in both e. coli and acinetobacter baumannii. activity was associated with inhibition of efflux and the synergistic phenotype was lost when tested against e. coli harbouring mutations within the rpob gene. structure-activity relationship studies revealed  that other anthracyclines do not synergize with rifampicin and removal of the sugar moiety of antibiotic 301a(1) abolishes activity. conclusions: screening only a subsection of our natural product library identified a small-molecule antibiotic adjuvant capable of sensitizing gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics  to which they are ordinarily intrinsically resistant. this result demonstrates the great potential of this approach in expanding antibiotic effectiveness in the face of the growing challenge of resistance in gram-negatives.

TI  == activation of phenotypic subpopulations in response to ciprofloxacin treatment in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the multidrug-resistant, opportunistic pathogen, acinetobacter baumannii, has spread swiftly through hospitals worldwide. previously, we demonstrated that a. baumannii regulates the expression of various genes in response to dna damage. some of these regulated genes, especially those encoding the multiple error-prone dna polymerases, can be implicated in induced mutagenesis, leading to antibiotic  resistance. here, we further explore the dna damage-inducible system at the single cell level using chromosomal transcriptional reporters for selected dna damage response genes. we found the genes examined respond in a bimodal fashion to ciprofloxacin treatment, forming two phenotypic subpopulations: induced and uninduced. this bimodal response to ciprofloxacin treatment in a. baumannii is unique and quite different than the escherichia coli paradigm. the subpopulations are not genetically different, with each subpopulation returning to a starting state and differentiating with repeated treatment. we then identified a palindromic motif upstream of certain dna damage response genes, and have shown alterations to this sequence to diminish the bimodal induction in response to dna damaging treatment. lastly, we are able to show a biological advantage for a bimodal response, finding that one subpopulation survives ciprofloxacin treatment better than the other.

AB  == we describe here the characteristics of alberta, canada, patients with infections or colonizations with carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria during 2010  to 2013 that were linked to recent travel outside canada. antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution, and isolates were characterized using pcr, sequencing, and multilocus sequencing typing. a broth mating study was used to assess the transferability of resistance plasmids, which were subsequently characterized. all the patients (n=12) included in our study had contact with a health care system while abroad. most of the patients presented with urinary tract infections (utis) and were admitted to hospitals within weeks after their return to alberta. secondary spread occurred in 1 case,  resulting in the death of another patient. the carbapenemase-producing bacteria (n=17) consisted of escherichia coli (sequence type 101 [st101], st365, st405, and st410) with ndm-1, klebsiella pneumoniae (st15, st16, st147, st258, st340, st512, and st972) with ndm-1, oxa-181, kpc-2, and kpc-3, acinetobacter baumannii  with oxa-23, providencia rettgeri with ndm-1, enterobacter cloacae with kpc-2, and citrobacter freundii with ndm-1. the blandm-1 gene was associated with various narrow- (i.e., incf) and broad- (i.e., inca/c and incl/m) host-range plasmids with different addiction factors. our results show that ndm-producing k. pneumoniae, belonging to a variety of sequence types with different plasmid scaffolds, are regularly imported from india into alberta. clinical microbiology  laboratories should remain vigilant in detecting bacteria with carbapenemases.

TI  == carnitine metabolism to trimethylamine by an unusual rieske-type oxygenase from human microbiota.
AB  == dietary intake of l-carnitine can promote cardiovascular diseases in humans through microbial production of trimethylamine (tma) and its subsequent oxidation to trimethylamine n-oxide by hepatic flavin-containing monooxygenases. although our microbiota are responsible for tma formation from carnitine, the underpinning molecular and biochemical mechanisms remain unclear. in this study, using bioinformatics approaches, we first identified a two-component rieske-type oxygenase/reductase (cntab) and associated gene cluster proposed to be involved in carnitine metabolism in representative genomes of the human microbiota. cnta belongs to a group of previously uncharacterized rieske-type proteins and has an  unusual "bridging" glutamate but not the aspartate residue, which is believed to  facilitate intersubunit electron transfer between the rieske center and the catalytic mononuclear iron center. using acinetobacter baumannii as the model, we then demonstrate that cntab is essential in carnitine degradation to tma. heterologous overexpression of cntab enables escherichia coli to produce tma, confirming that these genes are sufficient in tma formation. site-directed mutagenesis experiments have confirmed that this unusual "bridging glutamate" residue in cnta is essential in catalysis and neither mutant (e205d, e205a) is able to produce tma. taken together, the data in our study reveal the molecular and biochemical mechanisms underpinning carnitine metabolism to tma in human microbiota and assign the role of this novel group of rieske-type proteins in microbial carnitine metabolism.

AB  == raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. according to the usda, more than 58% of calves in the united states are fed unpasteurized milk. the aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of uv light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum igg. a pilot-scale uv light continuous (uvc) flow-through unit (45 j/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with listeria innocua, mycobacterium smegmatis, salmonella serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus agalactiae, and acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with uvc. during uvc treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. the effect of uvc on igg was  evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. for each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and igg was measured using elisa. the uvc treatment of milk resulted  in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction of listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/ml reduction), and a. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/ml) reduction for m. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment  of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/ml) of listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), but not of e. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/ml reduction), strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction), and staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/ml reduction). the uvc treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the igg concentration, with an observed final mean igg reduction of approximately 50%. development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to igg  caused by manipulating colostrum.

TI  == contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  == objective: this prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. methods: all beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (icus), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. the outer  surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. results: for general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%,  respectively (p<0.001). except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all icus than in corresponding wards. coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), streptococcus viridans (9.4%), escherichia coli (11.2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. conclusions: noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. the plastic cover of  the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. additionally, chart contamination is more common in icus. these findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. however, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.

TI  == in vitro activity and in vivo animal model efficacy of ib-367 alone and in combination with imipenem and colistin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the aim of our study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of ib-367 and its bactericidal effect for pseudomonas aeruginosa and escherichia coli, associated to a synergic study to test the antibiotic combinations between the peptide and colistin or imipenem. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics), the minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs), the synergy test and killing study were carried out to evaluate the ib-367 activity. in the in vivo model, a wound was incised through the panniculus carnosus of balb/c mice, and then inoculated with  5 x 107 colony-forming units of p. aeruginosa and e. coli. for each strain, the study included an infected or not infected group that did not receive any treatment, and five contaminated groups treated with local ib- 367, intraperitoneal imipenem, intraperitoneal colistin, topical ib-367 local plus intraperitoneal imipenem or intraperitoneal colistin. all isolates were inhibited by ib-367 at concentrations of 4-64 mg/l. killing by ib-367 was shown to be very  rapid: its activity on all gram-negative bacteria was completed within a 40 min exposure period at a concentration of 2 x mic/l. synergy was demonstrated when ib-367 was combined with colistin or imipenem. in in vivo studies, the groups treated with topical ib-367 and intraperitoneal colistin showed the best results  in terms of bacterial load inhibition either for pseudomonas or for e. coli. the  good in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy, as well as, the synergic interactions with antibiotics suggest that ib-367 is a promising candidate for potential application in the treatment of wound gram-negative infections.

TI  == in vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == objectives: to screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). methods: bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity  tests by the kirby-bauer's disc diffusion method. the antibacterial potentiality  of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains of nine uropathogens. results: two gram-positive isolates, e. faecalis and s. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. gram-negative isolates a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. methanolic leaf extracts of anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against s. aureus and 28 mm against e. faecalis and p. aeruginosa. cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for e. faecalis, e. aerogenes, and p. aeruginosa. based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: c. tora >  a. acuminata > schleichera oleosa > pterocarpus santalinus > eugenia jambolana >  bridelia retusa > mimusops elengi > stereospermum kunthianum > tectona grandis >  anthocephalus cadamba. the following eight plants had moderate control capacity:  artocarpus heterophyllus, azadirachta indica, dalbergia latifolia, eucalyptus citriodora, gmelina arborea, pongamia pinnata, pterocarpus marsupium, and shorea  robusta. e. coli, followed by a. baumannii, c. freundii, e. aerogenes, p. mirabilis, and p. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. conclusions: a majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against mdr uropathogenic bacteria.

TI  == photodynamic inactivation of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospital wastewaters: influence of residual antibiotics.
AB  == one environmental concern related to hospital effluents is discharge of them without preliminary treatment. antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (pdi) may  represent an alternative to the traditional expensive, unsafe and not always effective disinfection methods. the main goal of this work was to assess the efficiency of pdi on clinical multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria in hospital wastewaters in order to evaluate its potential use in treating hospital effluents. the efficiency of pdi was assessed using a cationic porphyrin as the photosensitizer (ps), four mdr bacteria either in phosphate buffered saline or in filtrated hospital wastewaters. the synergistic effect of pdi and antibiotics (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) was also evaluated, as well as the effect of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (sds). the results show the efficient inactivation of mdr bacteria in pbs (reduction of 6-8 log after 270 min of irradiation at 40 w m(-2) with 5.0 mum of ps). in wastewater, the inactivation of the four mdr bacteria was again efficient and the decrease in bacterial survival  starts even sooner. a faster decrease in bacterial survival occurred when pdi was combined with the addition of antibiotics, at sub-inhibitory and inhibitory concentrations, but the sds did not affect the pdi efficiency. it can be concluded that pdi has potential to be an effective alternative for the inactivation of mdr bacteria in hospital wastewaters and that the presence of antibiotics may enhance its effectiveness.

TI  == virulence properties of multidrug resistant ocular isolates of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == purpose: acinetobacter (a.) baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen and has been reported as a causative agent of ocular infections. the aim of this study is to identify virulence properties (biofilm formation, adhesion, invasion and cytotoxicity) and antibiotic resistance among a. baumannii isolates recovered from the eye. materials and methods: the microscan walk-away(r), an automated bacterial identification and susceptibility testing system was used to determine  antibiotic resistance. clonal relatedness was assessed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and plasmid profile analysis. conjugation experiments were carried out to determine the transfer of antibiotic resistance genes and pcr was  used to confirm gene transfer. virulence properties of the isolates were determined by biofilm formation using crystal violet and immunofluorescence staining, adherence and internalization using cultured corneal epithelial cells,  and cytotoxicity by tunel-staining and ldh release assays. results: all ocular isolates (n = 12) exhibited multidrug resistant (mdr) phenotype and one of the isolate (ab12) was resistant to 18 antibiotics (beta-lactam, aminoglycosides, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and quinolones). the plasmid profile analysis showed the presence of multiple plasmids in each isolate and a total of 10 different profiles were observed. however, pfge analysis was more discriminatory  which revealed 12 distinct genotypes. antibiotic resistance (tetracycline and quinolone) was transferable from the isolate ab12 to a recipient escherichia coli j53. ten isolates were strong biofilm producers and the remaining two (ab5 and ab7) were moderate producers. all isolates demonstrated adherence and invasive properties towards hcecs. a similar trend was observed in their ability to cause  cell death and toxicity. conclusions: our results indicate that ocular isolates of a. baumannii are biofilm producers and adherent and invasive to corneal epithelium, a first step in the pathogenesis of ocular infection. in addition, they demonstrated plasmid-mediated transfer of mdr traits making them a reservoir of resistance genes at ocular surface.

TI  == identification and methionine analog tolerance of environmental bacterial isolates selected on methionine analog containing medium.
AB  == methionine is the first limiting amino acid in poultry feed. currently, methionine supplement is synthesized from an expensive chemical process requiring hazardous chemicals. therefore, the objectives of this study were isolation of methionine producing bacteria from environmental samples and quantification of methionine production in these isolated bacteria. mcgc medium was selected as the isolation medium for methionine-producing bacteria by using corynebacterium glutamicum atcc13032 and escherichia coli atcc23798 as the positive and negative  controls, respectively. thirty-nine bacterial strains were obtained from environmental samples. only strains a121, a122, a151 and a181 were able to tolerate up to 0.1% (w/v) of ethionine or norleucine. these isolated strains were identified by sequencing small subunit rrna genes. the results revealed that bacterial strains a121, a122, a151and a181 were klebsiella species, acinetobacter baumannii, a. baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively. when methionine production in strains a121 and a181 was quantitated, strains a121 and a181 generated methionine up to 31.1 and 124.6 mug/ml, respectively.

TI  == [one-year surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in major bacteria except for mrsa isolated in eight medical facilities in kumamoto prefecture].
AB  == to investigate the current status of drug-resistant bacteria (except mrsa) in kumamoto prefecture, a study was conducted to determine the isolation numbers and ratios of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-escherichia coli, esbl-klebsiella species, esbl-proteus mirabilis, two-drug resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, (resistant to two drugs either carbapenems, quinolones and aminoglycosides) multi-drug-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa, multi-drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, and vancomyacin-resistant enterococcii in eight general hospitals from may in 2009 to april in 2010. esbl-e. coli was mostly isolated, and two-drug resistant p. aeruginosa came second. the isolation ratio of overall drug-resistant bacteria did not increase,  while the isolation ratio of two-drugs resistant p. aeruginosa declined, suggesting that infection control was successfully conducted in these hospitals.  however, the isolation numbers of esbl-klebsiella spp. and two-drug resistant p.  aeruginosa were variable in each hospital. furthermore, drug-resistant bacteria were occasionally spread into another medical facilities by patients transferred  from these hospitals, indicating that sharing information on drug-resistant bacteria between medical facilities is required.

TI  == class d beta-lactamases: are they all carbapenemases?
AB  == carbapenem-hydrolyzing class d beta-lactamases (chdls) are enzymes of the utmost  clinical importance due to their ability to produce resistance to carbapenems, the antibiotics of last resort for the treatment of various life-threatening infections. the vast majority of these enzymes have been identified in acinetobacter spp., notably in acinetobacter baumannii. the oxa-2 and oxa-10 enzymes predominantly occur in pseudomonas aeruginosa and are currently classified as narrow-spectrum class d beta-lactamases. here we demonstrate that when oxa-2 and oxa-10 are expressed in escherichia coli strain jm83, they produce a narrow-spectrum antibiotic resistance pattern. when the enzymes are expressed in a. baumannii atcc 17978, however, they behave as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and confer resistance to carbapenem antibiotics. kinetic studies  of oxa-2 and oxa-10 with four carbapenems have demonstrated that their catalytic  efficiencies with these antibiotics are in the same range as those of some recognized class d carbapenemases. these results are in disagreement with the classification of the oxa-2 and oxa-10 enzymes as narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, and they suggest that other class d enzymes that are currently regarded as noncarbapenemases may in fact be chdls.

TI  == effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  == in this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (ppis) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. clinical non-duplicate isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis and three species of enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumonia and enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their mics of tigecycline alone and in combination with ppis (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. with one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of ppis on tigecycline activity. the mic changes after ppis addition correlated with the  ppis concentrations in the test media. compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/l ppis could increase the mics of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. the time-kill study confirmed that the addition of ppis could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. even at low concentration (5 mg/l) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in e. cloacae  and e. faecalis strains. we conclude that in vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of ppis in a concentration-dependent manner.

TI  == the different inhibition mechanisms of oxa-1 and oxa-24 beta-lactamases are determined by the stability of active site carboxylated lysine.
AB  == the catalytic efficiency of class d beta-lactamases depends critically on an unusual carboxylated lysine as the general base residue for both the acylation and deacylation steps of the enzyme. microbiological and biochemical studies on the class d beta-lactamases oxa-1 and oxa-24 showed that the two enzymes behave differently when reacting with two 6-methylidene penems (penem 1 and penem 3): the penems are good inhibitors of oxa-1 but act more like substrates for oxa-24.  uv difference and raman spectroscopy revealed that the respective reaction mechanisms are different. the penems form an unusual intermediate, a 1,4-thiazepine derivative in oxa-1, and undergo deacylation followed by the decarboxylation of lys-70, rendering oxa-1 inactive. this inactivation could not  be reversed by the addition of 100 mm nahco3. in oxa-24, under mild conditions (enzyme:inhibitor = 1:4), only hydrolyzed products were detected, and the enzyme  remained active. however, under harsh conditions (enzyme:inhibitor = 1:2000), oxa-24 was inhibited via decarboxylation of lys-84; however, the enzyme could be  reactivated by the addition of 100 mm nahco3. we conclude that oxa-24 not only decarboxylates with difficulty but also recarboxylates with ease; in contrast, oxa-1 decarboxylates easily but recarboxylates with difficulty. structural analysis of the active site indicates that a crystallographic water molecule may  play an important role in carboxylation in oxa-24 (an analogous water molecule is not found in oxa-1), supporting the suggestion that a water molecule in the active site of oxa-24 can lower the energy barrier for carboxylation significantly.

TI  == cold air plasma to decontaminate inanimate surfaces of the hospital environment.
AB  == the hospital environment harbors bacteria that may cause health care-associated infections. microorganisms, such as multiresistant bacteria, can spread around the patient's inanimate environment. some recently introduced biodecontamination  approaches in hospitals have significant limitations due to the toxic nature of the gases and the length of time required for aeration. this study evaluated the  in vitro use of cold air plasma as an efficient alternative to traditional methods of biodecontamination of hospital surfaces. cultures of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia  coli, and acinetobacter baumannii were applied to different materials similar to  those found in the hospital environment. artificially contaminated sections of marmoleum, mattress, polypropylene, powder-coated mild steel, and stainless steel were then exposed to a cold air pressure plasma single jet for 30 s, 60 s, and 90 s, operating at approximately 25 w and 12 liters/min flow rate. direct plasma exposure successfully reduced the bacterial load by log 3 for mrsa, log 2.7 for vre, log 2 for esbl-producing e. coli, and log 1.7 for a. baumannii. the present  report confirms the efficient antibacterial activity of a cold air plasma single-jet plume on nosocomial bacterially contaminated surfaces over a short period of time and highlights its potential for routine biodecontamination in the clinical environment.

TI  == antibactr: dynamic antibacterial-drug-target ranking integrating comparative genomics, structural analysis and experimental annotation.
AB  == background: development of novel antibacterial drugs is both an urgent healthcare necessity and a partially neglected field. the last decades have seen a substantial decrease in the discovery of novel antibiotics, which combined with the recent thrive of multi-drug-resistant pathogens have generated a scenario of  general concern. the procedures involved in the discovery and development of novel antibiotics are economically challenging, time consuming and lack any warranty of success. furthermore, the return-on-investment for an antibacterial drug is usually marginal when compared to other therapeutics, which in part explains the decrease of private investment. results: in this work we present antibactr, a computational pipeline designed to aid researchers in the selection  of potential drug targets, one of the initial steps in antibacterial-drug discovery. the approach was designed and implemented as part of two publicly funded initiatives aimed at discovering novel antibacterial targets, mechanisms and drugs for a priority list of gram-negative pathogens: acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, helicobacter pylori, pseudomonas aeruginosa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. however, at present this list has been extended to  cover a total of 74 fully sequenced gram-negative pathogens. antibactr is based on sequence comparisons and queries to multiple databases (e.g. gene essentiality, virulence factors) to rank proteins according to their potential as antibacterial targets. the dynamic ranking of potential drug targets can easily be executed, customized and accessed by the user through a web interface which also integrates computational analyses performed in-house and visualizable on-site. these include three-dimensional modeling of protein structures and prediction of active sites among other functionally relevant ligand-binding sites. conclusions: given its versatility and ease-of-use at integrating both experimental annotation and computational analyses, antibactr may effectively assist microbiologists, medicinal-chemists and other researchers working in the field of antibacterial drug-discovery. the public web-interface for antibactr is  available at 'http://bioinf.uab.cat/antibactr'.

TI  == host-defense peptides with therapeutic potential from skin secretions of frogs from the family pipidae.
AB  == skin secretions from frogs belonging to the genera xenopus, silurana, hymenochirus, and pseudhymenochirus in the family pipidae are a rich source of host-defense peptides with varying degrees of antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicities to mammalian cells. magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (pgla), caerulein-precursor fragment (cpf), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (xpf) peptides have been isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from several species of xenopus and silurana. hymenochirins and pseudhymenochirins have been isolated from hymenochirus boettgeri and pseudhymenochirus merlini. a major obstacle to the development of these peptides as anti-infective agents is their hemolytic activities against human erythrocytes. analogs of the magainins,  cpf peptides and hymenochirin-1b with increased antimicrobial potencies and low cytotoxicities have been developed that are active (mic < 5 mum) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and klebsiella pneumoniae.  despite this, the therapeutic potential of frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents has not been realized so that alternative clinical applications as anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, or immunomodulatory drugs are being explored.

TI  == heterogeneous persister cells formation in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == bacterial persistence is a feature that allows susceptible bacteria to survive extreme concentrations of antibiotics and it has been verified in a number of species, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus spp., mycobacterium spp. however, even though acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen, data regarding its persistence phenotype are still lacking.  therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the persistence phenotype in a.  baumannii strains, as well as its variation among strains after treatment with polymyxin b and tobramycin. stationary cultures of 37 polymyxin b-susceptible clinical strains of a. baumannii were analyzed for surviving cells after exposure to 15 microg/ml of polymyxin b for 6 h, by serial dilutions and colony counting.  among these, the 30 tobramycin-susceptible isolates also underwent tobramycin treatment at a concentration of 160 microg/ml and persister cells occurrence was  evaluated equally. a high heterogeneity of persister cells formation patterns among isolates was observed. polymyxin b-treated cultures presented persister cells corresponding from 0.0007% to 10.1% of the initial population and two isolates failed to produce detectable persister cells under this condition. a high variability could also be observed when cells were treated with tobramycin:  the persister fraction corresponded to 0.0003%-11.84% of the pre-treatment population. moreover, no correlation was found between persister subpopulations comparing both antibiotics among isolates, indicating that different mechanisms underlie the internal control of this phenotype. this is the first report of persister cells occurrence in a. baumannii. our data suggest that distinct factors regulate the tolerance for unrelated antibiotics in this species, contrasting the multi-drug tolerance observed in other species (eg. dormancy-mediated tolerance). supporting this observation, polymyxin b--an antibiotic that is believed to act on non-dividing cells as well--failed to eradicate persister cells in the majority of the isolates, possibly reflecting a  disconnection between persistence and dormancy.

AB  == blood safety is a global health goal. in developed countries, bacterial contamination of platelet concentrates is the highest infectious risk in transfusion despite the current preventive strategies. we aimed to develop a conductometric biosensor for the generic, rapid and sensitive detection of gram-negative bacteria. our strategy is based on immunosensors: addressable magnetic nanoparticles coupled with anti-lps antibodies were used for the generic capture of gram-negative bacteria. bacterial capture was characterized by impedancemetric and microscopic measurements. the results obtained with conductometric measurements allowed real-time, sensitive detection of escherichia coli or serratia marcescens cultures from 1 to 10(3) cfu ml(-1). the ability of the immunosensor to detect gram negative bacteria was also tested on clinically relevant strains. the conductometric immunosensor allowed the direct detection of 10-10(3) cfu ml(-1) of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii strains that were undetectable using standard immunoblot methods. results showed that the conductometric response was not inhibited in 1% serum.

TI  == transcriptomic and biochemical analyses identify a family of chlorhexidine efflux proteins.
AB  == chlorhexidine is widely used as an antiseptic or disinfectant in both hospital and community settings. a number of bacterial species display resistance to this  membrane-active biocide. we examined the transcriptomic response of a representative nosocomial human pathogen, acinetobacter baumannii, to chlorhexidine to identify the primary chlorhexidine resistance elements. the most highly up-regulated genes encoded components of a major multidrug efflux system,  adeab. the next most highly overexpressed gene under chlorhexidine stress was annotated as encoding a hypothetical protein, named here as acei. orthologs of the acei gene are conserved within the genomes of a broad range of proteobacterial species. expression of acei or its orthologs from several other gamma- or beta-proteobacterial species in escherichia coli resulted in significant increases in resistance to chlorhexidine. additionally, disruption of the acei ortholog in acinetobacter baylyi rendered it more susceptible to chlorhexidine. the acei protein was localized to the membrane after overexpression in e. coli. this protein was purified, and binding assays demonstrated direct and specific interactions between acei and chlorhexidine. transport assays using [(14)c]-chlorhexidine determined that acei was able to mediate the energy-dependent efflux of chlorhexidine. an e15q acei mutant with a  mutation in a conserved acidic residue, although unable to mediate chlorhexidine  resistance and transport, was still able to bind chlorhexidine. taken together, these data are consistent with acei being an active chlorhexidine efflux protein  and the founding member of a family of bacterial drug efflux transporters.

AB  == whole-genome sequencing of a collection of 103 acinetobacter strains belonging to 22 validly named species and another 16 putative species allowed detection of genes for 50 new class d beta-lactamases and 65 new acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases (adc). all oxacillinases (oxa) contained the three typical motifs of class d beta-lactamases, stfk, (f/y)gn, and k(s/t)g. the phylogenetic tree drawn from the oxa sequences led to an increase in the number of oxa groups  from 7 to 18. the topologies of the oxa and rpob phylogenetic trees were similar, supporting the ancient acquisition of blaoxa genes by acinetobacter species. the  class d beta-lactamase genes appeared to be intrinsic to several species, such as acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter pittii, acinetobacter calcoaceticus, and acinetobacter lwoffii. neither blaoxa-40/143- nor blaoxa-58-like genes were detected, and their origin remains therefore unknown. the phylogenetic tree analysis based on the alignment of the sequences deduced from blaadc revealed five main clusters, one containing adc belonging to species closely related to a. baumannii and the others composed of cephalosporinases from the remaining species. no indication of blaoxa or blaadc transfer was observed between distantly related species, except for blaoxa-279, possibly transferred from acinetobacter genomic species 6 to acinetobacter parvus. analysis of beta-lactam  susceptibility of seven strains harboring new oxacillinases and cloning of the corresponding genes in escherichia coli and in a susceptible a. baumannii strain  indicated very weak hydrolysis of carbapenems. overall, this study reveals a large pool of beta-lactamases in different acinetobacter spp., potentially transferable to pathogenic strains of the genus.

TI  == membrane interactions and biological activity of antimicrobial peptides from australian scorpion.
AB  == uyct peptides are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the venom of the australian scorpion. the activity of the uyct peptides against gram positive and  gram negative bacteria and red blood cells was determined. the membrane interactions of these peptides were evaluated by dye release (dr) of the fluorophore calcein from liposomes and isothermal titration calorimetry (itc); and their secondary structure was determined by circular dichroism (cd). three different lipid systems were used to mimic red blood cells, escherichia coli and  staphylococcus aureus membranes. uyct peptides exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with low mic for s. aureus and multi-drug resistant gram negative strains. peptide combinations showed some synergy enhancing their potency but not hemolytic activity. the uyct peptides adopted a helical structure in lipid environments and dr results confirmed that the mechanism of action is by disrupting the membrane. itc data indicated that uyct peptides preferred prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic membranes. the overall results suggest that uyct peptides could be pharmaceutical leads for the treatment of gram negative multiresistant bacterial infections, especially against acinetobacter baumanni, and candidates for peptidomimetics to enhance their potency and minimize hemolysis. this article is part of a special issue entitled: interfacially active peptides and proteins. guest editors: william c. wimley and kalina hristova.

TI  == antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  == topical delivery of nitric oxide (no) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. this  study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing no-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite a that releases no upon contact with water. the release rate of no from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using  five common wound pathogens, including gram-negative bacteria (escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii), gram-positive bacteria (staphylococcus epidermidis  and meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (candida albicans).  the time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. the cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3t3 fibroblast cells. minimum microbicidal concentrations (mmcs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the  mmc for c. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to no-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same  concentration of no-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. in parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. these data indicate that ointment containing no-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.

TI  == case-control analysis of endemic acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia in the neonatal intensive care unit.
AB  == background: we aimed to characterize the clinical manifestations and outcomes of  patients with acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu). methods: all patients with a baumannii bacteremia in our nicu from 2004 to 2010 were reviewed. a matched case-control study was performed by comparing each case of a baumannii to 2 uninfected controls and all cases of escherichia coli and klebsiella bacteremia, respectively. results: thirty-seven cases with a baumannii bacteremia were identified. multidrug-resistant isolate was noted in only 2 cases (5.4%), and the overall mortality rate was 8.1%. compared with matched, uninfected controls, infants with a baumannii were more likely to have had a central vascular catheter (cvc) (p = .009), use of total parenteral nutrition (tpn) (p = .021), longer duration of ventilator use (p = .002), and hospitalization (p = .010). compared with e coli or klebsiella bacteremia, infants with a baumannii bacteremia had lower birth weight (median of 1,090 g vs 1,300 g, p = .044) and a higher rate of cvc and tpn use (both p < .001) at the time of infection. conclusion: a baumannii bacteremia occurs endemically or sporadically in the nicu, primarily in low-birth-weight infants on tpn use and with cvc in situ. although a baumannii does not often cause mortality, and multidrug-resistant a baumannii is uncommon, it contributes significantly to longer hospitalization.

TI  == an analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1b with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  == hymenochirin-1b (iklspetkdn(10)lkkvlkgaik(20)gaiavakmv.nh2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the congo clawed frog hymenochirus boettgeri (pipidae). structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the pro(5), glu(6) and asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency  against a range of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1b while  reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less  hemolytic. [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and a range of gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic in the range 0.8-3.1 mum) and ndm-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and citrobacter freundii (mic in the range 3.1-6.25 mum), and low hemolytic activity (lc50=302 mum). [e6k,d9k]hymenochirin-1b, at a concentration of 2.5 mum, significantly (p<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines il-4 and il-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear  cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-alpha and il-17.

TI  == a secondary mode of action of polymyxins against gram-negative bacteria involves  the inhibition of nadh-quinone oxidoreductase activity.
AB  == polymyxin b and colistin were examined for their ability to inhibit the type ii nadh-quinone oxidoreductases (ndh-2) of three species of gram-negative bacteria.  polymyxin b and colistin inhibited the ndh-2 activity in preparations from all of the isolates in a concentration-dependent manner. the mechanism of ndh-2 inhibition by polymyxin b was investigated in detail with escherichia coli inner  membrane preparations and conformed to a mixed inhibition model with respect to ubiquinone-1 and a non-competitive inhibition model with respect to nadh. these suggest that the inhibition of vital respiratory enzymes in the bacterial inner membrane represents one of the secondary modes of action for polymyxins.

TI  == prevention of biofilm colonization by gram-negative bacteria on minocycline-rifampin-impregnated catheters sequentially coated with chlorhexidine.
AB  == resistant gram-negative bacteria are increasing central-line-associated bloodstream infection threats. to better combat this, chlorhexidine (chx) was added to minocycline-rifampin (m/r) catheters. the in vitro antimicrobial activity of chx-m/r catheters against multidrug resistant, gram-negative acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia was tested.  m/r and chx-silver sulfadiazine (chx/ss) catheters were used as comparators. the  novel chx-m/r catheters were significantly more effective (p < 0.0001) than chx/ss or m/r catheters in preventing biofilm colonization and showed better antimicrobial durability.

TI  == on the essentiality of lipopolysaccharide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == lipopolysaccharide is a highly acylated saccharolipid located on the outer leaflet of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria. lipopolysaccharide is critical to maintaining the barrier function preventing the passive diffusion of  hydrophobic solutes such as antibiotics and detergents into the cell. lipopolysaccharide has been considered an essential component for outer membrane  biogenesis and cell viability based on pioneering studies in the model gram-negative organisms escherichia coli and salmonella. with the isolation of lipopolysaccharide-null mutants in neisseria meningitidis, moraxella catarrhalis, and most recently in acinetobacter baumannii, it has become increasingly apparent that lipopolysaccharide is not an essential outer membrane building block in all  organisms. we suggest the accumulation of toxic intermediates, misassembly of essential outer membrane porins, and outer membrane stress response pathways that are activated by mislocalized lipopolysaccharide may collectively contribute to the observed strain-dependent essentiality of lipopolysaccharide.

TI  == short antibacterial peptides with significantly reduced hemolytic activity can be identified by a systematic l-to-d exchange scan of their amino acid residues.
AB  == high systemic toxicity of antimicrobial peptides (amps) limits their clinical application to the treatment of topical infections; in parenteral systemic application of amps the problem of hemolysis is one of the first to be tackled. we now show that the selectivity of lipidated short synthetic amps can be optimized substantially by reducing their hemolytic activity without affecting their activity against methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa). in order to identify the optimized peptides, two sets of 32 diastereomeric h-(d)arg-wrwrw-(l)lys(c(o)cnh2n+1)-nh2 (n = 7 or 9) peptides were prepared using  a split-split procedure to perform a systematic l-to-d exchange scan on the central wrwrw-fragment. compared to the all-l c8-lipidated lead sequence, diastereomeric peptides had very similar antibacterial properties, but were over  30 times less hemolytic. we show that the observed hemolysis and antibacterial activity is affected by both differences in lipophilicity of the different peptides and specific combinations of l- and d-amino acid residues. this study identified several peptides that can be used as tools to precisely unravel the origin of hemolysis and thus help to design even further optimized nontoxic very  active short antibacterial peptides.

TI  == identification of small molecules inhibiting diguanylate cyclases to control bacterial biofilm development.
AB  == biofilm formation by pathogenic bacteria is an important virulence factor in the  development of numerous chronic infections, thereby causing a severe health burden. many of these infections cannot be resolved, as bacteria in biofilms are  resistant to the host's immune defenses and antibiotic therapy. an urgent need for new strategies to treat biofilm-based infections is critically needed. cyclic di-gmp (c-di-gmp) is a widely conserved second-messenger signal essential for biofilm formation. the absence of this signalling system in higher eukaryotes makes it an attractive target for the development of new anti-biofilm agents. in  this study, the results of an in silico pharmacophore-based screen to identify small-molecule inhibitors of diguanylate cyclase (dgc) enzymes that synthesize c-di-gmp are described. four small molecules, lp 3134, lp 3145, lp 4010 and lp 1062 that antagonize these enzymes and inhibit biofilm formation by pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii in a continuous-flow system are reported.  all four molecules dispersed p. aeruginosa biofilms and inhibited biofilm development on urinary catheters. one molecule dispersed a. baumannii biofilms. two molecules displayed no toxic effects on eukaryotic cells. these molecules represent the first compounds identified from an in silico screen that are able to inhibit dgc activity to prevent biofilm formation.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured cu-sio2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  == there is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (hcai). one method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial  materials. the antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in hcai. the structure of the coatings was determined using scanning electron microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on bs iso 22196:2007. the coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. sem showed nano-structured aggregates of cu within a silica matrix. a log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. the results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. the coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential  applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.

TI  == annual point-prevalence of healthcare-associated infection surveys in a university hospital in china, 2007-2011.
AB  == successive point-prevalence surveys were conducted annually from 2007 to 2011 to  monitor the prevalence of healthcare-associated infections (hais) in a university hospital in hubei province in china. the surveys used the case definition criteria established by the ministry of health of the people's republic of china. in the 5 surveys, the overall frequency of hais was 3.16% (301/9533). no significant differences were identified in the point prevalence measurements of hais in any of the years from 2007 to 2011. of all the cases, proportionally, the most frequent infection site was the respiratory tract (2.34%), followed by surgical sites (0.43%) and urinary tract sites (0.28%). gram-negative aerobic bacilli were the most common organisms mentioned; the most frequently isolated organism was pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. approximately one-half of the patients were receiving antibiotics at the time of the surveys. cephalosporin, penicillin, and quinolone  were most commonly used for treatment or prevention. the differences found in hai prevalence data across the 5 surveys given in the hospital were not statistically significant. in conclusion, this successive point-prevalence survey provides information about the trend of hai prevalence, epidemical character, and the use  of antibiotics among the university hospital's in-patients. this information allows us to initiate targeted programs for infection prevention and control.

TI  == lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == rationale: bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. methods: lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. in this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-auncs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. after bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-auncs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-aunc-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. the red emission from the auncs on the conjugates could be  visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. the bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (maldi-ms) combined with principal component analysis (pca). results: we demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-auncs and distinguished by the results combining maldi-ms and pca. additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to  differentiate e. faecalis from vre was also demonstrated. the lowest detection concentration for e. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/ml. conclusions: the results indicated that the lysozyme-auncs are effective affinity probes for gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. by combining the results from maldi-ms and pca, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. the current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.

TI  == expression, crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis of alanine racemase from acinetobacter baumannii oxa-23.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii has received much attention owing to its exceptional ability to develop resistance to currently available antibiotics. alanine racemase (alr) catalyzes the racemization of l-alanine to d-alanine with pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (plp) as a cofactor. the d-alanine product is an essential component of the bacterial cell wall and alr is a potential target for the development of novel antibacterial drugs. the alr gene from a. baumannii was cloned and the protein (abalr) was expressed, purified and crystallized. the abalr crystal diffracted to 2.3 a resolution and belonged to the primitive orthorhombic space group p2(1)2(1)2(1), with unit-cell parameters a = 55.1, b = 85.0, c = 167.7 a. two protomers were present in the asymmetric unit, with a corresponding v(m) value of 2.3 a(3) da(-1) and a solvent content of 47.5%.

TI  == comparison of pathogens and antibiotic resistance of burn patients in the burn icu or in the common burn ward.
AB  == background: this study aims to compare pathogens and their antibiotic resistances of burn patients from burn intensive care unit (icu) or common burn ward. of 2395 clinical samples from 63 patients in burn icu, pathogens were detected in 1621 samples, in which 1203 strains (74.2%) were gram negative bacteria, 248 strains (15.3%) were gram positive bacteria, 170 strains (10.5%) were fungi. top-4 microorganisms isolated from patients in burn icu were bauman's acinetobacter (557, 34.4%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (287.17.7%), staphylococcus aureus (199, 12.3%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (171, 10.5%). of 512 clinical samples from 235 patients in common burn units, pathogens were detected in 373 samples, in which 189 (50.6%) strains were gram negative bacteria, 150 strains (40.2%) were gram positive bacteria, 34 strains (9.2%) were fungi. top-4 microorganisms isolated from patients in common burn units were s. aureus (103, 27.6%), p. aeruginosa (46, 12.3%), k. pneumoniae (38, 10.2%) and escherichia coli (32, 8.6%). antibiotic resistance rates of pathogens isolated from clinical samples of burn patients from icu was significantly higher than those from common units. conclusions: pathogens and their antibiotic resistances are significantly different between burn icu and common burn units. this finding has great implication for infection control in burn patients.

TI  == molecular analysis of the acinetobacter baumannii biofilm-associated protein.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a multidrug-resistant pathogen associated with hospital outbreaks of infection across the globe, particularly in the intensive care unit. the ability of a. baumannii to survive in the hospital environment for long periods is linked to antibiotic resistance and its capacity to form biofilms. here we studied the prevalence, expression, and function of the a. baumannii biofilm-associated protein (bap) in 24 carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii st92 strains isolated from a single institution over a 10-year period.  the bap gene was highly prevalent, with 22/24 strains being positive for bap by pcr. partial sequencing of bap was performed on the index case strain ms1968 and  revealed it to be a large and highly repetitive gene approximately 16 kb in size. phylogenetic analysis employing a 1,948-amino-acid region corresponding to the c  terminus of bap showed that bapms1968 clusters with bap sequences from clonal complex 2 (cc2) strains acicu, tcdc-ab0715, and 1656-2 and is distinct from bap in cc1 strains. by using overlapping pcr, the bapms1968 gene was cloned, and its  expression in a recombinant escherichia coli strain resulted in increased biofilm formation. a bap-specific antibody was generated, and western blot analysis showed that the majority of a. baumannii strains expressed an approximately 200-kda bap protein. further analysis of three bap-positive a. baumannii strains  demonstrated that bap is expressed at the cell surface and is associated with biofilm formation. finally, biofilm formation by these bap-positive strains could be inhibited by affinity-purified bap antibodies, demonstrating the direct contribution of bap to biofilm growth by a. baumannii clinical isolates.

TI  == toward repurposing ciclopirox as an antibiotic against drug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  == antibiotic-resistant infections caused by gram-negative bacteria are a major healthcare concern. repurposing drugs circumvents the time and money limitations  associated with developing new antimicrobial agents needed to combat these antibiotic-resistant infections. here we identified the off-patent antifungal agent, ciclopirox, as a candidate to repurpose for antibiotic use. to test the efficacy of ciclopirox against antibiotic-resistant pathogens, we used a curated  collection of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates that are representative of known antibiotic resistance phenotypes. we found that ciclopirox, at 5-15 microg/ml concentrations, inhibited bacterial growth regardless of the antibiotic resistance status. at these same concentrations, ciclopirox reduced growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates, but some of these pathogens required higher ciclopirox concentrations to completely block growth. to determine how ciclopirox inhibits bacterial growth, we performed an overexpression screen in e. coli. this screen revealed that gale, which encodes udp-glucose 4-epimerase, rescued bacterial growth at otherwise restrictive ciclopirox concentrations. we found that ciclopirox does not inhibit epimerization of udp-galactose by purified e. coli gale; however, deltagalu, deltagale, deltarfai, or deltarfab mutant strains all have lower ciclopirox minimum inhibitory concentrations than the parent strain. the galu, gale, rfai, and rfab genes all encode enzymes that use udp-galactose or udp-glucose for galactose metabolism and lipopolysaccharide (lps) biosynthesis. indeed, we found that ciclopirox altered lps composition of an e. coli clinical isolate. taken together, our data demonstrate that ciclopirox affects galactose metabolism and lps biosynthesis, two pathways important for bacterial growth and virulence. the lack of any reported fungal resistance to ciclopirox in over twenty years of use in the clinic, its excellent safety profiles, novel target(s), and efficacy, make ciclopirox a promising potential antimicrobial agent to use against multidrug-resistant problematic gram-negative  pathogens.

TI  == molecular characterization of multidrug resistant hospital isolates using the antimicrobial resistance determinant microarray.
AB  == molecular methods that enable the detection of antimicrobial resistance determinants are critical surveillance tools that are necessary to aid in curbing the spread of antibiotic resistance. in this study, we describe the use of the antimicrobial resistance determinant microarray (ardm) that targets 239 unique genes that confer resistance to 12 classes of antimicrobial compounds, quaternary amines and streptothricin for the determination of multidrug resistance (mdr) gene profiles. fourteen reference mdr strains, which either were genome, sequenced or possessed well characterized drug resistance profiles were used to optimize detection algorithms and threshold criteria to ensure the microarray's effectiveness for unbiased characterization of antimicrobial resistance determinants in mdr strains. the subsequent testing of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae hospital isolates revealed the presence of several antibiotic resistance genes [e.g. belonging to tem, shv, oxa  and ctx-m classes (and oxa and ctx-m subfamilies) of beta-lactamases] and their assemblages which were confirmed by pcr and dna sequence analysis. when combined  with results from the reference strains, ~25% of the ardm content was confirmed as effective for representing allelic content from both gram-positive and -negative species. taken together, the ardm identified mdr assemblages containing six to 18 unique resistance genes in each strain tested, demonstrating its utility as a powerful tool for molecular epidemiological investigations of antimicrobial resistance in clinically relevant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == chlorhexidine activity against bacterial biofilms.
AB  == background: a biofilm is a complex microbiological ecosystem deposited on surfaces. microorganisms in form of biofilms are of particular clinical concern because of the poor response to antimicrobial treatments. this study aimed to determine whether bacterial and fungal biofilms are able to resist the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine, a powerful antiseptic widely used in the hospital environment. methods: disk diffusion and susceptibility tests were conducted in accordance with clinical and laboratory standards institute standards for the determination of biofilm inhibitory concentration. chlorhexidine was tested first at a minimum inhibitory concentration and then at  higher concentrations when it was not able to destroy the biofilm. the plates were developed with a solution of 0.1% crystal violet, and readings were made at  an optical density of 570 nm. results: chlorhexidine demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity for most microorganisms tested in their free form, but was less effective against biofilms of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. conclusion: this study confirms that microorganisms in biofilms have greater resistance to chlorhexidine, likely owing to the mechanisms of resistance conferred to the structure of biofilms.

TI  == class d beta-lactamases: a reappraisal after five decades.
AB  == despite 70 years of clinical use, beta-lactam antibiotics still remain at the forefront of antimicrobial chemotherapy. the major challenge to these life-saving therapeutics is the presence of bacterial enzymes (i.e., beta-lactamases) that can hydrolyze the beta-lactam bond and inactivate the antibiotic. these enzymes can be grouped into four classes (a-d). among the most genetically diverse are the class d beta-lactamases. in this class are beta-lactamases that can inactivate the entire spectrum of beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems). class d beta-lactamases are mostly found in gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa , escherichia coli , proteus mirabilis , and acinetobacter baumannii . the active-sites of class d beta-lactamases contain an unusual n-carboxylated lysine post-translational modification. a strongly hydrophobic active-site helps create the conditions that allow the lysine to combine with co2, and the resulting carbamate is stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonds. the carboxy-lysine plays a symmetric role in the reaction, serving as a general base to activate the serine nucleophile in the acylation reaction, and the deacylating water in the second step. there are more  than 250 class d beta-lactamases described, and the full set of variants shows remarkable diversity with regard to substrate binding and turnover. narrow-spectrum variants are most effective against the earliest generation penicillins and cephalosporins such as ampicillin and cephalothin. extended-spectrum variants (also known as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, esbls) pose a more dangerous clinical threat as they possess a small number of substitutions that allow them to bind and hydrolyze later generation cephalosporins that contain bulkier side-chain constituents (e.g., cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and cefepime). mutations that permit this versatility seem to cluster in the area surrounding an active-site tryptophan resulting in a widened  active-site to accommodate the oxyimino side-chains of these cephalosporins. more concerning are the class d beta-lactamases that hydrolyze clinically important carbapenem beta-lactam drugs (e.g., imipenem). whereas carbapenems irreversibly acylate and inhibit narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases, class d carbapenemases are able to recruit and activate a deacylating water. the rotational orientation of the c6 hydroxyethyl group found on all carbapenem antibiotics likely plays a role in whether the deacylating water is effective or not. inhibition of class d beta-lactamases is a current challenge. commercially available inhibitors that are active against other classes of beta-lactamases are ineffective against class d enzymes. on the horizon are several compounds, consisting of both beta-lactam derivatives and non-beta-lactams, that have the potential of providing novel leads to design new mechanism-based inactivators that are effective against the class d enzymes. several act synergistically when given in combination with a beta-lactam antibiotic, and others show a unique mechanism of inhibition that is  distinct from the traditional beta-lactamase inhibitors. these studies will bolster structure-based inhibitor design efforts to facilitate the optimization and development of these compounds as class d inactivators.

TI  == detection of the common resistance genes in gram-negative bacteria using gene chip technology.
AB  == objective: to design a resistance gene detection chip that could, in parallel, detect common clinical drug resistance genes of gram-negative bacteria. materials and methods: seventy clinically significant gram-negative bacilli (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii) were collected. according to the known resistance gene sequences, we designed and synthesized primers and probes, which were used to prepare resistance gene detection chips, and finally we hybridized and scanned the gene detection chips. results: the results between the gene chip and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) were compared. the rate was consistently 100% in  the eight kinds of resistance genes tested (tem, shv, ctx-m, dha, cit, vim, kpc,  oxa-23). one strain of pseudomonas aeruginosa had the imp, but it was not found by gene chip. conclusion: the design of gram-negative bacteria-resistant gene detection chip had better application value.

TI  == in vitro activity of the novel monosulfactam bal30072 alone and in combination with meropenem versus a diverse collection of important gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == the problem of antimicrobial resistance is exemplified by multidrug-resistant (mdr) isolates of gram-negative species. of particular concern are expanded-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant isolates of enterobacteriaceae, epidemic lineages of acinetobacter baumannii producing oxa-type carbapenemases, and mdr pseudomonas aeruginosa. in this study, the in vitro activity of the novel monosulfactam bal30072 was investigated both alone and in combination with meropenem against a diverse collection of commonly encountered gram-negative pathogens. thirty-one isolates were studied, including type strains and clinical  isolates with defined mechanisms conferring resistance to various antimicrobial agents including to carbapenems, colistin and tigecycline. bal30072 minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined in the presence and absence of meropenem (1:1, w/w) by agar dilution. potential synergy or antagonism between bal30072 and meropenem was investigated using standard chequerboard assays. versus mdr a. baumannii strains producing class d oxacillinases, bal30072 mics were all </=4 mg/l with the exception of the isolate belonging to the uk 'burn' lineage. bal30072 exhibited mic values of 0.5 mg/l to >64 mg/l towards the five p. aeruginosa strains. against three meropenem-susceptible escherichia coli, including the ctx-m-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producer, bal30072 exhibited mics of 0.25-2 mg/l; higher mics were recorded against some of the enterobacteriaceae isolates tested. the in vitro data suggest that bal30072 has a potential role in the treatment of infections due to gram-negative pathogens, including those with important resistances to other agents. in addition, bal30072 shows powerful synergistic activity in combination with meropenem, potentially expanding its coverage for the treatment of infections caused by problematic species.

TI  == particularities regarding the etiology of sepsis in forensic services.
AB  == if in clinical practice definitive diagnostic criteria had been established, after death sepsis is often difficult to diagnose, especially if a site of origin is not found or if no clinical data are available. this article will analyze the  etiology of sepsis in a medical-legal service with emphasis on the differences in diagnosing it in clinical and forensic environments. a total of 78 cases of sepsis cases diagnosed or confirmed at the autopsy were selected. the etiological agent was determined either during the hospitalization or by postmortem bacteriology. a high prevalence of gram-negative sepsis was found, especially multidrug-resistant micro-organisms. most frequent etiological agents were acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterobacter, enterococcus, pseudomonas, and klebsiella. polymicrobial sepsis is much more frequent than in nonforensic cases. in legal medicine, the prevalence of gram-negative sepsis is much higher than in nonforensic autopsies, and the point of origin is shifted toward the skin and the gastrointestinal system.

TI  == functional features of tonb energy transduction systems of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe nosocomial infections. strain atcc 19606(t) utilizes the siderophore acinetobactin to acquire iron under iron-limiting conditions encountered in the host. accordingly, the genome of this strain has three tonb genes encoding proteins for energy transduction functions needed for the active transport of nutrients, including iron, through the outer membrane. phylogenetic analysis indicates that these tonb genes, which are present in the genomes of all sequenced a. baumannii strains, were acquired from different sources. two of these genes occur as components of tonb-exbb-exbd operons and one as a monocistronic copy; all are actively transcribed in atcc 19606(t). the abilities  of components of these tonb systems to complement the growth defect of escherichia coli w3110 mutants kp1344 (tonb) and ra1051 (exbbd) under iron-chelated conditions further support the roles of these tonb systems in iron  acquisition. mutagenesis analysis of atcc 19606(t) tonb1 (subscripted numbers represent different copies of genes or proteins) and tonb2 supports this hypothesis: their inactivation results in growth defects in iron-chelated media,  without affecting acinetobactin biosynthesis or the production of the acinetobactin outer membrane receptor protein baua. in vivo assays using galleria mellonella show that each tonb protein is involved in, but not essential for, bacterial virulence in this infection model. furthermore, we observed that tonb2  plays a role in the ability of bacteria to bind to fibronectin and to adhere to a549 cells by uncharacterized mechanisms. taken together, these results indicate  that a. baumannii atcc 19606(t) produces three independent tonb proteins, which appear to provide the energy-transducing functions needed for iron acquisition and cellular processes that play a role in the virulence of this pathogen.

TI  == spectrum and antimicrobial resistance of common pathogenic bacteria isolated from patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in mainland of china.
AB  == background: bacteria-induced respiratory infection has been long considered to be the major cause of acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (aecopd). therefore, a clear picture about the distribution and drug-resistance of pathogenic bacteria in the lower airways should be helpful for treatment of the disease. so far, data on this topic among chinese are lacking. methods: a surveillance study was performed in consecutive patients with aecopd at five areas in china between october 2006 and april 2008. the sputum from these patients was cultured and isolated for bacteria. agar dilution method was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of levofoxacin and other 15 antibiotics against these strains. results: three hundred and fifty-nine pathogenic bacterial strains were isolated among 884 patients with aecopd. the predominant bacteria were pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12.3%), haemophilus influenzae (14.2%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (11.7%), followed by haemophilus parainfluenzae (9.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (7.8%), moraxella catarrhalis (6.4%) and escherichia coli (3.6%). the majority of bacterial pathogens isolated in this study were susceptible to fuoroquinolones, ceftazidime, cefepime and imipenem. conclusions: gram-negative bacilli are the leading pathogens in patients with aecopd in china. haemophilus parainfluenzae may be one of the most important pathogens in aecopd. this study provides evidence for local surveillance of aecopd pathogens and appropriate choice of antimicrobials in china.

AB  == marine biofouling, the settlement of microorganisms and macroorganisms on structures submerged in seawater, although economically detrimental, is a successful strategy for survival in hostile environments, where coordinated bacterial communities establish biofilms via the regulation of quorum sensing (qs) communication systems. the inhibition of qs activity among bacteria isolated from different coral species was investigated to gain further insight into its potency in the attenuation, or even the prevention, of undesirable biofouling on  marine organisms. it is hypothesized that coral mucus/microorganism interactions  are competitive, suggesting that the dominant communities secrete qs disruptive compounds. one hundred and twenty bacterial isolates were collected from healthy  coral species and screened for their ability to inhibit qs using three bioreporter strains. approximately 12, 11, and 24% of the isolates exhibited anti-qs activity against escherichia coli psb1075, chromobacterium violaceum cv026, and agrobacterium tumefaciens kyc55 indicator strains, respectively. isolates with positive activity against the bioluminescent monitor strains were scanned via a cytotoxic/genotoxic, e. coli tv1061 and dpd2794 antimicrobial panel. isolates detected by c. violaceum cv026 and a. tumefaciens kyc55 reporter  strains were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of these reporter strains, which were found to be unaffected. tests of the favia sp. coral isolate  fav 2-50-7 (>98% similarity to vibrio harveyi) for its ability to attenuate the formation of biofilm showed extensive inhibitory activity against biofilms of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. to ascertain the stability and general structure of the active compound, cell-free culture supernatants exposed to an increasing temperature gradient or to digestion by proteinase k, were shown to maintain potent qs attenuation and the ability to inhibit the growth of biofilms. mass spectrometry confirmed the presence of a low molecular mass compound. the anti-qs strategy exemplified in the coral mucus is a model with potentially wide applications, including countering the ecological threat posed by biofilms. manipulating synchronized bacterial behavior by detecting new  qs inhibitors will facilitate the discovery of new antifouling compounds.

TI  == structure-guided optimization of protein kinase inhibitors reverses aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.
AB  == activity of the aminoglycoside phosphotransferase aph(3')-ia leads to resistance  to aminoglycoside antibiotics in pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, and contributes to the clinical obsolescence of this class of antibiotics. one strategy to rescue compromised antibiotics such as aminoglycosides is targeting the enzymes that confer resistance with small molecules. we demonstrated previously that epk (eukaryotic protein kinase) inhibitors could inhibit aph enzymes, owing to the structural similarity between these two enzyme families. however, limited structural information of enzyme-inhibitor complexes hindered interpretation of the results. in addition, cross-reactivity of compounds between aphs and epks represents an obstacle to their use as aminoglycoside adjuvants to  rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity. in the present study, we structurally  and functionally characterize inhibition of aph(3')-ia by three diverse chemical  scaffolds, anthrapyrazolone, 4-anilinoquinazoline and pp (pyrazolopyrimidine), and reveal distinctions in the binding mode of anthrapyrazolone and pp compounds  to aph(3')-ia compared with epks. using this observation, we identify pp derivatives that select against epks, attenuate aph(3')-ia activity and rescue aminoglycoside antibiotic activity against a resistant escherichia coli strain. the structures described in the present paper and the inhibition studies provide  an important opportunity for structure-based design of compounds to target aminoglycoside phosphotransferases for inhibition, potentially overcoming this form of antibiotic resistance.

TI  == evaluation of the in vitro activity of fosfomycin tromethamine against gram-negative bacterial strains recovered from community- and hospital-acquired urinary tract infections in turkey.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activities of antimicrobial agents including fosfomycin tromethamine against gram-negative isolates recovered from urine samples. methods: a total of 2334 strains (1562 escherichia coli, 509 klebsiella spp, 85 proteus spp, 75 pseudomonas spp, 45 enterobacter spp, 37 acinetobacter baumannii, 8 citrobacter spp, 7 morganella morganii, and 6 serratia spp) were identified by vitek 2 during the study period, november 2008 to june 2012. antimicrobial susceptibilities of the strains were also evaluated using the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method, in accordance with the clinical and laboratory standards institute guidelines. results: overall, 2160 (92.5%) of the isolates tested were susceptible to fosfomycin tromethamine.  higher resistance rates were observed among inpatients compared to outpatients. resistance rates by strain were: 2.0% for e. coli, 4.4% for enterobacter spp, 6.9% for klebsiella spp, 9.4% for proteus spp, 48.6% for a. baumannii, 56.0% for  pseudomonas spp, and 100% for morganella morganii. all serratia spp and citrobacter spp strains were susceptible. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing isolates displayed higher fosfomycin resistance rates than negative strains (19.2% vs. 2.9%). the highest in vitro activity was detected for amikacin, piperacillin-tazobactam, and imipenem for all strains including esbl-producers. conclusions: regardless of esbl production, the excellent activity of fosfomycin against e. coli, enterobacter spp, serratia spp, and citrobacter spp, indicates that the drug is a valuable therapeutic option for urinary tract infections, even those with co-trimoxazole- and ciprofloxacin-resistant isolates, but not in esbl-producing klebsiella spp, pseudomonas spp, a. baumannii, and proteus spp. further studies should be carried out to determine the in vivo drug activity among enterobacteriaceae other than e. coli.

AB  == background: antimicrobial photodynamic therapy uses photosensitizers designed to  bind to microorganisms and generate reactive oxygen species when illuminated with visible light. materials & methods: we synthesized a highly water-soluble [70]fullerene monoadduct, c70[>m(c3n6(+)c3)2]-(i(-))10 (lc17), and bisadduct, c70[>m(c3n6(+)c3)2][>m(c3n6c3)2] (lc18), both with a well-defined decacationic quaternary ammonium iodide moiety with ten positive charges per c70 to give water solubility and bacterial binding. we determined the antimicrobial effects against human pathogens, gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative species  (escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii) when activated by uva or white light. results: white light was more effective with lc17, while uva light was more effective with lc18. both compounds were effective in a mouse model of gram-negative third-degree burn infections determined by bioluminescence imaging. discussion & conclusion: we propose that the attachment of an additional deca(tertiary-ethylenylamino)malonate arm to c70 allowed the moiety to act as a potent electron donor and increased the generation yield of hydroxyl radicals under uva illumination.

TI  == nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in cuban intensive care units: bacterial species and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == introduction: nosocomial pneumonia associated with use of mechanical ventilators  is one of the greatest challenges confronted by intensivists worldwide. the literature associates several bacteria with this type of infection; most common in intensive care units are acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and some of the enterobacteriaceae family. objectives: to identify the causal agents of nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care units of havana's hermanos ameijeiras clinical-surgical teaching hospital in 2011, and to characterize their antibiotic resistance. methods: a cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using hospital administrative data of quantitative cultures from positive tracheal aspirates for january through december, 2011. records were analyzed from 77 intensive care unit patients who developed nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. variables examined were age and sex, and pathogens identified from culture of tracheal aspirate and related antibiotic susceptibility. results species most frequently isolated were: acinetobacter baumannii in 53 patients (68.8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa in 34 patients (44.2%), other species of pseudomonas in 15 patients (19.5%), and serratia marcescens, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli in  12 patients each (15.6%). some patients presented more than one pathogen in concurrent or successive infections. antimicrobial susceptibility testing found high percentages of resistance to antibiotics in all these pathogens. least resistance was found to colistin. conclusions: the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia is of concern. colistin is the drug of choice among the antibiotics reviewed, but sensitivity to other antibiotics should be assessed to search for more appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. our results also suggest the need to strengthen  infection control efforts, particularly in intensive care units, and to reassess  compliance with quality control procedures. multidisciplinary research involving  microbiologists, epidemiologists, internists and intensivists is needed to fully  understand the etiological and resistance patterns observed.

TI  == identification and characterization of type ii toxin-antitoxin systems in the opportunistic pathogen acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes nosocomial infections. due to the ability to persist in the clinical environment and rapidly acquire antibiotic resistance, multidrug-resistant a. baumannii clones have spread in medical units in many countries in the last decade. the molecular basis of the emergence and spread of the successful multidrug-resistant a. baumannii clones is not understood. bacterial toxin-antitoxin (ta) systems are abundant genetic loci harbored in low-copy-number plasmids and chromosomes and have been proposed to fulfill numerous functions, from plasmid stabilization to regulation  of growth and death under stress conditions. in this study, we have performed a thorough bioinformatic search for type ii ta systems in genomes of a. baumannii strains and estimated at least 15 possible ta gene pairs, 5 of which have been shown to be functional ta systems. three of them were orthologs of bacterial and  archaeal relb/rele, hica/hicb, and higb/higa systems, and others were the unique  splt/spla and chet/chea ta modules. the toxins of all five ta systems, when expressed in escherichia coli, inhibited translation, causing rna degradation. the higb/higa and splt/spla ta pairs of plasmid origin were highly prevalent in clinical multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolates from lithuanian hospitals belonging to the international clonal lineages known as european clone i (eci) and ecii.

AB  == multidrug-resistant (mdr) gram-negative bacteria have emerged as a serious threat to human and animal health. bdellovibrio spp. and micavibrio spp. are gram-negative bacteria that prey on other gram-negative bacteria. in this study,  the ability of bdellovibrio bacteriovorus and micavibrio aeruginosavorus to prey  on mdr gram-negative clinical strains was examined. although the potential use of predatory bacteria to attack mdr pathogens has been suggested, the data supporting these claims is lacking. by conducting predation experiments we have established that predatory bacteria have the capacity to attack clinical strains  of a variety of ss-lactamase-producing, mdr gram-negative bacteria. our observations indicate that predatory bacteria maintained their ability to prey on mdr bacteria regardless of their antimicrobial resistance, hence, might be used as therapeutic agents where other antimicrobial drugs fail.

AB  == type vi secretion systems (t6ss) are a class of macromolecular secretion machines that are utilized by a number of bacteria for inter-bacterial competition or to elicit responses in eukaryotic cells. acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that causes severe infections in humans. these infections, including pneumonia and bacteremia, are important, as they are often associated with hospitals and medical-settings where they disproportionally affect critically ill patients like those residing in intensive care units. while it is known that a. baumannii genomes carry genes whose predicted products have homology with t6ss-associated gene products from other bacteria, and secretion of a major t6ss  structural protein hcp has been demonstrated, no additional work on an a. baumannii t6ss has been reported. herein, we demonstrated that a. baumannii strain m2 secretes hcp and this secretion was dependent upon tssb, an ortholog of a bacteriophage contractile sheath protein, confirming that strain m2 produces a  functional t6ss. additionally, we demonstrated that the ability of strain m2 to out-compete escherichia coli was reliant upon the products of tssb and hcp. collectively, our data have provided the first evidence demonstrating function in inter-bacterial competition, for a t6ss produced by a. baumannii.

TI  == prevalence of blaper-1 and integrons in ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacteria at a university hospital in turkey.
AB  == in this study, we examined the prevalence of the per-1 enzyme and the presence of clinically important integron classes in ceftazidime-resistant gram-negative bacteria isolated at a university hospital. the blaper-1 gene was detected by pcr in 33 (19.5%) of the total 169 gram-negative bacteria, including 17 (23.3%) of the 73 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates and 16 (25%) of the 64 acinetobacter baumannii complex isolates. molecular fingerprinting revealed that blaper-1 prevalence was mostly due to the dissemination of clonally related p. aeruginosa  and a. baumannii complex strains. class 1 integron (inti1) was detected in 52.7%  of the 169 bacteria examined in this study. its detection rates were estimated at 49.3% and 57.8% of the p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii complex strains isolated, respectively. it was also detected in 11 of the 16 escherichia coli isolates and  5 of the 10 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. a single e. coli isolate and another  k. pneumoniae isolate contained both class 1 and class 2 integrase genes. the results of this study revealed that clonally related blaper-1-positive p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii complex strains, mostly harboring inti1, had disseminated at our hospital.

TI  == carbapenem susceptibilities and non-susceptibility concordance to different carbapenems amongst clinically important gram-negative bacteria isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: results from the surveillance of multicentre antimicrobial resistance in taiwan (smart) in 2009.
AB  == to investigate the in vitro susceptibilities to various carbapenems amongst clinical gram-negative bacteria isolated from patients in intensive care units of ten major teaching hospitals in taiwan in 2009, a survey was conducted to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of ertapenem, imipenem, meropenem and doripenem against isolates of enterobacteriaceae (n = 594), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 185), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 192) and burkholderia cepacia (n = 23) using the agar dilution method. susceptibilities were determined according to 2009, 2011 and 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by the clsi as well as 2012 mic breakpoints recommended by eucast. based on clsi 2012 criteria, the ertapenem susceptible rate was 93%, 81%, 68% and 92% for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae and serratia marcescens, respectively. all proteus mirabilis and morganella morganii isolates  were susceptible to ertapenem; however, 64% of p. mirabilis and all m. morganii isolates were non-susceptible to imipenem. meropenem and doripenem had better activities than imipenem against ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae isolates. e. coli, k. pneumoniae and e. cloacae with ertapenem mics>/=4 mg/l were synchronously not susceptible to imipenem, meropenem and doripenem. imipenem susceptibility was 65% and 29% for p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii, respectively.  additionally, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=8 mg/l were also not susceptible to meropenem and doripenem. these data provide a better understanding of choosing appropriate carbapenem agents to treat infections caused by ertapenem-non-susceptible enterobacteriaceae as well as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates with imipenem mics>/=4 mg/l.

TI  == factors influencing the early mortality in haematological malignancy patients with nosocomial gram negative bacilli bacteraemia: a retrospective analysis of 154 cases.
AB  == background: the aim of this study is to assess the factors influencing the early  mortality (7-day after index blood culture) in haematological malignancy patients with gram negative bacilli (gnb) bacteraemia. methods: infection control committee records were reviewed to identify the cases between march 2006 and june 2011. only one bacteraemic episode per patient was included in the study. results: a total of 154 patients with gnb bacteraemia were identified. the early  mortality rate was 19.5% (30 out of 154). blood cultures revealed enterobacteriacea in 120 patients (escherichia coli; 86, klebsiella spp.; 28, enterobacter cloacea; 6) and glucose non-fermenting gnb in 34 patients (pseudomonas aeruginosa; 15, acinetobacter baumannii; 11, stenotrophomonas maltophilia; 7, burkholderia cepacia; 1). forty (33.3%) out of 120 enterobacteriaceae were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producers and 18  (52.9%) out of 34 glucose non-fermenting gnb were multidrug resistant. carbapenems were administered as first line therapy in 139 out of 154 patients. in univariate analysis pitt's bacteraemia score, presence of aplastic anaemia, bacteraemia caused by glucose non-fermentating gnb, inappropriate empirical antibacterial treatment, presence of severe sepsis or septic shock, unable to achieve microbiological cure, and intensive care unit (icu) acquired bacteraemia  were associated with mortality. multivariate analysis showed icu acquired bacteraemia (or, 12.55; 95% ci, 2.34-67.38, p=0.003) as an independent factor associated with early mortality. conclusion: haematological malignancy patients who require icu care are at high risk for early mortality related to gnb bacteraemia. based on the local findings pointing out high rate of multidrug resistance, carbapenems combined with colistin seems to be a reasonable approach  as empirical treatment of these patients. however, increasing carbapenem resistance rate is of concern.

AB  == tigecycline is a new glycylcyclin with a wide spectre including multi-resistant bacteria. our laboratory tests in routine the in vitro activity of the tgc towards clinically significant isolates of 3rd generation cephalosporins resistant enterobacteriaceae (ec3r), acinetobacter baumannii and bacteroides fragilis group (bfg). the objective of this study is to describe the in vitro activity of tgc against these strains isolated between 2008 and 2011 in the university hospital of montpellier. in this study period, 1070 isolates ec3r including 541 extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producers (esbl) strains, 47 isolates of a. baumannii including 40 multi-resistant isolates and 645 isolates of bfg were tested. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) were determined using the e-test method. tgc was active against 86.2% of ec3r with a mic 90 less or equal to 1mg/l (escherichia coli being the most sensitive species). a. baumannii  and bfg were also inhibited at low concentrations of tgc with a mic 90 less or equal to 2mg/l respectively for 47% and 84.2% of the isolates. our study confirms the activity of tgc against the ec3r including esbl-producers strains. the relevance of the therapeutic use of tgc on the bfg isolates with a mic greater than 2mg/l should be better documented. often prescribed in therapeutic impasse,  the proper use of tgc would require: clarifying the threshold of sensitivity for  some species (i.e., a. baumannii, bacteroides fragilis group); a better understanding of correlation between in vitro and in vivo activity.

TI  == staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal icu of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, india.
AB  == background: an early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. for the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. aim: to study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. setting and design: this was a retrospective study which was  conducted in the department of microbiology and the neonatal intensive care unit  (nicu) at sgrdimsar, amritsar, during june 2011 to june 2012. methods and materials: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. the antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the kirby bauer disc diffusion technique. results: a total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. these included staphylococcus aureus (n=68), coagulase negative staphylococcus (cons) (n=30), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), escherichia coli (n=05), enterobacter cloacae (n=04), citrobacter diversus (n=02), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and candida (n=01). staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis.  on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. the resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. the resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. a majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. conclusion: the present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.

TI  == oxa-235, a novel class d beta-lactamase involved in resistance to carbapenems in  acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == we investigated the mechanism of carbapenem resistance in 10 acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from the united states and mexico between 2005 and 2009. the detection of known metallo-beta-lactamase or carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinase (oxa) genes by pcr was negative. the presence of plasmid-encoded carbapenem resistance genes was investigated by transformation of a. baumannii atcc 17978. shotgun cloning experiments and sequencing were performed, followed by the expression of a novel beta-lactamase in a. baumannii. three novel oxa enzymes were identified, oxa-235 in 8 isolates and the amino acid variants oxa-236 (glu173-val) and oxa-237 (asp208-gly) in 1 isolate each. the deduced amino acid sequences shared 85% identity with oxa-134, 54% to 57% identities with the acquired oxa-23, oxa-24, oxa-58, and oxa-143, and 56% identity with the intrinsic oxa-51 and, thus, represent a novel subclass of oxa. the expression of  oxa-235 in a. baumannii led to reduced carbapenem susceptibility, while cephalosporin mics were unaffected. genetic analysis revealed that blaoxa-235, blaoxa-236, and blaoxa-237 were bracketed between two isaba1 insertion sequences. in addition, the presence of these acquired beta-lactamase genes might result from a transposition-mediated mechanism. this highlights the propensity of a. baumannii to acquire multiple carbapenem resistance determinants.

TI  == non-nucleoside inhibitors of base, an adenylating enzyme in the siderophore biosynthetic pathway of the opportunistic pathogen acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == siderophores are small-molecule iron chelators produced by bacteria and other microorganisms for survival under iron limiting conditions such as found in a mammalian host. siderophore biosynthesis is essential for the virulence of many important gram-negative pathogens including acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli. we performed high-throughput screening against base, which is involved in siderophore biosynthesis in a. baumannii, and identified 6-phenyl-1-(pyridin-4-ylmethyl)-1h-pyrazolo[3,4-b]pyridine-4-carboxylic acid 15.  herein we report the synthesis, biochemical, and microbiological evaluation of a  systematic series of analogues of the hts hit 15. analogue 67 is the most potent  analogue with a kd of 2 nm against base. structural characterization of the inhibitors with base reveals that they bind in a unique orientation in the active site, occupying all three substrate binding sites, and thus can be considered as  multisubstrate inhibitors. these results provide a foundation for future studies  aimed at increasing both enzyme potency and antibacterial activity.

TI  == novel derivatives of polymyxins.
AB  == polymyxin b and colistin (polymyxin e) are bactericidal pentacationic lipopeptides that act specifically on gram-negative bacteria, first by disrupting their outermost permeability barrier, the outer membrane (om), and then damaging  the cytoplasmic membrane. both were discovered in the mid-1950s and subsequently  used in intravenous therapy, but soon largely abandoned because of nephrotoxicity. the emergence of extremely multiresistant strains has now forced  clinicians to reinstate them in the therapy of severe infections caused by such strains. this article reviews recent attempts to develop novel derivatives of polymyxins that exhibit less toxicity and greater potency than the existing drugs. in addition, studies of novel des-fatty acyl-polymyxin derivatives that display activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa are included. the review also covers recent studies of derivatives that lack potent bactericidal action, but which disrupt the om, which increases bacterial permeability to other antibiotics, facilitating their entry into the cell.

AB  == introduction: multiresistant nosocomial pathogens, especially gram-negative bacilli (gnb), are a serious problem for public health systems worldwide. due to  their antimicrobial properties, copper alloys have been suggested as an alternative for the control of bacterial burden in surfaces in hospital environment. however, antibiotic multiresistance and copper resistance could be associated in gnb, and there is evidence that both kind of resistance genes (antibiotic and copper) can be located on the same genetic structures. for this reason antibiotic-multiresistant strains could survive in the presence of copper, selecting for bacterial phenotypes resistant to both antibacterial agents. aim: to evaluate antibacterial activity of copper against nosocomial extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbl) (+) and esbl (-) gnb, and carbapenems resistant or susceptible strains. material and method: this study included 390 strains of gnb  isolated from chilean hospitals: acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant (car r) and susceptible (car s) to carbapenem antibiotics, and klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli producers and non-producers of esbl. susceptibility levels to cupric sulphate were determined by agar dilution method and statistical analysis were used to determine the significance of the differences in the copper tolerance levels between the strains groups. results: statistically superior copper tolerance levels were found in the car r and esbl producing strains of a. baumannii and k. pneumoniae, in relation with the car s and esbl not-producing strains. conclusion: a relation between a diminished susceptibility to ionic copper and to recent generation antimicrobial agents was  observed in k. pneumoniae y a. baumannii strains.

TI  == genomic and functional analysis of the type vi secretion system in acinetobacter.
AB  == the genus acinetobacter is comprised of a diverse group of species, several of which have raised interest due to potential applications in bioremediation and agricultural purposes. in this work, we show that many species within the genus acinetobacter possess the genetic requirements to assemble a functional type vi secretion system (t6ss). this secretion system is widespread among gram negative  bacteria, and can be used for toxicity against other bacteria and eukaryotic cells. the most studied species within this genus is a. baumannii, an emerging nosocomial pathogen that has become a significant threat to healthcare systems worldwide. the ability of a. baumannii to develop multidrug resistance has severely reduced treatment options, and strains resistant to most clinically useful antibiotics are frequently being isolated. despite the widespread dissemination of a. baumannii, little is known about the virulence factors this bacterium utilizes to cause infection. we determined that the t6ss is conserved and syntenic among a. baumannii strains, although expression and secretion of the hallmark protein hcp varies between strains, and is dependent on tssm, a known structural protein required for t6ss function. unlike other bacteria, a. baumannii atcc 17978 does not appear to use its t6ss to kill escherichia coli or  other acinetobacter species. deletion of tssm does not affect virulence in several infection models, including mice, and did not alter biofilm formation. these results suggest that the t6ss fulfils an important but as-yet-unidentified  role in the various lifestyles of the acinetobacter spp.

(2) methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. detection rates of esbls in escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) no obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of staphylococcus and enterococcus were observed during these years. the enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to carbapenems, next to cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam. but the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime and ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems increased. conclusions: escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. the resistance rates of escherichia coli to cefepime  and ceftazidime, pseudomonas aeruginosa to carbapenems were gradually increasing  in the past years.

TI  == biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  == background: biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. to date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both gram-positive and gram-negative multidrug-resistant (mdr) species in the context of numerous types of infectious  syndromes. herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. methods: the biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at brooke army medical center (bamc) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mrsa/mssa) (n=23), acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (sem). relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and mdr phenotype were evaluated. furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. results: of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with p. aeruginosa and s. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more  frequently observed to be mdr. in patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be  strong biofilm producers in vitro. conclusions: this study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues,  (3) mdr pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.

TI  == riboswitch control of aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.
AB  == the majority of riboswitches are regulatory rnas that regulate gene expression by binding small-molecule metabolites. here we report the discovery of an aminoglycoside-binding riboswitch that is widely distributed among antibiotic-resistant bacterial pathogens. this riboswitch is present in the leader rna of the resistance genes that encode the aminoglycoside acetyl transferase (aac) and aminoglycoside adenyl transferase (aad) enzymes that confer resistance to aminoglycoside antibiotics through modification of the drugs. we show that expression of the aac and aad resistance genes is regulated by aminoglycoside binding to a secondary structure in their 5' leader rna. reporter  gene expression, direct measurements of drug rna binding, chemical probing, and uv crosslinking combined with mutational analysis demonstrate that the leader rna functions as an aminoglycoside-sensing riboswitch in which drug binding to the leader rna leads to the induction of aminoglycosides antibiotic resistance.

TI  == antibiotic resistance acquired through a dna damage-inducible response in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is an emerging nosocomial, opportunistic pathogen that survives desiccation and quickly acquires resistance to multiple antibiotics. escherichia coli gains antibiotic resistances by expressing genes involved in a global response to dna damage. therefore, we asked whether a. baumannii does the  same through a yet undetermined dna damage response akin to the e. coli paradigm. we found that reca and all of the multiple error-prone dna polymerase v (pol v) genes, those organized as umudc operons and unlinked, are induced upon dna damage in a reca-mediated fashion. consequently, we found that the frequency of rifampin-resistant (rif(r)) mutants is dramatically increased upon uv treatment,  alkylation damage, and desiccation, also in a reca-mediated manner. however, in the reca insertion knockout strain, in which we could measure the reca transcript, we found that reca was induced by dna damage, while uvra and one of the unlinked umuc genes were somewhat derepressed in the absence of dna damage. thus, the mechanism regulating the a. baumannii dna damage response is likely different from that in e. coli. notably, it appears that the number of dna pol v  genes may directly contribute to desiccation-induced mutagenesis. sequences of the rpob gene from desiccation-induced rif(r) mutants showed a signature that was consistent with e. coli dna polymerase v-generated base-pair substitutions and that matched that of sequenced a. baumannii clinical rif(r) isolates. these data  strongly support an a. baumannii dna damage-inducible response that directly contributes to antibiotic resistance acquisition, particularly in hospitals where a. baumannii desiccates and tenaciously survives on equipment and surfaces.

TI  == purification, crystallization and preliminary x-ray crystallographic analysis of  diaminopimelate epimerase from acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the meso isomer of diaminopimelate (meso-dap) is a biosynthetic precursor of l-lysine in bacteria and plants, and is a key component of the peptidoglycan layer in the cell walls of gram-negative and some gram-positive bacteria. diaminopimelate epimerase (dapf) is a pyridoxal-5'-phosphate-independent racemase which catalyses the interconversion of (6s,2s)-2,6-diaminopimelic acid (ll-dap) and meso-dap. in this study, dapf from acinetobacter baumannii was overexpressed  in escherichia coli strain solubl21, purified and crystallized using a vapour-diffusion method. a native crystal diffracted to a resolution of 1.9 a and belonged to space group p3(1) or p3(2), with unit-cell parameters a = b = 74.91,  c = 113.35 a, alpha = beta = 90, gamma = 120 degrees . there were two molecules in the asymmetric unit.

TI  == pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitors of dna gyrase b (gyrb) and topoisomerase iv (pare),  part ii: development of inhibitors with broad spectrum, gram-negative antibacterial activity.
AB  == the structurally related bacterial topoisomerases dna gyrase (gyrb) and topoisomerase iv (pare) have long been recognized as prime candidates for the development of broad spectrum antibacterial agents. however, gyrb/pare targeting  antibacterials with spectrum that encompasses robust gram-negative pathogens have not yet been reported. using structure-based inhibitor design, we optimized a novel pyrrolopyrimidine inhibitor series with potent, dual targeting activity against gyrb and pare. compounds were discovered with broad antibacterial spectrum, including activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. herein we describe the sar of the pyrrolopyrimidine series as it relates to key structural and electronic features  necessary for gram-negative antibacterial activity.

TI  == three-year review of bacteriological profile and antibiogram of burn wound isolates in van, turkey.
AB  == the risk of infection in burns is well-known. in recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. for this reason, a retrospective study was conducted at van training and research hospital to analyze the bacterial isolates from the wounds of patients admitted to the burn unit and to determine the susceptibility patterns of the commonly cultured organisms over a 3-year period, january 2009 to december 2011.a total of 250 microorganisms were isolated from burn wounds of 179 patients. our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was acinetobacter baumannii (23.6%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), staphylococcus aureus (11.2%), escherichia coli (10%) respectively. multidrug-resistance has emerged as an important concern in our burn unit. tigecycline, and colistin were found to be the most active drugs against acinetobacter baumannii. carbapenems and amikacin, were found to be the most active drugs against other gram negative bacteria. vancomycin and linezolid  were active against gram positive bacteria.aggressive infection control measures  should be applied to limit the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens.

TI  == additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  == background: there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (hcai). the purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for hcai, which are not included in the current  definition of hcai, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. methods: this 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. risk factors not included in the hcai definition, and independently associated with mdr pathogen infection, namely mdr gram-negative (mdr-gn) and eskape microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus  aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing klebsiella pneumonia and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or hcai). results: there were 1035 patients with  infection, 718 from the community. of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were mdr (28%). among mdr: 104 (85%) had mdr-gn and 41 (33%) had an eskape infection. independent risk factors associated with mdr and mdr-gn  infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (or) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12  months previously) (adjusted or = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). infection by pathogens from the eskape group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted or = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a  karnofsky index <70 (adjusted or = 3.7, p = 0.003). patients with infection by mdr, mdr-gn and pathogens from the eskape group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). conclusions: this study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of hcai for mdr pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial  for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.

TI  == pathogenic analysis of sputum from ventilator-associated pneumonia in a pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  == ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap) is a common and sometimes fatal complication in pediatric intensive care units (picu). the aim of our study was to characterize the distribution and drug susceptibility of the pathogens isolated from the sputum of patients with vap in the picu of our hospital and to  provide support to the administration of antibiotics early and reasonably in the  clinic. our study was conducted between january 2007 and december 2011 at the picu of the children's hospital of zhejiang university school of medicine. the endotracheal aspirates were collected and transported to a microbiology laboratory within 15 min. the pathogens were routinely analyzed and identified with vitek 60 and kirby-bauer disk diffusion methods. among the 121 vap patients, 127 pathogenic strains were isolated from sputum specimens. gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria and fungi accounted for 64.57% (82/127), 29.92% (38/127) and 5.51% (7/127), respectively. acinetobacter baumannii (25.61%), escherichia coli (20.27%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (20.27%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16.22%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.46%) were frequently identified isolates among gram-negative bacteria. staphylococci were susceptible to vancomycin and linezolid. all fungi were sensitive to the antimicrobial agents. the gram-negative bacteria were more prevalent than gram-positive bacteria and fungi  in vap and demonstrated a higher drug resistance. it is important to administer antimicrobial agents early and reasonably for children with vap. knowledge of antibiotic resistance and the characteristics of drug resistance is important for vap prophylaxis and treatment.

TI  == effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  == background: treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. ozone may have a role in these situations. the objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in petri dishes. methods: a pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. the small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/ml ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. in the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). the cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of o(3)/ml for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. results: the selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. all isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. conclusion: a single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.

TI  == photoinactivation of gram positive and gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer  eosin y.
AB  == we test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (klaklak)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin y upon conjugation. the conjugate eosin-(klaklak)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. photoinactivation assays were performed against the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant acinetobacter baumannii aye, as well as the gram-positive bacteria staphylococcus aureus , and  staphylococcus epidermidis . partitioning assays were performed with e. coli and  s. aureus . photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess  the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. eosin-(klaklak)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) cfu/ml of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 mum or below. in contrast, neither eosin y nor (klaklak)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. the increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (klaklak)(2) promotes the association of eosin y to bacteria. eosin-(klaklak)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines hacat, cos-7, and colo 316. consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. the peptide (klaklak)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin y toward both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (klaklak)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.

TI  == mexxy multidrug efflux system of pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == anti-pseudomonas aminoglycosides, such as amikacin and tobramycin, are used in the treatment of pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. however, their use is linked  to the development of resistance. during the last decade, the mexxy multidrug efflux system has been comprehensively studied, and numerous reports of laboratory and clinical isolates have been published. this system has been increasingly recognized as one of the primary determinants of aminoglycoside resistance in p. aeruginosa. in p. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis isolates, upregulation of the pump is considered the most common mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance. non-fermentative gram-negative pathogens possessing very close mexxy orthologs such as achromobacter xylosoxidans and various burkholderia species (e.g., burkholderia pseudomallei and b. cepacia complexes),  but not b. gladioli, are intrinsically resistant to aminoglycosides. here, we summarize the properties (e.g., discovery, mechanism, gene expression, clinical significance) of the p. aeruginosa mexxy pump and other aminoglycoside efflux pumps such as acrd of escherichia coli, amrab-opra of b. pseudomallei, and adeabc of acinetobacter baumannii. mexxy inducibility of the pa5471 gene product, which  is dependent on ribosome inhibition or oxidative stress, is noteworthy. moreover, the discovery of the cognate outer membrane component (opra) of mexxy in the multidrug-resistant clinical isolate pa7, serotype o12 deserves special attention.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against carbapenemase-producing contemporary gram-negative clinical isolates.
AB  == objectives: the antimicrobial activity of copper surfaces against a variety of contemporary carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria representative of the most problematic nosocomial pathogens worldwide was evaluated. methods: twenty-four clinical isolates, comprising four of escherichia coli, two of enterobacter spp., eight of klebsiella pneumoniae and five each of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii producing either vim-1 and/or kpc-2 or vim-2 or oxa-type carbapenemases, were studied. the antimicrobial activity of 99% copper (cu99%) and a 63% alloy (cu63%) was evaluated in comparison with that of stainless steel (ss) and polyvinylchloride (pvc) by incubating approximately 10(6) cfu/cm(2) of the tested strains on each surface at room temperature. results: copper demonstrated antimicrobial activity against all studied isolates. this effect was observed earlier and was more pronounced for cu99% than for cu63%. cu99% showed a bactericidal effect after <2 h for a. baumannii, 3 h for enterobacter spp., 5 h for k. pneumoniae and 6 h for p. aeruginosa and e. coli. no viable colonies were recovered from five (20.8%) isolates after 3 h and from nine (37.5%) isolates after 5 h of incubation on cu99%. conclusions: copper has significant antimicrobial activity against multidrug-resistant nosocomial gram-negative pathogens. this supports the hypothesis that replacement of high-contact materials with copper could reduce the high burden of environmental  contamination around high-risk patients. however, this strategy should be seen as an adjunctive measure to established cleaning protocols and to good hygiene practices for prevention of hospital-acquired infections.

AB  == postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (lvfx) has been conducted continuously since 1992. the present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in japan to 30 selected antibacterial  agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (fqs). the common respiratory pathogens streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, moraxella catarrhalis, and haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to fqs. in contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among s pneumoniae and s. pyogenes. regarding h. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to fqs, however, prevalence of lvfx-resistant escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of lvfx-resistant e. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence  of lvfx 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. another enterobacteriaceae member, klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to fqs, in contrast with e.  coli. in methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), the percentage of fq-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other fqs. however, methicillin-susceptible s. aureus (mssa) isolates were highly susceptible to fqs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. the prevalence of fqs-resistant  isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of fq-resistance in mrsa. the prevalence of fqs-resistant pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (utis) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in p. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (rtis). while this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were  noted in the prevalence of fq-resistant p. aeruginosa isolates derived from utis. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from utis and 0.3% among isolates from rtis, a decrease from the results  of 2007. acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to fqs. imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a  prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance  of 81.3-82.5%, to fqs. ceftriaxone (ctrx) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to ctrx in some clinical isolates. the result of the present survey indicated that although  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, enterococcus faecium, p. aeruginosa from utis, n. gonorrhoeae, and e. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the fqs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. while fq resistance has been prevailing in e. coli, e. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to fqs. the other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against fqs.

AB  == the host-defense peptide, esculentin-2cha (gfssifrgva(10)kfaskglgk d(20)laklgvdlva(30) ckiskqc) shows potent (mic</=6 mum) growth inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant strains of staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia  and differential cytotoxic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50)=150 mum) and human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma a549 cells (lc(50)=10 mum). esculentin-2cha significantly (p<0.01) stimulates the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine il-10 by mouse lymphoid cells and elevates its production after stimulation with concanavalin a and significantly (p<0.05) stimulates tnf-alpha production by peritoneal macrophages. effects on il-6 and il-1beta production were not significant. removal of the hydrophobic n-terminal hexapeptide (gfssif) from esculentin-2cha results in abolition of growth inhibitory activity against s. aureus and cytotoxic activity against erythrocytes and a549 cells as well as a marked (>/=16-fold) reduction in potency against a. baumannii and s. maltophilia. the primary structure of esculentin-2 has been poorly conserved between frog species but evolutionary pressure has acted to maintain the hydrophobic character of this n-terminal hexapeptide sequence. removal of the cyclic c-terminal domain (ckiskqc) and replacement of the cys(31)  and cys(37) residues by serine resulted in appreciable decreases in cytotoxicity  against all microorganisms and against mammalian cells. the more cationic [d20k,  d27k] analog showed a modest increase in potency against all microorganisms (up to 4-fold) but a marked increase in cytotoxicity against erythrocytes (lc(50)=11  mum) and a549 cells (lc(50)=3 mum).

TI  == comparative analysis of fecal microflora of healthy full-term indian infants born with different methods of delivery (vaginal vs cesarean): acinetobacter sp. prevalence in vaginally born infants.
AB  == in this study fecal microflora of human infants born through vaginal delivery (vb) and through cesarean section (cb) were investigated using culture-independent 16s rdna cloning and sequencing approach. the results obtained clearly revealed that fecal microbiota of vb infants distinctly differ from those in their counterpart cb infants. the intestinal microbiota of infants  delivered by cesarean section appears to be more diverse, in terms of bacteria species, than the microbiota of vaginally delivered infants. the most abundant bacterial species present in vb infants were acinetobacter sp., bifidobacterium sp. and staphylococcus sp. however, cb infant's fecal microbiota was dominated with citrobacter sp., escherichia coli and clostridium difficile. the intestinal  microbiota of cesarean section delivered infants in this study was also characterized by an absence of bifidobacteria species. an interesting finding of  our study was recovery of large number of acinetobacter sp. consisting of acinetobacter pittii (former acinetobacter genomic species 3), acinetobacter junii and acinetobacter baumannii in the vb infants clone library. among these, acinetobacter baumannii is a known nosocomial pathogen and acinetobacter pittii (genomic species 3) is recently recognized as clinically important taxa within the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii (acb) complex. although none of the infants had shown any sign of clinical symptoms of disease, this observation warrants a closer look.

TI  == detection of bacterial 16s rrna and identification of four clinically important bacteria by real-time pcr.
AB  == within the paradigm of clinical infectious disease research, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa represent the four most clinically relevant, and hence most extensively studied bacteria. current culture-based methods for identifying these organisms are slow  and cumbersome, and there is increasing need for more rapid and accurate molecular detection methods. using bioinformatic tools, 962,279 bacterial 16s rrna gene sequences were aligned, and regions of homology were selected to generate a set of real-time pcr primers that target 93.6% of all bacterial 16s rrna sequences published to date. a set of four species-specific real-time pcr primer pairs were also designed, capable of detecting less than 100 genome copies of a. baumannii, e. coli, k. pneumoniae, and p. aeruginosa. all primers were tested for specificity in vitro against 50 species of gram-positive and -negative bacteria. additionally, the species-specific primers were tested against a panel  of 200 clinical isolates of each species, randomly selected from a large repository of clinical isolates from diverse areas and sources. a comparison of culture and real-time pcr demonstrated 100% concordance. the primers were incorporated into a rapid assay capable of positive identification from plate or  broth cultures in less than 90 minutes. furthermore, our data demonstrate that current targets, such as the uida gene in e.coli, are not suitable as species-specific genes due to sequence variation. the assay described herein is rapid, cost-effective and accurate, and can be easily incorporated into any research laboratory capable of real-time pcr.

AB  == objective: to investigate the characteristics of multidrug resistance (mdr) organisms from the lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients, and the constitution, detection time and mortality of the intensive care unit (icu) patients with different clinical pulmonary infection scores (cpis). methods: a retrospective study was conducted. the clinical data of 72 cases with lower respiratory tract mdr on ventilation more than 48 hours were collected from april 2010 to december 2011. cpis were calculated at the same time. thirty-three patients with cpis>6 were diagnosed as ventilation associated pneumonia (vap), while 39 having cpis </=6 (non-vap). the characteristics of mdr, the detection time and mortality of the patients were compared between the two groups. results: the first five mdr were baumannii [49.5%(34/74)], klebsiella pneumoniae [24.3%(18/74)], escherichia coli [20.3%(15/74)], pseudomonas aeruginosa [5.4%(4/74)] and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus [mrsa, 4.1%(3/74)] in vap group, while the first five were escherichia coli [40.2%(37/92)], pseudomonas aeruginosa [33.7%(31/92)], klebsiella pneumoniae [13.1%(12/92)], baumannii [8.7%(8/92)] and mrsa [4.3%(4/92)] in non-vap group. there was no significant difference in average detection time between vap group and non-vap group (10.7+/-1.5 days vs. 9.4+/-1.8 days, p>0.05). the mortality rate in vap group was significantly higher than that in non-vap group (39.4% vs. 23.1%, p<0.05). conclusions: different mdr may be detected in lower respiratory tracts no matter the ventilated patients having vap or not, which influence the patients prognosis and should be monitored intensively. antibiotics should be empirically  prescribed and adjusted dynamically.

TI  == pharmacodynamic profiling of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem against prevalent  gram-negative organisms in the asia-pacific region.
AB  == carbapenems are increasingly being utilised owing to the escalating prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria from community and hospital settings. in this study, pharmacodynamic profiles of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem were evaluated against gram-negative bacteria isolated from hospitalised patients. mics for carbapenems were determined for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii obtained from the compact ii programme conducted in the asia-pacific region. monte carlo simulations were undertaken to assess the pharmacodynamic profile of  carbapenems against each of the pathogens. all carbapenem regimens achieved optimal exposures [cumulative fraction of response (cfr) >/=90%] against e. coli  and k. pneumoniae. against p. aeruginosa, doripenem achieved 81.3-95.3% cfr, imipenem achieved 55.2-77.9% cfr and meropenem achieved 71.9-91.3% cfr; only doripenem regimens of 4-h infusion of 1000 mg every 8h (q8h) and 1-h and 4-h infusion of 2000 mg q8h and a meropenem regimen of 3-h infusion of 2000 mg q8h obtained optimal exposures; all carbapenem regimens showed slight (1-7%) improvement in cfrs in favour of isolates collected from icu sources. against a.  baumannii, cfrs were much lower (25.9-46.7% cfr) and no carbapenem regimens achieved optimal exposure in or outside the icu. owing to the high potency of carbapenems against these enterobacteriaceae populations, standard regimens are likely to perform well in the asia-pacific region. however, larger doses combined with prolonged infusions will be required to increase the cfr for these carbapenems against resistant non-fermenting gram-negatives such as p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii that are prevalent in these countries.

TI  == impact of susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacteria before and after the  introduction of ertapenem at a medical center in northern taiwan from 2004 to 2010.
AB  == this retrospective observational study evaluated the impact of antimicrobial consumption on antimicrobial susceptibility among aerobic gram-negative bacteria  after introducing ertapenem to the formulary of a teaching hospital (1130 beds) in northern taiwan. data on consumption of various antimicrobial agents, expressed as defined daily dose/1000 patient-days (ddd/1000 pd), were collected retrospectively from hospital pharmacy records 2 years before and 5 years after the introduction of ertapenem (october 2005). during the study period, the consumption of ampicillin and aminoglycosides decreased significantly. in contrast, the consumption of cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (ertapenem, imipenem, and meropenem), and fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) increased significantly over time. there was a significant increase in the rate of susceptibility of escherichia coli to ampicillin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefpirome, amikacin, and levofloxacin; an increase in the rate of susceptibility of klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime, cefepime, cefpirome, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, levofloxacin, and amikacin; a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa to meropenem; and a significant decrease in the rate of susceptibility of acinetobacter baumannii to ceftazidime, carbapenems, ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin. the rate of antibiotic susceptibility to ertapenem of extended spectrum beta-lactamase producers, including e. coli and k. pneumoniae, remained  stable. usage of ertapenem was found to be negatively and significantly associated with the susceptibility rates of p. aeruginosa to meropenem and gentamicin. significantly negative correlations were noted between the use of ertapenem and the rates of susceptibility of a. baumannii to ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem), ciprofloxacin, and levofloxacin.

TI  == multidrug-resistant bacteria in travellers hospitalized abroad: prevalence, characteristics, and influence on clinical outcome.
AB  == background: worldwide, the burden of multidrug-resistant bacteria (mdr) is increasing, especially in the hospital setting. aim: to explore characteristics and clinical relevance of mdr obtained from travellers transferred from hospitals abroad. methods: this retrospective study included patients transferred from hospitals abroad to the university hospital zurich, switzerland, who routinely underwent admission screening for possible colonization with meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (esbl) and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria (mr gram negative). findings: forty-six (17%) of 259 subjects were found to be colonized with mdr and nine (3.5%) patients to be infected. thirty-three (12%) patients were colonized with one bacterial species, 12 (4.6%) with two, and three (1.2%) were colonized with three different bacterial species. in total, 36 esbl, 21 mr gram-negative and three mrsa isolates were detected. escherichia coli (n = 18, 30%), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 14, 23%) and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 14, 23%) were most frequently isolated. the most common sites of detection were skin (97%) and respiratory tract (41%). being colonized contributed to an increased length of icu stay [median (range): 8 (1-35) vs 3.5 (1-78) days; p = 0.011]. in-hospital mortality in patients colonized with mdr (10.9%) was higher than in uncolonized patients (2.3%, p = 0.018). being colonized with mdr was associated with death (adjusted odds ratio: 5.176; 95% confidence interval: 1.325-20.218). conclusions: a substantial proportion of patients transferred from abroad are colonized with mdr, a fact which is associated with poor clinical outcome.

AB  == in this work, human serum albumin (hsa) stabilized gold nanoclusters (hsa-auncs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli j96, pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (pdrab), staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecalis (vre). we discovered that hsa-auncs have unique affinity with s. aureus and mrsa. in addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of hsa-auncs toward s. aureus and mrsa, the binding peptide motifs identified from hsa-auncs were characterized by mass spectrometry. the identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound auncs (pep-auncs). the generated pep-auncs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with s. aureus and mrsa.

AB  == the sporadic emergence of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1)-producing acinetobacter spp. has been reported in china; however, ndm-1-positive bacteria epidemics are rarely reported in intensive care units (icus) in china, or even in the world. during 15 months' surveillance acinetobacter spp. isolated from patients, heathcare workers and surfaces of a chinese icu were screened for the bla(ndm-1) gene. a total of 27 of 3114 acinetobacter spp. strains were ndm-1 positive and identified as a. pittii with sequence type 63 (st63) by multilocus sequence typing. of the 27 ndm-1-positive a. pittii strains, 22 were isolated from the icu surfaces and grouped into a major clone a using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing, while the other five strains isolated from the patients were classified into three clones (a, b and c). the bla(ndm-1) gene was located on a 45-kb plasmid for all three a. pittii clones. the plasmid could be transferred to a. pittii and a. baumannii recipients at both 30 and 37 degrees c  but not to escherichia coli j53. the plasmid could not be classified into any of  the known plasmid incompatibility groups. the bla(ndm-1) region in the plasmid was flanked by two insertion sequence elements, isaba125 and isaba11, and no other carbapenemase gene was present in this ndm-1-positive a. pittii isolate. thus, we present the first report on the transmission and characterization of ndm-1-producing a. pittii in an icu in china as well as a novel bla(ndm-1) gene-bearing plasmid.

TI  == adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  == adenylate kinase (ak) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. we have shown that ak release serves as  a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. the ak assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using  conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (scv) and bacteria within  established biofilms. the usefulness of the ak assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including escherichia coli and all members of the "eskape" pathogens (enterococcus faecium, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enterobacter species). the assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited ak release. four of these  were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. two of these molecules were further characterized. the antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against s. aureus planktonic, scv population, and biofilm-associated cells. tamoxifen, an estrogen  receptor antagonist, was active toward e. faecium in vitro and also reduced e. faecium pathogenesis in a galleria mellonella infection model. our data demonstrate that the ak assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.

TI  == the effect of d-amino acid substitution on the selectivity of temporin l towards  target cells: identification of a potent anti-candida peptide.
AB  == the frog skin peptide temporin l (tl, 13-residues long) has a wide and potent spectrum of antimicrobial activity, but it is also toxic on mammalian cells at its microbicidal concentrations. previous studies have indicated that its analogue [pro(3)]tl has a slightly reduced hemolytic activity and a stable helical conformation along residues 6-13. here, to expand our knowledge on the relationship between the extent/position of alpha-helix in tl and its biological  activities, we systematically replaced single amino acids within the alpha-helical domain of [pro(3)]tl with the corresponding d isomers, known as helix breakers. structure-activity relationship studies of these analogues, by means of cd and nmr spectroscopy analyses as well as antimicrobial and hemolytic  assays were performed. besides increasing our understanding on the structural elements that are responsible for cell selectivity of tl, this study revealed that a single l to d amino acid substitution can preserve strong anti-candida activity of [pro(3)]tl, without giving a toxic effect towards human cells.

TI  == oxybiotest project: microorganisms under pressure. hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) and simple pressure interaction on selected bacteria.
AB  == background: hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) therapy involves exposure to pure oxygen in a pressurized room, and it is an already well-established treatment for various conditions, including those originated by serious infections. starting from the observation of an increased number of patients who were accessing our hbo units for diseases supported from concomitant multidrug-resistant microorganisms, as well as considering the evident clinical benefit and laboratory final outcome of  those patients at the end of the treatment, aim of our study was to measure, or better define at least, if there was any interaction between a hyperbaric environment and some selected microorganisms and if those positive results were due to the increased oxygen partial pressure (po2) value or just to the increased pressure, regardless of the fraction of inspired oxygen (fio2) applied (21/100%). design and methods: we applied various increased po2 values in a hyperbaric environment. our study design was tailored in four steps to answer four specific  questions, ordered in a progressive process: oxybiotest (obt)-1,2,3, and 4. specifically, we chose to investigate possible changes in the minimum inhibitory  concentration (mic) and in the minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) of multi-resistant microorganisms after a single session of hyperbaric therapy. results: obt-1 and obt-2 provide a semi-quantitative confirmation of the bacterio-cidal and cytostatic effects of hbo. hbo is cidal only if the total exposure pressure is elevated, and cidal or cytostatic effect are not always dependent on the po2 applied.obt-4 has shown the adjuvant effect of hbo and antimicrobial drug against some selected bacteria. discussion: we seem allowed to hypothesize that only in case of a good approach to a lesion, permitting smaller  bacterial loads thanks to surgical debridement and/or eventual antibiotic therapy for example, you can observe the clear effectiveness of the hyperbaric oxygen (hbo) exposure as a valid adjuvant therapy, even when that lesion is substained from multidrug-resistant micro-organisms. on the contrary when the bacterial load is very high we observe an unchanged situation or a just a slightly diminishing in the number of cfu/ml. conclusions: even if confined in this 'in vitro' environment and in a single treatment, just knowing the microorganism strain responsible of the lesion we seem allowed to both weight the possible related effectiveness using hbo therapy (hbot) and derive the best po2 to treat the case. a further possible development of the study highlights a comparison between acinetobacter baumannii (acba) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (psae), and escherichia coli (esco) and klebsiella pneumoniae (klpn).

TI  == in vivo-validated essential genes identified in acinetobacter baumannii by using  human ascites overlap poorly with essential genes detected on laboratory media.
AB  == a critical feature of a potential antimicrobial target is the characteristic of being essential for growth and survival during host infection. for bacteria, genome-wide essentiality screens are usually performed on rich laboratory media.  this study addressed whether genes detected in that manner were optimal for the identification of antimicrobial targets since the in vivo milieu is fundamentally different. mutant derivatives of a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii were screened for growth on human ascites, an ex vivo medium that reflects the infection environment. a subset of 34 mutants with unique gene disruptions that demonstrated little to no growth on ascites underwent evaluation in a rat subcutaneous abscess model, establishing 18 (53%) of these genes as in vivo essential. the putative gene products all had annotated biological functions, represented unrecognized or underexploited antimicrobial targets, and could be grouped into five functional categories: metabolic, two-component signaling systems, dna/rna synthesis and regulation, protein transport, and structural. these a. baumannii in vivo essential genes overlapped poorly with the sets of essential genes from other gram-negative bacteria catalogued in the database of essential genes (deg), including those of acinetobacter baylyi, a closely related species. however, this finding was not due to the absence of orthologs. none of the 18 in vivo essential genes identified in this study, or their putative gene products, were targets of fda-approved drugs or drugs in the developmental pipeline, indicating that a significant portion of the available target space within pathogenic gram-negative bacteria is currently neglected. importance: the  human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii is of increasing clinical importance, and  a growing proportion of isolates are multiantimicrobial-resistant, pan-antimicrobial-resistant, or extremely resistant strains. this scenario is reflective of the general problem of a critical lack of antimicrobials effective  against antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter sp., and escherichia coli. this study identified a set of a. baumannii genes that are essential for growth and survival during infection and demonstrated the importance of using clinically relevant media and in vivo validation while screening for essential genes for the purpose of developing new antimicrobials. furthermore, it established that if a gene is absent from the database of essential genes, it should not be excluded as a potential antimicrobial target. lastly, a new set of high-value potential antimicrobial targets for pathogenic gram-negative bacteria has been identified.

AB  == the purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after wenchuan earthquake in 2008. most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with  an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory  tract (37.1%) sites were identified. a total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as clostridium perfringens. the distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the  same time. the most prevalent pathogenic isolates were escherichia coli (15.4%),  acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and enterococcus spp. (9.3%). the drug susceptibility results showed that most of the gram-negative bacilli, except for pseudomonas aeruginosa  and burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. most of the gram-positive cocci  were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and synercid/dalfopristin. characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.

TI  == kinetic and crystallographic studies of extended-spectrum ges-11, ges-12, and ges-14 beta-lactamases.
AB  == ges-1 is a class a extended-spectrum beta-lactamase conferring resistance to penicillins, narrow- and expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, and ceftazidime. however, ges-1 poorly hydrolyzes aztreonam and cephamycins and exhibits very low  k(cat) values for carbapenems. twenty-two ges variants have been discovered thus  far, differing from each other by 1 to 3 amino acid substitutions that affect substrate specificity. ges-11 possesses a gly243ala substitution which seems to confer to this variant an increased activity against aztreonam and ceftazidime. ges-12 differs from ges-11 by a single thr237ala substitution, while ges-14 differs from ges-11 by the gly170ser mutation, which is known to confer increased carbapenemase activity. ges-11 and ges-12 were kinetically characterized and compared to ges-1 and ges-14. purified ges-11 and ges-12 showed strong activities against most tested beta-lactams, with the exception of temocillin, cefoxitin, and carbapenems. both variants showed a significantly increased rate of hydrolysis of cefotaxime, ceftazidime, and aztreonam. on the other hand, ges-11 and ges-12 (and ges-14) variants all containing ala243 exhibited increased susceptibility to classical inhibitors. the crystallographic structures of the ges-11 and ges-14 beta-lactamases were solved. the overall structures of ges-11 and ges-14 are similar to that of ges-1. the gly243ala substitution caused only subtle local rearrangements, notably in the typical carbapenemase disulfide bond. the active sites of ges-14 and ges-11 are very similar, with the gly170ser substitution leading only to the formation of additional hydrogen bonds of the ser residue with hydrolytic water and the glu166 residue.

TI  == is there a direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a?
AB  == study type--therapy (case series) level of evidence 4. what's known on the subject? and what does the study add? several studies describe a reduction of symptomatic urinary tract infections in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after intradetrusor injections of botulinum neurotoxin a (bont/a). it was, however, unclear if a direct antibacterial effect of bont/a plays a role  in this clinical observation. this is the first study to investigate a potential  antibacterial effect of two frequently used bont/a formulations (i.e. botox(r) and dysport(r)), providing evidence that bont/a does not exert an antibacterial effect on lower urinary tract pathogens. objective: * to determine a potential direct antimicrobial effect of botulinum neurotoxin type a (bont/a). materials and methods: * a prospective study was carried out using onabotulinumtoxin a (botox(r)) and abobotulinumtoxin a (dypsort(r)) in agar diffusion and broth microdilution assays with various clinical urinary tract isolates (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella oxytoca and bacillus subtilis). * inhibition zones (mm) of bacteria around a disc containing 20 microl saline with 4 iu of botox(r) were measured in the agar diffusion assay. * minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics, iu/ml) of both toxins for all bacteria were determined in the broth microdilution assay after overnight incubation at 35 degrees c. results: * there was no inhibition zone in the agar diffusion assays with any bacterial strain. * the microdilution test using botox(r) and dysport(r) showed bacterial growth in all dilutions, i.e. mics > 20 and >100 iu/ml for botox(r) and dysport(r), respectively. conclusions: * bont/a has no direct antimicrobial effect. * the reduced frequency of symptomatic urinary tract infections (sutis) in patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity (ndo) after  bont/a intradetrusor injections seems to be caused by different indirect mechanisms, which are still not completely understood.

TI  == antibacterial activities of iron chelators against common nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == the activities of iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone, apo6619, and vk28) were evaluated against type strains of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. deferiprone, apo6619, and vk28 each inhibited growth in standard and rpmi tissue  culture medium, while deferoxamine had no effect. additionally, time-kill assays  revealed that vk28 had a bacteriostatic effect against s. aureus. therefore, these newly developed iron chelators might provide a nontraditional approach for  treatment of bacterial infections.

TI  == volatile compound profiling for the identification of gram-negative bacteria by ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry.
AB  == aims: fast and reliable methods for the early detection and identification of micro-organism are of high interest. in addition to established methods, direct mass spectrometry-based analysis of volatile compounds (vcs) emitted by micro-organisms has recently been shown to allow species differentiation. thus, a large number of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria, which comprised acinetobacter  baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus vulgaris and serratia marcescens, were subjected  to headspace vc composition analysis using direct mass spectrometry in a low sample volume that allows for automation. methods and results: ion-molecule reaction-mass spectrometry (imr-ms) was applied to headspace analysis of the above bacterial samples incubated at 37 degrees c starting with 10(2) cfu ml(-1)  . measurements of sample vc composition were performed at 4, 8 and 24 h. microbial growth was detected in all samples after 8 h. after 24 h, species-specific mass spectra were obtained allowing differentiation between bacterial species. conclusions: imr-ms provided rapid growth detection and identification of micro-organisms using a cumulative end-point model with a short analysis time of 3 min per sample. significance and impact of the study: following further validation, the presented method of bacterial sample headspace  vc analysis has the potential to be used for bacteria differentiation.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  == the drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture,  nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in korea. therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in korea. a total of 443 isolates  (7 species) containing 5 sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 escherichia coli, 60 staphylococcus aureus, 15 staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 enterococcus faecalis, 27 citrobacter freundii, 35 acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of icr mice and sd rats. of these species, acinetobacter baumannii and enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (mic)  in e-test. in case of acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed mic values 16-128 microg/ml for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/ml) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. in addition, 44.1% of the enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/ml range, while mic value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/ml. these results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.

TI  == epidemiology and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of gram-negative bacteria  causing urinary tract infections in the asia-pacific region: 2009-2010 results from the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart).
AB  == in 2009, the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) was expanded to include surveillance of gram-negative pathogens causing urinary tract infections (utis) in the asia-pacific region. a total of 1762 isolates were collected from 38 centers in 11 countries from patients with utis in 2009 and 2010. in vitro susceptibilities were determined by the broth microdilution method and susceptibility profiles were determined using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) interpretive criteria, as recommended by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) in 2010 (m100-s20), in 2011 (m100-s21), and in 2012 (m100-s22). enterobacteriaceae comprised 86.0% of the isolates, of which  escherichia coli (56.5%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (13.8%) were the two most common species. amikacin was the most effective antibiotic (91.7%), followed by ertapenem (86.9%), imipenem (86.6%), and piperacillin-tazobactam (84.9%). rates of susceptibility were 50.3% for cefoxitin and ranged from 50.3% to 74.2% for the third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins. for ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin,  the susceptibility rates were 51.4% and 54.4%, respectively. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing enterobacteriaceae comprised 28.2% of all isolates. we also found a high rate of resistance to carbapenems among acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa causing uti. interestingly, according to 2012 clsi breakpoints, approximately 33.4% of esbl producers were still susceptible to ceftazidime. however, this in vitro efficacy of ceftazidime  needs to be validated in vivo by clinical data. the lowered clsi interpretive breakpoints for piperacillin-tazobactam, carbapenems, and some cephalosporins in  2011-2012 for enterobacteriaceae resulted in an approximate 5% drop in susceptibility rates for each drug, with the exception of imipenem for which the  susceptibility rate dropped from 99.4% according to 2010 criteria to 91.2% according to 2011 criteria. with the updated clsi criteria, the antimicrobial resistance threat from uti pathogens in the asia pacific area was revealed to be  more prominent.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections at five medical centers in taiwan that continuously participated in the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart)  from 2006 to 2010.
AB  == the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) is a worldwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of  antimicrobial agents against pathogens that cause intra-abdominal infections (iais). in this study, trends in antimicrobial resistance during the period 2006  to 2010 were analyzed at five tertiary-care hospitals in taiwan. enterobacteriaceae accounted for the majority (80.9%) of the 2417 gram-negative isolates, and the two most common species were escherichia coli (38.8%) and klebsiella pneumoniae (23.5%). the rates of susceptibility of enterobacteriaceae  isolates to cephalosporins decreased during the study period. although carbapenems, fluoroquinolones, piperacillin-tazobactam, and amikacin were active  in vitro against more than 80% of the enterobacteriaceae isolates, the activity of carbapenems declined during the study period. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production in e. coli was steady, but that in k. pneumoniae decreased during the study period. the rate of esbl-producing species was three-fold higher among patients with nosocomial iais than among patients with community-acquired iais. the majority of isolates from liver were k. pneumoniae (69%) and very few of those isolates were esbl producers (0.9%). pseudomonas aeruginosa (9.3%) and acinetobacter baumannii (3.8%) were the two most common non-enterobacteriaceae. p. aeruginosa showed improved susceptibility, whereas a. baumannii showed a rapid development of resistance during the study period. there was marked geographic variation in resistance patterns of the isolates obtained during the study period. northern taiwan had the highest rate of esbl producers and the highest rate of ceftazidime resistance among p. aeruginosa isolates. central taiwan had the lowest rate of esbl producers but the highest rates of carbapenem resistance  among p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. continuous monitoring and regular  updates of epidemiological data are needed to guide appropriate empiric antimicrobial therapy.

TI  == [the multiplex polymerase chain reaction for detection of ventilator-associated trachea-bronchitis and pneumonia in patients with common pathogens].
AB  == objective: to explore the clinical utility of multiple polymerase chain reaction  (m-pcr) in the rapid detection of the common pathogens in ventilator-associated trachea - bronchitis (vat) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap). methods: sputum samples of 75 patients complicated vat or vap in surgical intensive care unit (sicu), were examined by bacterial culture, ordinary pcr, the m-pcr detection. the pathogen detection rates among three methods were compared. results: the staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and klebsiella pneumoniae of the positive detection rates  were 50.7%, 45.3%, 30.7%, 41.3% and 58.7% by bacterial culture. by ordinary pcr,  the positive detection rates were respectively 88.0%, 89.3%, 78.7%, 85.3% and 93.3%, and by m-pcr, the positive detection rates were respectively 92.1%, 90.7%, 82.7%, 89.3% and 96.0%. the positive rates of five common pathogens of ordinary pcr and m-pcr were higher than those of bacterial culture (all p < 0.05). the m-pcr had merit for rapid detection compared with ordinary pcr. conclusion: compared with bacterial culture, ordinary pcr and m-pcr yield higher positive rates in identifying five common pathogens of vat and vap, meanwhile, it also demonstrated the tendency that m-pcr may save cost and labor power.

TI  == changing bacteriology of abdominal and surgical sepsis.
AB  == purpose of review: this review focuses on recent changes in epidemiological aspects of bacteria-induced intra-abdominal infections (iais), including the dominant pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and emerging resistance phenotypes. recent findings: enterobacteriaceae species, including escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, remain the major pathogens contributing to abdominal sepsis, although pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii have recently become common causes of hospital-acquired iais. the prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli, especially those that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls), has increased worldwide, although the distribution of those organisms varies from region to region. furthermore, recent changes in interpretive breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing recommended by the clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) have resulted in a marked increase in the reported rates of resistance among gram-negative bacilli to carbapenems, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. besides, routine detection and reporting of esbl phenotypes for clinical isolates have not been recommended after following new interpretive breakpoints. more studies are needed to investigate the impacts of these changes  on therapeutic strategies and epidemiological surveillance. in addition, pathogens carrying new delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (ndms), k. pneumoniae carbapenemases (kpcs), and other carbapenemases show extended resistance to currently available antibiotics and rapid transfer between species and countries. although some of these pathogens are still susceptible to tigecycline and colistin, rates of resistance to these two agents are rising. summary: abdominal  sepsis due to multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially esbl producers, and international and interspecies spreading of metallo-beta-lactamase raise key therapeutic problems.

TI  == in vitro characterization of multivalent adhesion molecule 7-based inhibition of  multidrug-resistant bacteria isolated from wounded military personnel.
AB  == treatment of wounded military personnel at military medical centers is often complicated by colonization and infection of wounds with pathogenic bacteria. these include nosocomially transmitted, often multidrug-resistant pathogens such  as acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. we analyzed the efficacy of multivalent adhesion molecule (mam) 7-based anti-adhesion treatment of host cells against aforementioned pathogens in a tissue culture infection model. herein, we observed that a correlation between  two important hallmarks of virulence, attachment and cytotoxicity, could serve as a useful predictor for the success of mam7-based inhibition against bacterial infections. initially, we characterized 20 patient isolates (five from each pathogen mentioned above) in terms of genotypic diversity, antimicrobial susceptibility and important hallmarks of pathogenicity (biofilm formation, attachment to and cytotoxicity toward cultured host cells). all isolates displayed a high degree of genotypic diversity, which was also reflected by large strain-to-strain variability in terms of biofilm formation, attachment and cytotoxicity within each group of pathogen. using non-pathogenic bacteria expressing mam7 or latex beads coated with recombinant mam7 for anti-adhesion treatment, we showed a decrease in cytotoxicity, indicating that mam7 has potential as a prophylactic agent to attenuate infection by multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens.

TI  == identification and characterization of an outer membrane receptor gene in acinetobacter baumannii required for utilization of desferricoprogen, rhodotorulic acid, and desferrioxamine b as xenosiderophores.
AB  == in this study, we found that acinetobacter baumannii utilized exogenously supplied desferricoprogen, rhodotorulic acid, and desferrioxamine b for growth under iron-limiting conditions. the ferric uptake regulator (fur) titration assay method was then successfully applied to select iron-regulated genes in a. baumannii genomic libraries. part of the nucleotide sequence homologous to escherichia coli, fhue, obtained from one of the positive clones allowed us to clone the entire gene, which was named fhue. the fhue gene had an amino acid sequence consistent with the n-terminal amino acid sequence of the 76-kda iron-repressible outer membrane proteins in a. baumannii. reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis demonstrated that fhue mrna is transcribed under iron-limiting conditions, consistent with the presence of a sequence homologous to the consensus fur box in the promoter region. disruption of fhue resulted in the loss of expression of the 76-kda protein. in addition, the double disruptant of fhue and basd, which encodes one of the biosynthetic genes for the cognate siderophore acinetobactin, was unable to grow in the presence of desferricoprogen, rhodotorulic acid or desferrioxamine b. however, growth of the double disruptant was restored by complementation with fhue, demonstrating that a. baumannii fhue functions as the receptor common to coprogen, ferric rhodotorulic acid and ferrioxamine b.

TI  == purification and characterization of oxa-23 from acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == although the existence of bla(oxa-23) is reported in various parts of the world,  the product of bla(oxa-23) gene, oxa-23, has not been purified and its kinetic properties are not known. in this study, oxa-23 of acinetobacter baumannii isolated from kocaeli university intensive care unit was characterized after purification using recombinant methods. preliminary results showed that conventional protein purification methods were not effective for purification of  oxa-23. therefore, oxa-23 was fused to maltose-binding protein of escherichia coli, the fused protein was expressed and purified to homogeneity. kinetic properties of the pure protein were then studied with substrates e.g., imipenem,  meropenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ampicilline, piperacillin, penicillin g, and nitrocefin. also clavulanic acid, tazobactam, and sulbactam concentrations that inhibit 50% of oxa-23 enzyme activity were calculated. modelling of oxa-23 revealed its ionic surface structure, conformation in the fused form and its topology allowing us to make predictions for oxa-23 substrate specificity.

TI  == ompa is the principal nonspecific slow porin of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter species show high levels of intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics. the major protein species in the outer membrane of acinetobacter baumannii does not belong to the high-permeability trimeric porin family, which includes escherichia coli ompf/ompc, and instead is a close homolog of e. coli ompa and pseudomonas aeruginosa oprf. we characterized the pore-forming function  of this ompa homolog, ompa(ab), by a reconstitution assay. ompa(ab) produced very low pore-forming activity, about 70-fold lower than that of ompf and an activity  similar to that of e. coli ompa and p. aeruginosa oprf. the pore size of the ompa(ab) channel was similar to that of oprf, i.e., about 2 nm in diameter. the low permeability of ompa(ab) is not due to the inactivation of this protein during purification, because the permeability of the whole a. baumannii outer membrane was also very low. furthermore, the outer membrane permeability to cephalothin and cephaloridine, measured in intact cells, was about 100-fold lower than that of e. coli k-12. the permeability of cephalothin and cephaloridine in a. baumannii was decreased 2- to 3-fold when the ompa(ab) gene was deleted. these results show that ompa(ab) is the major nonspecific channel in a. baumannii. the  low permeability of this porin, together with the presence of constitutive beta-lactamases and multidrug efflux pumps, such as adeabc and adeijk, appears to be essential for the high levels of intrinsic resistance to a number of antibiotics.

TI  == analysis of the air/water channels of gastrointestinal endoscopies as a risk factor for the transmission of microorganisms among patients.
AB  == background: for the effective reprocessing of gastrointestinal endoscopes, contaminants must be removed from the entire surface. however, these devices have long and narrow channels that can make this process difficult. methods: in this cross-sectional study, the staff assigned to reprocess gastroscopes and colonoscopes in 37 services located throughout brazil completed a questionnaire regarding reprocessing practices geared toward the channels in these devices. in  addition, samples from these air/water channels were collected for microbiological analysis. results: contamination was detected in 71.8% (28/39) of the samples obtained from the air/water channels of colonoscopes, and in 70% (42/60) of the samples from the air/water channels of gastroscopes. the median microbial load was 1,800 colony-forming units (cfu)/ml in the colonoscopes and 750 cfu/ml in the gastroscopes. the main microorganisms isolated from the air/water channels of gastroscopes were pseudomonas aeruginosa (26.4%), escherichia coli (18.9%), and acinetobacter baumannii (9.4%), and those isolated  from the colonoscopes included p aeruginosa (46.4%), a baumannii (14.3%), and klebsiella pneumoniae (10.7%), among others. the possible causes of the contamination of these devices included the failure to fill these channels with cleaning solution, lack of friction during cleansing, and inadequate rinsing. conclusion: the contamination of the air/water channels did in fact represent a risk for the transmission of microorganisms during gastrointestinal endoscopy exams, possibly related to the inadequate reprocessing of these channels.

AB  == objectives: the goal of this study was to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and the surrounding genetic structure of bla(ndm-1) in non-baumannii acinetobacter spp. in china. methods: non-baumannii acinetobacter spp. were collected from 28 provinces in china and were screened for the presence of bla(ndm-1) using pcr. the following four methods were used to classify the acinetobacter isolates: the vitek 2 system, 16s-23s rrna gene intergenic spacer sequencing, amplified rdna restriction analysis and partial rpob sequence analysis. an s1-pfge assay and southern blot hybridization were performed to determine the plasmid location of bla(ndm-1). the transferability of bla(ndm-1)-harbouring plasmids was confirmed by conjugation experiments and electrotransformation. the surrounding genetic structure of the bla(ndm-1) gene was analysed using a restriction endonuclease-based cloning approach and primer walking. results: among 726 non-baumannii acinetobacter spp., nine isolates collected from six different provinces and assigned to seven different acinetobacter spp. contained the bla(ndm-1) gene. none of these isolates was directly infectious to the patients or demonstrated an epidemiological importation from abroad. these bla(ndm-1) genes were located on plasmids that could be transferred to escherichia coli j53 by conjugation and acinetobacter baylyi adp1 by electrotransformation. seven of the nine strains shared a common genetic structure in which bla(ndm-1) was flanked by two copies of isaba125. conclusions: the clinical challenge posed by bla(ndm-1) is currently minimal in china; however, more attention should be devoted to monitoring the dissemination  of this gene due to its potential transferability via the isaba125-associated transposon.

TI  == api88 is a novel antibacterial designer peptide to treat systemic infections with multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens.
AB  == the emergence of multiple-drug-resistant (mdr) bacterial pathogens in hospitals (nosocomial infections) presents a global threat of growing importance, especially for gram-negative bacteria with extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) or the novel new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1) resistance. starting from the antibacterial peptide apidaecin 1b, we have optimized the sequence to treat systemic infections with the most threatening human pathogens,  such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii. the lead compound api88 enters bacteria without lytic effects at the membrane and inhibits chaperone dnak at the substrate binding domain with a k(d) of 5 mumol/l. the api88-dnak crystal structure revealed that api88 binds with a seven residue long sequence (pvyiprp), in two different modes. mice did not show any sign of toxicity when api88 was injected four times intraperitoneally at a dose of 40 mg/kg body weight (bw) within 24 h, whereas three injections of 1.25 mg/kg bw and 5 mg/kg bw were sufficient to rescue all animals in lethal sepsis models using pathogenic e. coli strains atcc 25922 and neumann, respectively. radioactive labeling showed that api88 enters all organs investigated including the brain and is cleared through both the liver and kidneys at similar rates. in conclusion, api88 is a novel, highly promising, 18-residue peptide lead compound with favorable in vitro and in vivo properties including a promising safety margin.

TI  == antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  == background: statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. in this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. methods: minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). results: it was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (mssa), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (vse), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to  rosuvastatin. on the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. conclusion: our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.

TI  == trends in aminoglycoside use and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative clinical isolates in us academic medical centers: implications for antimicrobial stewardship.
AB  == objective: to measure trends in aminoglycoside antibiotic use and gentamicin-resistant clinical isolates across a network of hospitals and compare  network-level relationships with those of individual hospitals. design: longitudinal observational investigation. setting: us academic medical centers. participants: adult inpatients. methods: adult aminoglycoside use was measured from 2002 or 2003 through 2009 in 29 hospitals. hospital-wide antibiograms assessed gentamicin resistance by proportions and incidence rates for pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. mixed-effects analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of changes in aminoglycoside use and changes in resistance rates and proportions. generalized estimating equations were used to assess the relationship between aminoglycoside use and resistance. results: mean aminoglycoside use declined by 41%, reflecting reduced gentamicin (p < .0001) and tobramycin (p < .005) use; amikacin use did not change. the rate and proportion of gentamicin-resistant p. aeruginosa decreased by 48% (p < .0001) and 31% (p < .0001), respectively. the rate and proportion of gentamicin-resistant e. coli increased by 166% and 124%, respectively (p < .0001), and they were related to increasing quinolone resistance in e. coli. resistance among k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii did not change. relationships between aminoglycoside use and resistance at the network level were highly variable at the individual hospital level. conclusions: mean aminoglycoside use declined in this network of us hospitals and was associated with significant and opposite changes in rates of resistance for some organisms and no change for others. at the individual hospital level, antibiograms appear to be an unreliable reflection of antibiotic use, at least for aminoglycosides.

TI  == evaluation of bactec plus aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles and bact/alert fan aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles for the detection of bacteremia in icu patients.
AB  == blood culture is the most valuable laboratory test for the diagnosis of bacteremia and sepsis. the bactec fx and bact/alert 3d automated blood culture systems are commonly used in korean health care facilities. a controlled clinical evaluation of the resin-containing bactec plus aerobic (ba) and anaerobic (bn), and the charcoal-containing fan aerobic (fa) and anaerobic (fn) bottles using blood from intensive care unit (icu) patients was designed. the performances of these 2 systems with media containing particle absorbing antimicrobial agents were evaluated using the culture positivity rate and time to detection (ttd). ttd was collected using data management systems, either the epicenter (bd diagnostic  systems) or the hospital laboratory information system. a total of 1539 four-bottle sets were collected from 270 patients in medical and surgical icus. blood culture samples included 1539 bottles each of ba, bn, fa, and fn, and yielded 113 (7.3%), 90 (5.8%), 104 (6.8%), and 80 (5.2%) positive bacterial or fungal isolates, respectively. there were significant differences between the resin-containing ba and bn samples in culture positivity and also between the charcoal-containing fa and fn samples, especially for escherichia coli (25/27 versus 17/27, p < 0.05) and acinetobacter baumannii (14/15 versus 7/15, p < 0.05). significantly shorter recovery time was observed in bactec plus aerobic bottles than in fan aerobic bottles (17.2 and 24.7 h, respectively) (p < 0.001).

TI  == lif reduces mics of antibiotics against clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == antibiotic resistance is an ever-growing problem yet the development of new antibiotics has slowed to a trickle, giving rise to the use of combination therapy to eradicate infections. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the combined inhibitory effect of lithium fluoride (lif) and commonly used antimicrobials on the growth of the following bacteria: enterococcus faecalis, staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, and streptococcus pneumoniae. the in vitro activities of ceftazidime, sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim, streptomycin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, alone or combined with lif were performed by microdilution method. mics were determined visually following 18-20 h of incubation at 37 degrees c. we observed reduced mics of antibiotics associated with lif ranging from two-fold to sixteen-fold. the strongest decreases of mics observed were for streptomycin and erythromycin associated with lif against acinetobacter baumannii and streptococcus pneumoniae. an eight-fold reduction was recorded for streptomycin against s. pneumoniae whereas an eight-fold and a sixteen-fold reduction were obtained for erythromycin against a. baumannii and s. pneumoniae. this suggests that lif exhibits a synergistic effect with a wide range of antibiotics and is indicative of its potential as an adjuvant in antibiotic therapy.

TI  == role of isaba1 and isaba125 in governing the expression of blaadc in clinically relevant acinetobacter baumannii strains resistant to cephalosporins.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a multi-resistant opportunistic nosocomial pathogen responsible for several outbreaks worldwide. it can cause several infections at various sites of the body. one of the main infections caused by this bacterium is ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients in intensive care units. treating these infections is becoming difficult because of the high resistance to antimicrobial agents. this study compared the expression of the chromosomally encoded bla(adc) gene in isolates having isaba1, isaba125 and no insertion upstream of the bla(adc) gene in a. baumannii clinical isolates. it showed that the expression of bla(adc) was six times greater when isaba125 was present upstream of the gene in comparison with the constitutively expressed bla(adc) gene with no insertion present upstream. the study indicated that isaba125 has better promoters than isaba1 and this is responsible for the overexpression of the bla(adc) gene as they share considerable homology to the well-established escherichia coli promoters. the -10 box of isaba125 formed a fusion promoter with the -35 box of the bla(adc) gene causing the bla(adc) gene to be significantly overexpressed. the ability to upregulate the expression of bla(adc) with the assistance of different insertion elements such as isaba1 and isaba125 has become an important factor in a. baumannii resistance to cephalosporins.

TI  == the risk factors for early infection in adult living donor liver transplantation  recipients.
AB  == objective: the high rate of early major infections in liver transplantation recipients is due to their compromised immune-system. we examined the risk factors of early major infection in living donor liver transplantation (ldlt). materials and methods: from january 2004 to december 2010, 242 patients undergoing ldlt were enrolled in the prospective cohort. we prospectively collected their clinical and demographic variables, operative details, and posttransplant complications. result: one hundred thirty-nine patients (57.7%) experienced 252 episodes of early infection posttransplantation: bloodstream septicemia (n = 46, 18.3%), urinary tract (n = 34; 14.1%), pneumonia (n = 64; 25.4%), peritonitis (n = 62; 25.7%), and catheter related (n = 46; 19%). the most frequent gram-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 52; 16.9%), followed by staphylococcus aureus (n = 32; 10.4%). the most common gram-negative bacteria were escherichia coli (n = 27; 8.8%); acinetobacter baumannii (n = 29; 9.4%), pseudomonas aureos (n = 18; 5.8%), and sternotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 18; 5.8%). upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for early major infection were a high creatinine level (odds ratio = 1.481), a long anhepatic arterial phase (1.01), a  reoperation (6.417), young age (1.040), and non-hepatocellular carcinoma recipient (2.141). conclusion: early major infection after ldlt was high with gram-positive bacteria, the most common etiologies. prolonged anhepatic arterial  phase, renal insufficiency, and reoperation were risk factors for an early major  infection.

TI  == stress response and virulence functions of the acinetobacter baumannii nfua fe-s  scaffold protein.
AB  == to successfully establish an infection, acinetobacter baumannii must overcome the iron starvation and oxidative stress imposed by the human host. although previous studies have shown that atcc 19606(t) cells acquire iron via the acinetobactin-mediated siderophore system, little is known about intracellular iron metabolism and its relation to oxidative stress in this pathogen. screening  of an insertion library resulted in the isolation of the atcc 19606(t) derivative 1644, which was unable to grow in iron-chelated media. rescue cloning and dna sequencing showed that the insertion inactivated a gene coding for an nfua fe-s cluster protein ortholog, without any effect on the expression of the acinetobactin system. the nfua mutant was also more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide than the parental strain. the iron chelation- and oxidative-stress-deficient responses of this mutant were corrected when complemented with either the atcc 19606(t) parental allele or the escherichia coli mg1655 nfua ortholog. furthermore, electron paramagnetic resonance (epr) and inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (icp-aes) analyses showed that the atcc 19606(t) nfua ortholog has iron-binding properties compatible with  the formation of [fe-s] cluster protein. ex vivo and in vivo assays using human epithelial cells and galleria mellonella, respectively, showed that nfua is critical for bacterial growth independent of their capacity to acquire iron or the presence of excess of free iron. taken together, these observations indicate  that the a. baumannii nfua ortholog plays a role in intracellular iron utilization and protection from oxidative-stress responses that this pathogen could encounter during the infection of the human host.

TI  == persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  == objective: fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. the aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. materials and methods: bacterial and  fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. one isolate each of candida albicans, candida tropicalis, candida krusei, candida glabrata, candida parapsilosis, geotrichum candidum, aspergillus  fumigatus, cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant enterococcus faecium (vre, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) positive escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (ibl) positive pseudomonas aeruginosa, ibl-positive acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. the survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. results: the median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi  were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. among the bacterial species tested, e. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. for the fungal isolates, it was observed that c. tropicalis and c. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. conclusion: this survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. these findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.

TI  == a comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed uv radiation device.
AB  == daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. however, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. this study evaluated a newly  developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (uv) radiation device for its bactericidal  activity in comparison with continuous uv-c, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. pseudomonas aeruginosa, multidrug-resistant p. aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, amikacin and ciprofloxacin-resistant a. baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s. aureus and bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed uv or continuous uv-c. pulsed uv and continuous uv-c required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2log growth inhibition of all the species. the use of pulsed uv in daily disinfection  of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. the new portable pulsed uv radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.

TI  == the use of multiplex real-time pcr improves the detection of the bacterial etiology of community acquired pneumonia.
AB  == community-acquired pneumonia (cap) is still a major cause of morbidity and mortality especially to children and compromised hosts, such as the old and those with underlying chronic diseases. knowledge of pathogens causing cap constitutes  the basis for selection of antimicrobial treatment. previous data have shown that etiological agents can be identified in only up to 50% of patients, but this figure can be improved by using polymerase chain reaction (pcr). this study was designed to evaluate multiplex real-time pcr as a method for rapid differential detection of five bacterial causes of cap (streptococcus pneumoniae, burkholderia pseudomallei and atypical bacterial pathogens namely mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydophila pneumoniae and legionella pneumophila) in cap patients attending hospital tengku ampuan afzan (htaa)/ kuantan, pahang, malaysia. two previously developed multiplex real-time pcr assays, duplex for the differential detection of s. pneumoniae and b. pseudomallei and triplex for the atypical bacterial pathogens, were used to detect a bacterial cause of cap in blood and respiratory  samples. thus, 46 blood and 45 respiratory samples collected from 46 adult cap patients admitted to htaa were analysed by multiplex real-time pcr assays and conventional methods. the microbial etiology of cap could be established for 39.1% (18/46) of cap patients by conventional methods and this was increased to 65.2% (30/46) with the additional use of real-time pcr. the most frequently detected pathogens were s. pneumoniae (21.7% - all by pcr alone), klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%), b. pseudomallei (13% - 83% of them positive by pcr alone and  17% by both culture and pcr), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.5%), m. pneumoniae (6.5%  - all by serology), c. pneumoniae (4.3% - all positive by both pcr and serology), l. pneumophila (2.1% - all by pcr alone), escherichia coli (4.3%). haemophilus infuenzae, acinetobacter lwoffii and acinetobacter baumannii were detected by conventional methods (2.1% for each).

AB  == background: environmental surfaces in health care settings are often contaminated by microorganisms, and biofilms can develop on the surfaces in these settings. steam vapor technology is of potential use for disinfection of biofilms on the environmental surfaces. methods: we tested the disinfection efficacy of a thermal-accelerated nanocrystal sanitation (tancs)-equipped steam vapor technology against biofilms through disinfecting biofilms developed by 4 bacterial strains-escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus-on an identical test surface (ie, polycarbonate) and biofilms developed by e coli on 4 different test surfaces: polycarbonate, rubber, stainless steel, and ceramics. results: our data show that a 3-second steam treatment rapidly killed each biofilm tested (>99.95 % killing efficiency). for biofilms developed on different surfaces, 3-second steam treatment achieved 99.95% killing of e coli biofilms developed on different surfaces. compared with chemical disinfection, steam treatment for <1 second a similar level of biofilm disinfection as provided by incubation with 10-ppm sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for 10-20 minutes of contact time. conclusions: our  data suggest that the tancs-equipped steam vapor disinfection is an emerging and  potentially useful technology for disinfecting biofilms on environmental surfaces.

TI  == [investigation and analysis of nosocomial infection in neonates].
AB  == objective: to investigate the incidence of nosocomial infections of newborn infants in neonates and to explore the risk factors and strategies of infection control. methods: there were 433 confirmed cases of nosocomial infection in the neonatal ward of the authors' hospital from january 2007 to december 2009. their  data of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, results of etiological examinations and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively analyzed. results: during the study, the number of hospitalizations were 6437. nosocomial infection  occurred in 433 patients 513 times. the overall nosocomial infection rate was 6.82%. the overall hospitalization days were 73 663 and nosocomial infection patient-day rates were 6.96 per thousand. the vap infection rate was 28.7 per thousand. the crbsi rate was 3.5 per thousand. gestational age (or = 1.049), mechanical ventilation (or = 1.810), umbilical vein catheter (or = 1.106), hospitalization days (or = 1.081), premature rupture of membrane (or = 1.433) were the risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection. there were 197 (38.4%) cases of pneumonia, which was the most common nosocomial infection in neonatal ward. there were 129 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (vap), which accounts for 65.5% of pneumonia and 24.4% of cases treated with ventilator. the next was sepsis, 124 cases (24.2%) and 64 cases of diarrheal disease (12.7%). one hundred and eighty two (54.4%) strains of isolates were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. the predominant pathogens of gram-negative bacteria were klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), followed by acinetobacter baumannii (8.1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.8%) and escherichia coli (4.8%). the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 91.4% and 75%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to cephalosporins. the rate of resistance to imipenem of klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1.5%, 11.1% and 41.7%. the isolation rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococcus were 28.6% and 95.5%. conclusion: it is important to identify the high risk factors for nosocomial infections in newborn infants. to shorten time for mechanical ventilation and hospitalization days, removal of the central venous catheter as early as possible would be conducive to reducing the morbidity of nosocomial infection. the main pathogens were gram-negative bacteria. the multidrug resistance of enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters is serious.

TI  == identification and characterization of an indigo-producing oxygenase involved in  indole 3-acetic acid utilization by acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii harbours a gene cluster similar to the iac locus of pseudomonas putida 1290, which can catabolize the plant hormone indole 3-acetic acid (iaa) as an energy source. however, there has been no evidence showing that  iaa can be utilized by a. baumannii. this study showed that a. baumannii can grow in m9 minimal medium containing iaa as the sole carbon source. a mutagenesis study indicated that iaca, encoded in the iac locus of a. baumannii, is involved  in the catabolism of iaa. as shown by western blotting analysis, the iaca protein was detected in a. baumannii grown in m9 minimal medium with iaa but not with pyruvate, suggesting that the expression of iaca is regulated by the presence of  iaa. in vitro studies have shown that iaca can oxidize indole, an iaa-like molecule, converting it to indoxyl, which spontaneously dimerises to form indigo. in this study, we show that the crude extracts from either wild-type a. baumannii or escherichia coli overexpressing iaca can oxidize iaa. these results imply that the iac gene cluster of a. baumannii is involved in iaa degradation and that the  iaca gene is upregulated when cells encounter iaa in their native environments.

AB  == the carbapenemase ndm-1 has been identified recently in enterobacteriaceae and acinetobacter baumannii as a source of multidrug resistance, including resistance to carbapenems. by analyzing the immediate genetic environment of the bla(ndm-1)  carbapenemase gene among a series of ndm-1-producing enterobacterial isolates, a  novel gene (ble(mbl), for ble gene associated with the metallo-beta-lactamase ndm-1) was identified. the ble(mbl) gene encodes a novel bleomycin resistance protein (brp), named brp(mbl), that shares weak similarities with known brps (less than 60% amino acid identity). the expression of brp(mbl) conferred resistance to bleomycin and to bleomycin-like molecules in enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the bla(ndm-1) and ble(mbl) genes were coexpressed under the control of the same promoter, located upstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene and at the  extremity of the insertion sequence isaba125. most of the ndm producers possessed the ble(mbl) gene. although brp(mbl) did not modify the growth or death rates of  escherichia coli under experimental conditions, it suppressed the mutation rate of hypermutable e. coli and therefore may stabilize the plasmid-borne bla(ndm-1)  gene. this study suggests that the emerging carbapenemase ndm-1 is selected by bleomycin-like molecules, and that brp(mbl) producers (and consequently ndm producers) are better suited to various environments.

TI  == assessing the pharmacodynamic profile of intravenous antibiotics against prevalent gram-negative organisms collected in colombia.
AB  == objectives: this study was designed to simulate standard and optimized dosing regimens for intravenous antibiotics against contemporary populations of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa using mic distribution data to determine which of the tested carbapenem regimens provided the greatest opportunity for obtaining maximal pharmacodynamic (pd) activity. methods: the isolates studied were obtained from the compact-colombia surveillance program conducted between february and november 2009. antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted by broth microdilution method according to the clsi guidelines. doripenem, imipenem-cilastatin, and meropenem, were the modeled antibiotics. a 5,000 patient monte carlo simulation was performed for each regimen and pd targets were defined as free drug concentrations above the mic for at least 40% of the dosing interval. results: all carbapenem regimens obtained optimal exposures against e. coli, unlike the other enterobacteriaceae tested. against p. aeruginosa, only a prolonged infusion of doripenem exceeded the 90% cumulative fraction of response (cfr) threshold. worrisomely, no regimens for any of the drugs tested obtained optimal cfr against a. baumannii. for p. aeruginosa intensive care unit (icu) isolates, cfr was approximately 20% lower for isolates collected in the respiratory tract compared  with bloodstream or intra-abdominal for imipenem and meropenem. noteworthy, all doripenem and meropenem regimens achieved greater than 90% cfr against bloodstream and respiratory isolates of k. pneumoniae. conclusions: our data suggests that higher dosing and prolonged infusion of doripenem or meropenem may  be suitable for empirically treating icu p. aeruginosa, while none of the carbapenems achieved optimal cumulative fraction of response against a. baumannii. standard dosing regimens of all the carbapenems tested achieved optimal cfr against e. coli isolates, but higher carbapenem dosages might be required for empiric treatment of k. pneumoniae, particularly from an intra-abdominal source. non-standard dosage regimens studied in this modeling should be proven effective in prospective clinical trials.

TI  == trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan study,  2006 to 2010.
AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae (prsp) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (vre) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 1,141), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in taiwan. mics of tigecycline were determined following the  criteria of the u.s. food and drug administration (fda) and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast-2011). among drug-resistant gram-positive pathogens, all of the prsp isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (mic(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one mrsa isolate (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three vre isolates (mic(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. among the gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for esbl-producing e. coli (mic(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae (mic(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by fda criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by eucast-2011 criteria. the susceptibility rate for a. baumannii (mic(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. a bimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible a. baumannii isolates, and a  unimodal mic distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible a. baumannii  isolates. in taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of a. baumannii.

TI  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infections after liver transplantation - spectrum and risk factors.
AB  == objectives: gram-negative bacilli infections, especially multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli infections, are the leading cause of high mortality after liver transplantation. this study sought to investigate the type of infection, infection rate, pathogenic spectrum, antibiotic-resistance profile, risk factors, and epidemiology of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacterial infection. methods: a retrospective cohort study was conducted and data of 217 liver transplant patients receiving cadaveric livers between january 2007 and april 2010 were analyzed. antibiotic susceptibility was determined by minimum inhibitory concentration test. extended-spectrum and metallo-beta-lactamase assays were used to analyze beta-lactamase-produced isolates, and repetitive-sequence polymerase chain reaction was used to differentiate bacterium subspecies. results: sixty-seven isolates of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria were isolated from 66 infected liver transplant patients. stenotrophomonas maltophilia (100%, 8/8), klebsiella pneumoniae (61.5%, 8/13), enterobacter cloacae (75%, 3/4) and escherichia coli (81.3%, 13/16) were the most common extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacilli. metallo-beta-lactamase expressing isolates were identified as s. maltophilia (100%, 8/8), pseudomonas aeruginosa (83.3%, 5/6), acinetobacter baumannii (95%, 19/20). significant independent risk factors for multidrug-resistant gram-negative infection were extended use of pre-transplant broad-spectrum antibiotics (or 9.027, p=0.001) and prolonged (>==72h) endotracheal intubation (or 3.537, p=0.033). conclusions: to reduce the risk of acquiring mdr gram-negative bacillus infections after liver transplant, control measures are required to limit the use of prophylactic antibiotic in preventing infection during liver transplant and to shorten endotracheal intubation time.

TI  == activity of polymyxin b and the novel polymyxin analogue cb-182,804 against contemporary gram-negative pathogens in new york city.
AB  == multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa have become common in many regions, often requiring therapy with colistin or polymyxin b. an increase in resistance to these agents would render many infections untreatable. we tested the activity of polymyxin b and the novel polymyxin analogue cb-182,804 against over 5,000 recent gram-negative clinical isolates from new york city, a region with a high prevalence of multiresistant strains. over 96% of escherichia coli, k. pneumoniae, a. baumannii, and p. aeruginosa were susceptible to polymyxin b; only 76% of enterobacter spp. was susceptible. the mics of cb-182,804 were generally two-fold higher than polymyxin b and cross-resistance was observed. the addition  of rifampin resulted in synergistic inhibition and bactericidal activity in time  kill studies, and restored activity against all polymyxin-resistant strains. the  synergistic effect of the combination with rifampin was most pronounced against a. baumannii strains, and was slightly greater with cb-182,804 than with polymyxin b against k. pneumoniae and enterobacter spp. despite considerable usage of polymyxin b and colistin in this region, polymyxin b retains excellent activity against most gram-negative isolates. cb-182,804 shows similar activity,  particularly when combined with rifampin. the clinical utility of cb-182,804 remains to be determined.

TI  == the antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  == the antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different ph values. consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of ph on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (sa) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (scmc) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa, mdr vibrio sp, mdr stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (esbl) producing salmonella sp, esbl producing klebsiella pneumoniae, esbl producing proteus mirabilis, esbl producing escherichia coli and mdr acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (czoi)]. the mean overall czoi for  the gram-positive isolates at a ph of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. a mean czoi of 5 mm was recorded for the scmc dressing, which was slightly higher,  at 5.4 mm for the sa dressing. at a ph of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed  a similar activity. however, at a ph of 8.5 the mean czoi of the scmc dressing was found to be significantly (p < 0.05) higher than the sa dressing for a select number of isolates. the mean overall czoi for the gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the gram-positive bacteria. susceptibility to  silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. interestingly, when ph was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (p < 0.05). overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all ph ranges. in addition, the study showed that the performance  of both dressings apparently increased when ph became more acidic. the findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role ph plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.

TI  == identification of new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase gene (ndm-1) from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter junii in china.
AB  == new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (ndm-1) is a novel type of metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl) responsible for bacterial resistance to beta-lactam  antibiotics. acinetobacter junii was previously shown to possess a mbl phenotype; however, the genes responsible for this phenotype were not identified. in this study, we reported the identification of ndm-1 gene in a clinical isolate of a. junii from a child patient in china, which was resistant to all beta-lactams except aztreonam but sensitive to aminoglycosides and quinolones. the cloned ndm-1 gene contained an open reading frame of 813 bp and had a nucleotide sequence 99.9% identical (812/813) to reported ndm-1 genes carried by acinetobacter baumannii , enterococcus faecium , escherichia coli , and klebsiella pneumoniae . recombinant ndm-1 protein was successfully expressed in e. coli bl21, and antibiotic sensitivities of the ndm-1-producing e. coli were largely similar to the a. junii 1454 isolate. the findings of this study raise attention to the emergence and spread of ndm-1-carrying bacteria in china.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from hypericum spp.
AB  == biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as staphylococcus spp., escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. new drugs are needed to  combat these pathogens. hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. however, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. the investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species hypericum densiflorum, hypericum ellipticum, hypericum prolificum, and hypericum punctatum  as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. assays were conducted against staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) ranging from 1.95 microg/ml to 7.81 microg/ml. four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain gram-positive strains at sub-mic concentrations.

AB  == the tigecycline in vitro surveillance in taiwan (tist) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. this study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014  isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (vre; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli (n = 602), esbl-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in taiwan. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended u.s. food and drug administration (fda) criteria and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria. the mic(90) values of tigecycline against mrsa, vre, esbl-producing e. coli, esbl-producing k. pneumoniae, and a. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. the total error rates between the two methods using the fda criteria were high: 38.4% for esbl-producing k. pneumoniae and 33.8% for a. baumannii. using the eucast criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for a. baumannii isolates. the total error rates between these two methods were <5% for mrsa, vre, and esbl-producing e. coli. for routine susceptibility testing of esbl-producing  k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.

TI  == diverse responses to uv light exposure in acinetobacter include the capacity for  dna damage-induced mutagenesis in the opportunistic pathogens acinetobacter baumannii and acinetobacter ursingii.
AB  == error-prone and error-free dna damage repair responses that are induced in most bacteria after exposure to various chemicals, antibiotics or radiation sources were surveyed across the genus acinetobacter. the error-prone sos mutagenesis response occurs when dna damage induces a cell's umudc- or dinp-encoded error-prone polymerases. the model strain acinetobacter baylyi adp1 possesses an  unusual, regulatory umud allele (umudab) with an extended 5' region and only incomplete fragments of umuc. diverse acinetobacter species were investigated for the presence of umudc and their ability to conduct uv-induced mutagenesis. unlike adp1, most acinetobacter strains possessed multiple umudc loci containing either  umudab or a umud allele resembling that of escherichia coli. the nearly omnipresent umudab allele was the ancestral umud in acinetobacter, with horizontal gene transfer accounting for over half of the umudc operons. despite multiple umud(ab)c operons in many strains, only three species conducted uv-induced mutagenesis: acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter ursingii and acinetobacter beijerinckii. the type of umudc locus or mutagenesis phenotype a strain possessed was not correlated with its error-free response of survival after uv exposure, but similar diversity was apparent. the survival of 30 acinetobacter strains after uv treatment ranged over five orders of magnitude, with the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-a. baumannii (acb) complex and haemolytic strains having lower survival than non-acb or non-haemolytic strains. these observations demonstrate that a genus can possess a range of dna damage response  mechanisms, and suggest that dna damage-induced mutation could be an important part of the evolution of the emerging pathogens a. baumannii and a. ursingii.

AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate bacterial antibiotic resistance in seawater  from four beaches in algiers. the most significant resistance rates were observed for amoxicillin and ticarcillin, whereas they were relatively low for ceftazidime, cefotaxime and imipenem. according to sampling sites, the highest resistance rates were recorded for 2 sites subjected to chemical and microbiological inputs (amoxicillin, 43% and 52%; ticarcillin, 19.6% and 47.7%),  and for 2 sites relatively preserved from anthropogenic influence, resistance rates were lowest (amoxicillin, 1.5% and 16%; ticarcillin, 0.8% and 2.6%). thirty-four bacteria resistant to imipenem (n=14) or cefotaxime (n=20) were identified as pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=15), pseudomonas fluorescens (7), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4), burkholderia cepacia (2), bordetella sp. (1), pantoea sp. (1), acinetobacter baumannii (1), chryseomonas luteola (1), ochrobactrum anthropi (1) and escherichia coli (1). screening for extended spectrum beta-lactamase showed the presence of ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase in the e.  coli isolate, and the encoding gene was transferable in association with the inci1 plasmid of about 50 kbp. insertion sequence isecp1b was located upstream of the ctx-m-15 gene. this work showed a significant level of resistance to antibiotics, mainly among environmental saprophytic bacteria. transmissible ctx-m-15 was detected in e. coli; this may mean that contamination of the environment by resistant bacteria may cause the spread of resistance genes.

AB  == the latest threat of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria corresponds to the emergence of carbapenemase ndm-1 (new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase) producers, mostly in enterobacteriacae. five bla(ndm) (-1) -positive plasmids of  different incompatibility groups (incl/m, fii, a/c and two untypeable plasmids) from clinical enterobacteriaceae were evaluated for conjugation properties and host specificity. successful conjugative transfers were obtained using all tested enterobacterial species as recipients (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium and proteus mirabilis) and all plasmid types. conjugation  frequencies varied from 1 x 10(-4) to 6 x 10(-8) transconjugants per donor. higher conjugation rates were obtained for two plasmids at 30 degrees c compared  with that observed at 25 and 37 degrees c. carbapenems used as selector did not lead to higher conjugation frequencies. none of the five plasmids was transferable to acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa by conjugation. this work underlines how efficient the spread of the carbapenemase bla(ndm) (-1)  gene could be among enterobacteriaceae.

AB  == the objective of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of avibactam (formerly nxl104) in combination with imipenem, cefepime or ceftazidime against gram-negative bacteria. bacterial isolates included: pseudomonas aeruginosa harbouring per-1 beta-lactamase (n=14); acinetobacter baumannii harbouring per-1, oxa-51 and oxa-58 (n=20); carbapenem-non-susceptible  klebsiella pneumoniae (n=25) and escherichia coli (n=1) harbouring oxa-48; carbapenem-non-susceptible e. coli (n=1) harbouring both imp-1 metallo-beta-lactamase and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl); carbapenem-non-susceptible serratia marcescens (n=1); and carbapenem-susceptible  e. coli (n=20) and k. pneumoniae isolates (n=12) with ctx-m-15 esbl. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were determined in combination with 4 mg/l avibactam by the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) method on mueller-hinton agar. imipenem/avibactam and  ceftazidime/avibactam displayed limited potency against a. baumannii isolates, whereas cefepime/avibactam and ceftazidime/avibactam were active against p. aeruginosa. klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with oxa-48 beta-lactamase were resistant to imipenem [mic for 90% of the organisms (mic(90)) >/=4 mg/l]. mic(90) values for the combination of avibactam 4 mg/l with imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime were in the susceptible range for all strains (mic(90)</=0.5mg/l). all e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with ctx-m-15 beta-lactamase were inhibited at </=1 mg/l for combinations with avibactam and 100% were susceptible  by clsi breakpoint criteria to imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime. in conclusion, combinations of imipenem, cefepime and ceftazidime with avibactam may present a promising therapeutic strategy to treat infections due to k. pneumoniae with oxa-48 enzyme as well as k. pneumoniae and e. coli with ctx-m-15 enzyme.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance pattern for gram-negative uropathogens isolated from hospitalised patients and outpatients in cartagena, 2005-2008].
AB  == objective: determining the microbial aetiology spectrum and antibiotic resistance pattern of uropathogens causing urinary tract infections in hospitalised patients and outpatients. methods: a descriptive study was carried out between february 2005 and november 2008 at the san buenaventura university's clinical laboratory in cartagena. antibiotic sensitivity was determined by the kirby bauer method. results: out of the total specimens (1,384) analysed over the four-year study period, 455 of the urine samples (32.9 %) were culture positive, most (81.4 %) having come from females. the bacterium isolated most frequently was escherichia  coli (60.1 %) followed by klebsiella pneumoniae (6.9 %), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6.6 %), proteus mirabilis (5.4 %) and acinetobacter baumannii (1.4 %). the gram-negative isolates displayed a high level of resistance to ampicillin (range  84.3100 %), amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (range 66.580 %) and ciprofloxacin (range 4057.9 %). conclusion: gram-negative bacteria were responsible for urinary tract  infections in the patients involved in this study. the most commonly isolated bacteria were e. coli. empirical administration of a third-generation cephalosporin for initial treatment of urinary tract infections in this population appears prudent from the perspective of antimicrobial susceptibility.

TI  == clinical predictors of pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia in patients admitted to the ed.
AB  == the identification of clinical characteristics that could identify patients at high risk for pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii bacteremia would  aid clinicians in the appropriate management of these life-threatening conditions, especially in patients admitted to the emergency department (ed) with community-onset infections. to determine clinical risk factors for p. aeruginosa  or a. baumannii bacteremia in patients with community-onset gram-negative bacteremia (gnb), a post hoc analysis of a nationwide bacteremia surveillance database including patients with microbiologically documented gnb was performed.  ninety-six patients with p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia were compared with 1230 patients with escherichia coli or klebsiella pneumoniae bacteremia. a solid tumor or hematologic malignancy was more likely to be associated with p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia, whereas concurrent neurologic disease was  less frequently seen. in regards to the site of infection, pneumonia was more common in p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia, whereas a urinary tract infection was less frequently seen. factors associated with p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia in multivariate analysis included pneumonia (odds ratio [or], 3.60; 95% confidence interval [ci], 1.86-6.99), hematologic malignancy (or, 2.71; 95% ci, 1.26-5.84), male sex (or, 2.17; 95% ci, 1.31-3.58), solid tumor (or, 1.89; 95% ci, 1.15-3.12), and health-care-associated infection (or, 1.88; 95% ci, 1.48-2.41). our data suggest that an initial empirical antimicrobial coverage of p. aeruginosa or a. baumannii bacteremia should be seriously considered in patients with pneumonia, a hematologic malignancy, solid tumor, or  health-care-associated infection, when gnb is suspected, even in community-onset  infections.

TI  == genetic characterization of an extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinase with hydrolysing activity against fourth-generation cephalosporins in a clinical isolate of enterobacter aerogenes selected in vivo.
AB  == background: extended-spectrum ampc cephalosporinases (esacs) have been reported in enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. here,  we characterize a new ampc variant presenting a broadened substrate activity towards fourth-generation cephalosporins, selected in vivo following cefepime treatment for enterobacter aerogenes. methods: two consecutive clonally related isolates of e. aerogenes were evaluated. screening for esac production was performed using plates containing 200 mg/l cloxacillin. mics were determined by microdilution (clsi guidelines). bla(ampc) genes were cloned into a pcr-blunt ii-topo vector and expressed in escherichia coli. the ampc genes were cloned into vector pgex-6p-1 for protein purification. results: isolate ea595 was resistant to two fourth-generation cephalosporins, cefepime and cefpirome; using plates containing cloxacillin, susceptibility to ceftazidime and cefepime was restored,  suggesting overproduction of the esac beta-lactamase. sequencing identified a new ampc beta-lactamase variant presenting one amino acid substitution, val291gly, inside the h-10 helix. recombinant plasmids harbouring this esac beta-lactamase conferred a broadened resistance profile to cefepime and cefpirome, with resistance levels increasing from 16- to 32-fold in e. coli. ampc-ea595 hydrolysed ceftazidime, cefepime and cefpirome at high levels, presenting a lower k(m) and enabling us to classify the enzyme as an esac. homology modelling suggested that the size of the active site could have increased. conclusions: we  characterized an esac beta-lactamase selected in vivo and conferring a high level of resistance to fourth-generation cephalosporins in e. aerogenes. the broadened  spectrum was caused by a new modification to the h-10 helix, which modified the active site.

TI  == urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after liver transplantation: etiologic agents and their susceptibility.
AB  == background: we performed an analysis of etiologic agents for urinary tract infections in the early posttransplant period after orthotopic liver transplantation (olt) in adult recipients. patients and methods: the study covered the first 4 weeks after olt of 190 patients from september 2001 to the end of 2007. immunosuppression consisted of steroids and tacrolimus. antimicrobial prophylaxis was piperacillin/tazobactam, fluconazole, and sbd. urine samples were cultured to identify microorganisms in accord with standard microbiological procedures and to test susceptibility using clinical laboratory and standards institute guidelines. results: urine specimens (n=539) examined from 185 recipients (97.4%) showed 210 microbial strains. the most common were gram-negative (n=131; 62.4%) with predominance of escherichia coli (28.2%), enterobacter cloacae (19.1%), and acinetobacter baumannii (11.4%). extended-spectrum beta- lactamases (esbl(+)) strains were isolated in 38.5% of cases. gram-positive bacteria comprised 28.6% (n=60): the most common strains were enterococci (85% including hlar 80.4% and vre 17.6%] and staphylococci 11.8% [mrsa/mrcns; 100%]. there were 19 (9%) fungal strains. conclusions: in general, the identification in urine samples of multi-drug-resistant bacterial and fungal  strains in patients after olt such as esbl(+) 38.5%; hlar 80.4%; vre 17.6%; and mrsa/mrcns 100% requires better infection control.

TI  == efficacy and toxicity of the antimicrobial peptide m33 produced with different counter-ions.
AB  == the tetra-branched peptide m33 (pini et al. in faseb j 24:1015-1022, 2010) is under evaluation in animal models for its activity as antimicrobial agent in lung infections and sepsis. the preclinical development of a new drug requires medium-scale manufacture for tests of efficacy, biodistribution, pharmacokinetics and toxicity. in order to produce the most suitable peptide form for these purposes, we evaluated the behaviour of the peptide m33 obtained with different counter-ions. we compared activity and toxicity in vitro and in vivo of the peptide m33 produced as trifluoroacetate salt (tfacetate) and as acetate salt. the two forms did not differ substantially in terms of efficacy in vitro or in vivo but showed different toxicities for human cells and in animals. m33-tfacetate proved to be 5-30% more toxic than m33-acetate for cells derived from normal bronchi and cells carrying deltaf508 mutation in the cftr gene, the most frequent variant in cystic fibrosis. m33-tfacetate produced manifest signs of in vivo toxicity immediately after administration, whereas m33-acetate only generated mild signs, which disappeared within a few hours. the peptide m33-acetate proved more suitable for the development of a new drug, and was therefore chosen for further characterization.

TI  == mechanism of anchoring of ompa protein to the cell wall peptidoglycan of the gram-negative bacterial outer membrane.
AB  == the outer membrane protein a (ompa) plays important roles in anchoring of the outer membrane to the bacterial cell wall. the c-terminal periplasmic domain of ompa (ompa-like domain) associates with the peptidoglycan (pgn) layer noncovalently. however, there is a paucity of information on the structural aspects of the mechanism of pgn recognition by ompa-like domains. to elucidate this molecular recognition process, we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of an ompa-like domain from acinetobacter baumannii bound to diaminopimelate (dap), a unique bacterial amino acid from the pgn. the structure  clearly illustrates that two absolutely conserved asp271 and arg286 residues are  the key to the binding to dap of pgn. identification of dap as the central anchoring site of pgn to ompa is further supported by isothermal titration calorimetry and a pulldown assay with pgn. an nmr-based computational model for complexation between the pgn and ompa emerged, and this model is validated by determining the crystal structure in complex with a synthetic pgn fragment. these structural data provide a detailed glimpse of how the anchoring of ompa to the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria takes place in a dap-dependent manner.

TI  == prevention of infections associated with combat-related extremity injuries.
AB  == during combat operations, extremities continue to be the most common sites of injury with associated high rates of infectious complications. overall, approximately 15% of patients with extremity injuries develop osteomyelitis, and  approximately 17% of those infections relapse or recur. the bacteria infecting these wounds have included multidrug-resistant bacteria such as acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella species and escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus. the goals of extremity injury care are to prevent infection, promote fracture healing, and restore function. in this review, we use a systematic assessment of military and civilian extremity trauma data to provide evidence-based recommendations for the varying management strategies to care for  combat-related extremity injuries to decrease infection rates. we emphasize postinjury antimicrobial therapy, debridement and irrigation, and surgical wound  management including addressing ongoing areas of controversy and needed research. in addition, we address adjuvants that are increasingly being examined, including local antimicrobial therapy, flap closure, oxygen therapy, negative pressure wound therapy, and wound effluent characterization. this evidence-based medicine  review was produced to support the guidelines for the prevention of infections associated with combat-related injuries: 2011 update contained in this supplement of journal of trauma.

AB  == incidence of nosocomial infections and antibiotics resistance in intensive care units is increasing worldwide. blood-stream infections of gram-negative non-fermentive bacteria are associated with higher mortality. aim and methods: the aim of this study was to compare the antibiotic sensitivity of nosocomial blood-stream infections between years 2008-2010. results: there was no difference in the sensitivity of methycillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli infections between the two years examined. antibiotic resistance of acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas infections showed a marked increase in 2010 when compared to that found in 2008: there was no multiresistant acinetobacter infection in samples obtained in 2008, but all these infections were found to be  sensitive only to colistin in samples investigated in 2010. sensitivity of pseudomonas infections to carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam decreased significantly during this time. in addition, the authors found that the mortality of multiresistant gram-negative blood-stream infections was higher compared to that caused by non-multiresistant bacteria. conclusions: these results emphasize  the importance of infection control, adequate dosing and timing of antibiotics, and an appropriate number of nurses in intensive care unit.

AB  == the emergence of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, in particular pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae, has necessitated the search for alternative therapy by either introducing new agents or renewing interest in old agents. this study compares the in vitro activity of tigecycline (tig), recently introduced to egyptian market, to other potentially active antimicrobials as colistin (col), imipenem (ipm), levofloxacin (lev), and piperacillin/tazobactam (pip/taz) against 67 gram-negative clinical isolates obtained from el- meery hospital in alexandria, egypt. el-meery hospital is a 1,500-bed tertiary teaching hospital where tig has  not been previously used. based on mic(90)s, tig was found to be a comparator to  ipm and col (mic(90)= 8 mug/ml). lev and pip/taz were less active than tig exhibiting high mic(90)s. tig inhibited 100% of escherichia coli and k. pneumoniae and 60% of ps. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates. in time-kill studies against ipm-resistant isolates, tig showed bactericidal activity after 6  hours of contact against the enterobacteriaceae isolates and after 3 hours for the tested ps. aeruginosa isolates at 4x and 8x mic. against a. baumannii, tig exerted a bacteriostatic effect. tig demonstrated variable ability to suppress biofilm formation affecting mainly e. coli and a. baumannii isolates. these results point tig to be a promising agent in treatment of infections caused by strains for which adequate therapy has been limited. as far as we know, this is the first report evaluating the in vitro activity of tig against egyptian clinical isolates.

TI  == development of taqman real-time polymerase chain reaction for the detection of the newly emerging form of carbapenem resistance gene in clinical isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == purpose: the newly emerging form of the so-called new delhi metallo-beta-lactamases (ndm-1) has been reported recently from patients worldwide and broadly thought as a potential source for the major global health problem. thus, it is important to study the epidemiology of the so-called ndm-1 harbouring bacteria to prevent its further spread and to place effective control  measures. the present study describes the use of the real-time polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay for the detection of the bla ndm-1 gene using taqman probes  among clinical isolates. materials and methods: clinical isolates of escherichia  coli (11 strains), klebsiella pneumoniae (17 strains) and acinetobacter baumannii (six strains) that were resistant to either of the carbapenems (meropenem or imipenem) were included in the study. the presence of carbapenemases in such strains was confirmed using the modified hodge test. a real-time pcr assay was optimized for the detection of ndm-1 using a cloned synthetic gene fragment followed by testing of the clinical isolates. the findings were further confirmed using pcr and gene sequencing. results: taqman probe assay displayed a good detection limit with analytical sensitivity of the assay up to 10 copies of bla ndm-1 gene per reaction. the isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae revealed narrow range crossing point values (cp values) between (12-17) cycles (mean cp value 14), indicating number of bla ndm-1 gene copies of 106-108. the wider range of cp values (15-34) cycles with a higher mean cp value (23.6) was observed in a. baumannii with number of bla ndm-1 gene copies of 103-108. conclusions: the study demonstrates that real-time pcr assay based on taqman chemistry is a useful technique for the detection of bla ndm-1 harbouring clinical isolates of e. coli, k. pneumoniae and a. baumannii. the assay has great precision in measuring the number of bla ndm-1 gene copies per specimen of dna.

AB  == fast, reliable, and versatile typing tools are essential to differentiate among related bacterial strains for epidemiological investigation and surveillance of health care-associated infection with multidrug-resistant (mdr) pathogens. the diversilab (dl) system is a semiautomated repetitive-sequence-based pcr system designed for rapid genotyping. the dl system performance was assessed by comparing its reproducibility, typeability, discriminatory power, and concordance with those of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) and multilocus sequence typing (mlst) and by assessing its epidemiological concordance on well-characterized mdr bacterial strains (n = 165). these included vana enterococcus faecium, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing strains of klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii, and esbl- or metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl)-producing pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the dl system showed very good performance for e. faecium and k. pneumoniae and good performance for other species, except for a discrimination index of <95% for a. baumannii and e. coli (93.9% and 93.5%, respectively) and incomplete concordance with mlst for p. aeruginosa (78.6%) and e. coli (97.0%). occasional violations of mlst assignment by dl types were noted for e. coli. complete epidemiological concordance was observed for all pathogens, as all outbreak-associated strains clustered in identical dl types that were distinct from those of unrelated strains. in conclusion, the dl system showed good to excellent performance, making it a reliable typing tool for investigation of outbreaks caused by study pathogens, even though it was generally less discriminating than pfge analysis. for e. coli and p. aeruginosa, mlst cannot be  reliably inferred from dl type due to phylogenetic group violation or discordance.

TI  == development of a high-throughput cloning strategy for characterization of acinetobacter baumannii drug transporter proteins.
AB  == heterologous expression of membrane proteins in escherichia coli often requires optimization to overcome problems with toxicity of the recombinant protein to the host cell. a number of gateway-based destination vectors were constructed to investigate expression of membrane proteins using a high-throughput approach. these vectors were tested using putative drug transporter proteins from the multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (mate) family and the resistance-nodulation-cell division superfamily encoded by the human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii. active transport of antibiotics and antiseptics mediated by efflux proteins contributes to the high level of multidrug resistance observed in a. baumannii. substrates for 4 of the 5 putative efflux proteins investigated  were identified using the expression vectors designed in this study. additionally, a gateway-based suicide vector was designed for construction of specific a. baumannii insertion disruption mutants. this knockout cloning strategy was tested and shown to be successful in inactivating abem4, a putative  mate family protein. therefore, we have shown that the gateway-based vectors constructed in this study are versatile tools that can be used for manipulation and characterization of membrane proteins.

AB  == the resistome of the multidrug-resistant escherichia coli strain 271 carrying the plasmid-mediated bla(ndm-1) carbapenemase gene was analyzed by high-throughput genome sequencing. the p271a plasmid carrying the bla(ndm-1) gene was 35.9 kb in  size and possessed an incn-type backbone that harbored a novel replicase gene. acquisition of the bla(ndm-1) gene on plasmid p271a had been likely the result of a cointegration event involving the transposase of tn5403. the expression of bla(ndm-1) was associated with the insertion sequence isaba125 likely originating from acinetobacter baumannii. e. coli 271 accumulated multiple resistance determinants, including five beta-lactamase genes (comprising the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase ctx-m-15), two 16s rna methylase arma- and rmtb-encoding genes, and the qepa gene encoding an efflux pump involved in resistance to fluoroquinolones. these resistance genes were located on three additional plasmids, of 160 kb (inca/c), 130 kb (incf), and 110 kb (inci1). in addition, several chromosomally encoded resistance determinants were identified,  such as topoisomerase mutations, porin modifications and truncations, and the intrinsic ampc gene of e. coli that was weakly expressed. the multidrug resistance pattern observed for e. coli 271 was therefore the result of combined  chromosome- and plasmid-encoded mechanisms.

AB  == this study examined the pattern of colonization of the neonatal gut by aerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) and evaluated the association between gut colonization and sepsis in the developing world. this deserves attention because  of the high incidence of sepsis and the differences in hygienic environments in developing countries compared with the developed world. the study was carried out on neonates in a tertiary-care government hospital. serial gut samples were analysed (gastric aspirates and stool samples) for gnb. blood samples of cases showing clinical signs of sepsis were also analysed for septic screening and culture positivity. antibiograms, serotyping and pfge were carried out to evaluate the relatedness of the gut and blood isolates. a diverse array of gnb was isolated from the gut of the neonates, klebsiella pneumoniae being most common, followed by escherichia coli. the rate of isolation of gnb was consistently higher in stool samples compared with gastric aspirate samples. colonization was influenced by a stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and by  the prolonged use of a feeding tube. gnb were the cause of sepsis in the majority of cases, with k. pneumoniae being the most frequently isolated gnb from the blood. acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae and burkholderia cepacia were the other gnb recovered from the blood of the neonates. neonates with gnb in the gut had a higher incidence of clinical sepsis than those without. in 50 % of cases, the genotypes of the organisms found in the blood were indistinguishable from their gut counterpart. these results show that the neonatal gut is colonized with a diverse array of gnb, and an association between gut colonization and neonatal sepsis was observed.

TI  == [evolution of susceptibility to antibiotics of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii, in a university hospital center of beirut between 2005 and 2009].
AB  == introduction: until recently, multiresistant bacteria were only limited to hospitals. however, they are now responsible for community acquired infections, affecting people who have had no contact with the hospital environment. several mechanisms are associated with these resistances. the production of betalactamases is however the predominant mechanism and especially the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases or esbl by strains of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, which mediate resistance to third generation cephalosporins and aztreonam (azt). the association of multiple mechanisms of resistance (efflux pumps, impermeability and enzymatic inactivation) generates multi resistant bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa mdr and klebsiella pneumoniae mdr. aim of the study: the aim of the study was to analyze retrospectively the susceptibility to antibiotics of strains of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumanii isolated from hospitalized and outpatients in a university hospital center of beirut over a period of five years from 2005 to 2009. materials and methods: bacterial strains were classified according to their origin (inpatients versus outpatients), their ability to produce or not esbls for e. coli and k. pneumonia and if they were mdr for p. aeruginosa and a. baumanii. antibiotics susceptibilities were retrieved from the  informatics database of the hospital. comparison of susceptibility percentages was done using a unilateral z-test on a computer program. results: in 2009, 2541  strains of e. coli were isolated, 773 of which or 30.4 % were esbl producers while 2031 strains were isolated in 2005, of which 361 or 17.8 % were esbl producers (p<0.001). we noticed a decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to  ceftazidime (caz) and azt, between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.001), and a decrease in community strains susceptibility to trimethoprime/sulfamethoxazole (sxt) between  2005 and 2009 (p=0.03). we noted however a significant decrease of esbl producing strains between 2007 and 2009: 33.4 % versus 30.4 % (p=0.03). among 560 strains of k. pneumoniae isolated in 2009, 178 strains or 31.8 % were esbl producers in comparison to 23.7 % of the strains isolated in 2005 (p=0.03). we also noticed a  decrease in hospital strains susceptibility to piperacilline-tazobactam (tzp), cefotaxime (ctx) and azt (p<0.001 p=0.03 and p=0.03 respectively) between 2006 and 2009, and a significant increase in esbl producing strains between 2008 et 2009 (p=0.0001). 26.5 % of p. aeruginosa strains isolated in 2009 were mdr bacteria with no significant change as compared to 26.6 % in 2005 (p=0.5). however, the percentage of mdr strains slightly decreased between 2008 and 2009 (p=0.047). the susceptibility of mdr strains to caz and imipenem (imp) decreased  between 2005 and 2009 (p<0.001 and p=0.003 respectively). as for a. baumanii, 77.7 % of strains were mdr in 2009 in comparison to 73.4 % in 2005 (p=0.24) with  a dramatic decrease of mdr strains susceptibility to imp from 92.3 % in 2006 to 30 % in 2009 (p<0.001). conclusion: despite restrictions on antibiotics prescriptions and isolation of patients harboring mdr bacteria or bacteria producing esbl, there has not been satisfactory reduction of multi resistant bacteria and efforts should be made to reduce these bugs from the hospital flora.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance of gram negative bacilli isolated from tertiary-care hospitals in colombia].
AB  == introduction: antimicrobial resistance has been identified as one of the major public health problems worldwide. to facilitate its control, bacterial resistance levels must be monitored permanently by effective surveillance systems. objective: to describe the antimicrobial resistance patterns of gram negative bacilli in colombian hospitals over a 3-year period. materials and methods: this  descriptive study used the bacterial susceptibility profiles provided by 14 tertiary-care hospitals belonging to the colombian nosocomial resistance study group. the hospitals were located in 7 major cities in colombia, and provided records over the period january 2006 to december 2008. using whonet 5.4, the antimicrobial resistance patterns were described for the enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenters (pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii). comparisons  were made in the bacterial responses to selected antibiotics in samples from general wards and from adult intensive care units. results: the antimicrobial resistance frequencies of several enterobacteriaceae species showed a decreasing  trend. in contrast, p. aeruginosa was demonstrated to be a multidrug-resistance organism with increasing resistance frequencies. conclusions: these data emphasize the importance of surveillance programs in detecting presence of multidrug-resistant organisms. this information will aid the implementation of protocols aimed to strengthen the infection control strategies and antibiotic stewardship in each hospital.

TI  == structure-function relationships of caro, the carbapenem resistance-associated outer membrane protein of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == objectives: in the context of the increasing worldwide occurrence of imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii strains, we investigated a possible porin-mediated mechanism relating to the carbapenem resistance-associated outer membrane protein, caro. the aim of this study was to determine whether this porin may be a diffusion pathway for carbapenems in a. baumannii. methods: by analysing and comparing the sequences of caro with protein databanks, we identified two major groups of sequences that we named caroa and carob. we overproduced in escherichia coli, extracted, purified by affinity chromatography and refolded in  triton x-100 rcaro from both groups. their functional properties were investigated and compared by reconstitution in planar lipid bilayers. results: this functional study showed that rcaroa and rcarob exhibit identical single-channel conductances (i.e. 20 ps in 1 m kcl) and similar poor cationic selectivity. both channels were not specific towards meropenem and glutamic acid  and poorly specific towards arginine, but they presented a marked specificity towards imipenem. from the calculated binding constants, we highlight that the carob channel was twice as specific as the caroa channel for this antibiotic. moreover, the caroa channel could facilitate ornithine diffusion when the carob channel would not. conclusions: we provide here the first evidence that caro channels possess an imipenem (but not meropenem) binding site, and that their specificities depend on their primary structure. any decrease in caro expression  would thus reduce the susceptibility of a. baumannii to this antibiotic.

TI  == molecular characterization of blandm-1 in an acinetobacter baumannii strain isolated in germany in 2007.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the genetic environment of the metallo-beta-lactamase  gene bla(ndm-1) in an acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2007 in a german hospital. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and resistance genes were characterized by pcr amplification and sequencing. transferability of beta-lactam resistance was tested by broth mating assays and transformation of plasmids. the genetic background of bla(ndm-1) was analysed by  primer walking. typing of the a. baumannii strain was performed by repetitive extragenic palindromic sequence-based pcr (rep-pcr) using the diversilab system.  results: the multidrug-resistant a. baumannii isolate harboured beta-lactamase genes bla(ndm-1) and intrinsic bla(oxa-64), but without the insertion sequence isaba1 often located upstream. transfer of carbapenem resistance by conjugation and transformation failed. hybridization of isolated plasmid dna with bla(ndm) probes was not successful. shotgun cloning of whole genomic dna and sequence analyses revealed that bla(ndm-1) was located between two insertion elements of isaba125. furthermore, this bla(ndm-1)-containing transposon structure was integrated into a chromosomal gene encoding a putative a. baumannii major facilitator superfamily (mfs) metabolite/h+ symporter. conclusions: the metallo-beta-lactamase gene bla(ndm-1) in this a. baumannii strain was integrated in the chromosome on a new transposon structure composed of two copies of insertion sequence isaba125. the variability of the genetic environment of bla(ndm-1) likely facilitates the rapid dissemination of this gene within many gram-negative bacterial species.

TI  == mucosal surveillance cultures in predicting gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care units.
AB  == this study aimed to examine the spectrum and time course of gut and nasopharyngeal colonization with gram-negative micro-organisms, and to define the value of surveillance cultures in predicting late-onset sepsis in neonates admitted to neonatal intensive care units. nasopharyngeal and rectal swabs were collected on admission and twice weekly thereafter in 278 neonates admitted within the first 72 h of life with risk factors of early-onset sepsis. sterile body fluid cultures were obtained on admission and subsequently as clinically indicated. approximately half of the rectal (693/1250, 55%) and nasopharyngeal (558/1153, 48%) samples but only 6% (32/555) of the sterile fluid samples in 26 patients were culture positive for gram-negative organisms. in total, 2108 invasive and mucosal culture pairs were analysed. the overall sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values of a mucosal sample to predict late-onset sepsis were 27%, 66%, 4% and 94%, respectively. patients with  pre-existing colonization with klebsiella pneumoniae (p = 0.011), klebsiella oxytoca (p = 0.002), escherichia coli (p = 0.003), stenotrophomonas spp. (p = 0.003) and pseudomonas spp. (p </= 0.001) were more likely to develop late-onset  sepsis. no such association was found for acinetobacter baumannii, serratia spp.  or enterobacter cloacae. in conclusion, routine mucosal cultures are inefficient  for the prediction of gram-negative late-onset sepsis in neonatal intensive care  units. however, targeted screening for specific organisms in an outbreak (e.g. klebsiella spp., e. coli, stenotrophomonas spp. and pseudomonas spp.) may offer an opportunity to improve infection control measures and enable timely initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == we studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. species studied included 3 common species of enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant enterococcus faecalis and e. faecium. mics and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) criteria for urinary tract isolates of escherichia coli and enterococcus faecalis and the european committee on antimicrobial susceptibility testing (eucast) criteria for enterobacteriaceae. tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by clsi or eucast. escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae. a. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in p. aeruginosa and s. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of mic breakpoint. new tentative zone diameter criteria for k. pneumoniae, e. cloacae, s. aureus, and e. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by clsi and eucast.

TI  == molecular analysis of ndm-1-producing enterobacterial isolates from geneva, switzerland.
AB  == objectives: to analyse the mechanisms responsible for decreased susceptibility or resistance to carbapenems in several enterobacterial isolates recovered in 2009-10 in geneva university hospitals, switzerland. methods: pcr and sequencing  were used to identify beta-lactamases, 16s rna methylases and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes. the transferable properties of the plasmids were analysed, as well as their plasmid type. the strains were typed by multilocus sequence typing. results: three patients were found to be positive for ndm-1-producing enterobacterial isolates (one with escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, one with k. pneumoniae only and one with proteus mirabilis), where ndm-1 stands for new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1. the bla(ndm-1) carbapenemase gene was detected in all isolates in addition to genes encoding narrow-spectrum beta-lactamases (tem-1, shv-11, oxa-1, oxa-9 and oxa-10), extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ctx-m-15, cmy-16 and cmy-30), arma and quinolone resistance determinants (qnr). the bla(ndm-1) gene was located on conjugative inca/c- or incf-type plasmids. upstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene, part  of isaba125, previously identified in ndm-1-negative acinetobacter baumannii, was found. downstream of the bla(ndm-1) gene, variable sequences were found. conclusions: this work constitutes the first identification of ndm-1 producers in switzerland. interestingly, patients from whom these ndm-1-producing isolates were recovered had a link with the indian subcontinent or the balkans.

TI  == susceptibility of gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  == the rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. we have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (no-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. although the prior findings suggest that the no-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of no-np has yet to be fully elucidated. in the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a no-np against several gram-positive and -negative  clinical isolates. we found that the no-np were uniformly active against all of the streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. we concluded that the no-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.

TI  == two methionine aminopeptidases from acinetobacter baumannii are functional enzymes.
AB  == drug resistance in gram-negative bacteria, such as acinetobacter baumannii, is emerging as a significant healthcare problem. new antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action are urgently needed to overcome the drug resistance. methionine aminopeptidase (metap) carries out an essential cotranslational methionine excision in many bacteria and is a potential target to develop such novel antibiotics. two putative metap genes were identified in a. baumannii genome, but whether they actually function as metap enzymes was not known. therefore, we established an efficient e. coli expression system for their production as soluble and metal-free proteins for biochemical characterization. we demonstrated that both could carry out the metal-dependent catalysis and could be activated by divalent metal ions with the order fe(ii) approximately ni(ii) >  co(ii) > mn(ii) for both. by using a set of metalloform-selective inhibitors discovered on other metap enzymes, potency and metalloform selectivity on the a.  baumannii metap proteins were observed. the similarity of their catalysis and inhibition to other metap enzymes confirmed that both may function as competent metap enzymes in a. baumannii and either or both may serve as the potential drug  target.

TI  == the challenges of antimicrobial resistance in brazil.
AB  == brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. rates of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic brazilian clone. local resistance to vancomycin in enterococci was first related to enterococcus faecalis, which differs from european and american epidemiology. also, local klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group  is becoming a major problem, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to spm-1 (pseudomonasaeruginosa) and oxa-23 (acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. local actions without loosing the  global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.

AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at  a tertiary medical center in northern taiwan. methods: we conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. the numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third  period, 1999-2005. results: during the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. a significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant s pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, and  imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. additionally, a significant increase  in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for e coli, enterobacter cloacae, and a baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). however, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005  was found for groups a and b streptococci, non-a, b, d streptococci, and s pneumoniae. conclusion: resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.

TI  == roles of dha2 family transporters in drug resistance and iron homeostasis in acinetobacter spp.
AB  == background: acinetobacter baumannii is a major cause of nosocomial infections worldwide due to its fitness within clinical settings and recalcitrance to conventional therapies. the drug: h(+) antiporter 2 (dha2) family export systems  encoded by a. baumannii were investigated for their roles in promoting the success ofthis organism as a human pathogen. methods: bioinformatic tools were used to identify the dha2 family transporters encoded by acinetobacter spp. and establish their phylogenetic relationships. the drug resistance phenotypes conferred by the transporters were tested using both heterologously expressed proteins in escherichia coli and acinetobacter deletion mutants. the transcriptional responses of dha2 family transporter genes to their substrates were established by qrt-pcr. results: six highly conserved dha2 family proteins were identified in a. baumannii. drug resistance phenotypes were established for  two dha2 family transporters. the expression of a third dha2 family protein is highly responsive to the availability of iron. the gene encoding this protein is  located within a putative siderophore biosynthesis locus, suggesting a physiological role in iron uptake, possibly via the export of a siderophore. conclusions: these results highlight functions for dha2 family proteins in both drug resistance and the maintenance of stable cellular physiology, emphasizing their importance in a. baumannii infections.

TI  == emergence of ndm-1-producing acinetobacter baumannii in china.
AB  == objectives: to investigate the prevalence of bla(ndm-1) in gram-negative bacilli  in china. methods: a total of 11 298 clinical gram-negative bacilli, covering escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas  aeruginosa, were collected for pcr-based surveillance of bla(ndm-1) from 57 hospitals representing 18 provinces in china. for bla(ndm-1)-positive isolates, antibiotic susceptibilities were assessed and molecular typing was performed using pfge. the genetic location of bla(ndm-1) was determined by analysis of pfge profiles of s1 nuclease-digested genomic dna and southern blot hybridization. plasmid transfer to e. coli recipients was investigated using filter mating and electroporation. results: four a. baumannii isolates with bla(ndm-1) were identified in four different provinces in china: no positive isolates were detected among e. coli, k. pneumoniae and p. aeruginosa. these bla(ndm-1)-positive a. baumannii were resistant to all carbapenems and cephalosporins, and three remained susceptible to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and colistin. the four ndm-1-producing a. baumannii were clonally diverse and carried bla(ndm-1) on different plasmids. plasmids carrying bla(ndm-1) were successfully transferred from three of the four isolates to e. coli recipients, although the transconjugants and transformants were prone to lose the transferred plasmids after passage in the absence of ampicillin selection. conclusions: we describe the emergence of a. baumannii producing ndm-1 in china. systemic surveillance network should be established for monitoring these resistant bacteria.

TI  == association of red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  == objective: pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. the relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. this study evaluated the association amongst red complex, a. actinomycetemcomitans (a.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (ph), gingivitis (g), chronic (cp) and aggressive (ap) periodontitis. methods: subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 ph, 42 g, 219 cp and 90 ap subjects. the presence and levels of a.a, red complex (porphyromonas gingivalis,  tannerella forsythia, treponema denticola), acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia  coli, enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and staphylococcus aureus were determined by dna probes and dna-dna hybridization technique. results: cp and ap subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of a.a, red  complex and a. baumannii than g and ph individuals (p<0.01), whereas s. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in ap as compared to the other groups  (p<0.001). the predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with pd and cal >/=5 mm. increasing age (or 1.08), high frequency of red complex (or 6.10), and the presence of a.a with p. aeruginosa (or 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). subjects harbouring a high prevalence of a.a, a. baumannii, and red complex with p. aeruginosa were more likely to have ap than cp (p<0.001). conclusion: putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated  with periodontitis.

TI  == immobilization of amphiphilic polycations by catechol functionality for antimicrobial coatings.
AB  == a new strategy for preparing antimicrobial surfaces by a simple dip-coating procedure is reported. amphiphilic polycations with different mole ratios of monomers containing dodecyl quaternary ammonium, methoxyethyl, and catechol groups were synthesized by free-radical polymerization. the polymer coatings were prepared by immersing glass slides into a polymer solution and subsequent drying  and heating. the quaternary ammonium side chains endow the coatings with potent antibacterial activity, the methoxyethyl side chains enable tuning the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and the catachol groups promote immobilization of the polymers into films. the polymer-coated surfaces displayed bactericidal activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus in a dynamic contact  assay and prevented the accumulation of viable e. coli, s. aureus, and acinetobacter baumannii for up to 96 h. atomic force microscopy (afm) images of coating surfaces indicated that the surfaces exhibit virtually the same smoothness for all polymers except the most hydrophobic. the hydrophobic polymer  without methoxyethyl side chains showed clear structuring into polymer domains, causing high surface roughness. sum-frequency generation (sfg) vibrational spectroscopy characterization of the surface structures demonstrated that the dodecyl chains are predominantly localized at the surface-air interface of the coatings. sfg also showed that the phenyl groups of the catechols are oriented on the substrate surface. these results support our hypothesis that the adhesive or  cross-linking functionality of catechol groups discourages polymer leaching, allowing the tuning of the amphiphilic balance by incorporating hydrophilic components into the polymer chains to gain potent biocidal activity.

TI  == broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide a3-apo in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  == although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide a3-apo has only modest activity against escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse  models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with  conventional antibiotics. in this study, the efficacy of a3-apo in several additional mouse models was investigated, including staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed klebsiella pneumoniae-a. baumannii-proteus mirabilis wound infection and k. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. in the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following a3-apo treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. the wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, a3-apo upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. one of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.

TI  == synthesis, conformational analysis and biological properties of a dicarba derivative of the antimicrobial peptide, brevinin-1bya.
AB  == brevinin-1bya (flpilaslaakfgpklfclvtkkc), first isolated from skin secretions of  the frog rana boylii, displays broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and potent haemolytic activity. this study investigates the effects on conformation and biological activity of replacement of the intramolecular disulphide bridge in the peptide by a non-reducible dicarba bond. dicarba-brevinin-1bya was prepared by microwave irradiation of [agl(18),agl(24)]-brevinin-1bya (agl = allylglycine) in  the presence of a second generation grubbs' catalyst. circular dichroism spectroscopy in 50% trifluoroethanol-water indicated that the degree of alpha-helicity of the dicarba derivative (22%) was less than that of brevinin-1bya (27%) but comparable to that of the acyclic derivative [ser(18),ser(24)]-brevinin-1bya (23%). dicarba-brevinin-1bya showed a two-fold increase in potency against reference strains of escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and candida albicans compared with the native peptide and displayed potent bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mic in the range 1-8 mum). compared with brevinin-1bya and [ser(18),ser(24)]-brevinin-1bya,  the dicarba derivative was associated with increased cytotoxicity against human erythrocytes (2.5-fold), mda-mb-231 breast carcinoma cells (1.3-fold) and hepg2 hepatoma-derived cells (1.5-fold).

TI  == multiresistant gram-negative bacteria: the role of high-risk clones in the dissemination of antibiotic resistance.
AB  == multilocus sequence typing reveals that many bacterial species have a clonal structure and that some clones are widespread. this underlying phylogeny was not  revealed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, a method better suited to short-term outbreak investigation. some global clones are multiresistant and it is easy to assume that these have disseminated from single foci. such conclusions need caution, however, unless there is a clear epidemiological trail, as with kpc carbapenemase-positive klebsiella pneumoniae st258 from greece to northwest europe. elsewhere, established clones may have repeatedly and independently acquired resistance. thus, the global st131 escherichia coli clone most often has ctx-m-15 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl), but also occurs without esbls and as a host of many other esbl types. we explore this interaction of clone and  resistance for e. coli, k. pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii- a species where three global lineages dominate--and pseudomonas aeruginosa, which shows clonal diversity, but includes the relatively 'tight' serotype o12/burst group 4 cluster that has proved adept at acquiring resistances--from pse-1 to vim-1 beta-lactamases--for over 20 years. in summary, 'high-risk clones' play a major role in the spread of resistance, with the risk lying in their tenacity--deriving from poorly understood survival traits--and a flexible ability to accumulate and  switch resistance, rather than to constant resistance batteries.

TI  == antibacterial activity of acinetobacter baumannii phage varphiab2 endolysin (lysab2) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == to investigate the nature and origin of the antibacterial activity of the lytic phage varphiab2 toward acinetobacter baumannii, we successfully isolated and characterized a novel phage lysozyme (endolysin) from varphiab2 and named it lysab2. to analyze antibacterial activity of lysab2, the complete lysab2 and two  deletion derivatives were constructed, purified and characterized. zymographic assays showed that only the intact lysab2 could lyse the peptidoglycan of a. baumannii and the staphylococcus aureus cell wall. antibacterial analysis also showed that only the intact lysab2 retained the complete bactericidal activity. when applied exogenously, lysab2 exhibited a broad bacteriolytic activity against a number of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. thermostability assays indicated that lysab2 was stable at 20 approximately 40 degrees c. its optimal ph was 6.0, and it was active from ph 4 to 8. scanning electron microscopy revealed  that exposure to 500 mugml(-1) lysab2 for up to 60 min caused a remarkable modification of the cell shape of the bacteria. treating bacteria with lysab2 clearly enhanced permeation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. these results  indicate that lysab2 is an effective lysozyme against bacteria, and they suggest  that it is a good candidate for a therapeutic/disinfectant agent to control nosocomial infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria.

TI  == suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  == acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. the main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of suprathel (polymedics innovations gmbh, denkendorf, germany) in combination with  various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii, or pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. the study  was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [hibicet]). as a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive  bacteria strains were tested: escherichia coli, p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant s aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups a and b. the tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p vulgaris, p aeruginosa, and a baumannii, except for the combination of  suprathel and mafenide acetate. it can be concluded that suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. the authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. the combination of  suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.

TI  == bactericidal oncocin derivatives with superior serum stabilities.
AB  == the proline-rich antimicrobial peptide oncocin is remarkably active in vitro against a number of important gram-negative bacteria of concern to humans owing to their increasing resistance to antibiotics, i.e. enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and enterobacter cloacae) and non-fermenting species (acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa). degradation of oncocin in mouse serum was investigated in this study. several approaches to stabilise the main cleavage sites (c-terminal to arg-15 and n-terminal to arg-19) by substituting either or both arginine (arg) residues with non-proteinogenic amino acids, i.e. alpha-amino-3-guanidino-propionic acid, homoarginine, nitro-arginine, n-methyl-arginine, beta-homoarginine, d-arginine (d-arg) or ornithine (orn), were tested. these modifications were found to increase the half-life of oncocin in full mouse serum. for oncocin with two orn residues in positions 15 and 19, the half-life in full serum increased from 25 min to 3 h. an increase of >8 h was observed for oncocin with two d-arg residues  at these same positions. the antibacterial activities of these modified sequences were slightly better than the original oncocin sequence. moreover, the three most stable analogues were found to be bactericidal against e. coli and were not toxic to hela cells or haemolytic to human erythrocytes.

AB  == due to escalating antimicrobial resistance amongst gram-negative organisms, the choice of effective empirical antimicrobial regimens has become challenging. monte carlo simulations were conducted for conventional and prolonged infusion regimens of doripenem, imipenem and meropenem using pharmacokinetic data from adult patients with conserved renal function. minimum inhibitory concentration data against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and  acinetobacter baumannii were incorporated from the compact surveillance programme in the asia-pacific region of the world. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was determined for each regimen against each bacterial population. all simulated carbapenem regimens achieved an optimal cfr against e. coli and k. pneumoniae (94.5-100% cfr). against p. aeruginosa, doripenem achieved 78.7-92.6%  cfr, imipenem achieved 60.4-79.0% cfr and meropenem achieved 73.0-85.1% cfr. the  only dosing regimen to achieve >/= 90% cfr against p. aeruginosa was doripenem 1000 mg and 2000 mg every 8 h (4-h infusion). carbapenem cfrs against a. baumannii were much lower (29.2-54.4% cfr). cfrs for non-fermenting isolates were ca. 10% lower for isolates collected in the intensive care unit. carbapenem resistance amongst enterobacteriaceae remains low in the asia-pacific region and  thus standard carbapenem dosing regimens had a high likelihood of achieving pharmacodynamic exposures. however, larger doses combined with prolonged infusion will be required to increase the cfr for these carbapenems against resistant non-fermenting gram-negatives that are common in these countries. the safety and  efficacy of these high dosing regimens will need to be confirmed in the clinical  setting.

AB  == the metallo-beta-lactamase vim-4, mainly found in pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii, was produced in escherichia coli and characterized by biochemical and x-ray techniques. a detailed kinetic study performed in the presence of zn(2)+ at concentrations ranging from 0.4 to 100 mum showed that vim-4 exhibits a kinetic profile similar to the profiles of vim-2 and vim-1. however, vim-4 is more active than vim-1 against benzylpenicillin, cephalothin, nitrocefin, and imipenem and is less active than vim-2 against ampicillin and meropenem. the crystal structure of the dizinc form of vim-4 was solved at 1.9 a. the sole difference between vim-4 and vim-1 is found at residue 228, which is ser in vim-1 and arg in vim-4. this substitution has a major impact on the vim-4 catalytic efficiency compared to that of vim-1. in contrast, the differences between vim-2 and vim-4 seem to be due to a different position of the flapping loop and two substitutions in loop 2. study of the thermal stability and the activity of the holo- and apo-vim-4 enzymes revealed that zn(2)+ ions have a pronounced stabilizing effect on the enzyme and are necessary for preserving the  structure.

AB  == chitosan is a biopolymer with antimicrobial activity and film-forming properties. in this study, the effects on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration of coating hens' eggs with chitosan was evaluated. a chitosan was selected from eight types (four non-commercial and four commercial) based on its  antimicrobial activity against salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis (s. enteritidis). for this purpose, a contact plate method was developed and chitosans were applied at a concentration of 0.25% (w/v). a commercial type with  a molecular weight of 310-375 kda and a deacetylation degree of 75% that reduced  s. enteritidis by 0.71 log(10) colony forming units compared to the control (without chitosan) was selected for further studies. the chitosan was shown to have antimicrobial activity against other egg borne bacteria, i.e., acinetobacter baumannii, alcaligenes sp., carnobacterium sp., pseudomonas sp., serratia marcescens and staphylococcus warneri, and against s. enterica serovar typhimurium, escherichia coli and listeria monocytogenes. the effects of various  concentrations of the selected chitosan (0.25%, 1% and 2%) on salmonella shell contamination and trans-shell penetration were assessed using the agar molding technique. effective reduction of eggshell contamination could not be demonstrated, but trans-shell penetration was significantly reduced in the presence of a 2% chitosan eggshell coating, with only 6.1% of the eggs being penetrated compared to 24.5% of the uncoated eggs. it was concluded that the 2% chitosan coating has the potential to reduce contamination of egg contents resulting from trans-shell penetration by s. enteritidis.

TI  == [the growing problem of antibiotic resistance in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria: current situation].
AB  == resistance to antimicrobial agents in clinically relevant gram-negative bacteria  is an increasingly important problem, which in the last few years has spread from the hospital setting to the community. in enterobacteria, the main features of this situation include resistance to beta-lactams and quinolones. beta-lactam resistance is caused by intrinsic beta-lactamases, extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, plasmid-mediated cephamycinases and carbapenemses, particularly  when produced in strains with decreased permeability because of altered porin expression. quinolone resistance is a multifactorial problem in which the importance of plasmid-mediated mechanisms (qnr proteins, acetylase, active efflux pumps) is being recognized. several studies in spain and other countries show that strains with these resistance mechanisms are being isolated with increased frequency. of particular concern is the spread of escherichia coli and other species producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (most frequently of the ctx-m family), affecting outpatients. very commonly these mechanisms are simultaneously expressed within the same bacterial host, leading to a multiresistance phenotype. this problem is also of major clinical importance in non-fermenting gram-negative rods, including pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii and, to a lesser extent, stenotrophomonas maltophilia and some other species. multiresistance in non-fermenting organisms results from the presence of intrinsic mechanisms (production of distinct beta-lactamases, decreased permeability and expression of several active efflux pumps) and from the acquisition of exogenous genes. therapeutic difficulties reach their maximum when bacteria express resistance to carbapenems (a multifactorial problem) or to polymyxins. new compounds with specific activity against multiresistant gram-negative rods should be developed, which, together with other measures, would contribute to controlling the current serious situation.

TI  == expression, purification, and refolding of biologically active acinetobacter baumannii ompa from escherichia coli inclusion bodies.
AB  == infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii have emerged as a significant clinical problem due to the increase in infections caused by antibiotic resistant strains. a. baumannii ompa is a highly conserved membrane protein that has multiple roles in interacting with the host during infection, and thus represents an attractive target for the development of novel antibacterial therapies. in the present study, the coding sequence of the mature form of a. baumannii ompa was cloned into the vector pet-15b and purified under denaturing conditions from escherichia coli inclusion bodies using nickel affinity chromatography. a triton  x-114 wash step was incorporated into the purification method in order to remove  endotoxin, resulting in endotoxin levels of <1.3 eu/mg of protein. a protocol was developed for refolding the purified protein by dilution into the non-ionic detergent n-octyl-beta-d-glucopyranoside followed by dialysis to remove excess denaturant and detergent. cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that refolded a. baumannii ompa was able to induce cell death in a549 cells. in addition, a polyclonal antibody was raised against the refolded protein and used to assess extracellular secretion of ompa by western blot. this protein expression and purification system may be useful for further characterization of a. baumannii ompa.

TI  == clinical outcomes of health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted to european intensive-care units: a cohort study.
AB  == background: patients admitted to intensive-care units are at high risk of health-care-associated infections, and many are caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. we aimed to assess excess mortality and length of stay in intensive-care units from bloodstream infections and pneumonia. methods: we analysed data collected prospectively from intensive-care units that reported according to the european standard protocol for surveillance of health-care-associated infections. we focused on the most frequent causative microorganisms. resistance was defined as resistance to ceftazidime (acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa), third-generation cephalosporins (escherichia coli), and oxacillin (staphylococcus aureus). we defined 20 different exposures according to infection site, microorganism, and resistance status. for every exposure, we compared outcomes between patients exposed and unexposed by use of time-dependent regression modelling. we adjusted  results for patients' characteristics and time-dependency of the exposure. findings: we obtained data for 119 699 patients who were admitted for more than 2 days to 537 intensive-care units in ten countries between jan 1, 2005, and dec 31, 2008. excess risk of death (hazard ratio) for pneumonia in the fully adjusted model ranged from 1.7 (95% ci 1.4-1.9) for drug-sensitive s aureus to 3.5 (2.9-4.2) for drug-resistant p aeruginosa. for bloodstream infections, the excess risk ranged from 2.1 (1.6-2.6) for drug-sensitive s aureus to 4.0 (2.7-5.8) for drug-resistant p aeruginosa. risk of death associated with antimicrobial resistance (ie, additional risk of death to that of the infection) was 1.2 (1.1-1.4) for pneumonia and 1.2 (0.9-1.5) for bloodstream infections for a combination of all four microorganisms, and was highest for s aureus (pneumonia 1.3 [1.0-1.6], bloodstream infections 1.6 [1.1-2.3]). antimicrobial resistance did not significantly increase length of stay; the hazard ratio for discharge, dead or alive, for sensitive microorganisms compared with resistant microorganisms (all four combined) was 1.05 (0.97-1.13) for pneumonia and 1.02 (0.98-1.17) for bloodstream infections. p aeruginosa had the highest burden of health-care-acquired infections because of its high prevalence and pathogenicity  of both its drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. interpretation: health-care-associated bloodstream infections and pneumonia greatly increase mortality and pneumonia increase length of stay in intensive-care units; the additional effect of the most common antimicrobial resistance patterns is comparatively low. funding: european commission (dg sanco).

TI  == [recent progress in taxonomic studies on pathogenic nocardia and usefulness of the bacteria for the studies on secondary metabolites and antibiotic resistant mechanisms].
AB  == the present taxonomic situation of pathogenic actinomycetes including nocardia was clarified, and the impact of genomic sequence information of nocardia farcinica ifm 10152 on taxonomic work is introduced. the number of cases of nocardiosis is on the rise along with the increasing number of immunocompromised  patients in japan. from 1999 to 2007, 718 strains of pathogenic actinomycetes were received for identification by medical mycology research center (mmrc), chiba university. about 75% of these were classified into nocardia, major species being n. farcinica, n. nova, and n. brasiliensis. among the strains classified as nocardia species, there were some unclassifiable strains and taxonomic studies on these led to the proposal of more than 18 new species, resulting in more than 1/4 of all nocardia species having been proposed by our group. recently a new nocardia species, nocardia mikamii was proposed by american researchers. a new phylogenetic analysis method using gryb and seca1 genes was proposed for the nocardia and gordonia strains.our whole genome analysis of n. farcinica suggests  that the bacterium has unique and characteristic gene profiles, and also suggests that n. farcinica is similar to mycobacterium tuberculosis. n. farcinica also has siderophore (nocobactin) and mce genes which are similar to mycobactin (siderophore) of m. tuberculosis as virulence factors. nocardia strains were found to be producers of new secondary metabolites including antifungal, antitumor and immunosuppressive activities.we reported novel antibiotic resistance mechanisms such as ribosylation, glucosylation, phosphorylation and degradation of rifampicin, phosphorylation of aminoglycosides, and glucosylation  of macrolide antibiotics. among rifampicin inactivation mechanisms, ribosylation  was found to be through the arr enzyme that catalyzes adp-ribosylation of rifampicin in a fast-growing mycobacterium smegmatis. this unique mechanism has also been reported as an antibiotic resistant mechanism in pathogenic escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and acinetobacter baumannii.our cooperative work on the elucidation of high-level resistance to the aminoglycoside antibiotic amikacin in n. farcinica with a research group from cdc, usa, revealed the presence of homozygous mutations in the 16r rrna genes which are responsible for high-level aminoglycoside antibiotic resistance.

TI  == [etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia in children].
AB  == objective: to investigate the etiology and epidemic characteristics of hospital acquired pneumonia (hap) in children. method: a retrospective hospital infection  study was performed in 52,639 children admitted to our hospital from january 2005 to december 2008. result: six hundred and ninety eight patients were diagnosed as hap. the incidence of hap was 1.33%, among which, 108 (15.47%) cases were early-onset hap and 590 (84.53%) were late-onset hap. the hap patients aged 3 days to 15 years (503 male and 195 female). the proportion of patients younger than 1 year was 51.4%. main underlying diseases were cytomegalovirus hepatitis, congenital heart disease, malignant tumor, granulocytopenia or agranulocytosis, prematurity and low birth weight. there was significant difference in the incidences among different departments with the highest one seen in icu, followed by departments of infectious diseases, hematology and digestive diseases. two hundred and thirty one stains of pathogens were identified from sputum of 355 cases. one hundred and fifty six (67.5%) strains were gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. there were 30 (13.0%) gram-positive bacterial strains, and 29 (12.6%) respiratory tract virus strains, and 15 (6.5%)  fungal strains, and 1 (0.4%) mycoplasma strain. the predominant bacterial pathogens were klebsiella pneumoniae, followed by stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. the isolation rates of klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) were 94.8% and 85.7%, respectively. those two bacteria were universally resistant to the third and forth generations  cephalosporins. the main pathogens of early-onset hap were respiratory syncytial  virus (rsv), streptococcus mitis, streptococcus pneumonia, haemophilus influenzae and klebsiella pneumoniae, while the main pathogens of late-onset hap were esbls-positive klebsiella pneumonia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, burkholderia cepacia, escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: hap in children is most common in children younger than 1 year and with underlying diseases. the main pathogens are gram-negative bacteria. rsv was an important pathogen of hap. the pathogens of early-onset hap are different from those of late-onset hap. these results may be of some help in prevention and control of hap in children and in guiding for rational application of antibiotics, especially the empirical antibiotic choice.

TI  == identification of diverse oxa-40 group carbapenemases, including a novel variant, oxa-160, from acinetobacter baumannii in pennsylvania.
AB  == three acinetobacter baumannii isolates that possess oxa-40 group carbapenemase genes were identified. they belonged to novel sequence types (st122, st123, and st124) and harbored bla(oxa-160), bla(oxa-72), and bla(oxa-40), respectively. oxa-160 is a novel variant of oxa-40 with a p227s substitution. an isogenic escherichia coli clone producing oxa-160 was more susceptible to carbapenems than a clone producing oxa-40. the genetic environment of bla(oxa-160) and bla(oxa-40) beyond the putative xerc/xerd recombination sites was distinct from the scaffold  reported previously.

TI  == efficacy of concurrent application of chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine against six nosocomial pathogens.
AB  == background: chlorhexidine gluconate (chg) and povidone iodine (pi) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. methods: chg and pi, alone and combined, were evaluated against  staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible s aureus [mssa] and methicillin-resistant s aureus [mrsa]), staphylococcus epidermidis (mrse), acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. minimum bactericidal concentration (mbc) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/ml at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (fbcis) were calculated to determine chg and pi compatibility. additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with s aureus (mssa), treated for 2 hours with chg 3%, pi 5%, or chg 3% and pi 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. results: in broth, chg demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas pi activity was all-or-none. all isolates studied were similarly susceptible to chg (mbcs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). the mbcs of pi were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. overall, fbci calculations showed indifference. treatment of mssa-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated  that the chg-pi combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. conclusion:  fbcis, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining chg and pi had no negative impact on antisepsis. moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.

TI  == carbapenem-hydrolyzing ges-type extended-spectrum beta-lactamase in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii isolate ap was recovered from a bronchial lavage of a patient hospitalized in paris, france. a. baumannii ap was resistant to all beta-lactams, including carbapenems, and produced the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) ges-14, which differs from ges-1 by two substitutions, gly170ser and gly243ala. cloning of the bla(ges-14) gene followed by its expression in escherichia coli showed that ges-14 compromised significantly the efficacy of all beta-lactams, including cephalosporins, aztreonam, and carbapenems. the carbapenemase activity of purified ges-14 was confirmed by kinetic studies. the bla(ges-14) gene was located into a class 1 integron structure and located onto a ca. 95-kb self-transferable plasmid. this study identified a very broad-spectrum beta-lactamase in a. baumannii.

TI  == genomics-driven reconstruction of acinetobacter nad metabolism: insights for antibacterial target selection.
AB  == enzymes involved in the last steps of nad biogenesis, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (nadd) and nad synthetase (nade), are conserved and essential in most bacterial species and are established targets for antibacterial drug development. our genomics-based reconstruction of nad metabolism in the emerging  pathogen acinetobacter baumannii revealed unique features suggesting an alternative targeting strategy. indeed, genomes of all analyzed acinetobacter species do not encode nadd, which is functionally replaced by its distant homolog nadm. we combined bioinformatics with genetic and biochemical techniques to elucidate this and other important features of acinetobacter nad metabolism using a model (nonpathogenic) strain acinetobacter baylyi sp. adp1. thus, a comparative kinetic characterization of pnca, pncb, and nadv enzymes allowed us to suggest distinct physiological roles for the two alternative, deamidating and nondeamidating, routes of nicotinamide salvage/recycling. the role of the niap transporter in both nicotinate and nicotinamide salvage was confirmed. the nondeamidating route was shown to be transcriptionally regulated by an adp-ribose-responsive repressor nrtr. the nadm enzyme was shown to possess dual substrate specificity toward both nicotinate and nicotinamide mononucleotide substrates, which is consistent with its essential role in all three routes of nad biogenesis, de novo synthesis as well as the two salvage pathways. the experimentally confirmed unconditional essentiality of nadm provided support for  the choice of the respective enzyme as a drug target. in contrast, nade, encoding a glutamine-dependent nad synthetase, proved to be dispensable when the nondeamidating salvage pathway functioned as the only route of nad biogenesis.

TI  == structure-activity studies on novel polymyxin derivatives that carry only three positive charges.
AB  == polymyxin b and colistin are pentacationic lipopeptides that possess a cyclic heptapeptide portion, a linear tripeptide portion, and a fatty acyl tail. they are used, in spite of nephrotoxicity, to treat infections caused by extremely multiresistant gram-negative bacteria. we have recently developed novel derivatives, that carry three cationic charges only. some of them, including nab739, are directly antibacterial whereas others, including nab7061, lack the direct activity but sensitize bacteria to other antibiotics. nab739 and nab7061 differ from the old polymyxins in their renal handling and have reduced affinity  to kidney brush border membrane. to further study the structure-activity relationships, we here synthesized eight additional derivatives and tested their  antibacterial activity. nab751 carries methylheptanoyl as the fatty acyl instead  of octanoyl in nab739 and was as active as nab739, whereas nab750 with dodecanoyl was less active. nab781 and nab782 with the linear peptide portion ser-dser and ser-ser-dser, respectively, were less active than nab739 that carries thr-dser. nab771 with thr at position 8 in the cyclic portion (instead of dab in nab7061) and thr-dab as the linear peptide portion (instead of thr-abu in nab7061), resembled nab7061 in its activity. however, replacement of two dab residues in the cyclic portion with thr greatly decreased the activity, even though the loss  of the cationic charges was compensated by introducing two dab residues in the linear portion. these findings reveal that subtle structural modifications have a major effect on the antibacterial activity and that it is possible to design numerous tricationic polymyxin derivatives that are antibacterial.

AB  == objectives: the designer antibacterial peptide a3-apo is efficacious in mouse models of escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii systemic infections. here  we compare the efficacy of the peptide with that of imipenem and colistin in a. baumannii wound infections after burn injury. methods: cd-1 mice were inflicted with burn wounds and different inocula of a. baumannii, isolated from an injured  soldier, were placed into the wound sites. the antibiotics were given intramuscularly (im) one to five times. available free peptide in the blood and the systemic toxicity of colistin and a3-apo were studied in healthy mice. results: while toxicity of colistin was observed at 25 mg/kg bolus drug administration, the lowest toxic dose of a3-apo was 75 mg/kg. in the a. baumannii blast injury models, 5 mg/kg a3-apo improved survival and reduced bacterial counts in the blood as well as in the wounds and improved wound appearance significantly better than any other antibiotic treatment. the free peptide concentration in the blood did not reach 1 microg/ml. conclusions: peptide a3-apo, with an intramuscular therapeutic index of 15, is more efficacious and less toxic than any existing burn injury infection therapy modality against multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens. a3-apo administered by the im route  probably binds to a biopolymer that promotes the peptide's biodistribution.

TI  == sensitization of microcin j25-resistant strains by a membrane-permeabilizing peptide.
AB  == microcin j25 (mccj25) is a plasmid-encoded, 21-amino-acid, antibacterial peptide  produced by escherichia coli. mccj25 inhibits rna polymerase and the membrane respiratory chain. mccj25 uptake into e. coli-sensitive strains is mediated by the outer membrane receptor fhua and the inner membrane proteins tonb, exbb, exbd, and sbma. this peptide is active on some e. coli, salmonella, and shigella  species strains, while other gram-negative bacteria, such as clinical isolates of enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter freundii, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, moraxella catarrhalis, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, are completely resistant. in the present work, we demonstrated that the membrane-permeabilizing peptide (kff)(3)k made some resistant strains sensitive to mccj25, among them s. typhimurium, where the antibiotic inhibits in vitro cell growth and bacterial replication within macrophages. the results demonstrate that the membrane permeabilization induced by (kff)(3)k allows mccj25 penetration in an fhua and sbma-independent manner and suggest that the combination of both peptides could be considered as a therapeutic agent against pathogenic salmonella strains.

TI  == antimicrobial peptides with therapeutic potential from skin secretions of the marsabit clawed frog xenopus borealis (pipidae).
AB  == nine peptides with differential growth inhibitory activity against escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin  secretions of the tetraploid frog xenopus borealis parker, 1936 (pipidae). structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they were orthologous to magainin-2 (1 peptide), peptide glycine-leucine-amide, pgla (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, cpf (4 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, xpf (2 peptides), previously isolated from xenopus  laevis and x. amieti. in addition, a second magainin-related peptide (g**kflhsagkfgkaflgevmig) containing a two amino acid residue deletion compared with magainin-2 was identified that had only weak antimicrobial activity. the peptide with the greatest potential for development into a therapeutically valuable anti-infective agent was cpf-b1 (glgsllgkafkiglktvgkmmggapreq) with mic=5 microm against e. coli, mic=5 microm against s. aureus, and mic=25 microm against candida albicans, and low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50)>200 microm). this peptide was also the most abundant antimicrobial peptide in the skin secretions. cpf-b1 was active against clinical isolates of the nosocomial pathogens, methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa) and multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii (mdrab) with mic values in the range  4-8 microm.

TI  == in vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  == human beta-defensin 2 (hbd-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. we determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hbd-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to  eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. the native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hbd-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hbd-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. characteristically, a. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (mdr) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hbd-2 (vld(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-mdr (wild-type) a. baumannii  strains (vld(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). bactericidal activity of hbd-2 was less pronounced against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis  strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. these observations give  indications that the natural hbd-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting mdr phenotypes.

TI  == molecular and functional characterization of a novel efflux pump, amva, mediating antimicrobial and disinfectant resistance in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == objectives: acinetobacter baumannii has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in hospitalized patients, and causes a multitude of infections with significant morbidity and mortality. the aim of this study was to elucidate the role of a novel efflux pump in a. baumannii. methods: the open reading frame abaye1518, annotated as a putative methyl viologen resistance protein in the genome of strain a. baumannii aye, exhibits >50% similarity with members of the major facilitator superfamily (mfs) multidrug efflux pumps. the antimicrobial susceptibility profiles of escherichia coli kam32 cells carrying the putative efflux pump were monitored by broth dilution method. different efflux pump inhibitors were used for fluorimetric efflux assays. the functions of the putative efflux pump were confirmed in a. baumannii by insertional inactivation and complementation. its expression in clinical isolates was analysed by reverse  transcriptase-pcr. results: e. coli cells carrying the pump had decreased susceptibility to some antibiotics, disinfectants, dyes and detergents, with enhanced efflux activity. the pump was inactivated in a clinical isolate of a. baumannii ac0037 and further characterization confirmed its role in antimicrobial resistance by active efflux. we found increased expression of the pump in clinical isolates that also exhibited elevated tolerance to antibacterial agents. conclusions: this report describes the functions of a novel resistance determinant, a member of the mfs efflux pumps, for the first time in a. baumannii.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility and beta-lactamase production of selected gram-negative bacilli from two croatian hospitals: mystic study results.
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) programme is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network that monitors the activity of meropenem and compares its activity with other broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. we now report the antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem compared to other broad-spectrum agents within the selective gram-negative pathogen groups from two croatian hospitals investigated between 2002-2007. a total of 1510 gram-negative pathogens were tested and the minimum-inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by broth microdilution method according to  clsi.there was no resistance to either imipenem or meropenem observed for escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis in both medical centers. high resistance rates of k. pneumoniae to ceftazidime (18%), cefepime (17%) and gentamicin (39%) are raising concern. acinetobacter baumannii turned out to be the most resistant gram-negative bacteria with 81% resistant to ceftazidime, 73% to cefepime, 69% to gentamicin and 71% to ciprofloxacin. almost  20% of pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were resistant to imipenem, 13% to meropenem, 69% to gentamicin and 38% to ciprofloxacin.the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in e. coli was 10% and in k. pneumoniae 49%. pcr and sequencing of the amplicons revealed the presence of shv-5 in nine e. coli strains and additional tem-1 beta-lactamase five strains. five k. pneumoniae strains were positive for bla(shv-5 )gene. eight esbl positive enterobacter spp. strains were found to produce tem and ctx-m beta-lactamases. plasmid-mediated ampc beta-lactamases were not found among k. pneumoniae, e. coli and enterobacter spp. three a. baumannii strains from zagreb university center were identified by multiplex pcr as oxa-58 like producers. six a. baumannii strains from split university center were found to possess an isaba1 insertion sequence upstream of bla(oxa-51 )gene. according to our results meropenem remains an appropriate antibiotic for the treatment of severe infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. these data indicate that despite continued use of meropenem, carbapenem resistance is not increasing among species tested, except for a. baumannii, in the two study hospitals and suggest that clinicians can still administer carbapenems as a reliable and effective choice in managing serious nosocomial infections.

TI  == oncocin (vdkppylprprpprriynr-nh2): a novel antibacterial peptide optimized against gram-negative human pathogens.
AB  == small proline-rich antimicrobial peptides (amp) have attracted considerable interest, as they target specific intracellular bacterial components and do not act by lytic mechanisms. here, a novel peptide, termed oncocin (vdkppylprprpprriynr-nh(2)), is reported that was optimized for the treatment of  gram-negative pathogens. its minimal inhibitory concentrations in tryptic soy broth medium ranged from 0.125 to 8 microg/ml for 34 different strains and clinical isolates of enterobacteriaceae and nonfermenters, such as escherichia coli , pseudomonas aeruginosa , and acinetobacter baumannii . substitutions of two arginine residues by ornithine increased the half-lives in full mouse serum from about 20 min to greater than 180 min and the activity. both optimized oncocin derivatives were neither toxic to human cell lines nor hemolytic to human erythrocytes. they could freely penetrate lipid membranes and were washed out completely without any sign of lytic activity, as assessed by quartz crystal microbalance. fluorescence labeled peptides entered the periplasmic space within  20 min at room temperature and homogeneously stained e. coli within 50 min. in conclusion, the optimized oncocin represents a very promising candidate for future in vivo work and may serve as a novel lead compound for an antibacterial drug class.

TI  == dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant e. coli in german intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  == introduction: the objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (icus). methods: the study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 german icus from 2001 through 2008. data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (ad) expressed as daily defined doses (ddd) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. results: total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 ddd/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). carbapenem use almost doubled to an ad of 151 in 2008. significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (ad of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (ad of 117 in 2008). aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (ad of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) 26% and 20% (p = 0.006; trend  test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (vre) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (p = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3gc)-resistant escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (p < 0.001), 3gc-resistant klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (p < 0.001), imipenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (p = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant k. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. the resistance densities did not change for mrsa but increased significantly for vre  faecium and 3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. in 2008, the resistance density for mrsa was 3.73, 0.48 for vre, 1.39 for 3gc-resistant e. coli and 0.82  for k. pneumoniae. conclusions: although total antibiotic use did not change over time in german icus, carbapenem use doubled. this is probably due to the rise in  3gc-resistant e. coli and k. pneumoniae. increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant k. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii.

TI  == a novel polymyxin derivative that lacks the fatty acid tail and carries only three positive charges has strong synergism with agents excluded by the intact outer membrane.
AB  == polymyxins are cationic lipopeptides (five cationic charges) and the last resort  for the treatment of serious gram-negative infections caused by multiresistant strains. nab741 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin b but carries in the linear peptide portion a threonyl-d-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). at the n terminus of the peptide, nab741 carries an acetyl group instead of a mixture of methyl octanoyl and methyl heptanoyl residues. nab741 sensitized escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae,  and acinetobacter baumannii to antibiotics against which the intact outer membrane is an effective permeability barrier. when tested by using etest strips  on plates containing increasing concentrations of nab741, the fractional inhibition concentration index (fici) of the combination of nab741 with rifampin  ranged from <or=0.111 to 0.158 and that with clarithromycin from <or=0.094 to 0.292. when tested by the checkerboard method, the corresponding fici values against e. coli atcc 25922 were <or=0.141 to <or=0.155 with rifampin and 0.094 with clarithromycin. in addition, at 4 microg/ml, nab741 decreased the mics of azithromycin, mupirocin, fusidic acid, and vancomycin for e. coli strains and e.  cloacae by factors ranging from 8 to 200. a sister peptide, nab752, carrying a threonyl-aminobutyryl residue as the linear peptide portion, was inactive. furthermore, nab741 sensitized e. coli to the bactericidal activity of fresh guinea pig serum. the renal clearance of nab741 was approximately 400-fold, 16-fold, and 8-fold higher than those measured for colistin, nab7061, and nab739, respectively.

TI  == bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  == background: titania dioxide (tio(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. visible-light responsive anion-doped tio(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. the antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. methodology/principal findings: using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated tio(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. among our tested titania substrates including tio(2), carbon-doped tio(2) [tio(2) (c)] and nitrogen-doped  tio(2) [tio(2) (n)], tio(2) (n) showed the best performance after silver coating. the synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of escherichia coli, streptococcus pyogenes, staphylococcus aureus and acinetobacter baumannii. scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on tio(2) (n) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. conclusion/significance: our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could  further influence the bactericidal property.

TI  == pharmacodynamic modeling of intravenous antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria collected in the united states.
AB  == background: in the era of escalating antimicrobial resistance, the choice of effective empiric antimicrobial therapy has become considerably more difficult. in an attempt to improve antimicrobial selection, pharmacodynamic modeling that considers the drug, dose, dosing interval, and duration of infusion is increasingly used as a tool to assist in the clinical decision-making process. objective: the aim of the passport (probability of target attainment of antibacterial agents studied for susceptibility and pharmacodynamic optimization  in regional trials) study was to compare the probabilities of achieving requisite pharmacodynamic exposure (eg, t>mic, auc/mic) of common intravenous antibiotics against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. methods: using a 5000-patient monte carlo simulation, pharmacodynamic analyses were conducted for standard and high-dose, prolonged (ie, 3-to 4-hour) infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, doripenem, ertapenem, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam in adult patients with normal renal function (>or=50 ml/min). mic data were incorporated from the 2008 trust (tracking resistance in the united states today)-12 surveillance program, a long-running resistance study in 56 participating us hospitals. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) was determined for each regimen against each population of e coli, k pneumoniae, a baumannii, and p aeruginosa. optimal cfr was defined a priori as >or=90%. results: all of the beta-lactam regimens had optimal cfrs against e coli, and all but piperacillin/tazobactam 3.375 g q6h had optimal cfrs against k pneumoniae. the fluoroquinolones had the lowest cfrs against all of the pathogen populations  tested (73.2%-88.9% against e coli and k pneumortfae; 44.5 %-61.9 % against a baumannii and p aeruginosa). optimal cfr against a baumannii was not achieved with any of the regimens. against p aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged-infusion doripenem and meropenem had cfrs of 97.2% to 98.8%, followed by high-dose, prolonged-infusion ceftazidime (93.3%) and cefepime (93.2%). high-dose, prolonged-infusion regimens were associated with increased cfrs for all (beta-lactams by approximately 10% over that of standard 0.5-hour infusion regimens against the nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli. conclusions: based on this model, standard doses of most intravenous (beta-lactam regimens had high probabilities of achieving optimal exposure against enterobacteriaceae. for nonfermenting gram-negative bacilli such as a baumannii and p aeruginosa, high-dose, prolonged infusions of cefepime, ceftazidime, doripenem, and meropenem had the highest probabilities of achieving bactericidal exposure.

TI  == rapid characterization of beta-lactamases by multiplex pcr.
AB  == the rising prevalence of the members of the enterobacteriaceae, pseudomonas spp.  and acinetobacter baumannii that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and carbapenem-hydrolysing beta-lactamases (carbapenemases) represents one of the largest "new" resistance problems faced by clinicians and microbiologists during the last 10 years. these diverse enzymes have emerged globally and represent serious health challenges, compromising therapeutic choice and complicating patient management. the rapid detection of strains that produce  these beta-lactamases in clinical bacteriology laboratories allows appropriate therapy to be implemented promptly, which reduces patient mortality. this chapter describes three multiplex pcr assays, which may be used to detect genes that encode five families of ctx-m-type esbls (groups 1, 2, 8, 9, and 25), five families of metallo-carbapenemases (imp, vim, spm, gim, and sim enzymes), and four families of oxa-carbapenemases (oxa-23-like, oxa-40-like, oxa-51-like, and oxa-58-like enzymes). the ctx-m esbls are the most prevalent of these enzyme groups, particularly, though not exclusively, in isolates of escherichia coli and in klebsiella spp.; metallo-carbapenemases are often found in pseudomonas spp. and other "non-fermenters," but are also emerging problems in members of the enterobacteriaceae in some countries and locales; with a few exceptions, the oxa-carbapenemases detected by the assay described are limited to isolates of acinetobacter spp. these assays are suitable for deployment in national reference laboratories, but should also be considered for use in regional centres and in tertiary referral hospitals.

TI  == development and evaluation of oligonucleotide chip based on the 16s-23s rrna gene spacer region for detection of pathogenic microorganisms associated with sepsis.
AB  == oligonucleotide chips targeting the bacterial internal transcribed spacer region  (its) of the 16s-23s rrna gene, which contains genus- and species-specific regions, were developed and evaluated. forty-three sequences were designed consisting of 1 universal, 3 gram stain-specific, 9 genus-specific, and 30 species-specific probes. the specificity of the probes was confirmed using bacterial type strains including 54 of 52 species belonging to 18 genera. the performance of the probes was evaluated using 825 consecutive samples that were positive by blood culture in broth medium. among the 825 clinical specimens, 708  (85.8%) were identified correctly by the oligonucleotide chip. most (536 isolates, or 75.7%) were identified as staphylococci, escherichia coli, or klebsiella pneumoniae. thirty-seven isolates (4.5%) did not bind to the corresponding specific probes. most of these also were staphylococci, e. coli, or k. pneumoniae and accounted for 6.3% of total number of the species. sixty-two specimens (7.5%) did not bind the genus- or species-specific probes because of lack of corresponding specific probes. among them, acinetobacter baumannii was the single most frequent isolate (26/62). the oligonucleotide chip was highly specific and sensitive in detecting the causative agents of bacteremia directly from positive blood cultures.

TI  == encapsulation in fusogenic liposomes broadens the spectrum of action of vancomycin against gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == many antibacterial agents, including the glycopeptides, are inactive against gram-negative bacteria because of their inability to cross the outer membrane of  these cells. different chemical and technological approaches have been described  to circumvent such limitation. in this study, we aimed to apply the strategy of fusogenic liposomes, up to now used to carry biological compounds and materials inside cells, to localise a glycopeptide antibiotic, vancomycin (van), to the periplasmic space, thus allowing it to exert its bactericidal activity. small unilamellar liposome vesicles were prepared by an extrusion procedure (suvets) from a phospholipid-cholesterol hemisuccinate mixture known for its fusogenic properties with the eukaryotic cell membrane. van was loaded with high efficiency into these vesicles and in microbiological experiments in vitro was shown to be able to inhibit to a different extent the growth of wild and standard gram-negative bacterial strains. minimum inhibitory concentrations as low as 6 mg/l were observed, for instance against clinical isolates of escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii. in comparison, neither the free antibiotic nor van-loaded 'classical' (non-fusogenic) liposomes showed any activity against the  same bacteria. scanning and transmission electron microscopy studies allowed confirmation that the produced suvets were able to adhere to and fuse with the external membrane of e. coli. according to preliminary experiments, this technological strategy can be proposed as a potentially successful way to enlarge the spectrum of activity of van.

AB  == this nationwide surveillance of clinically important bacteria from the intensive  care units (icus) of major teaching hospitals throughout taiwan investigated the  susceptibilities to doripenem and other comparator carbapenems from september through november 2005. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for 1,311 clinical isolates using the broth microdilution method according to clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) 2005 guidelines. doripenem showed similar (within four-fold difference of mics) in vitro activity to meropenem for enterobacteriaceae and probably comparable activity to meropenem against important nosocomial non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli (nfgnbs), including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and burkholderia cepacia. among the four carbapenems analysed, doripenem and meropenem exhibited better in vitro activity than imipenem or ertapenem against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli isolates. however, the meropenem mic(90) against esbl-producing k. pneumoniae isolates was 2 microg/ml. besides, doripenem with the mic(90) of 0.5 microg/ml to streptococcus pneumoniae possibly suggested its potential therapeutic effect regarding community-acquired pneumonia. because of the heavy resistance burden in taiwan, closely monitoring the evolutionary trend of carbapenem susceptibilities  against clinically important pathogens is crucial in the future.

TI  == studies on the mechanism of p-hydroxyphenylacetate 3-hydroxylase from pseudomonas aeruginosa: a system composed of a small flavin reductase and a large flavin-dependent oxygenase.
AB  == there are two known types of microbial two-component flavin-dependent monooxygenases that catalyze oxygenation of p-hydroxyphenylacetate (hpa), and they are distinguished by having structurally distinct reductases and oxygenases. this paper presents a detailed analysis of the properties of the enzyme from pseudomonas aeruginosa, an example of one group, and compares its properties to those published for the acinetobacter baumannii enzyme, an example of the alternative group. the reductase and oxygenase from p. aeruginosa were expressed  in escherichia coli. the reductase was purified as a stable c-terminally his-tagged yellow protein containing weakly bound fad, and the oxygenase was purified as a stable colorless n-terminally his-tagged protein. the reductase catalyzes the reduction of fad by nadh and releases the fadh(-) product into solution, but unlike the reductase from a. baumannii, this catalysis is not influenced by hpa. the oxygenase binds the released fadh(-) and catalyzes the oxygenation of hpa to form 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetate, after which the fad dissociates to be re-reduced by the reductase, a common overall pattern for two-component flavin-dependent oxygenases. with this system, it appears that interactions between the reductase and the oxygenase can facillitate the transfer of fadh(-) to the oxygenase, although they are not required. we show that the p.  aeruginosa oxygenase system in complex with fadh(-) reacts with o(2) to form a quasi-stable, unusually high-extinction flavin hydroperoxide species that binds hpa and reacts to form the product. the resultant flavin hydroxide decomposes to  fad and water while still bound to the oxygenase and then releases product and fad from the protein. unlike the enzyme from a. baumannii, during normal catalysis involving both the reductase and oxygenase, the rate-determining step in catalysis is the dissociation of fad from the oxygenase in a process that is independent of the concentration of hpa. structures for the reductases and oxygenases from a. baumannii and from thermus thermophilus (similar to the p. aeruginosa system) form a basis for interpreting the molecular origins of the differences between the two groups of flavin-dependent two-component oxygenases.

TI  == in vitro susceptibilities of aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections at a medical center in taiwan: results of the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) 2002-2006.
AB  == background and purpose: the study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends  (smart) was initiated to monitor the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of aerobic and facultative anaerobic gram-negative bacilli (gnb) isolated from patients with intra-abdominal infections (iai). this report summarizes the smart  data from 1 of the study centers from 2002 to 2006. methods: 492 gram-negative isolates were collected from 482 patients with iai. susceptibilities of these isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents were determined using the broth microdilution method. results: enterobacteriaceae comprised 68.3% of the isolates (n = 336). the 4 main species were klebsiella spp. (n = 129; 26.2%), escherichia coli (n = 122; 24.8%), enterobacter spp. (n = 36; 7.3%), and aeromonas hydrophila (n = 35;  7.1%). the commonest glucose non-fermentative gnb were acinetobacter baumannii (n = 46; 9.3%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 35; 7.1%). extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production was detected in 70 enterobacteriaceae isolates (70/336; 21%). the esbl phenotype was exhibited by 23% of klebsiella pneumoniae,  26% of e. coli, and 19% of enterobacter spp. the highest rate of esbl production  was found in 2005 for e. coli (38%) and in 2003 for klebsiella spp. (38%) and enterobacter spp. (40%). the incidence of esbl-producing isolates declined in 2005 and 2006. low susceptibility rates of e. coli isolates to ciprofloxacin (58%) and levofloxacin (64%) were noted. ertapenem (99%), imipenem (99%), and amikacin (94%) were the most potent agents against enterobacteriaceae spp. conclusions: continuous surveillance is crucial to monitor the trend of antimicrobial resistance patterns among gnb isolated from iai.

TI  == synthetic {beta}-(1->6)-linked n-acetylated and nonacetylated oligoglucosamines used to produce conjugate vaccines for bacterial pathogens.
AB  == vaccines for pathogens usually target strain-specific surface antigens or toxins, and rarely is there broad antigenic specificity extending across multiple species. protective antibodies for bacteria are usually specific for surface or capsular antigens. beta-(1-->6)-poly-n-acetyl-d-glucosamine (pnag) is a surface polysaccharide produced by many pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, yersinia pestis, bordetella pertussis, acinetobacter baumannii, and others. protective antibodies to pnag are elicited when a deacetylated glycoform (deacetylated pnag [dpnag]; <30% acetate) is used in conjugate vaccines, whereas highly acetylated pnag does not induce such antibodies. chemical derivation of dpnag from native pnag is imprecise, so we synthesized both beta-(1-->6)-d-glucosamine (glcnh(2)) and beta-(1-->6)-d-n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) oligosaccharides with linkers on the reducing termini that could be activated to produce sulfhydryl groups for conjugation to bromoacetyl groups introduced onto carrier proteins. synthetic 5-mer glcnh(2) (5glcnh(2)) or 9glcnh(2) conjugated to tetanus toxoid (tt) elicited mouse antibodies that mediated opsonic killing of multiple s. aureus strains, while the antibodies that were produced in response to 5glcnac- or 9glcnac-tt did not mediate opsonic killing. rabbit antibodies to 9glcnh(2)-tt bound to pnag and dpnag antigens, mediated killing of s. aureus and e. coli, and protected against s. aureus skin abscesses and lethal e. coli peritonitis. chemical synthesis of a series of oligoglucosamine ligands with defined differences in n acetylation allowed us to  identify a conjugate vaccine formulation that generated protective immune responses to two of the most challenging bacterial pathogens. this vaccine could  potentially be used to engender protective immunity to the broad range of pathogens that produce surface pnag.

TI  == inhibition of the class c beta-lactamase from acinetobacter spp.: insights into effective inhibitor design.
AB  == the need to develop beta-lactamase inhibitors against class c cephalosporinases of gram-negative pathogens represents an urgent clinical priority. to respond to  this challenge, five boronic acid derivatives, including a new cefoperazone analogue, were synthesized and tested against the class c cephalosporinase of acinetobacter baumannii [acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinase (adc)]. the commercially available carbapenem antibiotics were also assayed. in the boronic acid series, a chiral cephalothin analogue with a meta-carboxyphenyl moiety corresponding to the c(3)/c(4) carboxylate of beta-lactams showed the lowest k(i) (11 +/- 1 nm). in antimicrobial susceptibility tests, this cephalothin analogue lowered the ceftazidime and cefotaxime minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of escherichia coli dh10b cells carrying bla(adc) from 16 to 4 microg/ml and from 8 to 1 microg/ml, respectively. on the other hand, each carbapenem exhibited a k(i) of <20 microm, and timed electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (esi-ms)  demonstrated the formation of adducts corresponding to acyl-enzyme intermediates  with both intact carbapenem and carbapenem lacking the c(6) hydroxyethyl group. to improve our understanding of the interactions between the beta-lactamase and the inhibitors, we constructed models of adc as an acyl-enzyme intermediate with  (i) the meta-carboxyphenyl cephalothin analogue and (ii) the carbapenems, imipenem and meropenem. our first model suggests that this chiral cephalothin analogue adopts a novel conformation in the beta-lactamase active site. further,  the addition of the substituent mimicking the cephalosporin dihydrothiazine ring  may significantly improve affinity for the adc beta-lactamase. in contrast, the adc-carbapenem models offer a novel role for the r(2) side group and also suggest that elimination of the c(6) hydroxyethyl group by retroaldolic reaction leads to a significant conformational change in the acyl-enzyme intermediate. lessons from the diverse mechanisms and structures of the boronic acid derivatives and carbapenems provide insights for the development of new beta-lactamase inhibitors against these critical drug resistance targets.

AB  == objectives: to determine c(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. methods: killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/ml) were performed with 0.88 mg/l final concentrations (serum c(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in mueller-hinton broth supplemented with ca(2+) and mg(2+) (mh) and  in mh with 4 g/dl human albumin. controls were curves in mh with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fc(max) = 0.17 mg/l) calculated using protein binding. activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). target strains (tigecycline mic/mbc; mg/l) were: methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). results: at 24 h the fc(max) produced mean decreases of < or  =0.1 cfu/ml for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by c(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for e. coli and e. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for s. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). in the case of the a. baumannii isolate the c(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/ml at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). conclusions: correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity  was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.

TI  == antimicrobial therapy and aerobic bacteriologic culture patterns in canine intensive care unit patients: 74 dogs (january-june 2006).
AB  == objective: describe antimicrobial therapy and aerobic bacteriologic culture patterns in canine intensive care unit (icu) patients in a university hospital. design: retrospective descriptive. setting: a tertiary university referral hospital. animals: seventy-four canine icu patients. interventions: from january  to june 2006 patient antimicrobial use, minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) results, and clinical data were recorded. appropriate antimicrobial use was analyzed relative to the time of culture submission and mic results. measurements and main results: mean+/-sd age was 7.2+/-4.2 years. median (range) length of icu and hospital stays were 3 days (1-25 d) and 4 days (1-27 d), respectively. a total of 106 cultures were submitted; 47 of 106 (44%) cultures were positive for  70 isolates, including escherichia coli (16/70 [23%]), staphylococcus intermedius (7/70 [10%]), and acinetobacter baumannii (5/70 [7%]). a multidrug resistant pattern occurred in 19 of 70 (27%) isolates, and was significantly more likely after 48 hours of hospitalization (p<0.001). antimicrobials were administered before culture submission in 42 of 74 dogs (57%) and included enrofloxacin (23/42 [55%]), ampicillin (20/42 [48%]), and amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (8/42 [19%]). antimicrobial choices were appropriate 19% of the time. while pending culture results, antimicrobials were administered to 67 of 72 (94%) dogs remaining alive, and were appropriate 75% of the time. the most common antimicrobials administered while awaiting culture results were ampicillin (52/67 [78%]), enrofloxacin (49/67 [73%]), and amikacin (9/67 [13%]). post-mic antimicrobials were appropriate 89% of the time. of 45 dogs remaining alive, 17 (37%) continued to receive antimicrobials despite negative cultures. conclusions: antimicrobial use was extensive in this patient population, but when available, mic results were used to guide antimicrobial therapy. many patients with negative cultures continued to receive antimicrobial therapy. multidrug resistant bacteria were more likely in cultures taken after 48 hours of hospitalization.

TI  == kinetic and theoretical study of the chalcones as inhibitors of beta-lactamase enzyme.
AB  == staphyloccoccus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae and more bacteria have  shown resistance to antibiotics in colombia, therefore, resistance to antibiotics is a problem that is on increase in colombia. the resistance mechanism to penicillin antibiotics in these bacteria is the expression of beta-lactamase enzyme. in order to use the penicillin antibiotics which are still effective against them, we had evaluated 10 chalcones as inhibitors of this enzyme. the most active chalcone showed k(m') = 406.7 microm higher than clavulanic acid that showed k(m') = 211.9 microm at 37 degrees c during 10 h, and using amoxycillin as substrate. the chalcones were better competitive inhibitors because of they allowed the hydrolysis of smaller quantity of amoxycillin than the clavulanic acid, the most active chalcone showed k(cat)/k(m) = 1.398 (minm)(-1) and the clavulanic acid showed k(cat)/k(m) = 2.674 (minm)(-1). the molecular modelling of the enzyme-chalcones complexes showed that the chalcones with electron-donating groups on ortho, meta position of a ring favour the interaction with the residues threonine-319, lysine-67, serine-64 and tyrosine-150 of the active site of the enzyme, because of the number and strong of hydrogen bonds of the chalcones in the active site of the enzyme increase, and therefore the affinity of the chalcones increases too. the electron-donating groups in the chalcones contribute to their inductive effect improving the interaction with the active site of the enzyme because of rising of electrostatic attraction between them.

TI  == antimicrobial properties of brevinin-2-related peptide and its analogs: efficacy  against multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == brevinin-2 related peptide (b2rp; giwdtiksmg(10)kvfagkilqn(20)l.nh(2)), first isolated from skin secretions of the mink frog lithobates septentrionalis, shows  broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its therapeutic potential is limited by moderate hemolytic activity. the peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation in  a membrane-mimetic solvent but amphipathicity is low. increasing amphipathicity together with hydrophobicity by the substitutions lys(16)-->leu and lys(16)-->ala increased hemolytic activity approximately fivefold without increasing antimicrobial potency. the substitution leu(18)-->lys increased both cationicity  and amphipathicity but produced decreases in both antimicrobial potency and hemolytic activity. in contrast, increasing cationicity of b2rp without changing  amphipathicity by the substitution asp(4)-->lys resulted in a fourfold increase in potency against escherichia coli [minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) = 6 microm) and twofold increases in potency against staphylococcus aureus (mic = 12.5 microm) and candida albicans (mic = 6 microm) without changing significantly hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (lc(50) = 95 microm). the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the gram-negative bacterium acinetobacter baumannii constitutes a serious risk to public health. b2rp (mic = 3-6 microm) and [lys(4)]b2rp (mic = 1.5-3 microm) potently inhibited the growth of nosocomial isolates of multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii. although the analogs [lys(4), lys(18)]b2rp and [lys(4), ala(16), lys(18)]b2rp showed reduced potency against staphylococcus aureus, they retained activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic = 3-6 microm) and had very low hemolytic activity (lc(50) > 200 microm).

TI  == oxa-143, a novel carbapenem-hydrolyzing class d beta-lactamase in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == a carbapenem-resistant acinetobacter baumannii strain was isolated in brazil in 2004 in which no known carbapenemase gene was detected by pcr. cloning experiments, followed by expression in escherichia coli, gave an e. coli recombinant strain expressing a novel carbapenem-hydrolyzing class d beta-lactamase (chdl). oxa-143 showed 88% amino acid sequence identity with oxa-40, 63% identity with oxa-23, and 52% identity with oxa-58. it hydrolyzed penicillins, oxacillin, meropenem, and imipenem but not expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. the bla(oxa-143) gene was located on a ca. 30-kb plasmid. after transformation into reference strain a. baumannii atcc 19606, it conferred resistance to carbapenems. analysis of the genetic environment of bla(oxa-143) revealed that it was associated with neither insertion sequences nor integron structures. however, it was bracketed by similar replicase-encoding genes at both ends, suggesting acquisition through a homologous recombination process. this study identified a novel class d beta-lactamase involved in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii. this enzyme is the first member of a novel subgroup of chdls whose prevalence remains to be determined.

TI  == the optimization of a rapid pulsed-field gel electrophoresis protocol for the typing of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp.
AB  == pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (pfge) is the most common genotyping method used for the typing of a number of bacterial species. generally, investigators use their own custom-developed protocol, but a standardized pfge protocol would allow the comparison of typing results between laboratories and the tracing of strains  around the country. in the present study, we optimized a pfge protocol for subtyping of acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella spp., which are commonly isolated from nosocomial infections in many hospitals. reproducibility of our pfge procedure was studied three times at 2- to 3-week intervals. epidemiological concordance of the optimized pfge procedure was tested on seven isolates of a. baumannii from a previous outbreak and seven a. baumannii isolates randomly selected among the clinical isolates. the optimized pfge procedure was evaluated on a total of 174 clinical isolates including 62 a. baumannii, 50 e. coli, and 62 klebsiella spp. the inter-laboratory reproducibility of the optimized protocol was tested at four laboratories. the optimized procedure is completed in 28 h after culturing. it is likely to be cost-effective, due to the reduction in the time, reagent volume and enzyme concentration needed. the procedure showed high concordance with epidemiological  data. there were no non-typeable isolates among the tested bacteria. it is reproducible and versatile. this protocol can be used to identify outbreaks and monitor the spreading rate of nosocomial infections caused by the tested bacterial isolates. furthermore, due to its high intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility, the protocol has the potential to be useful for comparing pfge fingerprinting profiles of the isolates from different settings.

TI  == the clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  == the continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat  serious infections. the major success of the seven-valent streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. the almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of ctx-m beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the  united states, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumanni, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.

TI  == isolation and sequence analysis of a small cryptic plasmid prk10 from a corrosion inhibitor degrading strain serratia marcescens ace2.
AB  == the nucleotide sequence of a smallest cryptic plasmid prk10 of serratia marcescens ace2 was determined. when compared to the all other plasmids reported  so far from s. marcescens in sizes of over 70kb, prk10 is only 4241bp long with 53% g+c content and has five coding sequences representing a coding percentage of 65.41. this small plasmid consists of one tdh gene, four mobilization genes, mobcabd, and an origin of replication homologous to those of cole1-type plasmids. analysis of the five open reading frames identified on the plasmid suggests the presence of genes involved in replication and mobilization containing sequences homologous to the bom region and mobcabd genes of cole1 and tdh from acinetobacter baumannii str. aye. results also indicate that prk10 does not encode any gene for antibiotic/heavy metal resistance. copy number and incompatibility of the plasmid with plasmids of cole1 origin of replication was determined and it is quite stable in its natural host as well as in escherichia coli dh5alpha. this relatively small plasmid will be useful for construction of shuttle vectors to facilitate the genetic analysis.

TI  == clinical correlation between irrigation bottle contamination and clinical outcomes in post-functional endoscopic sinus surgery patients.
AB  == background: sinonasal irrigation after endoscopic sinus surgery (ess) is a common practice, but the role irrigation bottles play in iatrogenic contamination of the operated sinuses is unknown. therefore, we investigated whether irrigation bottles used postoperatively become contaminated and have any potential association with immediate postsurgical infection and outcomes. methods: patients irrigated twice daily after ess. bottle cleaning was performed as recommended by  the manufacturer. new bottles were distributed at the time of the operation and at each postoperative visit. during postoperative weeks 1, 2, and 4, bottles were cultured. medical charts were reviewed for the presence of postsurgical infection and changes in management. results: twenty post-ess patients were enrolled and examined at weeks 1, 2, and 4. a total of 51 bottles were collected and cultured. overall, 15 of 51 (29%) bottles demonstrated bacterial growth when cultured. during the first two collection periods, 10 of 40 (25%) bottles demonstrated bacterial growth when cultured; however, five of 11 (45%) bottles collected at the last postoperative visit demonstrated bacterial growth when cultured. during  the study, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and klebsiella pneumoniae were frequently recovered during the collection periods. other organisms isolated included escherichia coli and enterobacter spp. although positive bottle cultures were more common at weeks 2 and 4, no postoperative infections occurred. conclusions: irrigation bottles used postoperatively have a  measurable incidence of contamination. contamination rate increases when bottles  are used for longer than 1 week, but this does not appear to result in postsurgical infection.

TI  == intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. and candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == an overview of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns for gram-negative bacteria from the national antimicrobial resistance surveillance thailand (narst) program  from 2000 to 2005.
AB  == the national antimicrobial resistance surveillance thailand (narst) has been initiated since 1998 to strengthen the surveillance program for antimicrobial-resistant pathogens as well as to standardize the laboratory practices in thailand. this collaborative network was funded by the world health  organization, and involved 33 hospitals throughout thailand at the first phase. nevertheless, no prior effort has been made to share the antimicrobial resistance data in the national level. in this overview, the authors provide an update on the status of antimicrobial resistance from 2000 to 2005 among important gram-negative pathogens as well as the implication of these findings. the most striking finding appears to be the emergence of pandrug-resistant (pdr) acinetobacter baumannii. carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii has been dramatically  increasing from 2.1% in 2000 to 46.7% in 2005. there is a trend towards the increasing incidence rates of esbl-producing escherichia coli from 2000 to 2005,  but the incidence rates of esbl-producing klebseilla pneumoniae remain constant during the same period. the susceptibility of burkholderia pseudomallei to various antibiotics, particularly ceftazidime and carbapenems, approached 100%. in conclusions, to help strengthen the future surveillance system, narst needs to develop the data collection tools that include some important patient characteristics and the information that can help distinguish colonizations and infections as well as community-acquired infections and hospital-acquired infections. in addition, an appropriate test for antimicrobial susceptibility including the minimal inhibitory concentration determination should be implemented and carried out for all important pathogens. the narst data emphasized a need to strengthen the antimicrobial stewardship as well as the infection control measures at the hospital level to help reduce the transmission  of antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative bacteria in thailand.

TI  == detection of enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a dna microarray.
AB  == pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (pif). an obstacle associated with pif microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. we have developed a rapid, dna microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with pif contamination based on the 16s-23s rrna gene internal transcribed spacer (its) sequences and wzy (o antigen  polymerase) gene. using this procedure, enterobacter sakazakii, salmonella enterica, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus cereus, listeria monocytogenes, staphylococcus  aureus, and escherichia coli o157 were identified. one hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic dna or 10(4) cfu/ml). twenty-one real pif samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. the data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.

TI  == the pgaabcd locus of acinetobacter baumannii encodes the production of poly-beta-1-6-n-acetylglucosamine, which is critical for biofilm formation.
AB  == we found that acinetobacter baumannii contains a pgaabcd locus that encodes proteins that synthesize cell-associated poly-beta-(1-6)-n-acetylglucosamine (pnag). both a mutant with an in-frame deletion of the pga locus (s1deltapga) and a transcomplemented strain (s1deltapga-c) of a. baumannii were constructed, and the pnag production by these strains was compared using an immunoblot assay. deleting the pga locus resulted in an a. baumannii strain without pnag, and transcomplementation of the s1deltapga strain with the pgaabcd genes fully restored the wild-type pnag phenotype. heterologous expression of the a. baumannii pga locus in escherichia coli led to synthesis of significant amounts of pnag, while no polysaccharide was detected in e. coli cells harboring an empty vector. nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the extracellular polysaccharide material isolated from a. baumannii confirmed that it was pnag, but notably only  60% of the glucosamine amino groups were acetylated. pcr analysis indicated that  all 30 clinical a. baumannii isolates examined had the pga genes, and immunoblot  assays indicated that 14 of the 30 strains strongly produced pnag, 14 of the strains moderately to weakly produced pnag, and 2 strains appeared to not produce pnag. deletion of the pga locus led to loss of the strong biofilm phenotype, which was restored by complementation. confocal laser scanning microscopy studies combined with comstat analysis demonstrated that the biovolume, mean thickness, and maximum thickness of 16-h and 48-h-old biofilms formed by wild-type and pga-complemented a. baumannii strains were significantly greater than the biovolume, mean thickness, and maximum thickness of 16-h and 48-h-old biofilms formed by the s1deltapga mutant strain. biofilm-dependent production of pnag could be an important virulence factor for this emerging pathogen that has few known virulence factors.

AB  == antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (lrtis) in shandong province, china were investigated using data collected from january 2002 to december 2006. a total of  10 337 isolates were characterized in sputum samples from 39 920 lrti patients: 68.72% were gram-negative bacteria, 20.65% were gram-positive bacteria, and 10.62% were fungi. organisms most frequently isolated were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.88%), klebsiella pneumoniae (10.80%), escherichia coli (10.71%), fungi (10.62%), staphylococcus aureus (9.68%) and acinetobacter baumannii (9.03%). imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against gram-negative bacteria. most gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin. susceptibility to cephalosporins was not optimal and resistance to fluoroquinolones was high. resistance of gram-negative bacteria showed a rapid increase over the study period, while resistance of gram-positive bacteria remained relatively stable. the emergence of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents used against lrti pathogens has compounded the problem of using empirical therapy and created selective pressure on physicians to use certain antibiotics.

TI  == in vivo model of human pathogen infection and demonstration of efficacy by an antimicrobial pouch for pacing devices.
AB  == background: device-related infections represent a significant clinical challenge. once established, these infections prove difficult to treat with existing antibiotic regimens, compromising the health of device recipients, and usually requiring surgical intervention to resolve. objective: the purpose of this study  was to determine the efficacy of the aigis(rx) antibacterial envelope (tyrx pharma, inc., monmouth junction, nj, usa) designed to reduce device-related infections by incorporating minocycline and rifampin in a controlled release polymer. methods: an infection was established in a rabbit model by creating bilateral subcutaneous implant pockets, into which a pacing device with or without aigis(rx) was placed. the incisions were closed, and a defined dose of bacteria was infused into each implant pocket. after 7 days, devices were explanted and sampled for viable bacteria by swabbing and sonication. results: initial studies evaluated the ability of the aigis(rx) pouch to reduce staphylococcus epidermidis (s. epi) infection in this model using clinical and quantitative microbial endpoints. results demonstrate s. epi infection in all control samples, while no pathogens were recovered from samples with the aigis(rx) pouch. systemic antibiotic levels were undetectable. additional studies tested the efficacy of the aigis(rx) pouch with additional bacterial strains, staphylococcus capitis, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. in each case, the device and implant pocket with the aigis(rx) pouch was free of any signs of infection. an assessment of biofilm produced by acinetobacter demonstrated the elimination of biofilm formation on the implanted device. conclusion: these results demonstrate that in this animal model, the aigis(rx) device reduces the risk for infection of viable pathogens within implant pockets.

TI  == silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  == the colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective  antibacterial and antifouling coatings. there is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. in this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. the release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited  bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (sem). x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (xps) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. these silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. the broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant gram-negative enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.

TI  == a simple and large-scale strategy for the preparation of ag nanoparticles supported on resin-derived carbon and their antibacterial properties.
AB  == a simple strategy was developed for preparing stable ag nanoparticles supported on carbon by carbonizing ag(+)/acrylic acid type ion-exchange resin complexes under n(2) atmosphere. the products were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (xrd), scanning electron microscopy (sem), transmission electron microscopy (tem) and uv-visible absorption spectroscopy. the results indicated that the ag nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of carbon, and their size could be regulated by tuning the carbonization temperature. the antibacterial assay showed that the ag/c composites possess good antibacterial properties that are determined largely by the ag particle size. furthermore, the  composites are very stable and they do not show obviously change even after storing at ambient conditions for more than one year.

TI  == genetic and biochemical characterization of the first extended-spectrum carb-type beta-lactamase, rtg-4, from acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii isolate kar was uncommonly more resistant to cefepime and cefpirome than to ceftazidime and cefotaxime. cloning and expression of the beta-lactamase gene content of this isolate into escherichia coli top10 identified ss-lactamase rtg-4 (or carb-10), which corresponds to the first reported extended-spectrum carb-type enzyme. rtg-4 is a plasmid-encoded ambler class a beta-lactamase whose sequence differs by 4 amino acid substitutions from  the narrow-spectrum beta-lactamase rtg-3. rtg-4 hydrolyzes cefepime and cefpirome and weakly hydrolyzes ceftazidime due to the single ser-to-thr substitution at ambler position 69. rtg-4 is less susceptible to inhibition by tazobactam and sulbactam than rtg-3. expression of beta-lactamase rtg-4 in a wild-type a. baumannii reference strain showed that it conferred resistance to cefepime and cefpirome. the genetic environment of the bla(rtg-4) gene was made of a peculiar  transposon located on a ca. 50-kb plasmid. isaba9, located upstream of bla(rtg-4), may be responsible for its acquisition by recognizing a secondary right inverted repeat sequence, thus acting by a one-ended transposition process.

TI  == the antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  == acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. the main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused  by organisms such as proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii or pseudomonas aeruginosa. this study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect  of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (hibicet). former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. to cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial  strains were tested: escherichia coli, p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii,  enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) and beta-haemolytic streptococcus group a and b. the tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic gram-negative bacteria such as p. vulgaris, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii. the microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested  at a low concentration of 3%. in comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. an evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic  acid is currently underway. it can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.

TI  == catheter-related urinary tract infection in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries.
AB  == urinary tract infection is commoner in patients with spinal cord injuries because of incomplete bladder emptying and the use of catheters that can result in the introduction of bacteria into the bladder. 145 patients suffering from spinal cord injuries, admitted to the institute for physical medicine and rehabilitation, centre for paraplegia of the clinical centre of the university of sarajevo, were included. the patients were divided in three groups according to the method of bladder drainage: group a (n=61) consisted of patients on clean intermittent catheterization; group b (n=54) consisted of patients with indwelling catheters; group c (n=30) consisted of patients who had performed self-catheterization. from a total of 4539 urine samples, 3963 (87,3%) were positive and 576 (12,7%) were sterile. more than 90% of the infected patients were asymptomatic. the overall rate of urinary infection amounted to about 2,1 episodes, and bacteriuria to 8,1 episodes per patient. 77% of infections (113/145) were acquired within seven days from catheterization. infection was usually polymicrobial; the greatest number of urine samples 1770/3943 (44,9%) included more than one bacterium. the vast majority of cases of urinary tract infection and bacteriuria are caused by gram-negative bacilli and enterococci, commensal organisms of the bowel and perineum, representative of those from the hospital environment. providencia stuarti (18,9%) being the most common, followed by proteus mirabilis (16,3%), escherichia coli (11,8%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10,2%), klebsiella pneumoniae (8,1%), morganella morgani (5,4%), acinetobacter baumannii (4,6%), providencia rettgeri (3,5%). 15,7% of isolates were gram-positive with enterococcus faecalis (8,6%) as the most common. 55,3% of isolates were multidrug-resistant, and the highest rates of resistance were found among acinetobacter baumannii (87,8%), providencia rettgeri (86,7%), pseudomonas  aeruginosa (85,4%), providencia stuarti (84,3%) and morganella morgani (81,0%). lower rates of resistance were found in group c, i.e. patients on intermittent self-catheterisation. eradication of organisms was achieved in only 53 (10,05%) of patients; hence, antibiotic therapy had no or very low effect. significant correlations were found between the method of catheterization and the frequency of bacteriuria and urinary tract infections. the analysis of group c showed a rate of lower urinary tract infection and bacteriuria than the other two groups of patients. the objective of this study is the update of etiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. in addition, possible correlations between uti and the type of bladder  management were examined.

AB  == the antimicrobial activity of cationic n-dodecyl-n-methylpolyethylenimine (pei+)  against s. aureus, a. baumannii, and e. coli was evaluated when the polymer was applied as a coating to various surfaces using a paint-like procedure. antimicrobial activity of pei+ as a function of time was determined using an assay for long-term survival involving placement of single drops of various bacterial concentrations on dry surfaces. these data were compared with an assay  method where bacteria were applied by spraying and surfaces were incubated overnight under agar. pei+-coated surfaces were found to be highly bactericidal after 30 min when bacteria were sprayed onto surfaces. however, when bacteria were applied as single drops, pei+-coated surfaces were less biocidal at short contact times particularly for a. baumannii and e. coli. the observations are explained in the context of the difference in drying time between drops deposited on uncoated surfaces and pei+-coated surfaces and the sensitivity of bacterial survival to dehydration. these results demonstrate that pei+-coated surfaces are  not effectively biocidal for some types of bacteria under certain conditions and  that the method of assaying bactericidal efficiency can greatly affect the results obtained.

TI  == [investigation of the effect of efflux pump inhibitors to mic values of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus].
AB  == the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of efflux pump inhibitors on the minimal inhibitory concentration (mic) values of ciprofloxacin (cip) in fluoroquinolone-resistant 42 pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 42), escherichia coil (n= 97), acinetobacter baumannii (n= 58) and staphylococcus aureus (n= 80) strains isolated from clinical specimens. for this purpose phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (pa beta n) was used for p. aeruginosa, e. coli, a. baumannii and reserpine for s. aureus isolates as pump inhibitors. fluoroquinolone resistance of the clinical isolates were determined by vitek2 compact (biomerieux, france) automated system and confirmed with standard broth microdilution method. for the investigation of the effects of inhibitor agents, the mic values were also determined in the presence of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml pa beta n and 20 microg/ml reserpine. in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, 61.9% of cip resistant p. aeruginosa strains converted to susceptible ones, while this rate was 73.8% in the presence of 100 mg/l pa beta n. in a. baumannii clinical isolates, 8.6% and 15.5% of cip-resistant strains have become  susceptible in the presence of 25 mg/l and 100 mg/l pa beta n, respectively. similarly the mic values for cip have decreased > or = 4 folds in 42.2%, and > or = 2 folds in 30.9% of e. coli isolates, in the presence of 25 mg/l pa beta n, however, there was no change in mics of 26.9% of e. coli strains. the mic values  have also been lowered for > or = 4 folds in 83.6%, and two folds in 13.4% of e.  coli strains by the use of 100 mg/l pa beta n concentration, however, no decrease in mic values was detected in 3% of the isolates. 20 mg/l of reserpine have caused a decrease of > or = 4 folds in 8.75%, and two folds in 33.75% of s. aureus isolates, while there was no change in mic values of 57.5% of s. aureus strains. our results showed that pa beta n causes significant reduction in mic values for cip in the clinical isolates of p. aeruginosa, e. coli and a. baumannii and this effect may be attributed to efflux pump inhibition. in contrast, it was concluded that reserpine does not have a considerable effect on  the mic values of s. aureus against ciprofloxacin.

TI  == [resistance to newer beta-lactams and related esbl types in gram-negative nosocomial isolates in turkish hospitals: results of the multicentre hitit study].
AB  == increasing resistance due to extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) and multiple resistance mechanisms in gram-negative hospital isolates restrict the role of beta-lactam antibiotics in empirical treatment of serious infections. as  the prevalence of esbl producing strains and resistance rates to antimicrobial agents can vary in each center, local surveillance studies are required to guide  therapy. in this study, in vitro rates of resistance to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam were evaluated in 1196 gram-negative hospital isolates in a multicenter in vitro study with the participation of six different centers in turkey between the period of june 2004-january 2005. the isolates included escherichia coli (n= 457), klebsiella pneumoniae (n= 390), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 194) and acinetobacter boumannii (n= 155). in addition, frequency of esbl production and types of enzymes were determined in blood isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae. mics and  esbl production were investigated by e-test (ab biodisk, solna) and the results were evaluated by using clsi breakpoints. pcr analysis was used for typing of the esbls. in e. coli, 26% and in k. pneumoniae 32% of the isolates were esbl producers. among the blood isolates of e. coli and k. pneumoniae, 31.7% and 33.3% produced esbls, respectively. ctx-m (71.4%) was the most prevalent enzyme, followed by tem (49.4%) and shv (46.7%) derived enzymes. ctx-m-15 (69.4%) was the most frequent ctx-m type in blood isolates followed by ctx-m-3 (28.6%) and ctx-m-1 (2%). resistance to imipenem was not observed in e. coli isolates, however it was 1.3% in k. pneumoniae, 28.9% in p. aeruginosa and 52.2% in a. baumannii strains. resistance to cefoperazone/sulbactam was found as 6%, 17.7%, 27.9% and 41.3% in e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii isolates, respectively, whereas resistance rates to piperacillin/tazobactam were  10.2%, 22.3%, 22.7% and 78.7%, respectively. these results indicate that esbl production and rates of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics are high in hospital isolates of gram-negative bacteria in turkey, however, they show variations in different hospitals and ctx-m enzymes are prevalent in these isolates.

TI  == both fmnh2 and fadh2 can be utilized by the dibenzothiophene monooxygenase from a desulfurizing bacterium mycobacterium goodii x7b.
AB  == to investigate the flavin utilization by dibenzothiophene monooxygenase (dszc), dszc of a desulfurizing bacterium mycobacterium goodii x7b was purified from the  recombinant escherichia coli. it was shown to be able to utilize either fmnh(2) or fadh(2) when coupled with a flavin reductase that reduces either fmn or fad. sequence analysis indicated that dszc was similar to the c(2) component of p-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase from acinetobacter baumannii, which can use both fadh(2) and fmnh(2) as substrates. both flavins at high concentrations could inhibit the activity of dszc due to autocatalytic oxidation of reduced flavins. the results suggest that dszc should be reclassified as an fmnh(2) and fadh(2) both-utilizing monooxygenase component and the flavins should be controlled at properly reduced levels to obtain optimal biodesulfurization results.

TI  == microarray of dna-protein complexes on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate surface for pathogen detection.
AB  == a novel strategy was developed for the specific immobilization of dna probes on poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (phb) surface by using the substrate-binding domain (sbd)  of phb depolymerase as an active binding motif. to demonstrate whether this method can be used for the detection of clinical pathogens, the pathogen-specific biotin-labeled dna probes were immobilized via core streptavidin (csa) fused to the sbd. the pathogen-specific 15-mer oligonucleotide probes were designed for four model pathogens, while the target dnas were prepared by pcr using universal  primers. the complex of pathogen-specific probes and csa-sbd fusion protein was immobilized on the phb-coated slide by microspotting. this dna-protein complex microarray was able to successfully diagnose acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. furthermore, the specific pathogens could be diagnosed in the presence of other microorganisms. thus, the dna-protein complex microarray platform technology employing phb and the sbd reported here can be widely used for the detection of dna-dna and dna-biomolecule interactions without synthetic or chemical modification of biomolecules or solid surface.

TI  == [bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  == objective: bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. the objective of this study was to explore application of the combined  detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. methods: totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. the age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by  streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. the aspirate samples were also amplified for dna of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (tem-pcr) and detected with luminex xmap technology platform. results: the total positive rate  by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were hemophilus  influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella  pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187)  were acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. the total positive rate by combined detection of culture and tem-pcr assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were pseudomonas aeruginosa,  and 1.1% (2/187) were enterobacter cloacae. conclusion: the tem-pcr assay may increase the detection rate of hemophilus influenzae b, streptococcus pneumoniae, staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. the combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. the tem-pcr needs further improvement for diagnosis of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae.

TI  == comparative pharmacodynamics for intravenous antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria in europe between 2002 and 2006: a report from the optama program.
AB  == the optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic antibiogram (optama) program has been used globally to estimate antimicrobial exposures for either targeted pathogens or disease states. herein, we utilised this methodology to determine antimicrobial exposures of cefepime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, meropenem and piperacillin/tazobactam against european-derived isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa obtained in 2006 and compared these with results from 2002. all regimens, except ciprofloxacin, provided optimal pharmacodynamic exposures against e. coli, whereas more regional differences were noted with k. pneumoniae. for k. pneumoniae, the carbapenems provided the highest likelihood of optimal exposures. ciprofloxacin exposures were also noted to be low for both p.  aeruginosa and a. baumannii. moreover, for these two organisms higher doses and/or prolonged infusion of the studied beta-lactams was necessary to obtain the desired pharmacodynamic targets. these data reveal regional differences in the probability of pharmacodynamic optimisation as well as the potential utility of employing regimens utilising higher doses and/or prolonged infusion techniques when directing therapy against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == antimicrobial drug resistance in taiwan.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide, but marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial pathogens are found between countries and in different patient settings, especially in asia. in taiwan, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance to macrolides and streptogramins in clinical isolates of gram-positive bacteria correlates with the widespread use of these agents in the medical and farming communities. the relatively low proportion of enterococci that are resistant to glycopeptides does not equate to  the high use of glycopeptides and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in hospitals. the emerging problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. recently, gram-negative bacteria (e.g. pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) that are resistant to nearly all available antimicrobial agents, including carbapenems, have emerged.

TI  == summer peaks in the incidences of gram-negative bacterial infection among hospitalized patients.
AB  == objective: recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. there are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. we quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. methods: a cohort of all adult patients admitted to the university of maryland medical center during the period  from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. results: there were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by p. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; p ! .01), e. cloacae (46%; p  ! .01), e. coli (12%; p ! .01), and a. baumannii (21%; pp.06). for each 10 degrees f increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection  caused by p. aeruginosa (pp.01) and a. baumanii (pp.05). conclusion: significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. for some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. these findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.

TI  == genetic variability among ampc genes from acinetobacter genomic species 3.
AB  == as a part of a nationwide study in spain, 15 clinical isolates of acinetobacter genomic species 3 (ag3) were analyzed. the main objective of the study was to characterize the ampc genes from these isolates and to determine their involvement in beta-lactam resistance in ag3. the 15 ag3 isolates showed different profiles of resistance to ampicillin (range of mics, 12 to >256 microg/ml). nucleotide sequencing of the 15 ampc genes yielded 12 new ampc enzymes (adc-12 to adc-23). the 12 ag3 enzymes showed 93.7 to 96.1% amino acid identity with respect to the ampc enzyme from acinetobacter baumannii (adc-1 enzyme). eight out of fifteen ampc genes were expressed in escherichia coli cells under the control of a common promoter, and with the exception of one isolate (isolate 65, which showed lower beta-lactam mics), significant differences in overall beta-lactam mics for e. coli cells expressing ag3 ampc genes were not revealed. no significant differences in ampc gene expression in ag3 clinical isolates were revealed by reverse transcription-pcr analysis. a detailed analysis of the 12 ampc protein sequences revealed that amino acid replacements (in comparison with those of adc-1) occurred mainly in the same positions, although none were located in important functional domains such as the omega- loop or conserved beta-lactamase motifs. kinetic experiments performed with three representative ampc enzymes (adc-14, -16, and -18) in some cases revealed dramatic changes in k(m) and k(cat) values for beta-lactams. no isaba1 was detected upstream of the ampc genes. our results reveal 12 new ampc genes in ag3. the enzymes showed a moderate degree of variability, and they are tentatively named adc-12 to adc-23.

AB  == background & objectives: antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (icu). present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from icu causing nosocomial infections. special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. methods: the clinical specimens obtained  from icu, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. acinetobacter isolates were identified by api2one system. antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) by double dilution agar plate method. the plasmid profile of  26 antibiotic resistant isolates of acinetobacter was studied. curing of r-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing a. baumannii isolates. plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. results: major infections found in icu were due to acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. the infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. more than 90 per cent isolates of acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. plasmid profile of acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. ethidium bromide cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281, pupi282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pupi280, pupi281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. transformation frequency of e. coli hb101 with pupi281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid dna. interpretation & conclusions: a. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. a. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from icu. antibiotic sensitivity of a. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. therefore, it is very important to target acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.

TI  == nhsn annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the national healthcare safety network at the centers for disease control and prevention, 2006-2007.
AB  == objective: to describe the frequency of selected antimicrobial resistance patterns among pathogens causing device-associated and procedure-associated healthcare-associated infections (hais) reported by hospitals in the national healthcare safety network (nhsn). methods: data are included on hais (ie, central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) reported to the patient safety component of the nhsn between january 2006 and october 2007. the results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of up to 3 pathogenic isolates per hai by a hospital were evaluated to define antimicrobial-resistance in the pathogenic isolates. the pooled mean proportions  of pathogenic isolates interpreted as resistant to selected antimicrobial agents  were calculated by type of hai and overall. the incidence rates of specific device-associated infections were calculated for selected antimicrobial-resistant pathogens according to type of patient care area; the variability in the reported rates is described. results: overall, 463 hospitals reported 1 or more hais: 412  (89%) were general acute care hospitals, and 309 (67%) had 200-1,000 beds. there  were 28,502 hais reported among 25,384 patients. the 10 most common pathogens (accounting for 84% of any hais) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), staphylococcus aureus (15%), enterococcus species (12%), candida species (11%), escherichia coli (10%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), klebsiella pneumoniae (6%),  enterobacter species (5%), acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and klebsiella oxytoca (2%). the pooled mean proportion of pathogenic isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents varied significantly across types of hai for some pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. as many as 16% of all hais were associated with the following multidrug-resistant pathogens: methicillin-resistant s. aureus (8% of hais), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus faecium (4%), carbapenem-resistant p. aeruginosa (2%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant k. pneumoniae (1%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant e. coli (0.5%), and carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and e. coli (0.5%). nationwide, the majority of units reported no hais due to these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == aryl acid adenylating enzymes involved in siderophore biosynthesis: fluorescence  polarization assay, ligand specificity, and discovery of non-nucleoside inhibitors via high-throughput screening.
AB  == the design and synthesis of a fluorescent probe fl-sal-ams 6 based on the tight-binding inhibitor 5'- o-[ n-(salicyl)sulfamoyl]adenosine (sal-ams) is described for the aryl acid adenylating enzymes (aaaes) known as mbta, ybte, ente, vibe, dhbe, and base involved in siderophore biosynthesis from mycobacterium tuberculosis, yersinia pestis, escherichia coli, vibrio cholerae, bacillus subtilis, and acinetobacter baumannii, respectively. the probe was successfully used to develop a fluorescence polarization assay for these six aaaes, and equilibrium dissociation constants were determined in direct binding experiments. fl-sal-ams was effective for aaaes that utilize salicylic acid or 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid as native substrates, with dissociation constants ranging from 9-369 nm, but was ineffective for asbc, the aaae from bacillus anthracis, which activates 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid. competitive binding experiments using a series of ligands including substrates, reaction products, and inhibitors provided the first comparative structure-activity relationships for aaaes. the fluorescence polarization assay was then miniaturized to a 384-well plate format, and high-throughput screening was performed at the national screening laboratory for the regional centers of excellence in biodefense and emerging infectious diseases (nsrb) against base, an aaae from acinetobacter baumannii involved in production of the siderophore acinetobactin.  several small molecule inhibitors with new chemotypes were identified, and compound 23 containing a pyrazolo[5,4- a]pyridine scaffold emerged as the most promising ligand with a k d of 78 nm, which was independently confirmed by isothermal calorimetry, and inhibition was also verified in an atp-[ (32)p]-pyrophosphate exchange steady-state kinetic assay.

TI  == colistin monotherapy vs. combination therapy: evidence from microbiological, animal and clinical studies.
AB  == colistin is commonly the last resort for treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria. in clinical practice, it is frequently used as combination therapy in order to improve its antibacterial activity, despite the consequent increase in toxicity. the available evidence from various studies (microbiological, animal and clinical studies, retrieved from the pubmed and scopus databases) regarding the comparative effectiveness of  colistin monotherapy and colistin combination therapy was evaluated. most of the  microbiological studies examined colistin monotherapy vs. combinations with rifampicin (nine studies) or carbapenems (three studies) for pseudomonas aeruginosa or acinetobacter baumannii infections. a synergistic effect was detected in all the studies examining the combination of colistin and rifampicin, whereas carbapenems exhibited a synergistic effect in two of three studies. most  of the animal studies examined colistin monotherapy vs. combinations with rifampicin, carbenicillin, piperacillin and imipenem for treatment of p. aeruginosa, a. baumannii or escherichia coli infections. mortality rates were significantly lower in the combination treatment arm in three of six relevant studies. however, data from the small number (four) of relevant human studies suggest non-inferiority of colistin monotherapy as compared with combination therapy. in conclusion, microbiological studies suggest superiority of colistin combination treatment, which is in contrast to preliminary data from studies in humans. results from animal study data are equivocal. there is an urgent need for appropriately designed and powered clinical trials addressing this apparently controversial situation.

TI  == evolution of antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli causing intra-abdominal infections: results from the smart  studies 2003-2007.
AB  == study for monitoring antimicrobial resistance trends (smart) is an ongoing global antimicrobial surveillance program focused on clinical isolates from intra-abdominal infections (iai). the objective of this subanalysis was to assess the evolution of the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli (gnb) recovered over a 5-year period at our institution. we tested the in vitro activity of the antimicrobials, commonly used to treat iai, against consecutive unique isolates from iai using microdilution techniques according to the clsi guidelines for mic testing. all isolates were screened phenotypically for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) production. isolates recovered within 48 h of hospitalization were considered community-acquired (ca). over the study period a total of 572 aerobic and facultative gram-negative bacilli were recovered from 510 patients, of which 258  (45%) were ca. enterobacteriaceae composed 91% of the total isolates. escherichia coli was the most common isolated species (52%). susceptibility rates of enterobacteriaceae ranged from 96.5 %-100 % to ertapenem, 96.5 %-100 % to imipenem, 87.7%-94.3% to piperacillin-tazobactam, 85.1%-94.3% to cefotaxime, 89.5%-100% to cefepime, 76.3%-84.8% to ciprofloxacin, and 93.8%-100% to amikacin. esbl were detected in 6.3% of e. coli, 5.7% of klebsiella spp. and 2.7% of enterobacter spp. esbl producers generally had a more antibiotic- resistant profile than non-esbl producers and 16% of them were ca. susceptibility rates to  ertapenem, imipenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin and amikacin were, respectively, for p. aeruginosa: 28.2 %, 58.9%,  82%, 84.6 %, 76.9 %, 71.8% and 82%; for acinetobacter baumannii: 33.3 %, 100 %, 66.6 %, 66.6 %, 66.6%, 66.6% y 66.6%, and for stenotrophomonas maltophilia: 0%, 0%, 0%, 28.6%, 0%, 42.9% and 14.3%. over the 5 year-study period we have not observed significant increases in resistance of aerobic and facultative gnb causing iai to commonly used beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs. a minority of esbl-producing enterobacteriaceae were ca. carbapenems, including group i agents  like ertapenem, were the most reliably active drugs in vitro against isolates producing iai.

TI  == natural d240g toho-1 mutant conferring resistance to ceftazidime: biochemical characterization of ctx-m-43.
AB  == objectives: the aim of this article is biochemical and kinetic characterization of ctx-m-43, a natural asp-240-->gly mutant of ctx-m-44 (ex toho-1), from a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii isolated in a bolivian hospital. methods: steady-state kinetic parameters (k(m) and k(cat)) were determined for a  large pattern of substrates. analysis of inactivators and transient inactivators  was performed to determine the efficiency of acylation (k(+2)/k) and the deacylation constant (k(+3)). molecular modelling of michaelis complex of ceftazidime, cefotaxime and ceftibuten, obtained from molecular mechanics calculations, was carried out. results: ctx-m-43 showed a general increase in affinity towards all cephalosporins tested, with respect to ctx-m-44. carbapenems acted as inactivators with a good acylation efficiency for meropenem and ertapenem and significant deacylation constant for imipenem. mics of imipenem obtained at a higher bacterial inoculum of recombinant escherichia coli were increased. conclusions: kinetic data and molecular modelling of michaelis complex confirmed that asp-240-->gly allows a better accommodation of the bulky c7beta aminothiazol-oxyimino substituent, resulting in a general increase in the enzyme  affinity towards oxyimino cephalosporins. the ascertained potentialities of ctx-m-type enzymes, supported by the kinetic data and the behaviour of the recombinant e. coli at different bacterial inocula towards carbapenems, make a possible evolution of those enzymes towards a carbapenemase activity plausible.

TI  == a phase 3, open-label, non-comparative study of tigecycline in the treatment of patients with selected serious infections due to resistant gram-negative organisms including enterobacter species, acinetobacter baumannii and klebsiella  pneumoniae.
AB  == objectives: to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in patients with selected serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacteria, or failures who had received prior antimicrobial therapy or were unable to tolerate  other appropriate antimicrobials. secondary objectives included an evaluation of  the microbiological efficacy of tigecycline and in vitro activity of tigecycline  for resistant gram-negative bacteria. methods: this open-label, phase 3, non-comparative, multicentre study assessed the efficacy and safety of intravenous tigecycline (100 mg initially, then 50 mg 12 hourly for 7-28 days) in hospitalized patients with serious infections including complicated intra-abdominal infection; complicated skin and skin structure infection (csssi); community-acquired pneumonia (cap); hospital-acquired pneumonia, including ventilator-associated pneumonia; or bacteraemia, including catheter-related bacteraemia. all patients had infections due to resistant gram-negative organisms, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, or had failed on prior therapy or could not receive (allergy or intolerance) one or more agents from three classes of commonly used antibiotics. the primary efficacy endpoint was clinical response in the microbiologically evaluable (me) population at test of cure (toc). safety data included vital signs, laboratory tests and adverse events (aes). results: in the me population at toc, the clinical cure rate was 72.2% [95% confidence interval (ci): 54.8-85.8], and the microbiological eradication rate was 66.7% (95% ci: 13.7-78.8). the most commonly isolated resistant gram-negative pathogens were acinetobacter baumannii (47%), escherichia coli (25%), klebsiella pneumoniae (16.7%) and enterobacter spp. (11.0%); the most commonly diagnosed serious infection was csssi (67%). the most common treatment-emergent aes were nausea (29.5%), diarrhoea (16%) and vomiting (16%), which were mild or moderate in severity. conclusions: in this non-comparative study, tigecycline appeared safe and efficacious in patients with difficult-to-treat serious infections caused by resistant gram-negative organisms.

TI  == differential correlation between rates of antimicrobial drug consumption and prevalence of antimicrobial resistance in a tertiary care hospital in greece.
AB  == objective: to investigate whether there is a correlation between the rates of antimicrobial drug consumption in hospital departments and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among clinically important bacteria recovered in the hospital. design: retrospective study. setting: tertiary care hospital in greece. methods: data on antimicrobial consumption (from january 2001 through december 2004) were expressed as defined daily doses per 100 bed-days. the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterococcus faecium recovered during the same time period were calculated by the microbiology department. we then performed the following analyses: (1) a comparison of the consumption rates for different antimicrobial groups in individual hospital departments, (2) a comparison of the prevalence of resistance to different antimicrobials, and (3) a correlation analysis of antimicrobial consumption rates and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. results: the rates of antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of resistance varied substantially among the hospital's departments. the annual rate of consumption for carbapenems  correlated with the rate of consumption for glycopeptides and third-generation cephalosporins (p < .05). among p. aeruginosa isolates, the prevalence of imipenem resistance correlated with the prevalence of resistance to amikacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime (p < .05). the rate of carbapenem consumption correlated with the prevalence of imipenem resistance among p. aeruginosa and a.  baumannii isolates (p < .05). the rate of aminoglycoside consumption correlated with the prevalence of amikacin resistance among p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and e. coli isolates (p < .05). however, the rate of consumption for fluoroquinolones and glycopeptides had no correlation with the prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance among gram-negative bacteria or vancomycin resistance among e. faecium isolates. conclusions: these data are suggestive of a differential relationship between antimicrobial consumption and the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among various species and for various antimicrobial agents. these findings may help to optimize antimicrobial prescription policies in the hospital, especially in departments that have both high rates of antimicrobial consumption and a high prevalence of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == novel polymyxin derivatives carrying only three positive charges are effective antibacterial agents.
AB  == the lack of novel antibiotics against gram-negative bacteria has reinstated polymyxins as the drugs of last resort to treat serious infections caused by extremely multiresistant gram-negative organisms. however, polymyxins are nephrotoxic, and this feature may complicate therapy or even require its discontinuation. like that of aminoglycosides, the nephrotoxicity of polymyxins might be related to the highly cationic nature of the molecule. colistin and polymyxin b carry five positive charges. here we show that novel polymyxin derivatives carrying only three positive charges are effective antibacterial agents. nab739 has a cyclic peptide portion identical to that of polymyxin b, but in the linear portion of the peptide, it carries the threonyl-d-serinyl residue (no cationic charges) instead of the diaminobutyryl-threonyl-diaminobutyryl residue (two cationic charges). the mics of nab739 for 17 strains of escherichia  coli were identical, or very close, to those of polymyxin b. furthermore, nab739  was effective against other polymyxin-susceptible strains of enterobacteriaceae and against acinetobacter baumannii. at subinhibitory concentrations, it dramatically sensitized a. baumannii to low concentrations of antibiotics such as rifampin, clarithromycin, vancomycin, fusidic acid, and meropenem. nab739 methanesulfonate was a prodrug analogous to colistin methanesulfonate. nab740 was the most active derivative against pseudomonas aeruginosa. nab7061 (linear portion of the peptide, threonyl-aminobutyryl) lacked direct antibacterial activity but sensitized the targets to hydrophobic antibiotics by factors up to 2,000. the affinities of the nab compounds for isolated rat kidney brush border membrane were significantly lower than that of polymyxin b.

TI  == [etiology, epidemiology and microbiological diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections].
AB  == intra-abdominal infections (iais) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  the etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable  and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired iais enterobacteria predominate (mostly escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly bacteroides fragilis). in nosocomial iais, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus spp. e candida spp. diagnostic microbiology of iais is complex and plays a relevant role especially in some situations (e. g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing iais. resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.

TI  == bacterial resistance surveillance in china: a report from mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  == the aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in china. a total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15  cities throughout china. antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by clinical and  laboratory standards institute. the results of the mics revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of  staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of staphylococcus epidermidis strains. penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. five strains of enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. all staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. a high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the gram-positive cocci. enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation  cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. about 65% of the escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less  than 10%. imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant  isolates. combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. amikacin was active against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa. in conclusion,  methicillin-resistant staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive s. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in china. no glycopeptides-resistant staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant enterococci was seldom.

TI  == rat pneumonia and soft-tissue infection models for the study of acinetobacter baumannii biology.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a bacterial pathogen of increasing medical importance. little is known about its mechanisms of pathogenesis, and safe reliable agents with predictable activity against a. baumannii are presently nonexistent. the availability of relevant animal infection models will facilitate the study of acinetobacter biology. in this report we tested the hypothesis that the rat pneumonia and soft-tissue infection models that our laboratory had previously used for studies of extraintestinal pathogenic escherichia coli were clinically relevant for a. baumannii. advantages of these models over previously described models were that the animals were not rendered neutropenic and they did not receive porcine mucin with bacterial challenge. using the a. baumannii model pathogen 307-0294 as the challenge pathogen, the pneumonia model demonstrated all of the features of infection that are critical for a clinically relevant model: namely, bacterial growth/clearance, an ensuing host inflammatory response, acute  lung injury, and, following progressive bacterial proliferation, death due to respiratory failure. we were also able to demonstrate growth of 307-0294 in the soft-tissue infection model. next we tested the hypothesis that the soft-tissue infection model could be used to discriminate between the inherent differences in virulence of various a. baumannii clinical isolates. the ability of a. baumannii  to grow and/or be cleared in this model was dependent on the challenge strain. we also hypothesized that complement is an important host factor in protecting against a. baumannii infection in vivo. in support of this hypothesis was the observation that the serum sensitivity of various a. baumannii clinical isolates  in vitro roughly paralleled their growth/clearance in the soft-tissue infection model in vivo. lastly we hypothesized that the soft-tissue infection model would  serve as an efficient screening mechanism for identifying gene essentiality for drug discovery. random mutants of 307-0294 were initially screened for lack of growth in human ascites in vitro. selected mutants were subsequently used for challenge in the soft-tissue infection model to determine if the disrupted gene was essential for growth in vivo. using this approach, we have been able to successfully identify a number of genes essential for the growth of 307-0294 in vivo. in summary, these models are clinically relevant and can be used to study the innate virulence of various acinetobacter clinical isolates and to assess potential virulence factors, vaccine candidates, and drug targets in vivo and can be used for pharmacokinetic and chemotherapeutic investigations.

TI  == epidemiology of bacteremia episodes in a single center: increase in gram-negative isolates, antibiotics resistance, and patient age.
AB  == increased resistance among isolates causing bacteremia constitutes a major challenge to medical practitioners and institutions. variability between institutes is substantial, and requires the individual analysis of local trends.  an eight-year (1997-2004) surveillance study of episodes of bacteremia was conducted in an 850-bed university hospital in central israel. trends of incidence, resistance, age, and mortality were analyzed. we studied 6,096 patient-unique episodes of bacteremia, of which, 2,722 (45.3%) were nosocomial and 523 (9.2%) involved children less than 18 years of age. the overall incidence of bacteremia episodes has increased over the study years by 39% and the patient  mean age by 7.5 years. gram-negative organisms accounted for 72% of hospital-acquired cases and 69% of community-acquired cases. there was a substantial increase in the incidence of nosocomial episodes, predominantly due to gram-negative isolates, mainly acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, and escherichia coli. increased resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics was noted among gram-negative organisms, including quinolones (in k. pneumoniae), imipenem (a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa), piperacillin-tazobactam (k. pneumoniae), and amikacin (a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa). increased resistance  to oxacillin among coagulase-negative staphylococci was also noted. the all-cause mortality rates showed a significant rise. the patient age, intensive care unit (icu) stay, and hospital acquisition were independently associated with mortality. we describe an increase in the incidence and resistance of gram-negative organisms causing bacteremia and concomitant ageing of the patients with bacteremia. similar patterns have been reported from other localities, and are of real concern.

TI  == effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the risk of surgical site infection in orthotopic liver transplant.
AB  == surgical site infections are common bacterial infections in orthotopic liver transplantation. the purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, timing, location, and risk factors, specifically antibiotic prophylaxis, for surgical site infections. a prospective study was performed that included a population of 1222 consecutive patients (73.0% males) who underwent liver transplantation in spanish hospitals belonging to the red de estudio de la infeccion en el trasplante research network. one hundred seven patients developed surgical site infections. the predominant infection sites were incisional wound (53 episodes) and peritonitis (40 episodes). the timing of the organ/space surgical site infections was slightly delayed in comparison with incisional surgical site infections. enterococcus spp., escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, and acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant pathogens. choledochojejunal or hepaticojejunal reconstruction (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10.7), previous liver or kidney transplant (odds ratio,  2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.3), and more than 4 red blood cell units transfused (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4) were independently associated with the development of surgical site infections. biliary reconstruction by choledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy increases the risk of surgical site infections.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  == a horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (rcws) in taiwan. some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae and proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant pseudomonas  aeruginosa (mdr-pa) and acinetobacter baumannii (mdr-ab), were identified. pulsotypes of esbl-producing p. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. the prevalences of mrsa, esbl-producing e. coli (k. pneumoniae and p. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) p. aeruginosa, mdr-pa, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii and mdr-ab were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0%  and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. among the 44 respiratory isolates of  p. mirabilis with an esbl phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were mycobacterium tuberculosis. among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). high prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in rcws.

TI  == colistin susceptibility testing by etest and disk diffusion methods.
AB  == the accuracy of disk susceptibility methods for colistin against 778 bacterial pathogens was evaluated in comparison with etest using interpretive criteria available from the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi). colistin exhibited excellent activity against acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli isolates (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (mic(90))=0.5 mg/l), whilst it was less active both against enterobacter spp. and klebsiella pneumoniae (mic for 50% of the organisms (mic(50))=0.5 mg/l, mic(90)=16 mg/l). colistin also showed good activity against pseudomonas aeruginosa (mic(90)=2 mg/l, mic(50)=1 mg/l) but poor activity against stenotrophomonas maltophilia (mic(50)=8 mg/l, mic(90)=128 mg/l). only 0.8% of minor errors were observed between the studied methods for p. aeruginosa isolates when the clsi criteria were applied. all a. baumannii isolates with a zone diameter < or =12 mm were resistant and those with a zone diameter > or =14 mm were susceptible according to mic breakpoints established by the clsi. among nine isolates exhibiting a zone diameter of 13 mm, one was resistant to colistin (mic=8 mg/l) and eight isolates  were susceptible (mic=0.5 mg/l). applying a mic breakpoint of < or =2 mg/l for susceptibility in enterobacteriaceae, all isolates with a zone diameter > or =14  mm were susceptible, whilst all isolates with a zone diameter < or =11 mm were resistant. among isolates with zone diameters of 12-13 mm, 59% were characterised as susceptible. major errors were observed only in k. pneumoniae isolates at a rate of 0.8%. the poor agar diffusion characteristics of colistin limit the predictive accuracy of the disk diffusion test and consequently values of 12-13 mm should be confirmed with mic determination by etest or broth dilution method.

TI  == isolation and characterization of an autoinducer synthase from acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the opportunistic human pathogen acinetobacter baumannii strain m2 was found to produce distinct acyl-homoserine lactone (ahl) signals based on the use of an agrobacterium tumefaciens trag-lacz biosensor. an a. baumannii gene, designated abai, was cloned and directed ahl production in recombinant escherichia coli. the abai protein was similar to members of the luxi family of autoinducer synthases and was predicted to be the only autoinducer synthase encoded by a. baumannii. the primary ahl signal directed by abai was identified by mass spectrometry as being n-(3-hydroxydodecanoyl)-l-hsl (3-hydroxy-c(12)-hsl). minor amounts of at least five additional ahls were also identified. the expression of abai at the transcriptional level was activated by ethyl acetate extracts of culture supernatants or by synthetic 3-hydroxy-c(12)-hsl. an abai::km mutant failed to produce any detectable ahl signals and was impaired in biofilm development.

TI  == health effects of exposure to organic dust in workers of a modern hatchery.
AB  == the aim of the presented study was to determine the health status of workers occupationally exposed to moderate amounts of organic dust, employed in a modern  hatchery with an efficient ventilation system. a group of 32 hatchery workers was examined. as a reference group, 50 urban dwellers not exposed to any kind of organic dust were examined. all people were interviewed for the presence of work-related symptoms and subjected to physical and spirometric examinations. blood sera were examined for the presence of precipitins against 13 antigens associated with organic dust, and for the presence of total and chicken-specific  no significant differences were found between the spirometric values in the group of hatchery workers and the reference group. positive precipitin reactions were noted mostly with the antigens of gram-negative bacteria associated with organic  dust. the frequencies of positive reactions to antigens of escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in hatchery workers were significantly greater compared to the reference group (p<0.05). precipitin reactions to gram-positive non-branching bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi and birdactions to antigens of escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii in hatchery workers were significantly greater compared to the reference group (p<0.05). precipitin reactions to gram-positive non-branching bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi and bird  protein, were rare or absent. the mean concentration of total ige in sera of hatchery workers was nearly 3 times greater compared to the reference group, and  the difference proved to be statistically significant (p<0.05). no specific ige antibodies against chicken feathers were detected in the blood of hatchery workers and referents. in conclusion, the examined hatchery workers showed a moderate frequency of work-related symptoms, no decline in lung function and low  reactivity to most microbial and bird protein allergens. these results suggest that the effects of exposure to organic dust in workers of modern hatcheries with an efficient ventilation system are less compared to the workers of poultry farms, such as broiler or egg laying houses.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from turkey--a report from the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program.
AB  == the study monitored the susceptibility of nosocomial pathogens to meropenem and comparator antimicrobial agents isolated as part of the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) program from turkish university hospitals. in terms of minimum inhibitory concentration 90% (mic(90))  values, meropenem was two- and eight-fold more active than imipenem against escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. 40.5% of k. pneumoniae, 23.1% of klebsiella oxytoca and 15.3% of e. coli isolates were extended-spectrum  beta-lactamase (esbl) producers. piperacillin/tazobactam was the most active agent against isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by meropenem and imipenem. against acinetobacter baumannii isolates, meropenem and imipenem were the most active agents. continued surveillance by the mystic program appears to be prudent to help focus on effective empiric treatment regimens.

TI  == in vitro activity of isepamicin and other aminoglycosides against clinical isolates of gram-negative bacteria causing nosocomial bloodstream infections.
AB  == background and purpose: isepamicin is a newly introduced aminoglycoside in taiwan. since in vitro data for isepamicin against nosocomial gram-negative bloodstream infection from taiwan are limited, we compared the activity of isepamicin, amikacin, gentamicin and tobramycin against nosocomial gram-negative  blood isolates. methods: a total of 247 non-duplicate nosocomial blood isolates of gram-negative bacteria collected between january 2003 and december 2003 in a major teaching hospital in taiwan were tested for their in vitro susceptibilities to gentamicin, tobramycin, amikacin, and isepamicin using the agar dilution method. the isolates included escherichia coli (31 isolates), klebsiella pneumoniae (31), enterobacter cloacae (30), serratia marcescens (31), morganella  morganii (21), citrobacter freundii (10), pseudomonas aeruginosa (31), acinetobacter baumannii (31), and stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31). results: overall, isepamicin had high antibacterial activity against the tested gram-negative bacteria. for the 154 enterobacteriaceae isolates, isepamicin had the lowest minimum concentration inhibiting 90% of isolates (mic90) among the tested drugs, while its resistance rate (3.9%) was equal to that of amikacin (3.9%) and lower than those of tobramycin (18.2%) and gentamicin (21.4%). for the 93 of non-fermentative gram-negative bacilli isolates, isepamicin had the lowest  mic90, and a resistance rate (23.7%) lower than those of amikacin (27.9%), tobramycin (38.7%) and gentamicin (40.9%). conclusions: the in vitro activity of  isepamicin against gram-negative bacteria isolates was equal or similar to amikacin and superior to other tested aminoglycosides. in view of its potential for less nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity than other aminoglycosides, isepamicin is a drug of choice for the empirical treatment of nosocomial infections caused by gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == adeijk, a resistance-nodulation-cell division pump effluxing multiple antibiotics in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == we have identified a second resistance-nodulation-cell division (rnd)-type efflux pump, adeijk, in clinical isolate acinetobacter baumannii bm4454. the adei, adej, and adek genes encode, respectively, the membrane fusion, rnd, and outer membrane components of the pump. adej belongs to the acrb protein family (57% identity with acrb from escherichia coli). mrna analysis by northern blotting and reverse  transcription-pcr indicated that the genes were cotranscribed. overexpression of  the cloned adeijk operon was toxic in both e. coli and acinetobacter. the adeijk  genes were detected in all of the 60 strains of a. baumannii tested. the two latter observations suggest that the adeijk complex might contribute to intrinsic but not to acquired antibiotic resistance in acinetobacter. to characterize the substrate specificity of the pump, we have constructed derivatives of bm4454 in which adeijk (strain bm4579), adeabc (strain bm4561), or both groups of genes (strain bm4652) were inactivated by deletion-insertion. determination of the antibiotic susceptibility of these strains and of bm4652 and bm4579, in which the adeijk operon was provided in trans, indicated that the adeijk pump contributes to resistance to beta-lactams, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, erythromycin, lincosamides, fluoroquinolones, fusidic acid, novobiocin, rifampin, trimethoprim, acridine, safranin, pyronine, and sodium dodecyl sulfate. the chemical structure  of these molecules suggests that amphiphilic compounds are the preferred substrates. the adeabc and adeijk efflux systems contributed in a more than additive fashion to tigecycline resistance.

AB  == objectives: to assess the frequency and diversity of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (esbls) in the champagne-ardenne region france, and to identify genetic elements associated with the bla(ctx-m) genes. methods: during 2004, all  the non-duplicate isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii  resistant to ceftazidime and of enterobacteriaceae intermediate or resistant to ceftazidime and/or cefotaxime, screening samples excluded, were collected in 10 public hospitals and 3 private clinics. bla genes were sequenced and bla(ctx-m) environment characterized by pcr mapping. results: in enterobacteriaceae (138/21  861; 0.6%), esbls were predominantly tem-24 (n = 52; 37.7%) and ctx-m-15 (n = 37; 26.8%). three new enzymes were identified, ctx-m-61 (ctx-m-1 group), tem- and shv-type. a. baumannii (n = 5) produced veb-1 and p. aeruginosa (n = 2) shv-2a. isecp1 was detected in 22/27 strains, disrupted in 7 of them. the is903-like element was downstream of bla(ctx-m-14) and bla(ctx-m-16). iscr1 was found upstream of bla(ctx-m-2) and bla(ctx-m-9), and iscr1 and bla(ctx-m-2) were located on a sul1-type class 1 integron. in comparison with 2001-02, esbl distribution among enterobacteriaceae showed an increase in ctx-m-type (44.9% vs  3.7% p < 10(-7)) due to escherichia coli ctx-m-15 and to the almost total disappearance of tem-3 (0.9% vs 51.2%). e. coli was the most frequent species (50.0% vs 5.1% in 1998) despite a similar prevalence to that in 1998 (0.5% vs 0.2%). conclusions: a careful detection of bla(ctx-m)-type spread to other species would help to anticipate clonal endemics such as those observed in enterobacter aerogenes tem-24.

TI  == an oxa-66/oxa-51-like carbapenemase and possibly an efflux pump are associated with resistance to imipenem in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == we investigated the mechanisms involved in imipenem resistance in 23 clinical strains of acinetobacter baumannii. sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (sds-page) analysis showed the presence of a 30-kda protein in imipenem-intermediate a. baumannii (iiab) and imipenem-resistant a. baumannii (irab) strains; this protein was almost undetectable in imipenem-susceptible a. baumannii (isab) strains. the 30-kda protein was identified as an oxa-51-like carbapenemase using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. similar to other recent findings, bla(oxa-51-like) genes were found to exist in all 23 clinical strains; however, the transcript levels of bla(oxa-51-like) in the iiab and irab were higher than in the isab strains using reverse transcriptase pcr (rt-pcr) and real-time rt-pcr assays. this change was due to the presence of an insertion sequence, isaba1, upstream of bla(oxa-51-like) in the iiab and irab strains that was not present in the isab strains. the introduction of bla(oxa-66) (a bla(oxa-51)(-like) gene), identified in isab ab1254 and irab ab1266, into escherichia coli top10 cells resulted in 3.95-fold and 7.90-fold elevations in resistance to imipenem, respectively. furthermore, when isab ab8 and isab ab1254 and their in vitro-selected imipenem-resistant mutants isab ab8(r) and isab ab1254(r) were compared, the results showed no change in the bla(oxa-66)/bla(oxa-51-like) gene sequences, in expression of the gene, and in the outer membrane protein profiles. however, there was a four- to eightfold reduction in imipenem resistance upon adding carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone. taken together, these results suggest that the oxa-66/oxa-51-like carbapenemase contributes to intrinsic resistance to imipenem; however, drug export by an efflux pump may be more important and/or occur more frequently in imipenem-resistant a. baumannii. furthermore, this is the first report of a taiwanese strain of an oxa-66/oxa-51-like carbapenemase that confers  imipenem resistance in a. baumannii.

TI  == investigation of sources of potential bias in laboratory surveillance for anti-microbial resistance.
AB  == purpose: there are a number of biases that may influence the validity of laboratory-based surveillance for antimicrobial resistance. our objective was to  evaluate the potential magnitude of bias in reporting of etiologic agents and their resistance rates associated with inclusion of multiple patient samples and  non-random timing and location of sampling. methods: all urine cultures submitted to a regional laboratory in the calgary health region during 2004 and 2005 were studied. comparisons were then made using either the overall cohort or different  subgroups compared with the "reference" or gold standard population where only the first isolate per patient per year per species was included. results: overall 56,897 organisms were cultured at > or =104 cfu/ml from 53,548 samples from 35,890 patients; 39,835 organisms were included in the reference cohort. escherichia coli was reported in 37,246 (65.5%) of overall cohort and 28,257 (70.9%) of the reference cohort. therefore, the overall cohort resulted in a relative underestimation of the importance of e. coli as the principal cause of urinary tract infections by 8%. similarly, reported rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents most notably ciprofloxacin [6,480/52,544 (12.3%) vs. 2,647/37,086 (7.1%)], gentamicin [2,991/48,070 (6.2%) vs. 1,567/34,608 (4.5%)], and ceftriaxone [1,737/44,922 (3.9%) vs. 889/32,745 (2.7%)] were higher in the overall than in the reference cohorts. there were large differences in both the distribution of organisms and rates of resistance associated with sampling during different times of the day, week, and year as well as from acute care hospitals and outpatient clinics (p< or =0.001). conclusions: reports from laboratory-based surveillance studies may be biased depending on the population studied and method of sampling employed. care must be taken in interpreting results of surveillance  studies that do not protect from these major sources of bias.

TI  == pharmacodynamic target attainment of seven antimicrobials against gram-negative bacteria collected from china in 2003 and 2004.
AB  == using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data derived from a chinese national surveillance study and pharmacokinetic data collected in chinese individuals, a 5000-subject monte carlo simulation was conducted to determine the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for cefoperazone/sulbactam, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem and meropenem against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa collected during 2003 and 2004. the carbapenems had the highest cfrs against the  enterobacteriaceae (94.7-100%) and a. baumannii (66.0-86.3%). ceftazidime, meropenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam obtained the greatest cfrs against p. aeruginosa (73.9-86.6% in southern china and 64.8-82.1% in northern china). all other cephalosporin and ciprofloxacin regimens achieved < or =50% cfr against all bacterial species. meropenem 2g every 8h as a 3-h infusion displayed ca. 90% cfr  against a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. pharmacodynamic analyses are useful for selecting optimal compounds and dosing regimens as initial empirical therapy against these organisms in china.

TI  == antimicrobial activity against gram negative bacilli from yaounde central hospital, cameroon.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance among bacteria pathogens is a world-wide issue. the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of common pathogenic bacteria are essential to guide empirical and pathogen-specific therapy; unfortunately, these data are scarse in cameroon. objective: to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of gram-negative bacilli isolated in yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology. methods: gram-negative bacilli isolates (n = 505), obtained from a wide range of clinical specimens (urine, pus and blood) in  yaounde central hospital laboratory of bacteriology between march 1995 and april  1998, were evaluated for resistance to antibiotics (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, piperacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam, imipenem, gentamicin, tobramicin, ofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) by the kirby-bauer disk diffusion method. results: high rates of resistance were found in most of the bacteria studied. resistance to all isolates was mostly observed for amoxicillin (87%), piperacillin (74%) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (73%). susceptibilities to third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime, ceftazidime) and monobactame (aztreonam) were = 91% for escherichia coli, = 71% for klebsiella spp., = 98% for proteus mirabilis, = 50% for enterobacter spp. and citrobacter spp. pseudomonas aeruginosa was less susceptible to cefotaxime (2%) and aztreonam (33%), and highly susceptible to ceftazidime (72%) whereas acinetobacter baumannii was highly resistant to aztreonam (100%), to cefotaxime (96%) and cetazidime (62%). imipenem (98%) was the most active antibiotic followed by the ofloxacine (88%). susceptibility of all isolates to gentamicin was 67%. conclusion: these results indicate that surveillance to antimicrobial resistance in cameroon is necessary to monitor microbial trends, antimicrobial resistance pattern, and provide information for choosing empirical or direct therapy to physicians.

TI  == control of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae in a children's hospital by changing antimicrobial agent usage policy.
AB  == objectives: this ambidirectional intervention study was performed to examine the  impact of a change in antibiotic policy on extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) prevalence in a children's hospital with a high prevalence of esbl production among escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae. methods: the use of  extended-spectrum cephalosporins was restricted and use of beta-lactam/ beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations was encouraged from 2002. all strains of e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolated from sterile body fluids from 1999 to 2005 were analysed for beta-lactamase production and the prevalences of esbl production were compared at three periods; pre-intervention (1999-2001), transitional period (2002-03) and post-intervention (2004-05). results: comparing the pre- and post-intervention periods, overall piperacillin/tazobactam use increased from 2.2 to 108.0 days on antibiotics/1000 patient admission days/year (ad) (p for trend < 0.001), whereas extended-spectrum cephalosporin use decreased from 175.0 to 96.9  ad (p for trend < 0.001). among 252 strains of e. coli (n = 128) and k. pneumoniae (n = 124), the overall prevalence of esbl producers decreased from 39.8% (41/103) to 22.8% (18/79) (p for trend = 0.018). this decreasing trend of esbl production was more evident for k. pneumoniae (64.1% to 25.6%; p for trend < 0.001) than e. coli (25.0% to 19.4%; p for trend = 0.514). the mortality rates of invasive disease caused by e. coli or k. pneumoniae remained unchanged. conclusions: the substitution of piperacillin/tazobactam for extended-spectrum cephalosporins successfully decreased the prevalence of esbl production of k. pneumoniae and e. coli in an institute for children where esbls were endemic. the impact of change in antibiotic policy was more evident in k. pneumoniae than e. coli.

TI  == convenient test using a combination of chelating agents for detection of metallo-beta-lactamases in the clinical laboratory.
AB  == although transmissible metallo-beta-lactamases (mbls) are a serious threat to beta-lactam antibiotic therapy, the clsi currently does not recommend testing methods for the detection of mbls. the aim of this study was to evaluate the capability of double-disk tests (ddts) by using disks containing a combination of the chelators 2-mercaptopropionic acid (mpa) and tris-edta (te) to detect mbls. sixteen isolates (4 acinetobacter baumannii isolates, 6 pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates, 1 serratia marcescens isolate, 1 aeromonas hydrophila isolate, 1 aeromonas veronii isolate, 2 chryseobacterium meningosepticum isolates, and 1 stenotrophomonas maltophilia isolate) producing imp-1, imp-1-like, imp-18, gim-1, spm-1, vim-2, vim-2-like, and chromosomal mbls and 20 isolates (7 klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 3 escherichia coli isolates, 5 enterobacter cloacae isolates, 2 s. marcescens isolates, 1 proteus mirabilis isolate, and 2 a. baumannii isolates) producing non-mbl carbapenemases, ampc beta-lactamases, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were tested. the ddt method was evaluated by using four types of chelator disks (te, high-strength te, mpa, and te plus 20 microl of mpa [at various concentrations]) and the beta-lactams imipenem (ipm), meropenem (mem), ertapenem (ert), and ceftazidime (caz). ddts with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 1:320 mpa detected all mbls and yielded no false-positive  results. some, but not all, mbl producers were detected in ipm-based tests involving the single chelator te or mpa alone or by ert- or caz-based tests. ipm-based tests with mpa concentrations other than 1:320 and all mem-based tests  had suboptimal sensitivities or specificities. ddt with ipm and a te disk supplemented with 20 microl of 1:320 mpa appears to be convenient for the detection of mbls in the clinical laboratory.

TI  == short-term effect of antibiotic control policy on the usage patterns and cost of  antimicrobials, mortality, nosocomial infection rates and antibacterial resistance.
AB  == objectives: in 2003 turkish government released a new budget application instruction for regulating the usage of parenteral antibiotics inside and outside of the hospitals. in this study it was aimed to evaluate the effect of this instruction on the overall usage of restricted antibiotics, their cost, overall mortality, bacterial resistance patterns and nosocomial infection rates in intensive care units (icus) of our setting for march-october 2002 and march-october 2003 periods. methods and results: overall daily defined dose/1000  patients/day of restricted drugs decreased, whereas unrestricted drugs increased  significantly after the instruction. the cost of all analysed drugs in 2003 period was 540,303usd (-19.6%) less than 2002 period. nosocomial infection rates  in icus decreased significantly (p<0.05). when all microbiologically confirmed nosocomial bacteremia cases during the study period were analysed, amoxycilline/clavulanate, ciprofloxacin, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, piperacilline/tazobactam resistance and esbl rate in klebsiella pneumoniae decreased significantly (p<0.05). amikacin resistance in escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumannii increased significantly (p<0.05). conclusion: antibiotic  control is one of the most important and significant ways to save money, and to prevent antibacterial resistance.

TI  == resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. this study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical a. baumannii strains to disinfectants. twenty a. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. the in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. five american type culture collection (atcc) type strains (a. baumannii, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. all disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. with most of the disinfectants  tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. no significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be  required to confirm this. resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably  not a major factor in the epidemic spread of a. baumannii. however, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.

TI  == prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of treat, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  == background: prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. we assessed the ability of treat, a  computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. methods: treat uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. we included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the treat system in israel, germany and italy. discriminatory performance of treat to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the auc with 95% confidence intervals. calibration was assessed using the hosmer-lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. results: the aucs for gram-negative bacteria, including pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). adequate calibration was demonstrated for any gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for e. coli. discrimination and calibration were acceptable for enterococcus spp. (auc 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for staphylococcus aureus (auc 0.63, 0.55-0.71). the few infections caused by candida spp. and clostridium difficile were well predicted (aucs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). the coverage with treat's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all  pathogens, except candida spp. conclusions: treat predicted individual pathogens  causing infection well. prediction of s. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. treat can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. the system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility profile of selected bacteraemic pathogens from private institutions in south africa.
AB  == objectives: the national antimicrobial surveillance forum is a continuous surveillance organisation comprising all academic/public and private sector laboratories in south africa. methods: the antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter species, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and staphylococcus aureus from patients in private hospitals in five major centres were investigated. antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by 12 participating laboratories according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute (clsi) guidelines. extended-spectrum b-lactamase (esbl) production was  determined in selected species of enterobacteriaceae irrespective of source. results: the overall prevalence of ampicillin resistance in blood culture isolates of e. coli (n = 471) was 84%, and 20% were resistant to the fluoroquinolones. considerable geographical differences were noted between the centres with regard to the k. pneumoniae (n = 636) resistance rates for ceftriaxone and/or cefotaxime (39 - 87%). the most active agents in the enterobacter spp. (n = 244) were imipenem/meropenem, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and cefepime, with 100%, 94%, 88%, 87% and 80% susceptibility, respectively. carbapenem resistance in p. aeruginosa (n = 382) varied between 42% and 45%, and in the case of a. baumannii (n = 190) resistance varied between 32%  and 33% for meropenem and imipenem respectively. the nationwide incidence of oxacillin resistance in s. aureus (n = 629) was 36%. overall, the prevalence of esbl production among all isolates of k. pneumoniae was 26% (n = 7 514), while in enterobacter spp. it was 12% (n = 4 031) and in e. coli 5% (n = 28 412). conclusions: the data highlight the widespread problem of antibiotic resistance among important bacteraemic pathogens in private institutions in south africa. continued surveillance is vital to guide appropriate empirical therapy for invasive infections.

AB  == based on the instructions of the national organization of pharmaceutical agents (greece) from july 1, 2003, quinolones, 3( rd )and 4(th )generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactams, glycopeptides, oxazolidinones, and streptogramins were considered as "restricted" antibiotics that could be used only with the approval of an infectious disease specialist. we analyzed the effect of the policy on the consumption and cost of antibiotics as a group and of specific classes, adjusted for the patient load, as well as on the antimicrobial  resistance of isolated bacteria. we analyzed 5 trimesters (2 prior and 3 after the implementation of the new policy). a 20% and 16% reduction in adjusted consumption [in daily defined doses (ddds)] and cost, respectively, of the restricted antibiotics was accomplished during the first trimester after implementation of the new policy. however, this was accompanied by a 36% and 56%  increase in adjusted consumption and cost, respectively, of unrestricted antibiotics. a logistic regression model that we performed showed that the new policy had an independent positive effect on the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of pseudomonas aeruginosa (p=0.051) but not of acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli isolates. our data suggest that there are considerable limitations to the programs aiming to reduce the consumption of restricted antibiotics through the approval of their use by specialists, at least in some settings.

AB  == we have developed a novel high-throughput pcr-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (pcr-ldr-ce) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus aureus, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, enterococcus faecium, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae, streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, neisseria meningitidis, bacteroides fragilis, bacillus anthracis, yersinia pestis, francisella tularensis, and brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. the method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16s rrna gene, using universal pcr primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent ldr. the ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by ce. each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to  distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. the assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. the ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the united states. in summary, the pcr-ldr-ce assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of  20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.

AB  == objectives: the main objective of the present study was to demonstrate the presence of a beta-lactamase ampc gene in the chromosome of the non-pathogenic bacterium acinetobacter baylyi adp1. methods: beta-lactam mics were determined by etest. the ampc gene was amplified by pcr, with specific oligonucleotides, then cloned into pbgs18 and pat-ra plasmids and transformed into escherichia coli tg1  and parental a. baylyi as hosts. the gene was sequenced and analysed. the ampc protein was expressed, purified by affinity chromatography and the kinetic parameters determined. results: an ampc gene was amplified from the adp1 genome.  sequencing of the gene showed typical svsk and ktg domains and the typical yxn class c motif. the amplified gene showed significant identity (48.5% to 49.3%) with the ampc enzymes of acinetobacter baumannii and ag3 strains, which have recently been renamed adc-1 to adc-7. mic analysis revealed a cephalosporinase profile for the e. coli tg1 clone as well as for the parental a. baylyi strain that overexpressed the ampc gene cloned under the control of an external promoter. analysis of kinetic parameters of the purified enzyme showed higher catalytic efficiency for cefalotin than for ampicillin. conclusions: this study represents the first report of an ampc beta-lactamase in a. baylyi, which was shown by biochemical and microbiological experiments to have a typical cephalosporinase profile. the presence of the respective gene in the chromosome of a. baylyi adp1 suggested that this ampc gene is the naturally occurring cephalosporinase in this species, as previously reported for other acinetobacter  spp. we tentatively named the enzyme adc-8.

AB  == in the present study, samples of pond water, sediment and farmed species were collected at 12 fish and shrimp farms in malaysia, thailand and vietnam to determine the biodiversity and environmental distribution of chloramphenicol-resistant (cmr) mesophilic heterotrophs in southeast asian aquaculture sites. following isolation on iso-sensitest agar supplemented with 35mug ml(-1) cm and dereplication using (gtg)(5)-pcr fingerprinting, 557 genotypically unique cmr strains were subjected to polyphasic identification. the 557 mesophilic heterotrophic cmr isolates represented 18 different genera largely dominated by the genera escherichia (40.2%), pseudomonas (11.7%), acinetobacter (11.1%), klebsiella (7.5%) and bacillus (5.9%). a total of 439 cmr isolates were  further assigned to 31 described species or species groups, mainly including organisms that have been associated with various human opportunistic infections such as escherichia coli (n=219), pseudomonas putida (n=47), klebsiella pneumoniae (n=38) and acinetobacter baumannii (n=23). strains of escherichia, and most notably, of e. coli, were the only common group of cmr heterotrophs irrespective of country, sample type or farm type. together with other predominant but less widespread groups such as acinetobacters and pseudomonads, the results of this biodiversity study suggest that e. coli can be regarded as a  potential indicator of cm resistance in southeast asian aquaculture environments.

AB  == although pharmacodynamic (pd) modeling is now being considered for decision support for susceptibility breakpoint determination against gram-negative bacteria, these pd-derived breakpoints should be verified using a clinically applicable population of organisms. in this analysis, a 5000-patient monte carlo  simulation was used to determine pd breakpoints, the highest 2-fold mic in which  the probability of bactericidal target attainment (pta) remained > or = 90%. percent susceptibilities for 639 pseudomonas aeruginosa, 103 acinetobacter baumannii, 705 escherichia coli, and 418 klebsiella spp. collected during the 2004 meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance study were then defined according to the pd-derived breakpoint (%s(pd)) and compared with the current clinical laboratory standards institute (clsi)-defined  breakpoints (%s(clsi)). %s(pd) and %s(clsi) were compared with the bactericidal pta for each pathogen population to determine the degree of agreement. resulting  pd breakpoints were drug and dose dependent; moreover, values were commonly 2 to  4 mic dilutions lower than clsi breakpoints. overall, %s(pd) more closely agreed  with the pta for the tested beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone dosing regimens. in contrast, %s(clsi) overestimated pta for many dosing regimens, especially against pseudomonas: piperacillin/tazobactam 4.5 g qid (+9.7%), ciprofloxacin 0.4 g bid (+13.7%) and 0.4 g tid (+9.3%), and levofloxacin 0.5 g every 24 h (+22.4%) and 0.75 g every 24 h (+9.9%). differences were most pronounced against the nonfermenting gram-negative bacteria and were not observed among the enterobacteriaceae. as a result, a new method of breakpoint classification is proposed, which is dosing regimen and pathogen specific, and is designed to denote isolates as susceptible only if target bactericidal exposures are achievable with the dosing regimen selected.

TI  == pharmacodynamic target attainment of six beta-lactams and two fluoroquinolones against pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and klebsiella species collected from united states intensive care units in 2004.
AB  == study objective: to determine the likelihood that antibiotic regimens achieve bactericidal pharmacodynamic exposures against common nosocomial pathogens. design: pharmacodynamic monte carlo simulation model. data source: microbiologic  data generated from isolates from the 14 centers in the united states in the 2004 meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection (mystic) surveillance study. patients: five thousand simulated patients with infection. measurements and main results: pharmacokinetic profiles of the patients were simulated to determine the bactericidal cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for commonly used intravenous regimens of cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli, and klebsiella species. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin had cfrs among the lowest of all drugs against all pathogens, especially p. aeruginosa (40.4-65.5%) and a. baumannii (43.6-48.2%). the low cfr of about 78% against e. coli with these two agents was  of particular concern. among the beta-lactams, only high-dose cefepime and ceftazidime regimens achieved cfrs of greater than 90% against p. aeruginosa, followed by cefepime 2 g every 12 hours and the carbapenems (86.3-89.7%). no regimen achieved an optimum cfr for a. baumannii. all beta-lactam regimens achieved a greater-than-90% likelihood of having bactericidal cfrs against enterobacteriaceae. conclusion: because of the continual evolution of resistance  among gram-negative bacteria in the united states, reevaluation of optimum dosing strategies for beta-lactam and fluoroquinolone antibiotics is necessary.

TI  == acinetobacter baumannii lipopolysaccharides are potent stimulators of human monocyte activation via toll-like receptor 4 signalling.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a major nosocomial pathogen and frequent cause of hospital-acquired pneumonia, surgical wound infections and sepsis. as very little is known of the endotoxic potential of a. baumannii lipopolysaccharide (lps) with respect to human cells or of its ability to stimulate inflammatory signalling via human toll-like receptors (tlrs), the biological activity of these endotoxins was investigated in human monocytic thp-1 cells and in tlr-deficient hek-293 cells transfected with human tlr2 and tlr4 constructs. endotoxins derived from five clinical isolates of a. baumannii and one of acinetobacter 'genomospecies 9' showed high potency, which was comparable to that of escherichia coli strain r1 nctc 13114 lps, in the induction of the limulus amoebocyte reaction and interleukin 8 and tumour necrosis factor alpha release from thp-1 cells. whole uv-killed cells of a. baumannii and acinetobacter 'genomospecies 9' stimulated both tlr2- and tlr4-dependent signalling, whereas pure endotoxins of all investigated strains induced signalling via tlr4, but not tlr2.

TI  == a novel antibacterial gene transfer treatment for multidrug-resistant acinetobacter baumannii-induced burn sepsis.
AB  == sepsis caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial infections in critically injured patients has become a major clinical problem. recently, acinetobacter baumannii (ab) wound infections, especially in our critically injured soldiers fighting in  iraq and afghanistan, is posing a major clinical problem and an economic burden.  conjugon, inc., has developed a novel antibacterial therapeutic technology using  bacterial conjugation. the donor cells are attenuated escherichia coli carrying a conjugative plasmid. the expression of bactericidal genes cloned on the plasmid is tightly repressed in the donor cells but becomes de-repressed once mobilized into a pathogen and disrupts protein synthesis. here, we tested the efficacy of this novel conjugation technology to control and eradicate a drug-resistant clinical isolate of ab wound infection both in vitro and in a murine burn sepsis  model. c57blk/6j mice were divided into burn (b) and burn sepsis (bs) groups. all animals received a 12% tbsa dorsal scald full-thickness burn. the bs group was inoculated with multidrug-resistant ab (1 x 10(5) colony-forming units [cfu]) at  the burn wound site. bs animals were either untreated or treated with increasing  concentrations (10(3) - 19(10) cfu) of attenuated donor e. coli encoding bactericidal proteins. the survival rate was monitored for 10 days. the ability of donor cells to significantly diminish ab levels in the burn wound 24 hours after injury was determined by quantitative cultures. donor cells were highly effective in killing ab in vitro. in the burn sepsis model, 90% b group animals survived, and 40% to 50% bs animals survived with no treatment in 5 to 6 days. treatment with donor cells at 10(10) to 10(6) provided significant survival advantage (p < .05). quantitative cultures of burn wounds revealed that ab numbers increased from 3 x 10(4) cfu to 7.8 +/- 4.4 x 10(9) cfu in 24 hours in the untreated group. single treatment with donor cells (10(10) cfu) significantly reduced ab in the burn wound to less than the levels seeded into the wound (1.23  +/- 0.5 x 10(4) cfu; p < .05). taken together, these results indicate that this novel technology is an efficient method to control drug-resistant ab burn wound infections and prevent their systemic spread.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance surveillance: vira study 2006].
AB  == introduction: the objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two vira studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. methods: in february 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant haemophilus  influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli (365), pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and acinetobacter baumannii (92). the hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. susceptibility was determined with  a broth microdilution method. results: among the non-penicillin-susceptible s. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). among mrsa, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin mic of 4  microg/ml. the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing e. coli was 12.1%. resistance of a. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). conclusion: these results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.

TI  == [antimicrobial resistance in gram negative bacteria isolated from intensive care  units of colombian hospitals, whonet 2003, 2004 and 2005].
AB  == introduction: surveillance systems play a key role in the detection and control of bacterial resistance. it is necessary to constantly collect information from all institutions because the mechanisms of bacterial resistance can operate in different ways between countries, cities and even in hospitals in the same area.  therefore local information is important in order to learn about bacterial behaviour and design appropriate interventions for each institution. between january 2003 and december 2004, the centro internacional de entrenamiento e investigaciones medicas (cideim) developed a surveillance project in 10 tertiary  hospitals in 6 cities of colombia. objectives: describe the trends of antibiotic  resistance among the isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomona aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae, five of  the most prevalent nosocomial gram negative pathogens. materials and methods: the susceptibility tests were performed by automated methods in 9 hospitals and by kirby bauer in 1 hospital. antibiotics with known activity against gram negatives, according to the clinical laboratory standards institute guidelines, were selected. the laboratories performed internal and external quality controls. during the study period, the information was downloaded monthly from the databases of each microbiology laboratory and sent to cideim where it was centralized in a database using the system whonet 5.3. results: the high resistance rates reported especially for a. baumannii, evidenced the presence of  multidrug resistant bacteria in both icus and wards at every studied institution. conclusions: the creation of a national surveillance network to improve our capabilities to detect, follow up, and control the antibiotic resistance in colombia is urgently needed.

AB  == background: investigators who perform pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (pk-pd) modeling with monte carlo simulation have historically not stratified microbiological data by culture site. this lack of stratification might be problematic if susceptibility patterns differ among sites and might lead to differences in pk-pd. objective: this study compared the pk-pd of 2 antimicrobial regimens against 5 gram-negative bacterial species form 3 culture sites. methods: this data analysis was performed at the department of pharmacology, the university of texas health science center, san antonio, texas. blood, pulmonary (ie, bronchial, endotracheal, lung, respiratory, sputum, and tracheal secretions), and wound distributions of mics were extracted from the 2002 intensive care unit surveillance system database. bacteria included acinetobacter baumannii, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the pk properties of piperacillin/tazobactam (3.375 g every 4 hours) and piperacillin (3 g every 4 hours) were obtained from studies in healthy volunteers. monte carlo simulation was used in 10,000 patients for each antimicrobial-bacteria-culture site combination. the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for a free percentage time above the mic of > or =50% was determined for each combination, and a clinically significant difference was defined a priori as > or =10%. results: data from 2408 pulmonary, 490 blood, and  242 wound isolates were included. for piperacillin/tazobactam, the cfr varied <10% by culture site in all 5 bacterial species. site-specific differences were noted in mic50 for piperacillin versus e cloacae and e coli and mic90 for piperacillin/tazobactam versus k pneumoniae and p aeruginosa. likewise, for piperacillin, the cfr was similar among the 3 culture sites for p aeruginosa. however, the cfr for piperacillin varied by > or =10% for a baumannii (blood > wound), e cloacae (pulmonary > blood), e coli (pulmonary and blood > wound), and  k pneumoniae (wound > blood). conclusions: the pk-pd models based on pk properties found in healthy humans and site-specific mic distributions in this study suggest that for piperacillin, culture-site differences subsequently resulted in cfr differences that exceeded a predetermined level of clinical significance. furthermore, these data suggest that traditional reporting strategies for microbiological data (ie, mic50 and mic90) might fail to adequately characterize the mic population.

TI  == visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  == the antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (tio(2)) substrates is induced primarily by uv light irradiation. recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. their antibacterial activity, however, remains  to be quantified. in this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against escherichia coli compared to pure tio(2) and carbon-doped tio(2) substrates. we also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. in the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including shigella flexneri, listeria  monocytogenes, vibrio parahaemolyticus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped tio(2) substrates than by pure tio(2) substrates. these findings suggest that nitrogen-doped tio(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.

TI  == pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic rationale for cefepime dosing regimens in intensive care units.
AB  == objectives: (i) to develop a population pharmacokinetics (pk) model for cefepime  in patients in intensive care units (icus). (ii) to assess the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic profile of various cefepime dosing regimens and to assess their expected probability of target attainment (=pta expectation value) against common icu pathogens such as escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii. methods: thirteen icu patients received cefepime 2 g 12 hourly intravenous (3 min). twelve blood samples were taken on two occasions: (i) immediately after initial dose; and (ii) between days 3 and 6 after starting therapy. population pk models were developed  using nonmem. based on the final covariate model, monte carlo simulations were undertaken (n=1000) to simulate free-drug concentrations of cefepime for two administration methods: (i) intermittent bolus administration (iba); and (ii) continuous infusion (ci). concentration-time profiles were evaluated by the probability of achieving free-drug concentration above the mic for >65% of the dosing interval. finally, using local mic distributions of e. coli, k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii the pta expectation values for each dosing administration method were evaluated. results: a three-compartment model with zero-order input best described the concentration-time data. the pta expectation values for e. coli and k. pneumoniae were >90% in all ci doses but only when administered as 1 g every 6 h and higher daily doses for iba. for the current treatment protocol, 2 g every 12 h, p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii achieved target concentrations of only 54% and 28%, respectively. for p. aeruginosa, a ci of at least 4 g/day was required to achieve a pta expectation value>90% while for a. baumannii a 6 g/day ci only achieved a pta expectation value of 75%. conclusions: when given as iba or ci for e. coli and k. pneumoniae, cefepime should be successful in achieving the bactericidal target. for p. aeruginosa higher doses of cefepime (>4 g/day) are required to achieve the required pta expectation value. cefepime fails to achieve the bactericidal target even when administered at high doses, e.g. 6 g/day, for a. baumannii.

TI  == microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  == background: surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. methods: non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the phoenix system in 2003-2005. epidemiologic data were extracted using epicenter and powerlab. during selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. results: the specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). isolates of escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant staphylococcus aureus generally declined. highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (mdr) pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. a significant  increase was seen in infections attributable to s. epidermidis and candida albicans. the overall number of enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. it appeared that the tem-92 determinant moved from enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as acinetobacter baumannii. conclusion: the number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.

AB  == multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria are an emerging problem. the present article addresses 2 relevant questions: (1) should active surveillance be performed to identify patients colonized with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria, and (2) should contact isolation precautions be taken with patients colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria? data and variables that are needed to scientifically answer these questions are reviewed,  as are existing data on pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacteriaceae (escherichia coli and klebsiella species in particular), and acinetobacter baumannii.

TI  == bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  == between april 2000 and may 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and staphylococcus aureus. one hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa. bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were bacillus licheniformis, three were bacillus cereus and two were bacillus pumilus. seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. b. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. this outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. b. cereus and b. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but b. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except  for quinolones and vancomycin. two deaths were observed. in conclusion, bacillus  spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high  morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. both b. cereus and b. licheniformis may be among the 'new' gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.

TI  == isolation and characterization of heat-modifiable proteins from the outer membrane of porphyromonas asaccharolytica and acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == active porins were isolated and purified from the outer membranes of the gram-negative anaerobic rod porphyromonas asaccharolytica and the aerobic coccobacillus acinetobacter baumannii. the porins from both bacteria appear to be monomers when isolated and purified. both porins exhibited decreased mobility on  sds-page after boiling for 10 min in the sample buffer. after heating, their molecular weight is estimated at 43 kda while without heating they run as proteins with a molecular weight of approximately 37 kda. due to their characteristic heat-modifiability, these proteins were named hmp (heat-modifiable protein)-p. asaccharolytica and hmp-a. baumannii. amino acid analysis revealed both porins to be hydrophilic proteins. these proteins have been shown to be active in transporting sugars when incorporated into liposomes. the permeability  of both porins for l-arabinose was less than that produced by the porin of escherichia coli b. permeability to high molecular weight disaccharides was lower than for small monosaccharides. western blot analysis did not reveal any antigenic cross reaction between hmp-a. baumannii and the hmp-p. asaccharolytica. the results obtained in this study confirm that although these heat-modifiable proteins are pore forming proteins and have similar activity they differ in their antigenicity.

TI  == culture-proven bacterial meningitis in elderly patients in southern taiwan: clinical characteristics and prognostic factors.
AB  == the epidemiologic landscape of causative pathogens and clinical characteristics of bacterial meningitis varies with several clinical factors including preceding/pre-existent medical and/or surgical conditions, modes of contraction,  geographic distributions, status of vaccinations, the study time periods and differences among age groups. in order to delineate the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in senior adults (ages > or =60 y/o) in southern taiwan, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of 64 senior adults (42 men and 22 women, aged 60-80 years) with bacterial meningitis collected over a period of 13 years at our hospital. the prognostic factors between fatal and non-fatal groups of patients were compared. twenty-seven of the 64 patients belonged to a nosocomial infection group, and the other 37 comprised a community-acquired infection group. sixty percent (39/64) of the patients had a post-neurosurgical state as the most preceding event prior to infection. liver disease (13) and diabetes mellitus (6) were the most common underlying conditions of the other 25  patients with spontaneous meningitis. of these 64 patients, klebsiella (k.) pneumoniae (18), acinetobacter baumannii (5), escherichia coli (5), and enterobacter species (5) were the most commonly implicated gram-negative pathogens. staphylococcus (s.) aureus infection was increasing during the study period. the therapeutic results of this group of patients showed a mortality rate of 38% (24/64). the presence of septic shock was the most significant prognostic  factor. in conclusion, for this study group, a post-neurosurgical state was the single most important preceding event for senior adults developing bacterial meningitis. of the implicated pathogens, k. pneumoniae and s. aureus were the most common gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, respectively. the therapeutic result of this specific group of patients showed a high mortality rate; however, the small case number and possible bias of case selection have limited the analytical conclusions of this study.

TI  == tigecycline: first of a new class of antimicrobial agents.
AB  == tigecycline is the first commercially available member of the glycylcyclines, a new class of antimicrobial agents. the glycylcyclines are derivatives of the tetracycline antibiotics, with structural modifications that allow for potent gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic activity, including certain multidrug-resistant strains. the enhanced activity can be attributed to stronger  binding affinity and enhanced protection against several mechanisms of resistance that affect other antibiotic classes such as tetracyclines. tigecycline exhibits  generally bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30s ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein translation. in vitro activity has been demonstrated against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant and glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococci. multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, such as acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing klebsiella pneumoniae and escherichia coli, are typically highly susceptible to tigecycline. the drug also has displayed significant activity against many clinically important anaerobic organisms. this  agent demonstrates a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and minimal drug interactions, and is generally well tolerated, with nausea being the most common  adverse event. it was approved in june 2005 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (sssis) and complicated intraabdominal infections.  currently, a limited number of broad-spectrum antimicrobials are available to combat multidrug-resistant organisms. the addition of new agents is essential to  limiting the spread of these pathogens and improving outcomes in patients with these types of infections. tigecycline has demonstrated promising results in initial in vitro and clinical studies for sssis and complicated intraabdominal infections; however, further clinical experience will clarify its role as a broad-spectrum agent.

TI  == in vitro activities of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against bacterial pathogens isolated from intensive care units in taiwan: smart 2004 programme data.
AB  == we investigated the in vitro activity of various piperacillin and sulbactam combinations against gram-negative bacterial isolates from intensive care units (icus) in taiwan. antimicrobial susceptibility testing of 1030 bacterial isolates recovered from icus of nine major teaching hospitals was performed using the agar dilution method. sulbactam was added to piperacillin either at a fixed sulbactam  concentration of 4 mg/l and 8 mg/l or at a piperacillin:sulbactam ratio of 2:1 and 4:1. piperacillin/sulbactam at a ratio of 2:1 or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam had better activities against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis and serratia marcescens than other piperacillin/sulbactam formulations. for pseudomonas aeruginosa, piperacillin/sulbactam (2:1 or 4:1 ratios) had mic(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) of 64 mg/l (>90% susceptibility) compared with 64 mg/l for cefoperazone/sulbactam (68% susceptibility) and 128 mg/l for piperacillin/tazobactam (82% susceptibility). for acinetobacter baumannii, both piperacillin/sulbactam (either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l sulbactam) and cefoperazone/sulbactam were the most potent agents. adding sulbactam to piperacillin resulted in increased susceptibility rates among piperacillin-resistant p. aeruginosa (53-57% in either 2:1 or 4:1 ratios) and a.  baumannii (38-46% in either 2:1 ratio or a fixed 8 mg/l concentration of sulbactam) isolates. results of susceptibility tests with piperacillin/sulbactam  are dependent on the method used. piperacillin/sulbactam combinations possessed better in vitro activities than piperacillin alone or piperacillin/tazobactam against p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii.

TI  == epidemiology of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing gram-negative bacilli  at siriraj hospital, thailand, 2003.
AB  == a cross-sectional study was conducted from august to september, 2003 to determine the prevalence and risk factors in acquiring extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl) producing gram-negative bacilli (gnb) in patients admitted to siriraj hospital and the outcomes of these infections. of 346 isolates of gram-negative bacteria in 249 patients, 102 isolates from 87 patients were colonization only, but 244 isolates from 162 patients were infections. the common gnb were escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter cloacae. the overall prevalence of esbl producers was  30.1%. k. pneumoniae had a very high prevalence of esbl producers (56.9%). the urinary tract was the most common site for esbl- producing gnb infections. nosocomial infections, duration from admission to infection, peripheral line, urinary catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion and previous use of beta-lactams, cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones were associated with acquiring  esbl-producing gnb infections. esbl-producing gnb were significantly more resistant to antimicrobial agents. more than 80% of esbl-producing gnb were susceptible to carbapenems. mortality in patients infected with esbl-producing gnb (41.3%) was significantly higher than those infected with non- esbl-producing gnb (19.8%).

TI  == predominance of gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  == background and purpose: while nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of  empirical therapy. this study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (nbsis)  surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. methods: during the period from 1996 to 2003 at national cheng kung university hospital, patients with nbsis were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. results: from 1996 to 2003, there were  4,038 episodes of nbsis. the overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. aerobic gram-negative bacilli, gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of nbsis, respectively. the 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of nbsis), staphylococcus aureus (13%), candida spp. (10%), acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and escherichia coli (8%). oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of s. aureus isolates. in contrast to enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. the emerging antimicrobial-resistant gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant a. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant e. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing klebsiella pneumoniae and e. coli. despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. conclusions: in summary, gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing nbsis and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. surveillance of the characteristics of nbsis and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.

TI  == multidrug efflux inhibition in acinetobacter baumannii: comparison between 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine and phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide.
AB  == objectives: 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)-piperazine (nmp) has been shown to reverse multidrug resistance (mdr) in escherichia coli overexpressing rnd-type efflux pumps but there are no data on its activity in non-fermenters like acinetobacter. methods: antimicrobial susceptibility in the absence and presence of nmp and, for comparison, phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (pabetan), another putative efflux pump inhibitor (epi), was tested in laboratory and mutant strains with differing  intracellular dye accumulation and expression of adeb, and in clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii. results: based on a 4-fold or greater mic reduction,  the effects of both epis at low concentrations (25 mg/l) were limited. pabetan had a highly selective action on the reduction in the mic of rifampicin and clarithromycin. at a higher concentration of the putative epis (100 mg/l), nmp was more active than pabetan. this effect was not limited to strains with adeb overexpression, but affected the susceptibility to linezolid, chloramphenicol and tetracycline most, and was enhanced in clinical isolates with reduced fluoroquinolone susceptibility. conclusion: nmp can partially reverse mdr in a. baumannii and differs substantially in its activity from that of pabetan.

TI  == sequence and organization of pmac, an acinetobacter baumannii plasmid harboring genes involved in organic peroxide resistance.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii 19606 harbors pmac, a 9540-bp plasmid that contains 11 predicted open-reading frames (orfs). cloning and transformation experiments using acinetobacter calcoaceticus bd413 mapped replication functions within a region containing four 21-bp direct repeats (ori) and orf 1, which codes for a predicted replication protein. subcloning and tri-parental mating experiments mapped mobilization functions to the product of orf 11 and an adjacent predicted  orit. three orfs code for proteins that share similarity to hypothetical proteins encoded by plasmid genes found in other bacteria, while the predicted products of three others do not match any known sequence. the product of orf 8 is similar to  ohr, a hydroperoxide reductase responsible for organic peroxide detoxification and resistance in bacteria. this orf is immediately upstream of a coding region whose product is related to the marr family of transcriptional regulators. disk diffusion assays showed that a. baumannii 19606 is resistant to the organic peroxide-generating compounds cumene hydroperoxide (chp) and tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-bhp), although to levels lower than those detected in pseudomonas aeruginosa pao1. cloning and introduction of the ohr and marr orfs into escherichia coli was associated with an increase in resistance to chp and t-bhp. this appears to be the first case in which the genetic determinants involved in organic peroxide resistance are located in an extrachromosomal element, a situation that can facilitate the horizontal transfer of genetic elements coding for a function that protects bacterial cells from oxidative damage.

TI  == surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the estonian experience.
AB  == the aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive gram-negative pathogens in estonia. the antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella spp, escherichia coli, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with earss (european antimicrobial resistance surveillance system) protocols. despite the higher rate of gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for gram negative pathogens. the higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (esbl)-producing strains was 23% among klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among e. coli. the inclusion of invasive gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.

TI  == clonal occurrences of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli: report from the  meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection surveillance program  in the united states (2004).
AB  == the meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection program is a global, longitudinal resistance surveillance network of more than 100 medical centers worldwide monitoring the susceptibility of bacterial pathogens to carbapenems and other broad-spectrum agents. between 1999 and 2004, a total of 10-16 us medical centers referred up to 200 nonduplicate isolates from clinical infections to a central processing laboratory. over this 6-year period, the antimicrobial activity of 12 broad-spectrum agents was assessed against 15990 bacterial isolates using clinical and laboratory standards institute (formerly the national committee for clinical laboratory standards) reference methods. analysis of the mic results by year within organism species and/or organism groups revealed a continued decrease in fluoroquinolone susceptibility (ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin), especially among indole-positive proteae (-22.1%), escherichia coli (-17.0%), enterobacter species (-10.0%), and proteus mirabilis (-7.6%) isolates. antibiogram analysis of strains demonstrating multidrug resistance from the same institutions were further characterized by automated ribotyping and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to determine clonality. in 2004, a total of 165 selected multidrug-resistant (mdr) strains produced 64 different ribotypes with the largest representing 31 escherichia coli isolates from 6 medical centers. other clusters were also identified within single medical centers among enterobacter cloacae (6 strains), providencia stuartii (5 strains), and morganella morganii (4 strains). a significant clonal outbreak encompassing 40 acinetobacter baumannii isolates from 3 centers in a single endemic region was identified in 1999 and has persisted through 2004. continued surveillance of these broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents against mdr pathogens appears warranted to monitor the incidence and spread of resistant clones causing serious infections. possible emergence of resistance mechanisms via clonal dissemination  proves to be among the principle threats that compromise carbapenem therapy, where meropenem maintains the broadest spectrum of coverage.

AB  == a range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. the antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive acinetobacter  baumannii (bm4454), using a broth culture method. the rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. all five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against gram-negative bacteria, including enterobacter species, proteus species and e. coli. the spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. acticoat and contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both gram-positive and -negative bacteria. contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for enterobacter cloacae, proteus vulgaris, pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumanii. other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with mrsa.

TI  == making the most of surveillance studies: summary of the optama program.
AB  == antibiotic surveillance studies lack consideration of pharmacodynamics and provide little information about optimal dosing. by using minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data derived from a global surveillance study and monte carlo simulation, the optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic antibiogram (optama) program was established to impart greater understanding of the ability to attain pharmacodynamic exposure for specific dosing regimens and their relationship with percent susceptibility. early optama studies focused on determining the cumulative fraction of response (cfr) for various antibiotics against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa regionally in europe and the americas. later reports considered the prevalence of specific bacteria causing infections to estimate the cfr for empiric therapy of pneumonia, bloodstream, complicated skin/skin structure, and intra-abdominal infections. collectively, the approach of the optama program provides a novel tool that complements susceptibility data to help in the selection of appropriate empirical antibiotic therapy at the national, regional, and institutional level.

AB  == bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in western countries. reports indicate that appropriate administration  of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, klebsiella pneumoniae, vibrio vulnificus, and salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as enterococcus faecium and staphylococcus aureus. the phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of helicobacter pylori and p. aeruginosa, respectively. in addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such  as streptococcus pyogenes, s. pneumoniae, bacillus anthracis, and group b streptococci. all phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.

TI  == n-butanoyl-l-homoserine lactone (bhl) deficient pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from an intensive care unit.
AB  == acylated homoserine lactones (ahls) are self-generated diffusible signal molecules that mediate population density dependent gene expression (quorum sensing) in a variety of gram-negative bacteria, and several virulence genes of human pathogens are known to be controlled by ahls. in this study, strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, escherichia coli and klebsiella  pneumoniae, isolated from intensive care patients, were screened for ahl production by using ahl responsive indicator strains of chromobacterium violaceum cv026 and agrobacterium tumefaciens nt1. positive reactions were recorded for all 50 isolates of p. aeruginosa and 10 isolates of acinetobacter baumannii with agrobacterium tumefaciens nt1. surprisingly, most p. aeruginosa isolates gave negative results with c. violaceum cv026 in contrast to previous reports. this suggests that the new isolates of p. aeruginosa either failed to make short chain ahls or the level of the signal molecule is very low.

TI  == novel acquired metallo-beta-lactamase gene, bla(sim-1), in a class 1 integron from acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates from korea.
AB  == carbapenem resistance mediated by acquired carbapenemase genes has been increasingly reported, particularly for clinical isolates of pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter spp. of 1,234 non-duplicate isolates of carbapenem-resistant pseudomonas spp. and acinetobacter spp. isolated at a tertiary-care hospital in seoul, korea, 211 (17%) were positive for metallo-beta-lactamase (mbl). of these, 204 (96%) had either the bla(imp-1) or bla(vim-2) allele. in addition, seven acinetobacter baumannii isolates were found to have a novel mbl gene, which was designated bla(sim-1). the sim-1 protein has  a pi of 7.2, is a new member of subclass b1, and exhibits 64 to 69% identity with the imp-type mbls, which are its closest relatives. all sim-1-producing isolates  exhibited relatively low imipenem and meropenem mics (8 to 16 microg/ml) and had  a multidrug resistance phenotype. expression of the cloned bla(sim-1) gene in escherichia coli revealed that the encoded enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing a broad array of beta-lactams, including penicillins, narrow- to expanded-spectrum  cephalosporins, and carbapenems. the bla(sim-1) gene was carried on a gene cassette inserted into a class 1 integron, which included three additional cassettes (arr-3, catb3, and aada1). the strains were isolated from sputum and urine specimens from patients with pneumonia and urinary tract infections, respectively. all patients had various underlying diseases. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis of smai-digested genomic dnas showed that the strains belonged to two different clonal lineages, indicating that horizontal transfer of this gene had occurred and suggesting the possibility of further spread of resistance in the future.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides against gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == objective: to test a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides with alkyl chains containing between 9 and 16 carbons against gram-positive (staphylococcus aureus) and gram-negative (escherichia coli, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. materials and methods: chemical synthesis was based on the reaction of 2,4'-bipyridyl with alkyl bromide. antimicrobial activity of the bipyridyls was measured by growing bacterial cultures on mueller-hinton agar in the presence and absence of inhibitors. results: the compounds were most active against s. aureus. the most active compounds had alkyl chain lengths of between 11 and 16 carbons. methicillin-sensitive s. aureus was more susceptible to the inhibitors than methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa). two subclasses of mrsa existed which differed in their susceptibility to the inhibitors. the susceptibility of mrsa strains to the compounds was increased in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. the activity of the compounds against gram-negative organisms was increased when the membrane-permeabilizing agent sodium citrate was introduced. critical micelle concentrations of the compounds were much higher than minimum inhibitory concentrations of the inhibitors. conclusion: the mechanism of action of the compounds may involve perturbing bacterial membranes.  the resistance of some mrsa strains to the compounds may be related to efflux pumps.

TI  == contribution of acquired carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases to carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases are reported increasingly in acinetobacter baumannii. since they hydrolyze carbapenems at low levels, the roles of carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases oxa-23, oxa-40, and oxa-58 in a. baumannii were determined. the bla(oxa-23), bla(oxa-40), and bla(oxa-58) genes were inserted in broad-host-range plasmid pat801 and transformed in escherichia coli dh10b and in a. baumannii cip 70.10 and its point mutant derivative a. baumannii  bm4547, which overexpresses the efflux pump adeabc. natural plasmids harboring the bla(oxa-23) and bla(oxa-58) genes were also transformed in a. baumannii cip 70.10. in addition, the bla(oxa-40) gene was inactivated at its chromosome location in a. baumannii cla-1. intermediate levels of resistance or reduced susceptibilities to carbapenems were observed for a. baumannii transformants expressing oxa-23, oxa-40, and oxa-58. the inactivation of bla(oxa-40) in a. baumannii cla-1 yielded reduced susceptibilities to carbapenems. carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases oxa-23, oxa-40, and to a lesser extent oxa-58 play a role in carbapenem resistance in a. baumannii, and overexpression of efflux pump adeabc may also contribute to higher levels of resistance to beta-lactams, including carbapenems.

AB  == the clinical data of 62 adult patients who suffered post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis, retrospectively collected over a 16-year period, were studied. cases were divided into two groups based on the date of presentation, the first period being 1986-1993 and the second 1994-2001. fever and progressive  consciousness disturbance were the most consistent clinical features - signs that may also be attributed to other postoperative neurosurgical problems. the common  pathogens included staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative staphylococcus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii. an increase in polymicrobial infections and multi-antibiotic resistance during the second period was identified. in the first half of the study, mortality was 22%,  and in the second half 36%. adult post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis has become an important clinical problem. the choice of appropriate empirical antibiotics is challenging and must be guided by an awareness of the relative frequency of various pathogens and the increasing incidence of resistant strains. although high mortality rates may, in part, be related to the primary brain pathology, early diagnosis and the timely use of antibiotics based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential for survival.

TI  == comparison of pharmacodynamic target attainment between healthy subjects and patients for ceftazidime and meropenem.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacodynamics of two beta-lactams--ceftazidime and meropenem--in healthy subjects versus patients. design: monte carlo simulation based on published pharmacokinetic studies. subjects: one hundred and  ninety-seven participants (75 healthy volunteers and 122 patients) from published pharmacokinetic studies of ceftazidime or meropenem. measurements and main results: data on total body clearance and volume of distribution for ceftazidime  and meropenem in healthy subjects and patients were obtained from published studies. monte carlo simulations were performed based on the pharmacokinetics from each study for ceftazidime 1000 mg every 8 hours and meropenem 1000 mg every 8 hours against isolates of escherichia coli , klebsiella pneumoniae , acinetobacter baumannii , and pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from north and south america. we calculated the likelihood of obtaining bactericidal exposures (50% time above the minimum inhibitory concentration [mic] for ceftazidime and 40% time above the mic for meropenem) for each combination of pharmacokinetic study data and mic distribution. linear regression was used to compare target attainments for healthy subjects versus patients. only three drug-pathogen combinations differed in target attainment between healthy subjects and patients: ceftazidime against p. aeruginosa in north america and meropenem against e. coli  and p. aeruginosa in south america. the regression line of target attainment for  patients versus healthy subjects had a slope of 1.04 (95% confidence interval [ci] 0.983-1.093) and a y intercept of -3.73 (95% ci -8.265-0.827, r2 = 0.992). the beta values for slope and intercept did not differ to a statistically significant extent between the regression line and the line of identity (p=0.264). conclusion: the pharmacodynamic target attainment calculated with healthy subject pharmacokinetic data was predictive of patient target target attainment for ceftazidime and meropenem.

TI  == identification of a new allelic variant of the acinetobacter baumannii cephalosporinase, adc-7 beta-lactamase: defining a unique family of class c enzymes.
AB  == acinetobacter spp. are emerging as opportunistic hospital pathogens that demonstrate resistance to many classes of antibiotics. in a metropolitan hospital in cleveland, a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii that tested resistant to cefepime and ceftazidime (mic = 32 microg/ml) was identified. herein, we sought to determine the molecular basis for the extended-spectrum-cephalosporin resistance. using analytical isoelectric focusing, a beta-lactamase with a pi of  > or = 9.2 was detected. pcr amplification with specific a. baumannii cephalosporinase primers yielded a 1,152-bp product which, when sequenced, identified a novel 383-amino-acid class c enzyme. expressed in escherichia coli dh10b, this beta-lactamase demonstrated greater resistance against ceftazidime and cefotaxime than cefepime (4.0 microg/ml versus 0.06 microg/ml). the kinetic characteristics of this beta-lactamase were similar to other cephalosporinases found in acinetobacter spp. in addition, this cephalosporinase was inhibited by meropenem, imipenem, ertapenem, and sulopenem (k(i) < 40 microm). the amino acid  compositions of this novel enzyme and other class c beta-lactamases thus far described for a. baumannii, acinetobacter genomic species 3, and oligella urethralis in europe and south africa suggest that this cephalosporinase defines  a unique family of class c enzymes. we propose a uniform designation for this family of cephalosporinases (acinetobacter-derived cephalosporinases [adc]) found in acinetobacter spp. and identify this enzyme as adc-7 beta-lactamase. the coalescence of acinetobacter ampc beta-lactamases into a single common ancestor and the substantial phylogenetic distance separating them from other ampc genes support the logical value of developing a system of nomenclature for these acinetobacter cephalosporinase genes.

TI  == evaluation of adherence, hemagglutination, and presence of genes codifying for virulence factors of acinetobacter baumannii causing urinary tract infection.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a strictly aerobic bacterium which causes severe infections, however its pathogenic characteristics are not well defined. thirteen a. baumannii strains isolated from urine of hospitalized and nonhospitalized patients with different ages were investigated for the presence of virulence factors. the isolates belonged to biotypes 2, 6, and 9 and were sensitive to imipenem. the majority of them showed resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, norfloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. none of a. baumannii strains presented genes codifying for 17 different virulence factors previously described in uropathogenic escherichia coli, when tested by polymerase chain reaction (pcr). nine isolates agglutinated human group ab erythrocytes, in presence of mannose, but none of them agglutinated group o erythrocytes. adherence to polystyrene was  observed in 7 isolates, and this result did not correlate with that obtained in hemagglutination assay. all the isolates were able to grow in iron-limiting conditions, showing that a. baumannii produces some type of siderophore. however, the genes iuta and fyua, from iron uptake system of e. coli and yersinia sp., respectively, were not present in the isolates, suggesting the presence of a different type of siderophore. the fimbriae of a. baumannii strains that mediates the adherence are possibly mannose-resistant, even though the mechanism of adherence to human epithelial cells still remains to be elucidated.

TI  == risk factors of mortality for nosocomial pneumonia: importance of initial anti-microbial therapy.
AB  == nosocomial pneumonia is a common nosocomial infection and has high mortality rate. risk factors of mortality of nosocomial pneumonia were studied in 132 hospitalised patients who developed nosocomial pneumonia. the overall mortality rate was 64/132, 48.5%. of the 11 risk factors univariately associated with mortality due to nosocomial pneumonia, only the inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy, high simplified acute physiology score and multiple organ failures remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. gram-negative bacilli were still the most pre-dominant causative microbiologic agents of nosocomial pneumonia with pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), acinetobacter baumannii (18.6%) and escherichia coli (5.9%) being the three most predominant pathogens. a. baumannii were significantly more predominant among non-survivors than survivors (13.56 vs. 5.08%, p=0.0418). the incidence rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus was 19.5% higher than previous reports. we conclude that inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy for nosocomial pneumonia is associated with the mortality rate of nosocomial pneumonia, and appropriate anti-microbial therapy improves outcome of nosocomial  pneumonia.

AB  == neonatal sepsis is a major cause of death in newborns despite sophisticated neonatal intensive care. this retrospective study reviewed the clinical characteristics of cases of culture-proven sepsis in a neonatal intensive care unit from january 1992 to december 2001. patients were divided into those with onset of sepsis in the first 7 days of life (early-onset group) and those with onset after the seventh day of life (late-onset group). a total of 270 cases with 325 episodes of sepsis and 353 isolated pathogens were identified and included in the study. the male-to-female ratio was 1.4. the majority of cases of sepsis occurred in low birth weight (75.9%) and premature babies (76.7%). late onset occurred in 71.9% of cases. patients with late onset had a lower mortality rate than those with early onset (11.3% vs 28.9%). coagulase-negative staphylococci (20.1%) was the most common organism isolated, but infection with pseudomonas aeruginosa was associated with the highest morality rate (55.0%). late-onset sepsis was significantly more common in very low birth weight and premature infants. the most frequently encountered pathogens in the early-onset group were  group b streptococci (gbs) and escherichia coli, while in the late-onset group, the organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci and enterobacteriaceae, including e. coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, and acinetobacter baumannii. gbs infection resulted in the highest mortality when the onset of sepsis was within the first 24 hours of life.

TI  == [rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16srdna oligonucleotide array].
AB  == objective: the rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. however conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological  assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. on the basis of special gene sequence, pcr provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. but it is  difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic  agents. oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of  target genes. the objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the pcr product of 16srdna using a pair of universal  primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. methods: by comparison and analysis of the 16srdna sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. a pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight  species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus faecalis, hemophilus influenzae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, and acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. the probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of pcr  using the universal primers. results: the universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and staphylococcus epidermidis, enterobacter aerogenes, streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, neisseria meningitides, citrobacter freundii, bacillus subtilis, and salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human dna as control. the results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could  not hybridize with other bacteria. the lowest concentration of dna (product of pcr) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. the results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. the results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. from the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common  infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. conclusions: despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system,  which contains amplification of the segment of 16rdna from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of pcr products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.

TI  == monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  == the aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. five university clinics and/or regional hospitals in the slovak republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. the most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (cons) (19%), staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli (13.3%), klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacter sp. all cons and s. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the cons and only for 4% of s. aureus isolates. a higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in cons in comparison to s. aureus. enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against e. coli. although 17% of k. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against k. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against p. aeruginosa.

TI  == trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  == background and purpose: the microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. the growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. the aim of  this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. methods: the characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at national taiwan university hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. a total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during  this period. among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. results: the majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%),  and anaerobes (3%). in decreasing frequency, escherichia coli (13%), klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), enterobacter cloacae (7%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major gram-positive pathogens. two-thirds (20/30) of s. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of e. cloacae, 13% of k. pneumoniae and 10% of e. coli. overall, 33% of e. coli and 13% of k. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. conclusions: this study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing  bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at national taiwan university hospital is different from western countries in that gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.

TI  == [epidemiology and drug resistance of the pathogenic microbes in the complicated infection of hematological malignancies].
AB  == objective: to investigate the epidemiological characteristics and drug resistance profile of the infection in patients with hematological malignancies. methods: all the microbe strains isolated from the department of hematology in ruijin hospital between 1998 and 2002 were collected for the assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility and the results were analysed by whonet5 software. results: out of the 536 strains isolated in the department of hematology, 230 (42.9%) were gram positive and 301 (56.2%) gram negative organisms. the first 6 strains of gram (-) microbes in frequent order were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii and stenotrophomonas (xantho) maltophi. the extended spectrum beta-lactamase (esbls)  producing rates of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were 27.3% and 33.3%, respectively. methylcillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococcus (mrcns) was the most prevalent gram (+) bacteria in the complicated infection patients with hematological malignancies, which accounted for 88.5%. carbapenems  were most sensitive for all of the gram negative bacteria, with a drug resistance rate of 11.4 (5.0% approximately 15.8%) of imipenem. for esbls strains, carbapenems and cefapime were the best choice, with the resistance rate of 46.4%  approximately 94.4% and 50.0% approximately 75.9%, respectively. the drug resistance rate of acinetobacter baumannii was 25.0% approximately 41.3% for the  third generation cephalosporin, 22.7% for the fourth generation cephalosporin and 12.7% for imipenem. pseudomonas aeruginosa was resistant to carbapenems, with a resistance rate of 12.7% of imipenem; however, it was more sensitive to the third generation cephalosporin. conclusion: antibiotics should be rationally administrated with more considerations to the characteristics of epidemiology and drug resistance profile of the microbes in the given department of hematology.

TI  == resistance rates to commonly used antimicrobials among pathogens of both bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection.
AB  == this study examined the distribution of organisms and their antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted due to acute bacteremic and non-bacteremic community-acquired urinary tract infection (uti). during a period of 1 year and 1 month, a total of 201 patients and 253 bacterial isolates were studied. fever higher than 38.5 degrees c was significantly more common in the bacteremic group  than the non-bacteremic group (68% vs 48%; p<0.05). escherichia coli, klebsiella  pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and proteus mirabilis were the most common organisms isolated. e. coli was the leading pathogen and it was significantly more predominant in bacteremic uti than non-bacteremic uti (73% vs 49%; p<0.01).  bacteria other than e. coli (i.e., k. pneumoniae, p. aeruginosa, proteus spp., morganella morganii, enterobacter cloacae, citrobacter spp., acinetobacter baumannii, serratia marcescens, and providencia spp.) were more common in non-bacteremic uti than bacteremic uti (44% vs 22%; p<0.01). e. coli isolated from both bacteremic and non-bacteremic patients had a high rate of resistance to ampicillin (80%), cephalothin (59%), gentamicin (29%), piperacillin (61%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (56%), amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (34%), and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid (36%). isolates of p. aeruginosa, k. pneumoniae, and  proteus spp. from the non-bacteremic group showed a higher proportion of resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (netilmicin and amikacin) and ciprofloxacin. the emergence of a high rate of resistance to commonly used antimicrobials (ampicillin, cephalothin, gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, piperacillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid) may have an impact on the antibiotic treatment of patients admitted due to acute community-acquired bacteremic or non-bacteremic uti in taiwan. further studies are needed to clarify the impact of antimicrobial  resistance on the outcome in these conditions.

TI  == optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic antibiogram: data collected in north america in 2002.
AB  == the optama program is intended to examine typical antimicrobial regimens used in  the treatment of common nosocomial pathogens and the likelihood of these regimens attaining appropriate pharmacodynamic exposure in different parts of the world. a 5,000-subject monte carlo simulation was used to estimate pharmacodynamic target  attainment for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin-tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. standard dosing  regimens from north america were used. pharmacokinetic parameter variability was  derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and mic data came from the 2002 mystic program. ciprofloxacin displayed the lowest target attainment against all  bacterial species (41 to 46% for a. baumannii, 53 to 59% for p. aeruginosa, and 80 to 85% for the enterobacteriaceae). increasing the dose to 400 mg every 8 h did not significantly increase target attainment against nonfermenters. piperacillin-tazobactam target attainments were similar to that of ceftazidime against all pathogens. higher doses of both compounds were needed to achieve better target attainments against p. aeruginosa. overall, meropenem, imipenem, and cefepime attained the highest probabilities of attainment against the enterobacteriaceae (99 to 100%). the carbapenems appear to be the most useful agents against a. baumannii (88 to 92%), and these agents, along with higher doses of any of the beta-lactams, would be the most appropriate choices for empirical therapy for p. aeruginosa infection. given the lack of agreement between percent susceptibility and probability of target attainment for certain antimicrobial regimens, a methodology employing stochastic pharmacodynamic analyses may be a more useful tool for differentiating the most-optimal compounds and dosing regimens in the clinical setting of initial empirical therapy.

TI  == pharmacodynamic comparisons of antimicrobials against nosocomial isolates of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii and pseudomonas  aeruginosa from the mystic surveillance program: the optama program, south america 2002.
AB  == the optama (optimizing pharmacodynamic target attainment using the mystic [meropenem yearly susceptibility test information collection] antibiogram) program provides insight into the appropriate antibiotic options for empiric therapy for common nosocomial pathogens. in this report, south america is represented by brazil, colombia, peru, and venezuela. a 5000-subject monte carlo  simulation estimated pharmacodynamic target attainment for meropenem, imipenem, ceftazidime, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, and ciprofloxacin against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. pharmacokinetic parameter variability was derived from existing healthy volunteer data, and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) data came from the 2002 mystic program. piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin displayed the  lowest target attainment against all bacterial species (14% to 24% for a. baumannii, 26% to 37% for p. aeruginosa, and 48% to 66% for the enterobacteriaceae). overall, the carbapenems had the highest probabilities of attainment against the enterobacteriaceae (98% to 100%) and a. baumannii (73% to  74%), whereas cefepime obtained the greatest target attainment against p. aeruginosa (65%). because no single regimen had high target attainment against a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa, the use of combination therapy to treat these pathogens in south america may be justified. because of the lack of agreement with percent susceptibility for certain antimicrobial regimens, the use of pharmacodynamic target attainment may be a more accurate predictor of microbiologic success.

TI  == cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases), an expanding family of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases.
AB  == among the extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, the cefotaximases (ctx-m-ases) constitute a rapidly growing cluster of enzymes that have disseminated geographically. the ctx-m-ases, which hydrolyze cefotaxime efficiently, are mostly encoded by transferable plasmids, and the enzymes have been found predominantly in enterobacteriaceae, most prevalently in escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, klebsiella pneumoniae, and proteus mirabilis. isolates of vibrio cholerae, acinetobacter baumannii, and aeromonas hydrophila encoding ctx-m-ases have also been reported. the ctx-m-ases belong to the molecular class  a beta-lactamases, and the enzymes are functionally characterized as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. this group of beta-lactamases confers resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and monobactams, and the enzymes are inhibited by clavulanate, sulbactam, and tazobactam. typically, the ctx-m-ases hydrolyze cefotaxime more efficiently than ceftazidime, which is reflected in substantially higher mics to cefotaxime than to ceftazidime. phylogenetically, the ctx-m-ases are divided into four subfamilies that seem to have descended from chromosomal beta-lactamases of kluyvera spp. insertion sequences, especially isecp1, have been found adjacent to genes encoding enzymes  of all four subfamilies. the class i integron-associated orf513 also seems to be  involved in the mobilization of blactx-m genes. this review discusses the phylogeny and the hydrolytic properties of the ctx-m-ases, as well as their geographic occurrence and mode of spread.

TI  == the status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan among gram-negative pathogens: the taiwan surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (tsar) program, 2000.
AB  == in a nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance (taiwan surveillance of  antimicrobial resistance, tsar), isolates were collected from 21 medical centers  and regional hospitals throughout taiwan over a three-month period in 2000 (tsar  ii). this report summarizes susceptibility data of 7 common gram-negative bacilli (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, proteus mirabilis, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and acinetobacter baumannii) in the tsar ii collection and compared selected key forms of resistance by epidemiologic factors and with isolates collected in 1998 (tsar i) as well as with data from international surveillance studies. resistance of the 5 enterobacteriaceae species to most of the commonly prescribed "first-line" antimicrobials in taiwan, such as ampicillin (78% in e. coli, 68% in p. mirabilis), gentamicin (19% in k. pneumonia to 66% in s. marcescens), and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (29% in k.  pneumoniae to 70% in p. mirabilis), was high, several of which are higher than other countries. resistance to certain broad-spectrum antimicrobials is also more acute in taiwan than most western countries, such as ceftazidime resistant a. baumannii (73%) and ciprofloxacin resistant e. coli (12%). differences in geographic regions and specimen types were associated with certain forms of resistance in tsar ii; however, the resistance problem is prevalent among both inpatients and outpatients of not only medical centers but also regional hospitals throughout taiwan.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern taiwan.
AB  == background: antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in taiwan. while some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be  unique for specific regions. methods: to determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from chang gung memorial hospital at chia-yi from january 2002 through december 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. results: the most common gram-positive isolate was staphylococcus aureus. escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by acinetobacter baumannii. oxacillin resistance rate of s. aureus was  58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. the penicillin non-susceptibility rate of streptococcus pneumoniae was  52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. resistance to various antimicrobial agents for p. aeruginosa, aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. infections caused by multidrug-resistant a. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant a. baumannii was rarely encountered. antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid salmonella, s. choleraesuis and serogroup b isolates in particular. conclusion: the high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.

TI  == epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  == background: the pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (np) in infants in a pediatric surgical icu after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult icus. study objectives: the primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of np  in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. methods: data were collected between june 1999 and june 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. we retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. results: of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired np after cardiac surgery. the incidence of np was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (chd) compared to simple chd (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). the proportion of late-onset np was higher in patients with complex chd (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). a total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. gram-negative bacilli (gnb) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). the main gnb were acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen gnb were flavobacterium meningosepticum (7  isolates, 8.9%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). the most commonly seen gram-positive cocci were staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). the frequent fungi were candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). most gnb were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. the bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from k pneumoniae and e coli; the susceptibility of esbl-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. there were one case of methicillin-resistant s aureus (mrsa) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant s epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. from 1999 to 2002 in infants with np after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant gnb such as a baumanii, p aeruginosa, and k pneumoniae. however, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. early onset episodes of np were frequently caused by haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive s aureus, and other susceptible enterobacteriaceae. conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset np, p aeruginosa, a baumannii, other multiresistant gnb, mrsa, and fungi were the predominant organisms. conclusions: the pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in np in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of gram-positive pathogens as reported by several  adult icus. gnb still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years  in our hospital. there was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.

TI  == pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem against enterobacteriaceae, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  == study objective: to compare the pharmacodynamics of meropenem and imipenem, both  administered as 500 mg every 6 hours, against populations of enterobacteriaceae,  acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. design: ten thousand-subject monte carlo simulation. intervention: variability in total body clearance (clt),  volume of distribution as calculated by the terminal elimination rate (vdbeta), and minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) distributions (escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, a. baumannii, p. aeruginosa) were derived from the literature for both meropenem and imipenem.  for the free drug concentrations, the percentage of the dosing interval that the  drug concentrations remain above the mic (%t>mic) for each carbapenem-bacteria combination was calculated for 10,000 iterations, substituting a different clt, vdbeta, fraction of unbound drug, and mic into the equation each time based on the probability distribution for each parameter. probabilities of attaining targets of 30%, 50%, and 100% t>mic were calculated. measurements and main results: meropenem free drug %t>mic exposure was significantly greater than that  of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, whereas imipenem exposure was greater for a. baumannii. for both agents, free drug %t>mic exposure was greatest against enterobacteriaceae and less for a. baumannii and p. aeruginosa. probabilities of target attainment for 30% and 50% t>mic were similar between drugs for most bacteria. at 100% t>mic, meropenem target attainments were greater than those of imipenem against enterobacteriaceae and p. aeruginosa, and  imipenem attainment was higher for a. baumannii. conclusion: the probability of attaining lower pharmacodynamic targets for most gram-negative bacteria is similar for these carbapenems; however, differences become apparent as the pharmacodynamic requirement increases. further study of the benefits of achieving this pharmacodynamic breakpoint with a higher probability of attaining targets is necessary.

AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, carbapenems, monobactams, and penicillins. changes in czop susceptibility among bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated from  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (4,154 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2001, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, enterobacter cloacae, enterobacter aerogenes, serratia marcescens, serratia liquefaciens, citrobacter freundii, citrobacter koseri, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, providencia spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas fluorescens, pseudomonas putida, acinetobacter baumannii, acinetobacter iwoffii,  burkholderia cepacia, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, bacteroides fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas. czop preserved its antibacterial activity against m. (b.) catarrhalis (mic90: 4 micrograms/ml) and showed comparable activity to carbapenems against h. influenzae (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. coli was preferable (mic90: 0.125 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cefpirome (cpr), cefepime (cfpm), and imipenem (ipm). the  mic90 of czop against k. pneumoniae and k. oxytoca was 1 and 0.25 microgram/ml, respectively. the mic90 of czop against e. cloacae increased during 6 years (32 to 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against e. aerogenes was preferable (mic90: 1 microgram/ml). the antibacterial activities of czop against s. marcescens and s. liquefaciens were relatively potent (mic90: 0.5 and  0.25 microgram/ml) and comparable to those of cpr, cfpm, and carumonam. czop preserved comparable antibacterial activity to cpr against c. freundii and c. koseri (mic90: 8 and 0.125 micrograms/ml). the mic90 of czop against p. mirabilis, p. vulgaris, and m. morganii was 0.25, 16, and 2 micrograms/ml, respectively. the antibacterial activity of czop against providencia spp. was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity of czop against p. aeruginosa was the most potent (mic90: 16 micrograms/ml) among the test agents and comparable to those cfpm, ipm, and mepm. czop had low activity against p. fluorescens and p. putida (mic90: 128 micrograms/ml). the antibacterial activity  of czop against a. baumannii was comparable to those of ceftazidime (caz), cpr and cfpm (mic90: 32 micrograms/ml) and against a. lwoffii was moderate (mic90: 64 micrograms/ml). most of the test agents including czop had low antibacterial activity against b. cepacia, s. maltophilia, and b. fragilis group. the mic90 of  czop against prevotella/porphyromonas was 64 micrograms/ml. bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and other agents was low in most of the species, ranging from 0.0 to 15.1%. in non-glucose fermentative bacteria, however, the bacterial cross-resistance ratio between czop and cfpm, caz, cpr, or ipm was high, being 36.8%, 28.0%, 38.7%, or 31.1%, respectively. in conclusion, the 6-year duration study suggested that the antibacterial activity of czop against e. cloacae possible decreased, but against other gram-negative bacteria was consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval.

TI  == ventilator-associated pneumonia in a multi-hospital system: differences in microbiology by location.
AB  == objective: to determine whether there were differences in the microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia in different clinical settings. design: observational retrospective cohort study of microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia from 1998 to 2001 in a multi-hospital system. microbiologic results were compared between hospitals and between different intensive care units (icus) within hospitals. setting: three hospitals--one pediatric teaching hospital, one adult teaching hospital, and one community hospital--in one healthcare system in the midwestern united states. patients: patients at the target hospitals who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and for whom microbiologic data were available. results: seven hundred fifty-three episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia had culture data available for review. the most common organisms at all hospitals were staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) and pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2%). the pediatric hospital had higher proportions of escherichia coli (9.5% vs 2.3%; p < .001) and  klebsiella pneumoniae (13% vs 3.1%; p < .001) than did the adult hospitals. in the pediatric hospital, the pediatric icu had higher p aeruginosa rates than did  the neonatal icu (33.3% vs 17%; p = .01). in the adult hospitals, the surgical icu had higher acinetobacter baumannii rates (10.2% vs. 1.7%; p < .001) than did  the other icus. conclusions: microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia vary between and within hospitals. knowledge of these differences can improve selection of initial antimicrobial regimens, which may decrease mortality.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of piperacillin, piperacillin-sulbactam and piperacillin-tazobactam against nosocomial pathogens isolated from intensive care patients.
AB  == we investigated the antimicrobial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam versus piperacillin-sulbactam against common nosocomial pathogens (n = 565) isolated from intensive care patients. for gram-positive bacteria, antimicrobial susceptibilities to the two piperacillin-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations were almost identical. for gram-negative bacteria, piperacillin-tazobactam exhibited greater activity against escherichia coli and proteus vulgaris than piperacillin-sulbactam. both combinations, however, were equally effective against the other enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates. piperacillin-sulbactam exhibited better antimicrobial activity against acinetobacter baumannii. our findings might prove important for the appropriate choice of antibiotic therapy with beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

TI  == antimicrobial resistance among gram-negative organisms in the intensive care unit.
AB  == purpose of review: we review the hospital-acquired gram-negative organisms commonly encountered among patients in the intensive care unit and discuss pertinent surveillance data, resistance mechanisms and patterns, and optimal treatment regimens for these pathogens. recent findings: there has been a notable increase in antibiotic resistance among gram-negative intensive care unit pathogens. data from surveillance programs such as national nosocomial infections surveillance system, intensive care antimicrobial resistance epidemiology, and others have documented undesirable trends in antibiotic resistance, indicating decreasing efficacy of antibiotic classes such as third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones, the increased prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases has contributed to the finding of multidrug resistance among bacteria such as klebsiella and escherichia coli. furthermore, organisms such as acinetobacter baumannii, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia display intrinsic resistance to many antibiotics, making selection of optimal therapy difficult. studies have correlated infection  by these organisms with prior antibiotic exposure, and containment of the spread  of infection can be achieved by careful antibiotic use and infection control practices. summary: antibiotic resistance continues to rise among hospital-acquired gram-negative pathogens. optimal management of these infections requires knowledge of local epidemiology and practices to control their spread.

TI  == partial characterization of a transposon containing the tet(a) determinant in a clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == a genomic library from one clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii was obtained to find genes responsible for tetracycline resistance. escherichia coli  dh5alpha-mdr transformants, selected on mueller-hinton agar supplemented with tetracycline 18 mg/l, were thoroughly characterized. in one clone, with an insert of 7,070 bp, it was found that the resistance to tetracycline was mediated by the tet(a) gene (1,200 bp) which encodes a tetracycline efflux pump. this gene was recovered together with tetr(a) (651 bp), the tet(a) repressor. moreover, the partial sequence (2,008 bp) of a transposase gene, tnpa, and 1,316 bp corresponding to an is, similar to that described in one strain of salmonella typhi (is4321), were found. in this a. baumannii clinical isolate, the tet(a) gene is located in a transposon. the structure of this transposon is similar to that of tn1721, with the tet(a), tetr(a) and the regions between these genes, being closely related to those of tn1721. the data indicate horizontal transfer of tetracycline resistance genes between a. baumannii and other genera sharing the same ecological niches.

TI  == the influence of inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment on patients with bloodstream infections in an intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the occurrence of inadequate antimicrobial therapy among  critically ill patients with bacteremia and the factors associated with it, to identify the microorganisms that received inadequate antimicrobial treatment, and to determine the relationship between inadequate treatment and patients outcome.  methods: from june 1995 to january 1999 we collected data on all clinically significant icu-bacteremias in our teaching hospital. clinical and microbiological characteristics were recorded and the adequacy of empirical antimicrobial treatment in each case was determined. we defined inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment as applying to infection that was not being effectively treated at the time the causative microorganism and its antibiotic susceptibility were known. multivariate analysis was used to determine the variables associated with inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment and to  evaluate the influence of this on the related mortality to bacteremia, using the  spss package (9.0). results: among 166 intensive care unit patients with bacteremia, 39 (23.5%) received inadequate antimicrobial treatment. in this last  group the mean age of patients was 64.1 +/- 13.2 years, and 64% were men. bacteremia was hospital-acquired in 92% of these cases. eleven percent developed  septic shock and 37.7% severe sepsis, and ultimately fatal underlying disease was present in 28.2% of patients given inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment.  the main sources of bacteremias in this group were: a vascular catheter (15.3%),  respiratory (7.6%) or unknown (53.8%). the microorganisms most frequently isolated in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment were: coagulase-negative staphylococci (29.5%), acinetobacter baumannii (27.3%), enterococcus faecalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, enterobacter cloacae, proteus mirabilis, escherichia coli, and candida species (4.5% each). the frequency of coagulase-negative staphylococci in the cases with inappropriate treatment was higher than in the group with appropriate treatment (or 2.62; 95% ci: 1.10-6.21;  p = 0.015). the global mortality rate was 56% and the related mortality was 30% in the group with inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment. the only factor associated with inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment was the absence of abdominal or respiratory focus (p = 0.04; or = 0.35; 95% ci: 0.12-0.97). septic shock was related to attributable mortality (p = 0.03; or = 3.19; 95% ci: 1.08-9.40), but not inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (p = 0.24; or =  1.71; 95% ci: 0.66-4.78). conclusion: almost a quarter of critically ill patients with bloodstream infections were given inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment, but mortality was not higher in the group with inadequate treatment than in the group with adequate treatment. this fact was probably due to microbiological factors and clinical features, such as the type of microorganism most frequently  isolated and the source of the bacteremia.

TI  == photodynamic effects of antioxidant substituted porphyrin photosensitizers on gram-positive and -negative bacterial.
AB  == photodynamic treatment of the gram-negative bacteria escherichia coli b and acinetobacter baumannii and the gram-positive bacterium staphylococcus aureus was performed using two newly devised and synthesized antioxidant carrier photosensitizers (antioxidant carrier sensitizers-2 [acs-2] and antioxidant carrier sensitizers-3 [acs-3]), which are butyl hydroxy toluene and propyl gallate substituted haematoporphyrins, respectively. it was found that acs-2 is less reactive than other photosensitizers previously used for the same purpose, whereas acs-3 is very effective against the multidrug-resistant bacterium a. baumannii, causing its complete eradication at a low fluence (approximately 7.5 j/cm2) of blue light (407-420 nm) and a low concentration (10 microm). at a higher fluence (approximately 37.5 j/cm2) complete eradication of e. coli b can be obtained under the same conditions. furthermore, x-ray microanalysis and ultrastructural changes indicate that acs-3, especially in the case of photodynamic treatment of a. baumannii, interferes with membrane functions and causes the inactivation of the bacterium. acs-3 may be suggested as a specific photosensitization agent for photoinactivation of gram-negative bacteria.

TI  == cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies raised against the lipopolysaccharide antigen of salmonella minnesota re chemotype: diagnostic relevance.
AB  == three cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies (mabs) of igm and igg2b isotype were generated in two separate fusions after immunization of balb/c mice with heat killed salmonella minnesota r595 of re chemotype and acid-treated bacteria, coated with re lipopolysaccharide (lps) antigen. the specificity of the mabs was  demonstrated as the re lps antigen. the activity and cross-reactivity against purified elementary bodies of chlamydia trachomatis and various s- and r-lps antigens of other gram-negative bacteria were characterized in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, passive hemolysis assay, immunoblot and immunofluorescence with the available chlamydial strains. the results demonstrated cross-reaction between the re lps antigen, the genus-specific chlamydial lps and the lps antigens of escherichia coli o119 and acinetobacter baumannii, suggesting the presence of identical or similar epitopes in the lipopolysaccharide antigens. the findings are implying the necessity of novel approaches, improving the specificity of serologic assays in the laboratory diagnosis of chlamydial infections.

TI  == genetic organization of an acinetobacter baumannii chromosomal region harbouring  genes related to siderophore biosynthesis and transport.
AB  == the acinetobacter baumannii 8399 clinical isolate secretes dihydroxybenzoic acid  (dhba) and a high-affinity catechol siderophore, which is different from other bacterial iron chelators already characterized. complementation assays with enterobactin-deficient escherichia coli strains led to the isolation of a cosmid  clone containing a. baumannii 8399 genes required for the biosynthesis and activation of dhba. accordingly, the cloned fragment harbours a dhbaceb polycistronic operon encoding predicted proteins highly similar to several bacterial proteins required for dhba biosynthesis from chorismic acid. genes encoding deduced proteins related to the e. coli fes and the bacillus subtilis dhbf proteins, and a putative yersinia pestis phosphopantetheinyl transferase, all of them involved in the assembly and utilization of catechol siderophores in  other bacteria, were found next to the dhbaceb locus. this a. baumannii 8399 gene cluster also contained the om73, p45 and p114 predicted genes encoding proteins potentially involved in transport of ferric siderophore complexes. the deduced products of the p114 and p45 genes are putative membrane proteins that belong to  the rnd and mfs efflux pump proteins, respectively. interestingly, p45 is highly  related to the e. coli p43 (ents) protein that participates in the secretion of enterobactin. although p114 is similar to other bacterial efflux pump proteins involved in antibiotic resistance, its genetic arrangement within this a. baumannii 8399 locus is different from that described in other bacteria. the product of om73 is a fur- and iron-regulated surface-exposed outer-membrane protein. these characteristics together with the presence of a predicted tonb box and its high similarity to other siderophore receptors indicate that om73 plays such a role in a. baumannii 8399. the 184 nt om73-p114 intergenic region contains promoter elements that could drive the expression of these divergently transcribed genes, all of which are in close proximity to almost perfect fur boxes. this arrangement explains the iron- and fur-regulated expression of om73,  and provides strong evidence for a similar regulation for the expression of p114.

TI  == chromosomal integration of a cephalosporinase gene from acinetobacter baumannii into oligella urethralis as a source of acquired resistance to beta-lactams.
AB  == clinical oligella urethralis isolate coh-1, which was uncommonly resistant to penicillins and narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, was recovered from a 55-year-old  patient with a urinary tract infection. shotgun cloning into escherichia coli and expression experiments gave recombinant clones expressing either an ampc beta-lactamase-type phenotype of resistance or a carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase-type phenotype of resistance. the ampc beta-lactamase identified (aba-1), which had a pi value of 8.2, had 98% amino acid identity with a chromosomally encoded cephalosporinase of acinetobacter baumannii. a 820-bp insertion sequence element, isour1, belonging to the is6 family of insertion sequence elements, was identified immediately upstream of bla(aba-1), providing a -35 promoter sequence and likely giving rise to a hybrid promoter region. the carbenicillin-hydrolyzing beta-lactamase identified (carb-8), which had a pi value of 6.4, differed from carb-5 by two amino acid substitutions. hybridization of ceui fragment i-restricted dna fragments of o. urethralis coh-1 with bla(aba-1)-, bla(carb-8)-, and 16s rrna-specific probes indicated the chromosomal integration of the beta-lactamase genes. pcr and hybridization experiments failed to detect bla(carb-8)- and bla(aba-1)-like genes in three o. urethralis reference strains, indicating that the beta-lactamase genes identified were the source of acquired resistance in o. urethralis coh-1. this is one of the few examples of the interspecies transfer and the chromosomal integration of a gene encoding a naturally occurring beta-lactamase.

TI  == genetic and functional analysis of the chromosome-encoded carbapenem-hydrolyzing  oxacillinase oxa-40 of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == clinical isolate acinetobacter baumannii cla-1 was resistant to a series of antibiotic molecules, including carbapenems. cloning and expression of the beta-lactamase gene content of this isolate in escherichia coli dh10b identified  a chromosome-encoded oxacillinase, oxa-40, that differed by one or two amino acid changes from oxa-24, -25, and -26 and an ampc-type cephalosporinase. the oxa-40 beta-lactamase had a mainly narrow-spectrum hydrolytic profile, but it included ceftazidime and imipenem. its activity was resistant to inhibition by clavulanic  acid, tazobactam, sulbactam, and, like most of the other carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases, nacl. oxa-40 had an fgn triad replacing a ygn motif at class d beta-lactamase (dbl) positions 144 to 146. site-directed dna mutagenesis leading  to a phe-to-tyr change at dbl position 144 in oxa-40 gave a mutant enzyme with increased hydrolytic activity against most beta-lactams, including imipenem. conversely, with a gene encoding the narrow-spectrum oxacillinase oxa-1 as the template, a nucleotide substitution leading to a tyr-to-phe change in the ygn motif of oxa-1 gave a mutant enzyme with decreased hydrolytic activity without an increase in carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity. thus, the phe residue in the fgn motif was not associated with carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity by itself but instead was associated with weak overall hydrolytic activity. finally, this phe residue in oxa-40 explained resistance to inhibition by nacl whereas a tyr residue in motif ygn was related to susceptibility to nacl.

TI  == neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in karachi.
AB  == objective: to study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. setting: the study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (nicu) at pns shifa (naval hospital), karachi during january 1997 to june 1999. methods: blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a nicu with sepsis. the specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth.  subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. the isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by modified kirby baur disc diffusion technique. results: a  total of 212 organisms were isolated. these included staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), escherichia coli (n = 22), enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), citrobacter diversus (n = 5), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group b streptococcus (n = 2). on antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. more than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for acinetobacter baumannii. resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. conclusion: in view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.

TI  == genetic and phenotypic analysis of acinetobacter baumannii insertion derivatives  generated with a transposome system.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii is a metabolically versatile pathogen that causes severe  infections in compromised patients. however, little is known about the genes and  factors involved in its basic physiology and virulence properties. insertion mutagenesis was used to initiate the identification and characterization of some  of these factors and genes in the prototype strain 19606. the utilization of the  plofkm suicide delivery vector, which harbors a suicide mini-tn10 derivative, proved to be unsuccessful for this purpose. the ez::tn <r6kgammaori/kan-2> tnp transposome system available from epicentre was then used in conjunction with electroporation to generate isogenic insertional derivatives of a. baumannii 19606. replica plating showed that 2% of the colonies that grew after electroporation on agar plates without antibiotics also grew in the presence of 40 micro g of kanamycin per ml. dna hybridization proved that all of the kanamycin-resistant derivatives contained the ez::tn <r6kgammaori/kan-2> insertion element, which was mapped to different genomic locations. replica plating on simmons citrate agar and microtiter plate-plastic tube assays identified growth- and biofilm-defective derivatives, respectively. the location  of the insertion in several of these derivatives was determined by self-ligation  of ndei- or ecori-digested genomic dna and electroporation of escherichia coli transformax ec100d (pir(+)). sequence analysis of the recovered plasmids showed that some of the a. baumannii 19606 growth-defective derivatives contain insertions within genes encoding activities required for the generation of energy and cell wall components and for the biosynthesis of amino acids and purines. a gene encoding a protein similar to the gacs sensor kinase was interrupted in four derivatives, while another had an insertion in a gene coding for a hypothetical sensor kinase. a. baumannii 19606 derivatives with defective attachment or biofilm phenotypes had insertions within genes that appear to be part of a chaperone-usher transport system described for other bacteria. dna hybridization  experiments showed that the presence of strain 19606 genes encoding regulatory and attachment or biofilm functions is widespread among other a. baumannii clinical isolates.

AB  == aims: to test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. methods: the bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 iu/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin b was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees c with five inocula of 14 bacteria. two yeasts  (candida spp) and one aspergillus were also tested. contaminated media were then  inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened  daily by visual inspection. the sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. results: organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria  irrespective of the starting inoculums: streptococcus pneumoniae, branhamella catarrhalis, escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, and haemophilus influenzae. for micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal  only (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis, staphylococcus haemolyticus, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, bacillus subtilis, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, candida albicans, candida kruzei, aspergillus  fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (sd 13.8, range 2-52). in cases of detection by the  blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. conclusions: blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.

TI  == [surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: vira study].
AB  == introduction: resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. the aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. material and methods: a total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in october 2001 were studied. these included 294 methicillin-resistant  staphylococcus aureus (mrsa), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (cns), 96 enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant escherichia coli, 160 pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 acinetobacter baumannii. sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. results: overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant e. coli and mrsa strains was 24% in both cases. the pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. most mrsa isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. all the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. only 50% of a. baumannii strains were susceptible  to imipenem. conclusion: the results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as mrsa, cns, ampicillin-resistant  enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.

TI  == diffusion of beta-lactam antibiotics through oligomeric or monomeric porin channels of some gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the penetration of anionic beta-lactam antibiotics through porins was evaluated as a mechanism of drug resistance. the major proteins with porin activity were purified from the outer membranes of six bacteria. three of the six porins were oligomeric porins. the molecular weights of their monomers were 37 kda from photobacterium damsela, 42 kda from serratia liquefaciens, and 36 kda from e. coli b. the other three porins were heat-modifiable monomeric porins with molecular weights of 43 kda from porphyromonas asaccharolytica and acinetobacter  baumannii, and 37 kda from escherichia coli k12. comparison of the six porin proteins revealed that, independent of their aggregation state, their amino acid  content is similar but not identical. all have double the amount of negatively charged amino acids compared with positively charged amino acids. they have a similar polarity and polarity index. two of the six tested bacteria do not produce beta-lactamase. these two bacteria were sensitive to the different beta-lactams tested. the other four bacteria were resistant to all or to several  beta-lactams.a modified liposome swelling method was used for determining the rate of penetration of charged beta-lactam antibiotics. zwitterionic beta-lactams were found to penetrate into liposomes at a rate that more or less fits their molecular weight, whether the porins are monomeric or oligomeric. the penetration rates of negatively charged beta-lactams are different for oligomeric and monomeric porins. negatively charged beta-lactams penetrate through oligomeric porins better than estimated by their molecular weight, whereas monomeric porins  are less penetrable to negatively charged beta-lactams than estimated by their molecular weight. the contribution of all types of porins to the susceptibility of bacteria to beta-lactam antibiotics (zwitterionic or negatively charged) is apparently doubtful. the porins may decrease or increase bacterial penetration rates to beta-lactams, and only the existence of a potential beta-lactamase that  can destroy the penetrating drug will cause resistance.

TI  == isolation, characterization, and plasmid pupi126-mediated indole-3-acetic acid production in acinetobacter strains from rhizosphere of wheat.
AB  == thirty-seven strains of acinetobacter isolated and characterized from rhizosphere of wheat were screened for indole-3-acetic acid (iaa) production. only eight acinetobacter strains showed iaa production. the genus acinetobacter was confirmed by chromosomal dna transformation assay. biotyping of eight strains was carried out and they were found to be genospecies of a. junii, a. baumannii, a. genospecies 3, and a. haemolyticus. five of eight strains produced iaa at the early stationary phase: a. haemolyticus (a19), a. baumannii (a18, a16, a13), and  acinetobactergenospecies 3 (a15). a. junii a6 showed maximum iaa production at log phase and a. genospecies 3 and a. baumannii (a28, a30) at late stationary phase. iaa was extracted by ethyl acetate and purified by preparative thin-layer  chromatography. purified iaa was confirmed by 1h-nuclear magnetic resonance and infrared spectrum analysis. pot experiments showed a significant increase in plant growth inoculated with eight acinetobacter genospecies as compared to control plants. iaa production was found to be encoded by plasmid pupi126. all eight strains of acinetobacter contain a plasmid pupi126 with a molecular weight  of 40 kb. plasmid pupi126 was transformed into escherichia coli hb101 at a frequency of 5 x 10(-5), and e. coli hb101 (pupi126) transformants also showed iaa activity. pupi126 also encoded resistance to selenium, tellurium, and lead. this is the first report of plasmid-encoded iaa production in the genus acinetobacter.

TI  == preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  == membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. they act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic  antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long)  and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. all the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microm) and high antimicrobial activity. hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. in contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. biacore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward  zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (pc)/egg spingomyelin (sm)/cholesterol) vesicles. all the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (e. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (pe)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (pg)) vesicles regardless of their length. in contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both pc/sm/cholesterol and pe/pg membranes. attenuated total reflectance fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of pc/cholesterol. the correlation between the antibacterial activity  and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of e. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. the data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.

TI  == comparative in-vitro activities of ertapenem against aerobic bacterial pathogens  isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  == the in vitro activities of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam were compared against 1018 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from 531 patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection. enterobacteriaceae accounted for 66.3% of the aerobic  bacteria; escherichia coli was the most common isolate. the ertapenem minimal inhibitory concentration was < or = 2 microg/ml for 74.6% of isolates and > or =  8 microg/ml for 21.9% (including isolates of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus, acinetobacter baumannii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa). against enterobacteriaceae, ertapenem was the most potent and the most active drug evaluated (100% susceptible), followed by ceftriaxone (98% susceptible), piperacillin-tazobactam (96% susceptible), amoxicillin-clavulanate (80% susceptible), and ampicillin-sulbactam (64% susceptible). piperacillin-tazobactam was the only drug evaluated with clinically useful activity against p. aeruginosa. in summary, ertapenem was highly active in vitro against many clinically important aerobic intra-abdominal bacterial pathogens, especially enterobacteriaceae.

TI  == antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  == the antibiotic and chlorhexidine (chx) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus aureus (not mrsa), streptococcus pyogenes and enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (mbc) and/or minimal inhibitory (mic) concentrations. non-fermentative bacteria tolerated chx at high concentrations; gram-positive cocci, especially s. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. we found a good correlation between chx and  antibiotic susceptibility in both mic and mbc among gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in mbc among gram-positive bacteria. resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate  increased chx resistance among gram-negative bacteria. this finding gives clinicians the ability to predict chx susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.

TI  == epidemiological typing and prevalence of integrons in multiresistant acinetobacter strains.
AB  == seventy-seven acinetobacter isolates were recovered from patients in a korean hospital during the period from november to december 1998. the isolates were genotyped using randomly amplified polymorphic dna (rapd) analysis for epidemiological relationship, and investigated for antibiotic susceptibility and  presence of integrons. sixty-nine acinetobacter baumannii isolates were distributed into five groups by rapd profiles, with 5, 1, 60, 2 and 1 in each group. the major rapd group of 60 isolates was further divided into six subgroups by antibiograms. eight isolates belonging to acinetobacter dna group 13tu were distributed among six rapd groups. seventy-three of the acinetobacter isolates were resistant to eight or more of the antibiotics tested. integrase genes were detected in 66 of the 69 a. baumannii (96%) and in 5 of the 8 acinetobacter dna group 13tu isolates (63%). the inti1 and inti2 genes were found in 63 and 8 isolates, respectively. the inti3 gene was not detected. all integron-carrying isolates were resistant to multiple antibiotics. all strains isolated from more than one patient carried integrons. according to the results, the presence of integrons was significantly (p<0.01) associated with multiple antibiotic resistance and nosocomial spread in acinetobacter strains.

TI  == hospital-acquired infections following the 1999 marmara earthquake.
AB  == in this study, medical records of all casualties admitted to our hospital following the marmara earthquake, which struck northwest turkey and resulted in the destruction of several towns in the marmara region, were evaluated retrospectively. the time buried under the rubble, demographic data, type of medical and surgical therapies performed, type of injury and data on infection were analysed. between 17 august and 25 september 1999, 630 trauma victims were received at our hospital and 532 (84%) of them were hospitalized. the mean age of hospitalized patients (312 males, 220 females) was 32 years (2-90 years). two hundred and twenty patients were hospitalized for more than 48 h. forty-one of them (18.6%) had 43 hospital-acquired infection (hai) episodes, which were mostly wound infections (46.5%). a total of 143 culture specimens was collected and 48 yielded the following potential pathogens: 15 acinetobacter baumanii (31.2%), nine staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), seven pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.6%), six escherichia coli (12.5%), six klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), two stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.2%) and three various pseudomonas spp. (6.3%). all s. aureus strains were found to be resistant to methicillin in vitro. two strains of a. baumannii and one p. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to all antimicrobials  including carbapenems. fifty-three victims died (10%) and 36 of those died during the first 48 h because of severe injuries and multi-organ failure. after 48 h of  hospitalization, the mortality rate was significantly higher in those patients with hai (14/41) than those without (3/179) (34.1% vs. 1.7%, p<0.05). in conclusion, trauma is the significant factor associated with hai and a high incidence of acinetobacter strains was responsible for hai in trauma patients.

TI  == [post-marketing surveillance of antibacterial activities of cefozopran against various clinical isolates--ii. gram-negative bacteria].
AB  == as a post-marketing surveillance, the in vitro antibacterial activities of cefozopran (czop), an agent of cephems, against various clinical isolates were yearly evaluated and compared with those of other cephems, oxacephems, penicillins, monobactams, and carbapenems. changes in czop susceptibility for the bacteria were also evaluated with the bacterial resistance ratio calculated with  the breakpoint mic. twenty-five species (3,362 strains) of gram-negative bacteria were isolated from the clinical materials annually collected from 1996 to 2000, and consisted of moraxella (branhamella) catarrhalis (n = 136), haemophilus influenzae (n = 289), escherichia coli (n = 276), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 192), klebsiella oxytoca (n = 157), enterobacter cloacae (n = 189), enterobacter  aerogenes (n = 93), serratia marcescens (n = 172), serratia liquefaciens (n = 24), citrobacter freundii (n = 177), citrobacter koseri (n = 70), proteus mirabilis (n = 113), proteus vulgaris (n = 89), morganella morganii (n = 116), providencia spp. (n = 41), pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 290), pseudomonas fluorescens (n = 56), pseudomonas putida (n = 63), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 146), acinetobacter lwoffii (n = 34), burkholderia cepacia (n = 101), stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 169), bacteroides fragilis group (n = 196), and prevotella/porphyromonas (n = 173). an antibacterial activity of czop against e.  coli, k. pneumoniae, k. oxytoca, and s. marcescens was potent and consistent with or more preferable than the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against m.(b.) catarrhalis, c. koseri, and p. aeruginosa  was not considerably changed and consistent with the study results obtained until the new drug application approval. mic90 of czop against e. cloacae, e. aerogenes, and p. mirabilis increased year by year. the increase in mic90 of czop against e. aerogenes and p. mirabilis, however, was not considered to be an obvious decline in susceptibility. in contract, the susceptibility of e. cloacae  to czop was suspected to be decreasing because this species showed 20.6% resistance to czop. mic90 of czop against c. freundii was variably changed or not one-sidedly, but was higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. additionally, mic90 of czop against h. influenzae was stable during 5 years except being higher in 1999, and, as a whole, was a little  higher than the values obtained until the new drug application approval. an antibacterial activity of czop against p. fluorescens, p. putida, b. cepacia, s.  maltophilia, b. fragilis group, and prevotella/porphyromonas was weak like the other cephems. changes in mic90 of czop against the other bacteria were 2 tubes or more through 5-year study period, but did not tend towards a unilateral direction as meaning a decline in susceptibility.

TI  == how many nosocomial infections are associated with cross-transmission? a prospective cohort study in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  == objective: to determine the percentage of cross-transmissions in an intensive care unit (icu) with high nosocomial infection (ni) rates according to the data of the german nosocomial infection surveillance system. setting: a 14-bed surgical icu of a 1,300-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. method: prospective surveillance of nis during a period of 9 months. if an ni was present, the isolates of the following indicator pathogens were stored and typed by species: staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus species, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and enterobacter species. pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed for typing of s. aureus strains and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction was applied for the other pathogens. the presence of two indistinguishable strains in two patients was considered as one episode of cross-transmission. results: two hundred sixty-two patients were observed during a period of 2,444 patient-days; 96 nis were identified in 59 patients and the overall incidence density of ni was 39.3 per 1,000 patient-days. for 104 isolates, it was possible to consider typing results. altogether, 36 cross-transmissions have lead to nis in other patients. that means at least 37.5% of all nis identified were due to cross-transmissions. conclusion: because of the method of this study, the percentage of nis due to cross-transmission identified  for this icu is an "at least number." in reality, the number of cross-transmissions, and thus the number of avoidable infections, may have been even higher. however, it is difficult to assess whether the percentage of nis due to cross-transmission determined for this icu may be the crucial explanation for  the relatively high infection rate in comparison to other surgical icus.

TI  == current status of antimicrobial resistance in taiwan.
AB  == while some trends in antimicrobial resistance rates are universal, others appear  to be unique for specific regions. in taiwan, the strikingly high prevalence of resistance to macrolides and streptogramin in clinical isolates of gram-positive  bacteria correlates with the widespread use of these agents in the medical and farming communities, respectively. the relatively low rate of enterococci that are resistant to glycopeptide does not parallel the high use of glycopeptides and extended-spectrum beta-lactams in hospitals. the evolving problem of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is substantial, and some unique enzymes have been found. recently, some gram-negative bacteria (e.g., pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii) that are resistant to all available antimicrobial agents including carbapenems have emerged.

TI  == multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in taiwan.
AB  == a susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (icus) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from march, 2000, to june, 2000, in taiwan. this study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in staphylococcus aureus (orsa), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), enterobacter cloacae (57%), serratia marcescens (34%), and citrobacter freundii (60%). high rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for p. aeruginosa (15%) and acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. the percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for klebsiella pneumoniae. rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for s. pneumoniae (42%), enterococcus faecium (71%), and orsa (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. the resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of icus. surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in icu settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in icu patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  == introduction: the emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. the introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these  as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. materials and methods: the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the e-test method. results: all streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. similarly,  both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing haemophilus influenzae and moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. as for enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with mic < 8 mg/l, but resistance was noted for some of proteus mirabilis, klebsiella spp. and escherichia coli. enterococci and acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. conclusion: moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common  organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. there was good anti-anaerobic activity against bacteroides fragilis and clostridum spp. results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.

AB  == the in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. a total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. the minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. the mic of cefpiramide for escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). fifty-one percent (26/51) of enterobacter cloacae  isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against e. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. cefpiramide was more active against pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. cefpiramide-resistant p. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant s. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible staphylococcus aureus (mic90, 2 microg/ml). against streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an mic90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. these results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible staphylo-coccus aureus, s. pneumoniae, and h. influenzae. thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibilities among clinical isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria in a taiwanese university hospital.
AB  == infections caused by gram-negative bacteria with resistance to extended-spectrum  cephalosporins require the identification of effective alternative antimicrobial  therapy. to determine the role of other pre-existing or currently available antimicrobial agents in treating infections caused by these multidrug-resistant pathogens, we evaluated the in vitro susceptibilities of these agents in 411 non-duplicate isolates of extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant gram-negative bacteria recovered between january 1999 and december 1999 in a major teaching hospital in taipei, taiwan. these isolates included cefotaxime-resistant (mics >  or = 2 mg/l) escherichia coli (66 isolates) and klebsiella pneumoniae (77 isolates); cefotaxime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) enterobacter cloacae (59 isolates), serratia marcescens (52 isolates) and citrobacter freundii (52 isolates); and ceftazidime-resistant (mics > or = 64 mg/l) pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 isolates) and acinetobacter baumannii (55 isolates). overall, carbapenems (imipenem and meropenem) had good activity against the cefotaxime-resistant enterobacteriaceae tested (>90% of isolates were susceptible). however, carbapenems had limited activity against the ceftazidime-resistant p. aeruginosa  (only 4% of isolates were susceptible) and a. baumannii (51-56% of isolates were  susceptible). among the e. coli and k. pneumoniae isolates tested, 33.3% and 58.4%, respectively, exhibited extended-spectrum beta-lactamase phenotype, determined by the double disc method. over 80% of cefotaxime-resistant e. cloacae and c. freundii were susceptible to cefepime, but this agent had limited activity against other bacteria tested. susceptibilities of these isolates to ciprofloxacin varied, ranging from 25% for a. baumannii to 92% for e. cloacae. newer fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin and trovafloxacin) had equal or less activity against these organisms, except for a. baumannii for which their mic(90)s (8-16 mg/l) were four- to 16-fold less than that of ciprofloxacin (mic(90) 128 mg/l).

TI  == in vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. a total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the national taiwan university hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant staphylococcus epidermidis, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. for many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. some strains of methicillin-resistant s. aureus and methicillin-resistant s. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum  inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. moxifloxacin was less active against p. aeruginosa, but was more active against s. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. in conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. the drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in taiwan.

AB  == the adhc1 gene from acinetobacter baumannii 8399, which encodes a glutathione-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase (gsh-fdh), was identified and cloned after mapping the insertion site of tn3-hoho1 in a recombinant cosmid isolated from a gene library. sequence analysis showed that this gene encodes a protein exhibiting significant similarity to alcohol dehydrogenases in bacterial, yeast, plant and animal cells. the expression of the adhc1 gene was confirmed by  the detection of gsh-fdh enzyme activity in a. baumannii and escherichia coli cells that expressed the cloned gene. however, the construction and analysis of an a. baumannii 8399 adhc1::tn3-hoho1 isogenic derivative revealed the presence of adhc2, a second copy of the gene encoding gsh-fdh activity. enzyme assays and  immunoblot analysis showed that adhc2 encodes a 46.5 kda protein that is produced in similar amounts under iron-rich and iron-limited conditions. in contrast, the  expression of adhc1, which encodes a 45 kda protein with gsh-fdh activity, is induced under iron limitation and repressed when the cells are cultured in the presence of free inorganic iron. the differential expression of adhc1 is controlled at the transcriptional level and mediated through the fur iron-repressor protein, which has potential binding sites within the promoter region of this adhc copy. the expression of both adhc copies is significantly enhanced by the presence of sub-inhibitory concentrations of formaldehyde in the  culture media. examination of different a. baumannii isolates indicates that they can be divided into two groups based on the type of gsh-fdh they produce. one group contains only the constitutively expressed 46.5 kda protein, whilst the other produces this gsh-fdh type in addition to the iron-regulated isoenzyme. further analysis showed that the presence and expression of the two adhc genes does not confer resistance to exogenous formaldehyde, nor does it enable it to utilize methylated compounds as a sole carbon source when cultured under iron-rich as well as iron-deficient conditions.

TI  == antimicrobial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser on gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the objective of this study was to evaluate the antibacterial activity of argon fluoride (arf) excimer laser radiation on clinically important strains of gram-negative bacteria. the antibacterial activity of arf excimer laser radiation was evaluated on two acinetobacter baumannii, one enterobacter cloacae, three escherichia coli, two helicobacter pylori, one klebsiella pneumoniae and two pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. the strains were isolated from clinical specimens and typed by the usual biochemical procedures. square agar plates of 12 x 12 cm were divided into rectangular (2 x 3 cm) regions and spread with 0.5x 10(4) colony forming units (cfu)/ml of bacterial suspension. the excess liquid was removed and the plates were allowed to dry for 30 min. a total of 96 rectangular  (2x3 cm) regions were used for each strain, in order to test an equal number of laser parameters. each rectangular region was irradiated with different laser parameters, using a 193 nm arf excimer laser, linked with a simple galilean afocal system and a rectangular diaphragm of the same dimensions as the original  laser beam cross-section, at a distance of 10 cm from the irradiated surface. this system was used in order to keep the laser pulse energy under 80 mj and to cut-out the non-transverse electromagnetic mode branches of the laser beam. we then studied the bacterial survival ratio versus the number of laser pulses, the  repetition frequency and the total laser beam fluence. our results showed that the total laser beam fluence was the most important parameter to consider in evaluating the bactericidal effect of arf excimer laser radiation. a critical value of the total fluence was determined for each strain, such that, for laser beam fluences greater than this critical value, no colonies appeared to survive while, for laser fluences less than this critical value, the survival ratio did not exceed 2 x 10(7) cfu (2 x 10(-5)%). these critical values were found to vary  between 8 j/cm2 and 16 j/cm2 for the bacterial species studied. under these conditions, arf laser irradiation is promising for the sterilisation of hard surfaces and for in situ application.

TI  == efficacy of cefepime versus ceftazidime in the treatment of adult pneumonia.
AB  == effective empiric treatment of pneumonia requires antibiotic coverage against gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, including drug-resistant isolates. this study evaluated the efficacy of cefepime treatment in 20 patients with community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and 21 patients with hospital-acquired pneumonia (hap), and ceftazidime treatment in 20 patients with hap. the mean age  of patients was over 70 years. more than half of the patients had multiple lobe involvement. there was no significant difference in the severity of illness according to the acute physiology, age, chronic health evaluation (apache) iii score between the hap-cefepime and hap-ceftazidime group. the most common bacteria isolated from sputum of patients with cap were streptococcus pneumoniae  (n = 7), klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4), and pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2). in patients with hap, p. aeruginosa (n = 13), acinetobacter baumannii (n = 11), serratia marcescens (n = 6), k. pneumoniae (n = 5), stenotrophomonas maltophilia  (n = 5), enterobacter cloacae (n = 3), citrobacter spp. (n = 2), and escherichia  coli (n = 2) were isolated. the cure rates were 95%, 76%, and 60% in the cap-cefepime group, the hap-cefepime group, and the hap-ceftazidime group, respectively. the increased rates of antimicrobial resistance commonly found among isolates causing cap and hap indicate that extended-spectrum antimicrobial  agents, such as cefepime, would be more appropriate therapeutic agents.

TI  == comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a north american surveillance study.
AB  == the in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the united states and canada between 1997-1999. based on mic(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of gram-positive isolates: streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant s. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant s. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (mic > or = 4 microg/ml) s. pneumoniae, s. pyogenes, s. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant s. aureus, s. epidermidis, s. hemolyticus, and s. saprophyticus. against enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-enterobacteriaceae gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: citrobacter freundii, enterobacter aerogenes, e. cloacae, escherichia coli, klebsiella oxytoca, klebsiella pneumoniae, morganella morganii, proteus mirabilis, p. vulgaris, providencia stuartii, serratia marcescens, acinetobacter lwoffii, a. baumannii, burkholderia cepacia, haemophilus influenzae, h. parainfluenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and stenotrophomonas maltophilia. gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable  with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of gram-negative pathogens.

TI  == photoinactivation of acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli b by a cationic hydrophilic porphyrin at various light wavelengths.
AB  == photodynamic treatment by the cationic tmpyp photosensitizer was undertaken on the multiple antibiotic-resistant bacteria acinetobacter baumannii and escherichia coli. total eradication of the bacterial cultures was determined immediately after initiation of illumination when these bacteria were treated with 5, 10, 15, 20-tetra (4-n methylpyridyl)porphine (tmpyp) at a concentration of 29.4 micromol/l and illuminated by blue, green, or red light. total eradication of both bacteria was obtained also after treatment of bacterial cultures with 3.7 micromol/l tmpyp and illumination with blue light (400-450 nm). on the other hand, an 8- or 16- to 20-fold higher light intensity, respectively,  was required for total eradication upon illumination with green (480-550 nm) or red light (600-700 nm). a 407-nm blue light only 7 and 9 joules/cm2, respectively, was needed for total eradication of both bacteria even at a concentration of 3.7 micromol/l tmpyp. x-ray-linked microanalysis demonstrated loss of potassium and a flood of sodium and chloride into the cells, indicating serious damage to the cytoplasmic membrane. transmission electron microscopy (tem) revealed structural changes and damage to the membrane of treated e. coli.  in a. baumannii-treated cells, mesosomes and black dots that resemble aggregation of polyphosphate polymers could be seen. dna breakage appeared only after a long  period of illumination, when the bacterial cell was no longer viable. it can be concluded that cytoplasmic membrane damage and not dna breakage is the major cause for bacterial death upon photosensitization.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance in multiresistant nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii strains from seven clinics in the slovak and czech republics.
AB  == sixty-seven multiresistant nosocomial acinetobacter baumannii isolates from patients hospitalized mostly in intensive care units of seven clinics in slovak and czech republic were tested to determine their ability to transfer antibiotic  resistance. all isolates were resistant to kanamycin, ticarcillin, cephalothin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, aztreonam and susceptible to carbapenems, sulbactam and  ampicillin/sulbactam. sixty-five out of 67 strains transferred resistance determinants to escherichia coli k-12 and proteus mirabilis p-38 recipients. analysis of selected transconjugants by an indirect selection method showed a more variable pattern of transferred resistance determinants. the clonal spread of strains transferring resistance seems to be an additional risk for occurrence  of strains resistant to ceftazidime and aztreonam.

TI  == [activity of cefepime compared with other antibiotics against major hospital bacterial pathogens].
AB  == the aim of the study was to evaluate susceptibility of 976 bacterial isolates from nosocomial infections to cefepime and 9 other antibiotics used in the treatment of hospitalised patients. bacterial strains were mainly derived from wound and soft tissue infections, sputum, abscesses and blood. the most prevalent etiologic agents were: pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.7%), escherichia coli (13.8%),  staphyloccocus aureus (9.7%, acinetobacter baumannii (9.12%), klebsiella pneumoniae (7.38%), enterobacter cloacae (5.6%). the most susceptible to cefepime were strains of k. pneumoniae (98.62%), e. coli (98.52%) and e. cloacae (98.19%)  including those producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. the degree of susceptibility to cefepime was equal to that of imipenem. a. baumannii was the least susceptible species (67.42%). this study indicate that cefepime may play an important role in therapy of nosocomial infections in particular caused by enterobacteriace.

TI  == imp-4, a novel metallo-beta-lactamase from nosocomial acinetobacter spp. collected in hong kong between 1994 and 1998.
AB  == between 1994 and 1998, 97 imipenem-resistant acinetobacter isolates were identified at the prince of wales hospital, hong kong, china. a bla(imp) pcr product was obtained from 23 of 35 viable cultures; 12 isolates belonged to genomic dna group 3, 8 belonged to group 2 (acinetobacter baumannii), 2 belonged  to group 13tu, and 1 belonged to group 1. the bla(imp) homologues were sequenced  from two isolates from genomic dna group 2 and one isolate each from groups 3 and 13tu. the four sequences included an identical 738-bp open reading frame, predicted to encode a polypeptide of 246 amino acids, with 95.6% homology to imp-1 and 89.3% homology to imp-2. the new enzyme, designated imp-4, was partially purified. it had a pi of 8.0 and was strongly active against imipenem and meropenem, with v(max) values 53 and 8% of that for penicillin g, respectively. strong activity was also seen against oxyimino-aminothiazolyl cephalosporins but not against aztreonam. hydrolytic activity was inhibited by edta but not by clavulanate or tazobactam. carbapenem mics for most bla(imp)-positive isolates were 4 to 32 microg/ml, but one isolate with the intact gene was susceptible, with imipenem and meropenem mics of 0.25 and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. the latter isolate did not produce the band with a pi of 8.0, and gene expression was inferred to have been lost. none of the isolates studied in detail contained extrachromosomal dna, and carbapenem resistance was not transmissible to escherichia coli. nevertheless, the presence of bla(imp-4) in different genomic dna groups implies horizontal transfer, and sequences resembling a gttrrry integrase-dependent recombination motif were identified in the flanking regions of bla(imp-4).

TI  == characterization of oxa-25, oxa-26, and oxa-27, molecular class d beta-lactamases associated with carbapenem resistance in clinical isolates of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == carbapenem resistance in acinetobacter spp. is increasingly being associated with oxa-type beta-lactamases with weak hydrolytic activity against imipenem and meropenem. such enzymes were characterized from acinetobacter isolates collected  in belgium, kuwait, singapore, and spain. the isolates from spain and belgium had novel class d beta-lactamases that were active against carbapenems. these were designated oxa-25 and oxa-26, respectively, and had >98% amino acid homology with each other and with the oxa-24 enzyme recently described by others from an acinetobacter isolate collected elsewhere in spain. the isolate from singapore had oxa-27 beta-lactamase, another novel class d type with only 60% homology to oxa-24, -25, and -26, but with 99% homology to oxa-23 (ari-1), described previously from an acinetobacter baumannii isolate collected in scotland. sequence data were not obtained for the carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxa enzyme from the isolate from kuwait; nevertheless, the enzyme was phenotypically similar to oxa-25 and -26. the enzymes oxa-23, -24, -25, -26, and -27 retained the stfk and  sxv motifs typical of class d beta-lactamases, but the ygn motif was altered to fgn. the ktg motif was retained by oxa-27 and -23 but was replaced by ksg in oxa-24, -25, and -26. oxa-25 and -26 enzymes were strongly active against oxacillin, but unusually for an oxa-type beta-lactamase, oxa-27 had apparently weak activity, although measurement was complicated by biphasic kinetics. none of the new enzymes was transmissible to escherichia coli recipients. many acinetobacter isolates are multiresistant to other antibiotics, and the emergence of class d enzymes with carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity is a disturbing development for antimicrobial chemotherapy.

TI  == distribution and in-vitro transfer of tetracycline resistance determinants in clinical and aquatic acinetobacter strains.
AB  == following characterisation by phenotypic tests and amplified ribosomal dna restriction analysis (ardra), 50 tetracycline-resistant (mic > or = 16 mg/l) acinetobacter strains from clinical (n = 35) and aquatic (n = 15) samples were analysed by pcr for tetracycline resistance (tet) determinants of classes a-e. all the clinical strains were a. baumannii; most (33 of 35) had tet a (n = 16) or b (n = 17) determinants, and only two did not yield amplicons with primers for any of the five tetracycline resistance determinants. the aquatic strains belonged to genomic species other than a. baumannii, and most (12 of 15) did not  contain determinants tet a-e. strains negative for tet a-e were also negative for tet g and m; further analysis of two aquatic strains with specific primers for tet o and tet y and degenerate primers for tet m-s-o-p(b)-q also showed negative  results. transfer of tetracycline resistance was tested for 20 strains with three aquatic acinetobacter strains and escherichia coli k-12 as recipients. transfer of resistance was demonstrated between aquatic strains from distinct ecological niches, but not from clinical to aquatic strains, nor from any acinetobacter strain to e. coli k-12. most transconjugants acquired multiple relatively small plasmids (<36 kb). transfer did not occur when dna from the donor strains was added to the recipient cultures and was not affected by deoxyribonuclease i, suggesting a conjugative mechanism. it is concluded that tet a and b are widespread among tetracycline-resistant a. baumannii strains of clinical origin,  but unknown genetic determinants are responsible for most tetracycline resistance among aquatic acinetobacter spp. these differences, together with the inability of clinical strains to transfer tetracycline resistance in vitro to aquatic strains, contra-indicate any important flow of tetracycline resistance genes between clinical and aquatic acinetobacter populations.

TI  == molecular characterization of integrons in acinetobacter baumannii: description of a hybrid class 2 integron.
AB  == twenty acinetobacter baumannii strains resistant to various antibiotics were analyzed for integron content and sequences of the amplification products. sixteen clinical isolates had a class 1 integron, 2 contained an additional class 1 or class 2 integron, but no class 3 integron was detected. thirteen strains had integrons with a single cassette: aac(3)-ia (9 strains), ant(2")-ia (2 strains),  or aac(6')-ib (2 strains); 1 had aac(6')-ib and oxa20 cassettes and an unknown gene; and 1 had an integron containing ant(2")-ia and an oxa3 cassette truncated  by is6100. the remaining strains harbored class 1 integrons with gene cassettes previously found in enterobacteriaceae. one integron had a hybrid structure composed of inti2 and the 3' conserved segment of class 1 integrons. these data indicate that integrons play a major role in multidrug resistance in acinetobacter.

TI  == use of pcr with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  == we have designed a universal pcr capable of amplifying a portion of the 16s rrna  gene of eubacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis,  streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus agalactiae, streptococcus pneumoniae, enterococcus faecium, enterococcus faecalis, mycobacterium tuberculosis, legionella pneumophila, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, proteus mirabilis, haemophilus influenzae, and neisseria meningitidis. the sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most pcr products generated by haeiii digestion were different. pcr products from s. aureus and s. epidermidis could not be digested by haeiii but yielded different patterns when they were digested with mnli. pcr products from s. pneumoniae, e. faecium, and e. faecalis yielded the same haeiii digestion pattern but could be differentiated by alui digestion. pcr  products from e. coli, k. pneumoniae, s. marcescens, and e. cloacae also had the  same haeiii digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with ddei  or bstbi. this universal pcr could detect as few as 10 e. coli or 250 s. aureus organisms. compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal pcr for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. these results suggest that this universal pcr coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.

TI  == oxa-24, a novel class d beta-lactamase with carbapenemase activity in an acinetobacter baumannii clinical strain.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii ryc 52763/97, a clinical isolate involved in a prolonged  nosocomial outbreak at our hospital, was resistant to all beta-lactams tested, including imipenem and meropenem, which had mics of 128 and 256 microg/ml, respectively. this strain synthesized three beta-lactamases: a plasmid-mediated tem-1 beta-lactamase (pi 5.4), an ampc-type chromosomal cephalosporinase (pi 9.4), and a novel, presumptively chromosomally mediated oxa-related enzyme (pi 9.0) named oxa-24. after cloning and sequencing, the deduced amino acid sequence  of the oxa-24 beta-lactamase showed 40% homology with the oxa-10 (pse-2) and oxa-7 beta-lactamases, 39% homology with the oxa-11 and oxa-5 enzymes, and 33% homology with the lcr-1 beta-lactamase. the amino acid sequence of the oxa-24 beta-lactamase contained the stfk motif found in serine beta-lactamases, but the  typical class d triad ktg was replaced by ksg and the motif ygn was replaced by fgn. the oxa-24 beta-lactamase hydrolyzed benzylpenicillin and cephaloridine but  lacked activity against oxacillin, cloxacillin, and methicillin. the enzymatic activity was inhibited by chloride ions and by tazobactam (50% inhibitory concentration [ic(50)], 0.5 microm), sulbactam (ic(50), 40 microm), and clavulanic acid (ic(50), 50 microm). carbapenem mics for an escherichia coli transformant (pbmb-1) expressing the cloned oxa-24 enzyme had a fourfold increase. relative v(max)/k(m) values of 13 and 6 were obtained with imipenem and meropenem, respectively, and a positive microbiological assay result with imipenem was obtained with a purified enzymatic extract of this transformant strain. therefore, we consider this new beta-lactamase to be involved in the carbapenem resistance of a. baumannii ryc 52763/97.

TI  == characterization of the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant of acinetobacter baumannii ac-54/97 reveals the existence of bla(imp) allelic variants carried by  gene cassettes of different phylogeny.
AB  == the metallo-beta-lactamase determinant of acinetobacter baumannii ac-54/97, a clinical isolate from italy that was previously shown to produce an enzyme related to imp-1, was isolated by means of a pcr methodology which targets amplification of gene cassette arrays inserted into class 1 integrons. sequencing revealed that this determinant was an allelic variant (named bla(imp-2)) of bla(imp) found in japanese isolates and that it was divergent from the latter by  12% of its nucleotide sequence, which evidently had been acquired independently.  similar to bla(imp), bla(imp-2) was also carried by an integron-borne gene cassette. however, the 59-base element of the bla(imp-2) cassette was unrelated to those of the bla(imp) cassettes found in japanese isolates, indicating a different phylogeny for the gene cassettes carrying the two allelic variants. expression of the integron-borne bla(imp-2) gene in escherichia coli resulted in  a significant decrease in susceptibility to a broad array of beta-lactams (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephalothin, cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and carbapenems). the imp-2 enzyme was purified from an escherichia coli strain carrying the cloned determinant, and kinetic parameters were determined with several beta-lactam substrates. compared to imp-1, the kinetic parameters of imp-2 were similar overall with some beta-lactam substrates (cefoxitin, ceftazidime, cefepime, and imipenem) but remarkably different with others (ampicillin, carbenicillin, cephaloridine, and meropenem), revealing a functional significance of at least some of the mutations that differentiate the two imp variants. present findings suggest that the environmental reservoir of bla(imp) alleles could be widespread and raise a question about the global risk of their transfer to clinically relevant species.

AB  == during a 1-year study we observed that both aerobic and anaerobic blood culture bottles from patients were negative by the bact/alert system during a 7-day incubation period. however, upon subcultivation of negative bottles, growth of pseudomonas aeruginosa was detectable. in an attempt to explain this observation, aerobic bact/alert fan bottles were seeded with a defined inoculum (0.5 mcfarland standard; 1 ml) of escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, serratia marcescens,  p. aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, or acinetobacter baumannii. half of  the inoculated bottles were loaded into the bact/alert system immediately, and the remainder were preincubated for 4, 8, 16, and 24 h at 36 degrees c. with preincubation all bottles seeded with the enterobacteriaceae signaled positive during the next 1.5 h. organisms in bottles seeded with the nonfermentative species p. aeruginosa and a. baumannii remained undetected by the bact/alert system for 7 days. s. maltophilia was detected if the preincubation time was equal or less than 8 h. without preincubation all bottles seeded with the enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative species signaled positive. since nonfermentative species seem to enter a state of bacteriostasis within the preincubation period, we reasoned that an unknown factor is consumed. accordingly, a smaller inoculum should allow the detection of nonfermentative species, even after preincubation, and serial dilutions of p. aeruginosa were detected in preincubated bottles. in this case preincubated bottles signaled positive faster than bottles without preincubation. we conclude that all bottles  from clinical settings should be subcultured prior to loading to avoid false negatives. an alternative may be preincubation at room temperature.

AB  == background: to assess the clinical features and therapeutic outcomes of gram-negative bacillary meningitis (gnbm) in adult postneurosurgical patients. methods: thirty adult patients with gnbm were included in this study. their clinical features, laboratory data, prognostic factors, and therapeutic outcome were analyzed. the patients were 22 males and 8 females, aged 17-72 years. seven  had community-acquired infections and 23 had nosocomial infections. two patients  were associated with brain abscess. results: the pathogens found in the 30 gnbm patients were pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella species, escherichia coli, acinetobacter baumannii, and some rare pathogens including citrobacter freundii,  serratia marcescens, enterobacter cloacae, and proteus mirabilis. among these 30  patients, 8 patients with third-generation cephalosporin-resistant gnbm were identified since 1994; all infections were nosocomially acquired. appropriate antibiotics were given to 22 patients. eight patients did not receive appropriate antibiotic therapy. all eight died. the mortality rate in those treated with appropriate antibiotics was 14%. conclusions: there has been an increase of gnbm  in postneurosurgical patients in recent years. in addition, the emergence of strains resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in this specific group of patients has also been noted in recent years, and has become a great therapeutic  challenge. we noted many prognostic factors in postneurosurgical patients in this study; however, appropriate antibiotic therapy and initial consciousness level are the most significant ones. therefore, in cases of postneurosurgical patients  with nosocomially acquired gnbm, the possibility of third-generation cephalosporin resistance should be strongly suspected. early initiation of appropriate antibiotic therapy is needed in this potentially fatal disease.

TI  == comparison of differential plating media and two chromatography techniques for the detection of histamine production in bacteria.
AB  == the bacterial enzyme histidine decarboxylase (hdc) catalyses the conversion of histidine into histamine. this amine is essential for the biosynthesis of iron chelators (siderophores) and is an important cause of food poisoning after consumption of fish contaminated with histamine-producing bacteria. in this work  we compared different methods for detecting histamine secreted by different bacterial strains. the presence of histamine in the culture supernatant of vibrio anguillarum, which produces hdc and secretes the histamine-containing siderophore anguibactin, was detected by thin-layer chromatography. similar results were obtained using the culture supernatant of the acinetobacter baumannii 19606 prototype strain that secretes the histamine-containing siderophore acinetobactin. conversely, histamine was not detected in the culture supernatant  of an isogenic v. anguillarum hdc mutant and the a. baumannii 8399 strain that secretes a catechol siderophore different from anguibactin and acinetobactin. these results were confirmed by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. however, all these strains tested positive for histamine secretion when cultured  on differential plating media containing histidine and a ph indicator, which were specifically designed for the detection of histamine-producing bacteria. the ph increase of the medium surrounding the bacterial colonies was however drastically reduced when the histidine-containing medium was supplemented with peptone, beef  extract, and glucose. the histidine-containing culture supernatants of the a. baumannii and v. anguillarum strains showed an increase of about two units of ph, turned purple upon the addition of cresol red, and contained high amounts of ammonia. escherichia coli strains, which are hdc negative and do not use histidine as a carbon, nitrogen, and energy source, gave negative results with the differential solid medium and produced only moderate amounts of ammonia when  cultured in the presence of excess histidine. this study demonstrates that, although more laborious and requiring some expensive equipment, thin-layer and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry are more accurate than differential media for detecting bacterial histamine secretion. the results obtained with these analytical methods are not affected by byproducts such as ammonia, which are generated during the degradation of histidine and produce false positive results  with the differential plating media.

TI  == impact of use of multiple antimicrobials on changes in susceptibility of gram-negative aerobes.
AB  == evaluation of antimicrobial usage vs. susceptibility relationships typically involves single agents. however, susceptibility profiles may be affected by multiple drugs. from 1992 through 1996, we studied relationships between drug usage and the susceptibility (only susceptibility rates of > or = 70%) of acinetobacter anitratus (baumannii), enterobacter aerogenes, escherichia coli, enterobacter cloacae, klebsiella pneumoniae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, proteus mirabilis, and serratia marcescens to 22 agents. linear regression was used to assess usage of each agent vs. susceptibility to it and to all agents. only relationships with a coefficient of determination of > or = 0.5 and a negative slope were evaluated and classified as increasing drug use and decreasing susceptibility (increasing d, decreasing %s) or decreasing drug use and increasing susceptibility (decreasing d, increasing %s). the mean numbers (range) of drugs associated with a change in susceptibility were 1.7 (0-14) and 0.6 (0-7), respectively, for increasing d, decreasing %s and decreasing d, increasing %s relationships. multiple antimicrobials are associated with susceptibility to other drugs; thus, surveillance of these relationships should not be limited to single drugs.

TI  == korean nationwide surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  == antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in korea. twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. seven per cent and 26% of escherichia coli and klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. increased resistance rates, 19% of acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem,  were noted. the resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in e. coli, 56% in a. baumannii and 42% in p. aeruginosa. mean resistance rates were similar in all  hospital groups: about 17% of p. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. in conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria  in korea.

TI  == in vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in taiwan.
AB  == the in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in taiwan. meropenem was active against most gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, enterococcus faecalis, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, pseudomonas aeruginosa, burkholderia cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, haemophilus influenzae, and bacteroides fragilis. for many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. it is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. it is uncommon for these common bacteria, except mrsa and stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to  other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.

TI  == purification and characterization of a major 40 kda outer membrane protein of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii, an opportunistic pathogen, is well known to cause a wide spectrum of nosocomial infections particularly in intensive care units. the major outer membrane (om) protein, ompab, of 40 kda from a. baumannii has been identified and purified to homogeneity from cultures grown at 30 degrees c and 100 mm nacl. the synthesis of om proteins of a. baumannii is thermoregulated and  osmoregulated. the pore forming ability of the purified ompab and the diffusion of uncharged solutes in proteoliposomes has been demonstrated by following the liposomal swelling assay. the trimeric ompab is characterized as a porin with a pore size of 1.3 nm and is found to be similar to the ompf of escherichia coli and can possibly be classified as a general diffusion pore. it appears that ompab plays an important role in the diffusion properties of the outer membrane of a. baumannii.

AB  == growth kinetics, siderophore activity and iron-regulated bacterial proteins of acinetobacter baumannii bm2580 were studied in iron-restricted and iron-supplemented chemically defined media. iron-regulated outer membrane proteins of 75 kda and 80 kda were expressed under iron-restricted conditions. cloning and sequencing of the complete iron-uptake regulatory (fur) gene from a.  baumannii bm2580 is reported for the first time. this gene is preceded by a single autoregulated promoter whose -10 region overlaps the fur binding site. the open reading frame identified encodes a polypeptide consisting of 145 amino acids. the fur gene is followed by a divergent open reading frame coding for the  c-terminus of a putative pilu protein. sequence analysis indicates that the fur protein of a. baumannii was 63% identical to the escherichia coli fur protein.

TI  == adherence of acinetobacter baumannii to rat bladder tissue.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii, an important nosocomial pathogen, causes severe infections in patients of intensive care units, but its pathogenic attributes are unknown. previously, the adherence of a. baumannii to cell lines has been negative in the authors' laboratory. in this work, the adherence of strains of a. baumannii of various biotypes to small pieces of rat bladder tissue was investigated. tissue pieces were submerged into cultures of a. baumannii and sessile cells were counted after removing planktonic bacteria. fimbriae and sessile cells were examined by transmission and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. in contrast to a uropathogenic strain of escherichia coli, all cultures exhibited a mannose- and galactose-resistant agglutination of human group o red blood cells as well as mannose- and galactose-resistant adherence to  the bladder tissue. inhibition of exopolysaccharide synthesis did not modify adherence. indeed, adherence, apparently unrelated to these fimbriae or to the exopolysaccharide, may be a factor contributing to the pathogenicity of a. baumannii in the urinary tract or in other tissues.

TI  == cloning and characterization of 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo) transferase genes (kdta) from acinetobacter baumannii and acinetobacter haemolyticus.
AB  == 3-deoxy-d-manno-oct-2-ulosonic acid (kdo) transferases (kdta) are multifunctional glycosyltransferases with primary structures of low similarity. totally degenerated primers were deduced from two stretches of identical amino acids between known kdta sequences and used to amplify by pcr a kdta-specific fragment  from acinetobacter baumannii atcc 15308 dna which was then applied as a probe for the cloning and sequencing of the complete kdo transferase gene. with conserved pcr primers for this structural gene from a. baumannii atcc 15308, also kdta genes of a. baumannii atcc 19606 and a. haemolyticus atcc 17906 were obtained, cloned from the chromosome and sequenced. the genes coded for proteins with similarities to known kdo transferases. within the genus acinetobacter, the identity and similarity of the deduced amino acid sequences were 71% and 84.5%, respectively. the kdta sequences of both a. baumannii strains were identical and  possessed a ttg start codon, whereas atg was found in the case of a. haemolyticus. the genes from acinetobacter and kdta from escherichia coli k-12 were expressed in the gram-positive bacterium corynebacterium glutamicum. in vitro tests confirmed the function of the gene products as kdo transferases, which transferred mainly two kdo residues to a synthetic lipid a precursor of e.  coli. also, no differences between the cloned kdta genes from a. baumanniii, a. haemnolyticus and e. coli were observed when tetraacyl or hexaacyl lipid a were tested, since all transferases acted more efficiently on the former. with limiting amounts of acceptor, all kdo transferases were able to transfer a third  kdo residue with varying efficiency.

(14.5%), escherichia coli (13.1%), enterococcus faecalis (11.6%) and enterococcus solitarius (6.5%). in all strains resistance to antibiotics and chemotherapeutic drugs was assessed. conclusions: investigation of the frequency of different bacterial species, along with monitoring of the resistance is an essential prerequisite of initial antibiotic therapy of febrile episodes in neutropenic patients.

TI  == influence of aqueous extracts of medicinal plants on surface hydrophobicity of escherichia coli strains of different origin.
AB  == the adhesion of microbes on host cells is of decisive importance in the development of gram-negative microbe-induced infections and can be influenced by  the surface hydrophobicity of the microbial cell. the hydrophobicity of 155 escherichia coli strains of different origin was determined by the salt aggregation test (sat). among the strains isolated from faecal samples of healthy persons only 16.7% showed aggregative properties, whereas among the strains isolated from the urine of patients with pyelonephritis and the faecal samples of calves and pigs with diarrhoea some 40.0%-60.0% were aggregative. the influence of aqueous extracts prepared from bearberry leaves, st. john's wort herbs, wild camomile and marigold flowers on hydrophobicity of 40 e. coli and 20 acinetobacter baumannii strains was investigated. the decoctions of bearberry and st. john's wort increased remarkably the hydrophobicity of both microbial species. the infusions of wild camomile and marigold completely blocked the aggregative properties of the investigated strains. bactericidal action was relatively low in the case of bearberry and st. john's wort and completely lacking in the case of wild camomile and marigold. thus, one of the probable and  potentially important action mechanisms of the four medicinal plants studied is their ability to influence the surface characteristics of the microbial cells and thereby their putative virulence properties.

TI  == identification and analysis of a gene encoding l-2,4-diaminobutyrate:2-ketoglutarate 4-aminotransferase involved in the 1,3-diaminopropane production pathway in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the ca. 2.2-kbp region upstream of the ddc gene encoding l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase in acinetobacter baumannii was sequenced and found to contain another open reading frame of 1,338 nucleotides encoding a protein with a deduced molecular mass of 47,423 da. analysis of the homologies observed from the deduced amino acid sequence indicated that the gene product is an enzyme belonging to subgroup ii of the aminotransferases. this was first verified when examination of the crude extracts from escherichia coli transformants led to detection of a novel aminotransferase activity catalyzing the following reversible reactions: l-2,4-diaminobutyric acid + 2-ketoglutaric acid<-->l-glutamic acid + l-aspartic beta-semialdehyde. further confirmation was obtained when the gene was overexpressed in e. coli and the corresponding protein was purified to homogeneity. it catalyzed the same reactions and its n-terminal amino acid sequence was consistent with that deduced from the nucleotide sequence. therefore, the gene and its product were named dat and l-2,4-diaminobutyrate:2-ketoglutarate 4-aminotransferase (daba at), respectively. feeding experiments of a. baumannii with l-[u-14c]aspartic acid resulted in the incorporation of the label into 1,3-diaminopropane. apparent homologs of dat and  daba at were detected in other acinetobacter species by pcr amplification and western blotting. these results indicate that the dat gene (as well as the ddc gene) participates in the synthesis of 1,3-diaminopropane, the only diamine found in this genus. however, the biological role, if one exists, of 1,3-diaminopropane synthesis is unknown.

AB  == acinetobacter spp. have frequently been reported to be the causative agents of hospital outbreaks. the circumstances of some outbreaks demonstrated the long survival of acinetobacter in a dry, inanimate environment. in laboratory experiments, we compared the abilities of five acinetobacter baumannii strains, three acinetobacter sp. strains from the american type culture collection (atcc), one escherichia coli atcc strain, and one enterococcus faecium atcc strain to survive under dry conditions. bacterial solutions of the 10 strains were inoculated onto four different material samples (ceramic, polyvinyl chloride, rubber, and stainless steel) and stored under defined conditions. we investigated the bacterial counts of the material samples immediately after inoculation, after drying, and after 4 h, 1 day, and 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks of storage. a statistical model was used to distribute the 40 resulting curves among four types of survival curves. the type of survival curve was significantly associated with  the bacterial strain but not with the material. the ability of the a. baumannii strains to survive under dry conditions varied greatly and correlated well with the source of the strain. strains isolated from dry sources survived better than  those isolated from wet sources. an outbreak strain that had caused hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections survived better than the strains from wet sources, but not as well as strains from dry sources. resistance to dry  conditions may promote the transmissibility of a strain, but it is not sufficient to make a strain an epidemic one. however, in the case of an outbreak, sources of acinetobacter must be expected in the dry environment.

AB  == minimal inhibitory concentrations (mics) of enoxacin (enx), a new fluoroquinolone indicated for the treatment of urinary tract infections, was determined by agar dilution for 703 bacterial strains isolated in 1993 in 3 university hospitals in  order to study its activity against urinary pathogens; in addition, antibiograms  by agar diffusion were performed with 5 micrograms disks to calculate the regression curve and the breakpoints for sensitivity testing. activity of enx against nalidixic acid (nal) susceptible (s) enterobacteriaceae was close to that of other fluoroquinolones (fq) (mic 50 and 90: 0.25-0.5 microgram/ml); like for other fq, this activity was reduced against nal intermediate and resistant (r) enterobacteriaceae (8-64) mics of enx against p. aeruginosa were between 0.5 and  128 (2- > 128). enx had also a good activity against nal-s a. baumannii (0.06-2)  but this activity is reduced against nal-r acinetobacter (0.5- > 128). enx showed activity close to the currently available fq against methicillin susceptible staphylococci (0.5-8); the resistant strains (32- > 64) are usually methicillin resistant. enx is less effective against enterococci (4-128). the coefficient correlation of the regression curve is 0.906. for mic breakpoints of 1 and 2 micrograms/ml, zone diameter breakpoints should be 22 and 19 mm.

TI  == cloning and expression in escherichia coli of the gene encoding a novel l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the gene encoding l-2,4-diaminobutyrate decarboxylase (daba dc) was cloned from acinetobacter baumannii atcc 19606. the gene was evidently under the control of its own promoter. interestingly, the host carrying this clone also produced an appreciable amount of 1,3-diaminopropane. restriction mapping and subsequent subcloning of the cloned insert localized the daba dc gene within a 2.45-kb sphi/ecori fragment. for endogenous production of dap, a 1.75-kb ecori/psti region downstream from the daba dc gene was further required. southern blot hybridization revealed some heterogeneity in the daba dc genes among other acinetobacter species.

TI  == high level kanamycin resistance associated with the hyperproduction of aac(3)ii and a generalised reduction in the accumulation of aminoglycosides in acinetobacter spp.
AB  == the clinical isolate of acinetobacter baumannii strain sak contains an actively transcribed aacc2 gene and a latent aadb gene that encode the aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes, aac(3)ii and aad(2"), respectively. in an attempt to activate the aadb gene, the strain was cultured in the presence of kanamycin which is a substrate for aad(2"). although it was possible to isolate kanamycin resistant derivatives these were not associated with detectable aad(2") activity. instead, there was a marked increase in the level of aac(3)ii activity  which was associated with amplification of the aacc2 gene.

TI  == characterization of the chromosomal aac(6')-ij gene of acinetobacter sp. 13 and the aac(6')-ih plasmid gene of acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == the amikacin resistance genes aac(6')-ih of acinetobacter baumannii bm2686 and aac(6')-ij of acinetobacter sp. 13 bm2689 encoding aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases were characterized. the 441-bp coding sequences predict proteins with calculated masses of 16,698 and 16,677 da, respectively. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequences indicated that the proteins belonged to a subfamily of 6'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase type i enzymes from gram-negative bacteria. the aac(6')-ih gene of bm2686 was located on a 13.7-kb nonconjugative plasmid. the aac(6')-ij gene from bm2689 was not transferable either by conjugation to escherichia coli or a. baumannii or by transformation to acinetobacter calcoaceticus. plasmid dna from bm2689 did not hybridize with an intragenic aac(6')-ij probe. these results suggest a chromosomal location for this gene. the aac(6')-ij gene was detected by dna hybridization in all 28 strains of acinetobacter sp. 13 tested but not in other acinetobacter strains, including a. baumannii, proteolytic genospecies 4, 6, 14, 15, 16, and 17, and ungrouped strains. the aac(6')-ih and -ij probes did not hybridize in dot blot assays with dna from members of the families enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae that produced 6'-n-acetyltransferases. these data suggest that the genes are confined to the acinetobacter genus and that the aac(6')-ij gene is species specific and may be used to identify acinetobacter sp. 13.

TI  == plasmid mediated silver resistance in acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  == acinetobacter baumannii bl88, an environmental isolate, was resistant to 13 metals and 10 antibiotics. plumbagin cured resistance to silver, cadmium, antimony, streptomycin and ampicillin at varying frequencies. however, only silver resistance transferred (1 x 10(-6) recepient-1) to escherichia coli k12 during conjugation. correspondingly there was transfer of a 54 kb plasmid (pupi199) from a. baumannii bl88. the plasmid transformed e. coli dh5 alpha cells at a frequency of 1 x 10(-8) recepient-1. the growth rate of e. coli dh5 alpha (pupi199) was slower as compared with e. coli dh5 alpha. plasmid pupi199 was 76 and 9.6% stable in the host a. baumannii bl88 in the presence and absence of selection pressure, respectively. a. baumannii bl88 was found to accumulate and retain silver whereas e. coli dh5 alpha (pupi199) effluxed 63% of the accumulated silver ions.

TI  == in vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  == the in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. the bacteria studied were staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), staphylococcus epidermidis, enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), escherichia coli, salmonella species, proteus mirabilis, proteus vulgaris, morganella morganii, klebsiella pneumoniae, enterobacter cloacae, serratia marcescens, citrobacter spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, pseudomonas cepacia, acinetobacter baumannii, and bacteroides fragilis. in contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most enterobacteriaceae and a. baumannii. the minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (mic90s) were < 1 microgram/ml against most tested species. ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin  were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. all fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible s. aureus, with mic90s < or = 1 microgram/ml. for methicillin-resistant strains, on  the other hand, the mic90s were > or = 4 micrograms/ml. there was no significant  difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and  -resistant s. epidermidis. sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against b. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. the mic90s of most quinolones assayed against k. pneumoniae, citrobacter spp., e. cloacae, s. aureus and s. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.

TI  == [ciprofloxacin resistance in gram negative bacilli. epidemiologic aspects].
AB  == background: the aim of the present was to study the resistance to ciprofloxacin (cip) in gram negative bacilli (april 1990-march 1992) and to determine the temporary distribution of the resistant strains by species, samples and departments. methods: seven thousand four hundred seventy-eight samples were studied. the identification and determination of the sensitivity was performed by the pasco (difco) system. haemophilus spp. and campylobacter spp. were excluded from the study. the microorganisms with cim 2 mg/l were considered as resistant (cipr). results: four hundred eighty-one cipr isolations were identified (6.4%).  with regard to the percentage of resistant strains, the species with the highest  were: providencia stuartii (50%); pseudomonas cepacia (44.4%); xanthomonas maltophilia (26.9%); acinetobacter baumannii (25.8%); pseudomonas aeruginosa (16%); citrobacter freundii (12.5%); serratia marcescens (8.4%); enterobacter cloacae (5.8%) and escherichia coli (4.3%). with respect to the absolute number of resistant strains, the most frequent resistant strains were: p. aeruginosa (205), e. coli (144), and a. baumannii (41). isolation of e. coli and a. baumannii cipr increased over the study period. forty-four point five percent of  the e. coli cipr were of extrahospitalary origin; most of the a. baumannii (92.9%) and p. aeruginosa (77.6%) in contrast were of intrahospitalary origin. conclusions: p. aeruginosa, e. coli, and a. baumannii are the most frequently resistant species. the frequency of isolation of resistant strains of e. coli and a. baumannii significantly increased (p < 0.001) over the two years of the study.

TI  == characterization of acinetobacter haemolyticus aac(6')-ig gene encoding an aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase which modifies amikacin.
AB  == the amikacin resistance gene acc(6')-ig of acinetobacter haemolyticus bm2685 encoding an aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferase was characterized. the gene was identified as a coding sequence of 438 bp corresponding to a protein with a calculated mass of 16,522 da. analysis of the deduced amino acid sequence suggested that it was the fourth member of a subfamily of aminoglycoside 6'-n-acetyltransferases. the resistance gene was not transferable either by conjugation to escherichia coli or to acinetobacter baumannii or by transformation into acinetobacter calcoaceticus. plasmid dna from strain bm2685 did not hybridize with an intragenic aac(6')-ig probe. these results suggest a chromosomal location for this gene. the gene was detected by dna hybridization in all 20 strains of a. haemolyticus tested but not in 179 other acinetobacter strains, including a. baumannii, a. lwoffii, a. junii, and a. johnsonii and genospecies 3, 6, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17, of which 162 were amikacin resistant. the probe did not hybridize in dot blot assays with dnas purified from members of the families enterobacteriaceae and pseudomonadaceae that encode 6'-n-acetyltransferases. these data suggest that the aac(6')-ig gene is species specific and may be used to identify a. haemolyticus.

TI  == erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin: use of frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses to compare in vitro activities and  describe cross-resistance.
AB  == mics of erythromycin, clarithromycin, and azithromycin for 852 recent clinical isolates were determined by broth microdilution methods. frequency distribution curves, scattergrams, and regression analyses were used to compare in vitro activities and describe cross-resistance. clarithromycin was the most active drug against bacteroides spp. but the least active against haemophilus influenzae. azithromycin was most active against h. influenzae, moraxella catarrhalis, pasteurella multocida, and fusobacterium spp. but the least active against streptococcus spp. and enterococcus spp. all three drugs had equivalent activities against staphylococcus spp. and gram-positive anaerobes. none of the three drugs was particularly active against members of the family enterobacteriaceae or nonfermentative gram-negative bacilli, although concentrations of 4 micrograms of azithromycin per ml inhibited some strains of the family enterobacteriaceae (particularly escherichia coli and citrobacter diversus) and acinetobacter baumannii. although relative drug activities varied by organism, organisms relatively susceptible to one were relatively susceptible  to all and organisms relatively resistant to one were relatively resistant to all; an exception was fusobacteria, which were usually susceptible only to azithromycin. cross-susceptibility and cross-resistance were, therefore, the rule (except for fusobacterium spp.), although the percentage of susceptible organisms could be varied considerably on the basis of the selection of breakpoints.

TI  == gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults: a recent six-year experience.
AB  == thirty-eight cases of gram-negative bacillary meningitis in adults have been identified over the past six years at the veterans general hospital, taipei. twenty cases were associated with head trauma and/or neurosurgery, while 18 cases occurred spontaneously. the overall mortality was 58%. within the spontaneous meningitis group, 13 cases (72%) were due to klebsiella pneumoniae, 11 cases (61%) were associated with bacteremia and eight cases (44%) with diabetes mellitus. in spite of the administration of third-generation cephalosporins, most cases of spontaneous meningitis (15 patients, 83%) died soon after diagnosis. in  contrast, the clinical course for the postneurosurgical patients was more benign. only seven patients (35%) died during the course of therapy. common causative agents in postneurosurgical patients included pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumannii, and escherichia coli. external cerebrospinal fluid drainage devices were thought to be the most important predisposing factor in gram-negative bacillary meningitis in the postneurosurgical patients. factors that adversely influenced the mortality of gram-negative bacillary meningitis included the presence of bacteremia, shock, deep coma and a high initial cerebrospinal fluid leukocyte count.

TI  == ribotyping of the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex.
AB  == the acinetobacter calcoaceticus-acinetobacter baumannii complex consists of four  genotypically distinct but phenotypically very similar bacterial species or dna groups: a. calcoaceticus (dna group 1), a. baumannii (dna group 2), unnamed dna group 3 (p. j. m. bouvet and p. a. d. grimont, int. j. syst. bacteriol. 36:228-240, 1986), and unnamed dna group 13 (i. tjernberg and j. ursing, apmis 97:595-605, 1989). because strains in this complex cause nosocomial outbreaks, it is important to be able to identify them as completely as possible. ribotyping could provide such identification. therefore, ribotyping was done on 70 strains in the a. calcoaceticus-a. baumannii complex with known dna group affiliations by use of restriction enzymes ecori, clai, and sali. a nonradioactive digoxigenin-11-dutp-labeled escherichia coli rrna-derived probe was used. with any of the three restriction enzymes, banding patterns that were specific for each dna group were seen. all 70 strains showed banding patterns that could identify them to the correct dna group by use of any two of the three enzymes. in addition, banding patterns that could separate strains within any one dna group were present. the discriminatory index of p. hunter and m. gaston (j. clin. microbiol. 26:2465-2466, 1988), applied to all strains with the combined results  obtained with all three enzymes, revealed a value of 0.99. for strains in each dna group, the value varied from 0.93 to 0.98. these results indicate the high discriminatory power of the system when used for epidemiological typing.

TI  == bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin upon escherichia coli and acinetobacter baumanni.
AB  == the mechanisms of bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin (mechanisms a and b) upon cells of a strain of escherichia coli and one strain of acinetobacter baumannii were investigated under different conditions. the killing of e. coli cells by ciprofloxacin was significantly reduced by chloramphenicol, but this antibiotic showed almost no activity upon killing of a. baumannii cells by this quinolone. similar results were obtained when rifampicin was added to ciprofloxacin. bactericidal activity of ciprofloxacin upon nondividing cells of e. coli was lower and that upon non-dividing cells of a. baumannii was not affected when compared with activity of ciprofloxacin upon dividing cells of both microorganisms. these results demonstrate that the antibacterial activity of ciprofloxacin upon a. baumannii is independent of protein and arn synthesis, a fact which suggests that this quinolone exerts only bactericidal mechanism b upon a. baumannii. this finding might explain, at least in part, the lower susceptibility of this microorganism to ciprofloxacin.

TI  == ru 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester hr 916. i. antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  == the aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin ru 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester hr 916. ru 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. against methicillin-sensitive staphylococci ru 29 246 (mic90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. ru 29 246 inhibited hemolytic streptococci of the serogroups a, b, c and g as well as penicillin-sensitive streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (mic90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). mic90s of ru 29 246 against escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, klebsiella oxytoca, salmonella spp., shigella spp.,  proteus mirabilis and haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. only ru 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against acinetobacter baumannii (mic90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). most strains of pseudomonas spp., serratia marcescens, enterobacter spp., hafnia alvei and bacteroides spp. were resistant to ru 29 246. ru 29 246 killed escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times mic. the ph value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of ru 29 246. ru 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.

TI  == the in-vitro activity of cefodizime: a review.
AB  == for enterobacteriaceae, mic50s and mic90s of cefodizime (mg/l), respectively, were as follows, for naturally non-beta-lactamase-producing species: escherichia  coli 0.12 and 0.5, salmonella spp. and shigella spp. 0.25 and 0.5, proteus mirabilis 0.016 and 0.03; for chromosomal penicillinase-producing species. klebsiella spp. 0.25 and 64, and for chromosomal cephalosporinase-producing species. enterobacter cloacae 1 and 64, citrobacter freundii 1 and 128, serratia  marcescens 2 and 8: indole-positive proteus spp. 0.06 and 0.5; and providencia stuartii 0.5 and 1. the activity of cefodizime was not modified by plasmid-mediated penicillinase-producing strains but cefodizime was inactive against cephalosporinase hyper-producing strains and against expanded broad-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains. cefodizime was noticeably less active against pseudomonas aeruginosa and acinetobacter baumannii with mics ranging from 32 to more than 128 mg/l. haemophilus spp. and neisseria gonorrhoeae, regardless of beta-lactamase producing status, as well as n. meningitidis, were highly susceptible (mic50s and mic90s less than or equal to 0.008 mg/l). cefodizime was moderately active against methicillin-susceptible staphylococci (mic50 and mic90 8 mg/l) but failed to inhibit methicillin-resistant strains. enterococci were generally resistant: streptococcus pyogenes and str. pneumoniae were inhibited by low concentrations (mic50 and mic90 0.12 and 0.5 mg/l). a fairly wide range of mics was found for anaerobes, with lower values for clostridium perfringens (mic50 and mic90 0.5 and 1 mg/l) than for bacteroides fragilis (8- greater than 128 mg/l). these results show that cefodizime has similar properties to other third generation cephalosporins and suggest that cefodizime would find a role in the management of hospital infections.

TI  == nucleotide sequence of acinetobacter baumannii apha-6 gene: evolutionary and functional implications of sequence homologies with nucleotide-binding proteins,  kinases and other aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes.
AB  == a new kanamycin-resistance gene, detected in acinetobacter baumannii and designated apha-6, was sequenced. it specifies a 30319 dalton 3'-aminoglycoside phosphotransferase (aph(3'] that mediates resistance to kanamycin and structurally related aminoglycosides, including amikacin. pairwise comparisons of the six types of aph(3') so far detected in human pathogens (types i, ii, iii and vi) and in amino-glycoside-producing microorganisms (types iv and v), confirm that aph(3') enzymes have diverged from a common ancestor. three highly retained  motifs (1: v--hgd----n; 2: g--d-gr/k-g and 3: d--k/r--y/f---lde) located in the c-terminal part of the enzymes were defined. screening of protein sequence data bases fore each of these motifs revealed that motifs 1 and 2 are both found in nucleotide-binding phosphotransferases associated with a variety of biological processes, namely adenylate kinase, viral oncogenic protein kinases, elongation factors, na+/k+-transporting atpase, myosin and antibiotic-modifying enzymes. motif 2 probably corresponds to the mgatp binding site, while motifs 3 and 1 could be involved in the splitting of the phosphodiester bond and in the phosphate transfer, respectively. moreover, an additional motif, almost invariably centrally located, was found in all aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes.  the occurrence of this motif, possibly a recombination site which would have allowed the association of units of separate functions, is compatible with a modular concept for the structure of aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes.
