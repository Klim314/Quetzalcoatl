TI  - Antibacterial effects of silver nanoparticles on gram-negative bacteria: influence on the growth and biofilms formation, mechanisms of action.
AB  - Antibacterial action of silver nanoparticles (AgNP) on Gram-negative bacteria (planctonic cells and biofilms) is reported in this study. AgNP of 8.3 nm in diameter stabilized by hydrolyzed casein peptides strongly inhibited biofilms formation of Escherichia coli AB1157, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and Serratia proteamaculans 94 in concentrations of 4-5 mug/ml, 10 mug/ml and 10-20 mug/ml, respectively. The viability of E. coli AB1157 cells in biofilms was considerably reduced by AgNP concentrations above 100 to -150 mug/ml. E. coli strains with mutations in genes responsible for the repair of DNA containing oxidative lesions (mutY, mutS, mutM, mutT, nth) were less resistant to AgNP than wild type strains. This suggests that these genes may be involved in the repair of DNA damage caused by AgNP. E. coli mutants deficient in excision repair, SOS-response and in the synthesis of global regulators RpoS, CRP protein and Lon protease present similar resistance to AgNP as wild type cells. LuxI/LuxR Quorum Sensing systems did not participate in the control of sensitivity to AgNP of Pseudomonas and Serratia. E. coli mutant strains deficient in OmpF or OmpC porins were 4-8 times more resistant to AgNP as compared to the wild type strain. This suggests that porins have an important function related AgNP antibacterial effects.
TI  - Growth of Salmonella enteritidis and Salmonella typhimurium in the presence of quorum sensing signalling compounds produced by spoilage and pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - The effect of acylated homoserine lactones (AHLs) and autoinducer-2 (AI-2) signalling compounds present in the cell-free culture supernatants (CFS), of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Yersinia enterocolitica-like GTE 112, Serratia proteamaculans 00612, Y. enterocolitica CITY650 and Y. enterocolitica CITY844, on the growth of two Salmonella Enteritidis and two S. Typhimurium strains was assessed though monitoring of changes in conductance of the medium. Detection times (T(det)), area and slope of conductance curves were recorded. Except for P. aeruginosa 108928, which was not found to produce AI-2, all other strains produced both AHLs and AI-2. Thereafter, aliquots (20% in the final volume) of these CFS were transferred into NZ Amine broth inoculated with ca. 10(3) CFU/ml of stationary phase cultures of each Salmonella strain. While the CFS of P. aeruginosa induced a shorter detection time, i.e. acceleration of the metabolic activity, the CFS of the other microorganisms increased the detection time of Salmonella strains compared to control samples (i.e. without CFS). Results indicate that the growth of Salmonella may be affected by the presence of Quorum sensing (QS) signalling compounds and/or other novel signals existing in CFS, produced by other bacterial species and confirm the complexity of bacterial communication.
TI  - [Antibacterial effects of silver ions: effect on gram-negative bacteria growth and biofilm formation].
AB  - Minimal inhibiting AgNO3 concentration (MICs) in the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli K12, Serratia proteamaculans 94, and Serratia liquefaciens MG1 were found to be on the average within the range of 0.075-0.3 microg/ml, and for Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and P. chlororaphis 449, 0.15-0.3 microg/ml. Biofilm formation in Escherichia coli AB1157 and S. Proteamaculans 94 was completely inhibited at an AgNO3 concentration of 0.3 microg/ml, and in Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, at 0.6 microg/mlAgNO3. Mutations in E. coli genes encoding for global regulators of gene expression, such as sigma S and sigma N subunits of RNA polymerase, catabolite repression protein CRP, and Lon protease, had no marked effect on the sensitivity of cells to silver. The wild-type E. coli strains and strains deficient in excision repair (uvrA, uvrB), SOS-repair or recombination (recA, lexA, recBC, recF mutants) did not differ in their silver sensitivity. This suggests that the sensitivity of bacteria to silver does not correlate with DNA lesions that could be repaired by these repair and recombination systems. E. coli mutant strains deficient in porins OmpF or OmpC, were 3-4-fold more resistant to silver ions as compared with the wild-type strain. Experiments with pME6863 plasmid harboring the gene of N-acyl-homoserine lactonase AiiA demonstrated that Quorum Sensing regulation (QS) did not participate in the control of S. proteamaculans 94 and P. chlororaphis 449 silver sensitivity. The same conclusion was drawn from the comparison of AgNO3 MICs for the S. liquefaciens wild-type strain and a mutant strain deficient in QS.
TI  - Comparative effectiveness of Pseudomonas and Serratia sp. containing ACC-deaminase for improving growth and yield of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) under salt-stressed conditions.
AB  - Ethylene synthesis is accelerated in response to various environmental stresses like salinity. Ten rhizobacterial strains isolated from wheat rhizosphere taken from different salt affected areas were screened for growth promotion of wheat under axenic conditions at 1, 5, 10 and 15 dS m(-1). Three strains, i.e., Pseudomonas putida (N21), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N39) and Serratia proteamaculans (M35) showing promising performance under axenic conditions were selected for a pot trial at 1.63 (original), 5, 10 and 15 dS m(-1). Results showed that inoculation was effective even in the presence of higher salinity levels. P. putida was the most efficient strain compared to the other strains and significantly increased the plant height, root length, grain yield, 100-grain weight and straw yield up to 52, 60, 76, 19 and 67%, respectively, over uninoculated control at 15 dS m(-1). Similarly, chlorophyll content and K(+)/Na(+) of leaves also increased by P. putida over control. It is highly likely that under salinity stress, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid-deaminase activity of these microbial strains might have caused reduction in the synthesis of stress (salt)-induced inhibitory levels of ethylene. The results suggested that these strains could be employed for salinity tolerance in wheat; however, P. putida may have better prospects in stress alleviation/reduction.
TI  - Biotransformation of adenine and cytokinins by the rhizobacterium Serratia proteamaculans.
AB  - Approximately 60,000 microorganisms from Saskatchewan soil were screened for growth on the cytokinin N6-benzyladenine (BA) as C source. A single isolate, identified as Serratia proteamaculans, grew well on BA. The culture filtrates from S. proteamaculans were screened using reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) for the presence of secondary metabolites. The analysis revealed a major metabolite and its chemical structure was deduced as 8-hydroxy-N6-benzyladenine (8-OHBA). Subsequently, the S. proteamaculans isolate was also found to metabolize N6-(2-isopentenyl)adenine and adenine through oxidation of C-8 of the purine ring. A clone of the S. proteamaculans xanthine dehydrogenase (Xdh, EC 1.1.1.204) encoding genes was isolated in Escherichia coli. This E. coli isolate metabolized BA to 8-OHBA. Similar to other bacterial Xdh, the S. proteamaculans enzyme was composed of two subunits. The derived amino acid sequences of these Xdh subunits were most similar (XdhA, 60%; XdhB, 72%) to those of Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
