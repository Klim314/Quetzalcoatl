TI  == transport and catabolism of the sialic acids n-glycolylneuraminic acid and 3-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic acid by escherichia coli k-12.
AB  == escherichia coli can transport and catabolize the common sialic acid, n-acetylneuraminic acid (neu5ac), as a sole source of carbon and nitrogen, which  is an important mucus-derived carbon source in the mammalian gut. herein we demonstrate that e. coli can also grow efficiently on the related sialic acids, n-glycolylneuraminic acid (neu5gc) and 3-keto-3-deoxy-d-glycero-d-galactonononic  acid (kdn), which are transported via the sialic acid transporter nant and catabolized using the sialic acid aldolase nana. catabolism of neu5gc uses the same pathway as neu5ac, likely producing glycolate instead and acetate during its breakdown and catabolism of kdn requires nana activity, while other components of the neu5ac catabolism pathway are non-essential. we also demonstrate that these two sialic acids can support growth of an e. coli nant strain expressing sialic acid transporters from two bacterial pathogens, namely the tripartite atp-independent periplasmic transporter siapqm from haemophilus influenzae and the sodium solute symport transporter stm1128 from salmonella enterica ssp. typhimurium, suggesting that the ability to use neu5gc and kdn in addition to neu5ac is present in a number of human pathogens.

TI  == a prospective study of the causes of febrile illness requiring hospitalization in children in cambodia.
AB  == background: febrile illnesses are pre-eminent contributors to morbidity and mortality among children in south-east asia but the causes are poorly understood. we determined the causes of fever in children hospitalised in siem reap province, cambodia. methods and findings: a one-year prospective study of febrile children  admitted to angkor hospital for children, siem reap. demographic, clinical, laboratory and outcome data were comprehensively analysed. between october 12(th) 2009 and october 12(th) 2010 there were 1225 episodes of febrile illness in 1180  children. median (iqr) age was 2.0 (0.8-6.4) years, with 850 (69%) episodes in children <5 years. common microbiological diagnoses were dengue virus (16.2%), scrub typhus (7.8%), and japanese encephalitis virus (5.8%). 76 (6.3%) episodes had culture-proven bloodstream infection, including salmonella enterica serovar typhi (22 isolates, 1.8%), streptococcus pneumoniae (13, 1.1%), escherichia coli  (8, 0.7%), haemophilus influenzae (7, 0.6%), staphylococcus aureus (6, 0.5%) and  burkholderia pseudomallei (6, 0.5%). there were 69 deaths (5.6%), including those due to clinically diagnosed pneumonia (19), dengue virus (5), and melioidosis (4). 10 of 69 (14.5%) deaths were associated with culture-proven bloodstream infection in logistic regression analyses (odds ratio for mortality 3.4, 95% ci 1.6-6.9). antimicrobial resistance was prevalent, particularly in s. enterica typhi, (where 90% of isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and 86% were multi-drug resistant). comorbid undernutrition was present in 44% of episodes and a major risk factor for acute mortality (or 2.1, 95% ci 1.1-4.2), as were hiv infection and cardiac disease. conclusion: we identified a microbiological cause  of fever in almost 50% of episodes in this large study of community-acquired febrile illness in hospitalized children in cambodia. the range of pathogens, antimicrobial susceptibility, and co-morbidities associated with mortality described will be of use in the development of rational guidelines for infectious disease treatment and control in cambodia and south-east asia.

TI  == bloodstream infection among children presenting to a general hospital outpatient  clinic in urban nepal.
AB  == background: there are limited data on the etiology and characteristics of bloodstream infections in children presenting in hospital outpatient settings in  south asia. previous studies in nepal have highlighted the importance of murine typhus as a cause of febrile illness in adults and enteric fever as a leading bacterial cause of fever among children admitted to hospital. methods: we prospectively studied a total of 1084 febrile children aged between 2 months and  14 years presenting to a general hospital outpatient department in kathmandu valley, nepal, over two study periods (summer and winter). blood from all patients was tested by conventional culture and by real-time pcr for rickettsia typhi. results: putative etiological agents for fever were identified in 164 (15%) patients. salmonella enterica serovar typhi (s. typhi) was identified in 107 (10%), s. enterica serovar paratyphi a (s. paratyphi) in 30 (3%), streptococcus pneumoniae in 6 (0.6%), s. enterica serovar typhimurium in 2 (0.2%), haemophilus influenzae type b in 1 (0.1%), and escherichia coli in 1 (0.1%) patient. s. typhi was the most common organism isolated from blood during  both summer and winter. twenty-two (2%) patients were pcr positive for r. typhi.  no significant demographic, clinical and laboratory features distinguished culture positive enteric fever and murine typhus. conclusions: salmonella infections are the leading cause of bloodstream infection among pediatric outpatients with fever in kathmandu valley. extension of immunization programs against invasive bacterial disease to include the agents of enteric fever and pneumococcus could improve the health of children in nepal.

TI  == fine tuning of the active site modulates specificity in the interaction of o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase isozymes with serine acetyltransferase.
AB  == o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (oass) catalyzes the synthesis of l-cysteine in the  last step of the reductive sulfate assimilation pathway in microorganisms. its activity is inhibited by the interaction with serine acetyltransferase (sat), the preceding enzyme in the metabolic pathway. inhibition is exerted by the insertion of sat c-terminal peptide into the oass active site. this action is effective only on the a isozyme, the prevalent form in enteric bacteria under aerobic conditions, but not on the b-isozyme, the form expressed under anaerobic conditions. we have investigated the active site determinants that modulate the interaction specificity by comparing the binding affinity of thirteen pentapeptides, derived from the c-terminal sequences of sat of the closely related species haemophilus influenzae and salmonella typhimurium, towards the corresponding oass-a, and towards s. typhimurium oass-b. we have found that subtle changes in protein active sites have profound effects on protein-peptide recognition. furthermore, affinity is strongly dependent on the pentapeptide sequence, signaling the relevance of p3-p4-p5 for the strength of binding, and p1-p2 mainly for specificity. the presence of an aromatic residue at p3 results in high affinity peptides with k(diss) in the micromolar and submicromolar range, regardless of the species. an acidic residue, like aspartate at p4, further strengthens the interaction and results in the higher affinity ligand of s. typhimurium oass-a described to date. since oass knocked-out bacteria exhibit a significantly decreased fitness, this investigation provides key information for  the development of selective oass inhibitors, potentially useful as novel antibiotic agents.

TI  == peptides complementary to the active loop of porin p2 from haemophilus influenzae modulate its activity.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) is one of the leading causes of invasive bacterial infection in young children. it is characterized by inflammation that is mainly mediated by cytokines and chemokines. one of the most abundant components of the hib outer membrane is the p2 porin, which has been shown to induce the release of several inflammatory cytokines. a synthetic peptide corresponding to loop l7 of the porin activates jnk and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (mapk) pathways. we report a novel use of the complementary peptide approach to design a peptide that is able to bind selectively to the protein p2, thereby reducing its activity. this work provides insights into essential molecular details of p2 that may affect the pathogenesis of hib infections where interruption of the signaling cascade could represent an attractive therapeutic strategy.

TI  == community-acquired bacterial bloodstream infections in developing countries in south and southeast asia: a systematic review.
AB  == information about community-acquired bacteraemia in developing countries in south and southeast asia is scarce. we aimed to establish the case fraction of bacteraemia in febrile patients admitted to hospital. we searched four databases  and identified studies of south and southeast asia published between 1990 and 2010 that prospectively assessed patients admitted to hospital and from whom a blood culture was taken. we reviewed 17 eligible studies describing 40,644 patients. pathogenic organisms were isolated from 3506 patients (9%; range 1-51%); 1784 (12%) of 14,386 adults and 1722 (7%) of 26,258 children. salmonella  enterica serotype typhi was the most common bacterial pathogen, accounting for 532 of 1798 (30%) isolates in adults and 432 of 1723 (25%) in children. other commonly isolated organisms in adults were staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, and other gram-negative organisms, and in children were streptococcus pneumoniae and haemophilus influenzae. a substantial case fraction of bacteraemia occurs in patients admitted to hospital with fever in this region. management could be improved if diagnostic microbiology facilities were more widely available. the prevailing organisms causing bacteraemia and their susceptibility  patterns could inform empirical treatment regimens and prevention strategies.

TI  == antibacterial activity of clarithromycin loaded plga nanoparticles.
AB  == novel drug delivery systems such as nanoparticles (nps) have been proved to enhance the effectiveness of many drugs. clarithromycin is a broad spectrum macrolide antibiotic, used in many infectious conditions like upper and lower respiratory tract infections, and skin and other soft tissue infections. this paper describes the preparation and enhanced in vitro antibacterial activities of clarithromycin loaded poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) (plga) nanoparticles. a modified quasi-emulsion solvent diffusion (mqesd) method was used to prepare clarithromycin (clr) nps. the antibacterial activity of the nps was evaluated using the agar well diffusion method against escherichia coli (ptcc 1330), haemophilus influenzae (ptcc 1623), salmonella typhi (ptcc 1609), staphylococcus  aureus (ptcc 1112) and streptococcus pneumoniae (ptcc 1240). the inhibition zone  diameters related to each nano formulation were compared with those for untreated clr at the same concentrations. the results indicated that the mean inhibition zone diameters of nps against all the bacteria tested were significantly higher than those of untreated clr, particularly in the case of s. aureus. the increased potency of clr nps may be related to some physicochemical properties of nps like  modified surface characteristics, lower drug degradation, and increased drug adsorption and uptake.

TI  == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB  == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of  nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present  in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have  been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only  for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further  studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB  == carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria  encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in  the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of  these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and  s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI  == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB  == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp.  in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information  on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI  == comparative thermodynamic studies on substrate and product binding of o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase reveals two different ligand recognition modes.
AB  == background: the importance of understanding the detailed mechanism of cysteine biosynthesis in bacteria is underscored by the fact that cysteine is the only sulfur donor for all cellular components containing reduced sulfur. o-acetylserine sulfhydrylase (oass) catalyzes this crucial last step in the cysteine biosynthesis and has been recognized as an important gene for the survival and virulence of pathogenic bacteria. structural and kinetic studies have contributed to the understanding of mechanistic aspects of oass, but details of ligand recognition features of oass are not available. in the absence of any detailed study on the energetics of ligand binding, we have studied the thermodynamics of oass from salmonella typhimurium (stoass), haemophilus influenzae (hioass), and mycobacterium tuberculosis (mtoass) binding to their substrate o-acetylserine (oas), substrate analogue (methionine), and product (cysteine). results: ligand binding properties of three oass enzymes are studied  under defined solution conditions. both substrate and product binding is an exothermic reaction, but their thermodynamic signatures are very different. cysteine binding to oass shows that both enthalpy and entropy contribute significantly to the binding free energy at all temperatures (10-30 degrees c) examined. the analyses of interaction between oass with oas (substrate) or methionine (substrate analogue) revealed a completely different mode of binding.  binding of both oas and methionine to oass is dominated by a favorable entropy change, with minor contribution from enthalpy change (deltah(st-met) = -1.5 +/- 0.1 kj/mol; tdeltas(st-met) = 8.2 kj/mol) at 20 degrees c. our salt dependent ligand binding studies indicate that methionine binding affinity is more sensitive to [nacl] as compared to cysteine affinity. conclusions: we show that oass from three different pathogenic bacteria bind substrate and product through  two different mechanisms. results indicate that predominantly entropy driven methionine binding is not mediated through classical hydrophobic binding, instead, may involve desolvation of the polar active site. we speculate that oass in general, may exhibit two different binding mechanisms for recognizing substrates and products.

TI  == ultra-fast and sensitive detection of non-typhoidal salmonella using microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence ("mamef").
AB  == certain serovars of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is  needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. an innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (mamef). we have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oric locus common to all salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. we have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. following lysis and dna release, as little as 1 cfu of salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can  detect oric from salmonella serovars typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi b, paratyphi c, typhimurium, enteritidis and choleraesuis but does not detect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or acinetobacter baumanii. we have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic salmonella oric oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with pbs. these pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant  body fluids).

TI  == the vi conjugate typhoid vaccine is safe, elicits protective levels of igg anti-vi, and is compatible with routine infant vaccines.
AB  == typhoid fever remains a serious problem in developing countries. current vaccines are licensed for individuals who are 5 years old or older. a conjugate of the capsular polysaccharide (cp) of salmonella enterica serovar typhi (vi) bound to recombinant exoprotein a of pseudomonas aeruginosa (vi-repa) enhanced vi immunogenicity and protected 2- to 5-year-olds in vietnam. in this study, vi-repa was evaluated for use in infants. a total of 301 full-term vietnamese infants received expanded program on immunization (epi) vaccines alone or with vi-repa or haemophilus influenzae type b-tetanus toxoid conjugate (hib-tt) at 2, 4, and 6 months and vi-repa or hib-tt alone at 12 months. infants were visited 6, 24, and  48 h after each injection to monitor adverse reactions. maternal, cord, and infant sera were assayed for igg anti-vi and for igg antibodies to hib cp and the diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis toxins at 7, 12, and 13 months. no vaccine-related serious adverse reactions occurred. in the vi-repa group, the igg anti-vi geometric mean (gm) increased from the cord level of 0.66 to 17.4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay units (eu) at 7 months, declined to 4.76 eu at  12 months, and increased to 50.1 eu 1 month after the 4th dose (95% of infants had levels of >/= 3.5 eu, the estimated protective level). controls had no increase of the igg anti-vi gm. infants with cord anti-vi levels of <3.5 eu responded with significantly higher igg anti-vi levels than those with levels of  >/= 3.5 eu. anti-diphtheria, -tetanus, and -pertussis toxin levels were similar in all groups. vi-repa was safe, induced protective anti-vi levels, and was compatible with epi vaccines, and it can be used in infants. high cord igg anti-vi levels partially suppressed infant responses to vi-repa.

TI  == high burden of antimicrobial resistance in asia.
AB  == antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in asian countries. in asia, one of  the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (mdr) acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (esbl)-producing klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by ctx-m-9, ctx-m-14 and ctx-m-15), new delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (ndm-1)-producing enterobacteriaceae, mdr salmonella enterica serotypes choleraesuis and typhi, carbapenem-resistant a. baumannii (oxa-58 and oxa-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant candida glabrata. a few clones of mdr a. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in asia, and k. pneumoniae carbapenemase (kpc)-producing k. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed  in china. in addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant mycobacterium  tuberculosis (xdr-tb) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.

TI  == the burden of vaccine-preventable invasive bacterial infections and pneumonia in  children admitted to hospital in urban nepal.
AB  == background: protein-polysaccharide vaccines have made a significant impact on the burden of disease caused by encapsulated bacteria such as streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and have the potential to do so for salmonella typhi. nepal is one of many resource-poor nations with limited information on the epidemiology of childhood infections caused by these pathogens. methods: over a 21-month period, we studied children aged </=12 years admitted to an urban hospital in nepal with suspected bacteremia, meningitis, or pneumonia. patan hospital is a non-profit hospital with the second largest pediatric unit in the kathmandu valley. results: of 2039  children enrolled in the study, 142 (7.5%) included in the analysis had positive  blood cultures. the agents of enteric fever, salmonella typhi and salmonella paratyphi, accounted for 59/142 (42%) of all bacteremias and were the most frequently cultured pathogens in children >/=1 year of age. s. pneumoniae was isolated in 16% of positive blood cultures and was the most common cause of bacteremia in children <1 year of age. pneumonia accounted for 51% of admissions  in children >/=2 months, with 44% of these children having radiographically defined primary endpoint pneumonia. s. pneumoniae was the most commonly identified pathogen in cases of pneumonia and meningitis. the s. pneumoniae serotype distribution indicated that the 10-valent and 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccines would cover 44% and 47%, respectively, of all s. pneumoniae cultured from blood or cerebrospinal fluid (csf) isolates and 62% and 67%, respectively, of isolates associated with pneumonia. h. influenzae type b was isolated infrequently from blood or csf cultures, but is likely to be more important as a cause of pneumonia. conclusions: the data on the burden of invasive bacterial infections and pneumonia from this study suggest that vaccines in development against salmonella typhi and the pneumococcus have the potential to significantly improve the health of children in nepal.

TI  == characterization of a novel sialic acid transporter of the sodium solute symporter (sss) family and in vivo comparison with known bacterial sialic acid transporters.
AB  == the function of sialic acids in the biology of bacterial pathogens is reflected by the diverse range of solute transporters that can recognize these sugar acids. here, we use an escherichia colideltanant strain to characterize the function of  known and proposed bacterial sialic acid transporters. we discover that the stm1128 gene from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, which encodes a member of the sodium solute symporter family, is able to restore growth on sialic acid to the deltanant strain and is able to transport [(14)c]-sialic acid. using the deltanant genetic background, we performed a direct in vivo comparison of the transport properties of the stm1128 protein with those of sialic acid transporters of the major facilitator superfamily and tripartite atp-independent  periplasmic families, e. coli nant and haemophilus influenzae siapqm, respectively. this revealed that both stm1128 and siapqm are sodium-dependent and, unlike siapqm, both stm1128 and nant are reversible secondary carriers, demonstrating qualitative functional differences in the properties of sialic acid transporters used by bacteria that colonize humans.

TI  == expression of homing receptors on iga1 and iga2 plasmablasts in blood reflects differential distribution of iga1 and iga2 in various body fluids.
AB  == although secretory iga is the most abundantly produced ig isotype, the mechanisms underlying the differential distribution of iga subclasses in various body fluids remain unclear. to explore these mechanisms, we examined the distribution of iga  subclasses, the influence of the nature and sites of encounters with antigens, and the correlation between iga subclass distribution and homing potentials of circulating iga plasmablasts. iga1 predominated in serum, tears, nasal wash fluid, and saliva; the levels of iga1 and iga2 were comparable in vaginal wash fluid; and iga2 predominated in intestinal lavage fluids. seventy-one percent of  circulating iga plasmablasts secreted iga1. the intestinal homing receptor (hr),  alpha4beta7, was expressed more frequently on iga2 than on iga1 plasmablasts, with no differences in the expression of other hrs. iga subclass distribution among circulating antigen-specific antibody-secreting cells (asc) was dependent on the nature of the antigen: following vaccination with salmonella enterica serovar typhi, unconjugated pneumococcal polysaccharide, or haemophilus influenzae polysaccharide-diphtheria toxoid conjugate, the proportions of specific iga1 asc were 74%, 47%, 56%, and 80%, respectively. hr expression depended on the route of administration: expression of hrs was different after oral than after parenteral vaccination, while no difference was seen between hr expression of antigen-specific iga1 and iga2 asc induced via the same route. the  key factors determining iga subclass distribution in a given secretion are the nature of the antigens encountered at a particular site and the site-specific homing instructions given to lymphocytes at that site. these two factors are reflected as differences in the homing profiles of the total populations of circulating iga1 and iga2 plasmablasts.

TI  == inhibitory mechanism of novel inhibitors of udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase from haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == bacterial udp-n-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (mura) catalyzes the transfer of enolpyruvate from phosphoenolphyruvate (pep) to uridine diphospho-n-acetylglucosamine (unag), which is the first step of bacterial cell wall synthesis. we identified thimerosal, thiram, and ebselen as effective inhibitors of heamophilus influenzae mura by screening a chemical library that consisted of a wide range of bioactive compounds. when mura was preincubated with these inhibitors, their 50% inhibitory concentrations (ic50s) were found to range from 0.1 to 0.7 microm. in particular, thimerosal suppressed the growth of several different gram-negative bacteria such as escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella typhimurium at a concentration range of 1-2 microg/ml. these inhibitors covalently modified the cysteine residue near the active site of mura. this modification changed the open conformation of mura to a more closed configuration, which may have prevented the necessary conformational change from  occurring during the enzyme reaction.

AB  == escherichia coli penicillin-binding protein 5 (pbp5), a dd-carboxypeptidase encoded by the daca gene, plays a key role in the maintenance of cell shape. although pbp5 shares one of the highest copy numbers among the pbps, it is not essential for cell survival. to determine the effect of this redundant pbp on beta-lactam antibiotic susceptibility, pbp5 was deleted from o-antigen-negative e. coli k-12 (cs109) and o8-antigen-positive e. coli 2443, thus creating strains  am15-1 and ag1o5-1, respectively. compared with the parent strains, both mutants  were four- to eight-fold more susceptible to all the beta-lactam antibiotics tested. reversion to beta-lactam resistance was observed in the mutants upon complementing with cloned pbp5, indicating the involvement of pbp5 in maintaining an o-antigen-independent intrinsic beta-lactam resistance in e. coli cells. to check whether other daca homologues were able to substitute this behaviour of e.  coli pbp5, ag1o5-1 was complemented with its nearest daca homologues (salmonella  enterica serovar typhimurium lt2, vibrio cholerae and haemophilus influenzae). all of the cloned homologues were capable of restoring the lost beta-lactam resistance in ag1o5-1, either completely or at least partially. therefore, apart  from maintaining cell shape, involvement of pbp5 in maintaining intrinsic beta-lactam resistance is an important physiological observation and we speculate that such a strategy of deleting pbp5 may be helpful to introduce beta-lactam susceptibility in the laboratory.

TI  == pattern classification of phylogeny signals.
AB  == in this paper we propose the minimum entropy clustering (mec) method for clustering genes based on their phylogenetic signals. this entropy based method will cluster two genes together when their concatenation can decrease the entropy. an integral feature of mec is that it chooses the number of clusters automatically, which is a major advantage over the other methods. our simulation  results show that this method is quite successful in clustering genes with a common phylogeny.

TI  == role of n-acetylglucosamine within core lipopolysaccharide of several species of  gram-negative bacteria in targeting the dc-sign (cd209).
AB  == our recent studies have shown that the dendritic cell-specific icam nonintegrin cd209 (dc-sign) specifically binds to the core lps of escherichia coli k12 (e. coli), promoting bacterial adherence and phagocytosis. in this current study, we  attempted to map the sites within the core lps that are directly involved in lps-dc-sign interaction. we took advantage of four sets of well-defined core lps  mutants, which are derived from e. coli, salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and haemophilus ducreyi and determined interaction of each of these four sets with dc-sign. our results demonstrated that n-acetylglucosamine (glcnac) sugar residues within the core lps in these bacteria play an essential role in targeting the dc-sign receptor. our results also imply  that dc-sign is an innate immune receptor and the interaction of bacterial core lps and dc-sign may represent a primeval interaction between gram-negative bacteria and host phagocytic cells.

TI  == nmr assays for carbohydrate-based vaccines.
AB  == antibodies against the cell surface carbohydrates of many microbial pathogens protect against infection. this was initially exploited by the development of purified polysaccharide vaccines, but glycoconjugate vaccines, in which the cell  surface carbohydrate of a microbial pathogen is covalently attached to an appropriate carrier protein, are proving the most effective means to generate this protective immunity. carbohydrate-based vaccines against haemophilus influenzae type b, neisseria meningitidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and salmonella enterica serotype typhi (s. typhi) are already licensed, and many similar products are in various stages of development. for many of these vaccines, biological assays are not available or are inappropriate and nmr spectroscopy is proving a valuable tool for the characterisation and quality control of existing and novel products. this review highlights some of the areas  in which nmr spectroscopy is currently used, and where further developments may be expected.

TI  == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB  == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however,  on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased  susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible  h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation  of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

TI  == unexpected functional diversity among fadr fatty acid transcriptional regulatory  proteins.
AB  == the fadr protein of escherichia coli has been shown to play a dual role in transcription of the genes of bacterial fatty acid metabolism. the protein acts as a repressor of beta-oxidation and an activator of unsaturated fatty acid synthesis. fadr dna binding is antagonized by long chain acyl-coas, and thus fadr acts as a sensor of fatty acid availability in the environment. when viewed from  a genomic viewpoint, fadr proteins are unusual in that the dna binding domain is  very highly conserved among fadr-containing bacteria, whereas the c-terminal acyl-coa binding domain shows only weak conservation. to further our understanding of the role of fadr in bacterial lipid metabolism we have examined  the in vivo and in vitro properties of a diverse set of fadr proteins expressed in e. coli. in addition to e. coli fadr the proteins examined were those of salmonella enterica, vibrio cholerae, pasteurella multocida, and haemophilus influenzae. these fadr proteins were found to differ markedly in their effects on repression and induction of beta-oxidation in e. coli and in their acyl-coa binding abilities as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry. the e. coli and s. enterica proteins were the most similar, although they differed in their effects on utilization of oleic acid and acyl-coa binding affinities, whereas the p. multocida and h. influenzae proteins showed only weak repression and poor acyl-coa binding affinities. the v. cholerae fadr was strikingly superior to the  other proteins in the amplitude of its regulatory response, and it bound long chain acyl-coas appreciably more strongly than the e. coli and s. enterica proteins. the significance of these findings is discussed in view of the protein  sequences and the physiological niches occupied by these organisms.

TI  == peptides selected for binding to a virulent strain of haemophilus influenzae by phage display are bactericidal.
AB  == nontypeable haemophilus influenzae (nthi) is an obligate parasite of the oropharynx of humans, in whom it commonly causes mucosal infections such as otitis media, sinusitis, and bronchitis. we used a subtractive phage display approach to affinity select for peptides binding to the cell surface of a novel invasive nthi strain r2866 (also called int1). over half of the selected phage peptides tested were bactericidal toward r2866 in a dose-dependent manner. five of the clones encoded the same peptide sequence (kqrtsirategclps; clone hi3/17),  while the remaining four clones encoded unique peptides. all of the bactericidal  phage peptides but one were cationic and had similar physical-chemical properties. clone hi3/17 possessed a similar level of activity toward a panel of  clinical nthi isolates and h. influenzae type b strains but lacked bactericidal activity toward gram-positive (enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus aureus) and  gram-negative (proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica) bacteria. these data indicate that peptides binding to bacterial surface structures isolated by phage display may prove of value in developing new antibiotics.

TI  == novel approach to mapping of resistance mutations in whole genomes by using restriction enzyme modulation of transformation efficiency.
AB  == restriction enzyme modulation of transformation efficiencies (remote) is a method that makes use of genome restriction maps and experimentally observed differences in transformation efficiencies of genomic dna restriction digests to discover the location of mutations in genomes. the frequency with which digested genomic dna from a resistant strain transforms a susceptible strain to resistance is primarily determined by the size of the fragment containing the resistance mutation and the distance of the mutation to the end of the fragment. the positions of restriction enzyme cleavage sites immediately flanking the resistance mutation define these parameters. the mapping procedure involves a process of elimination in which digests that transform with high frequency indicate that the restriction enzyme cleavage sites are relatively far away from  the mutation, while digests that transform with low frequency indicate that the sites are close to the mutation. the transformation data are compared computationally to the genome restriction map to identify the regions that best fit the data. transformations with pcr amplicons encompassing candidate regions identify the resistance locus and enable identification of the mutation. remote was developed using haemophilus influenzae strains with mutations in gyra, gyrb,  and rpse that confer resistance to ciprofloxacin, novobiocin, and spectinomycin,  respectively. we applied remote to identify mutations that confer resistance to two novel antibacterial compounds. the resistance mutations were found in genes that can decrease the intracellular concentration of compounds: acrb, which encodes a subunit of the acrab-tolc efflux pump; and fadl, which encodes a long-chain fatty acid transporter.

TI  == cloning and sequencing of a genomic island found in the brazilian purpuric fever  clone of haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius.
AB  == a genomic island was identified in the haemophilus influenzae biogroup aegyptius  brazilian purpuric fever (bpf) strain f3031. this island, which was also found in other bpf isolates, could not be detected in non-bpf biogroup aegyptius strains or in nontypeable or typeable h. influenzae strains, with the exception of a region present in the type b eagan strain. this 34,378-bp island is inserted, in  reference to h. influenzae rd kw20, within a choline transport gene and contains  a mosaic structure of mu-like prophage genes, several hypothetical genes, and genes potentially encoding an erwinia carotovora carotovoricin er-like bacteriocin. the product of the tail fiber orf in the bacteriocin-like region shows a hybrid structure where the c terminus is similar to an h. influenzae phage hp1 tail protein implicating this open reading frame in altering host specificity for a putative bacteriocin. significant synteny is seen in the entire genomic island with genomic regions from salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar typhi ct18, photorhabdus luminescens subsp. laumondii tt01, chromobacterium violaceum, and to a lesser extent haemophilus ducreyi 35000hp. in a previous work, we isolated several bpf-specific dna fragments through a genome  subtraction procedure, and we have found that a majority of these fragments map to this locus. in addition, several subtracted fragments generated from an independent laboratory by using different but related strains also map to this island. these findings underscore the importance of this bpf-specific chromosomal region in explaining some of the genomic differences between highly invasive bpf  strains and non-bpf isolates of biogroup aegyptius.

TI  == pnuc and the utilization of the nicotinamide riboside analog 3-aminopyridine in haemophilus influenzae.
AB  == the utilization pathway for the uptake of nad and nicotinamide riboside was previously characterized for haemophilus influenzae. we now report on the cellular location, topology, and substrate specificity of pnuc. pnuc of h. influenzae is only distantly related to pnuc of escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. when e. coli pnuc was expressed in an h. influenzae pnuc mutant, it was able to take up only nicotinamide riboside and not nicotinamide mononucleotide. therefore, we postulated that pnuc transporters in general possess specificity for nicotinamide riboside. earlier studies showed that 3-aminopyridine derivatives (e.g., 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide) are inhibitory for h. influenzae growth. by testing characterized strains with mutations in the nad utilization pathway, we show that 3-aminopyridine riboside is inhibitory to h. influenzae and is taken up by the nad-processing and nicotinamide riboside route. 3-aminopyridine riboside is utilized effectively in  a pnuc+ background. in addition, we demonstrate that 3-aminopyridine adenine dinucleotide resynthesis is produced by nadr. 3-aminopyridine riboside-resistant  h. influenzae isolates were characterized, and mutations in nadr could be detected. we also tested other species of the family pasteurellaceae, pasteurella multocida and actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans, and found that 3-aminopyridine riboside does not act as a growth inhibitor; hence, 3-aminopyridine riboside represents an anti-infective agent with a very narrow host range.

TI  == transferable antibiotic resistance elements in haemophilus influenzae share a common evolutionary origin with a diverse family of syntenic genomic islands.
AB  == transferable antibiotic resistance in haemophilus influenzae was first detected in the early 1970s. after this, resistance spread rapidly worldwide and was shown to be transferred by a large 40- to 60-kb conjugative element. bioinformatics analysis of the complete sequence of a typical h. influenzae conjugative resistance element, icehin1056, revealed the shared evolutionary origin of this element. icehin1056 has homology to 20 contiguous sequences in the national center for biotechnology information database. systematic comparison of these homologous sequences resulted in identification of a conserved syntenic genomic island consisting of up to 33 core genes in 16 beta- and gamma-proteobacteria. these diverse genomic islands shared a common evolutionary origin, insert into trna genes, and have diverged widely, with g+c contents ranging from 40 to 70% and amino acid homologies as low as 20 to 25% for shared core genes. these core genes are likely to account for the conjugative transfer of the genomic islands and may even encode autonomous replication. accessory gene clusters were nestled  among the core genes and encode the following diverse major attributes: antibiotic, metal, and antiseptic resistance; degradation of chemicals; type iv secretion systems; two-component signaling systems; vi antigen capsule synthesis; toxin production; and a wide range of metabolic functions. these related genomic  islands include the following well-characterized structures: spi-7, found in salmonella enterica serovar typhi; pap1 or pklc102, found in pseudomonas aeruginosa; and the clc element, found in pseudomonas sp. strain b13. this is the first report of a diverse family of related syntenic genomic islands with a deep  evolutionary origin, and our findings challenge the view that genomic islands consist only of independently evolving modules.

TI  == genomic subtraction for the identification of putative new virulence factors of an avian pathogenic escherichia coli strain of o2 serogroup.
AB  == to identify putative new virulence factors of avian pathogenic escherichia coli (apec) strains, a genomic subtraction was performed between the apec strain mt512 and the non-pathogenic e. coli strain of avian origin ec79. seventeen dna fragments were cloned that were specific for the apec strain. among them, nine were identified that were more frequent among pathogenic than non-pathogenic isolates in a collection of 67 avian e. coli. chromosome or plasmid location, and the nucleotide sequence of these nine fragments were characterized. four fragments were plasmid-located. the nucleotide sequence of two of them exhibited  identity with the sequence of the repf1b replicon of e. coli plasmids, and the amino-acid deduced sequences from the two other fragments exhibited similarity to the products of genes sita of salmonella typhimurium and irod of e. coli, which are involved in iron metabolism. of the five chromosome-located fragments, three  were predicted to encode parts of proteins that were significantly homologous to  previously described proteins: tkta (transketolase) of haemophilus influenzae, a  frua (fructokinase) homologue of listeria innocua and gp2 (large terminal subunit) of phage 21. the putative products of the two other chromosome-located fragments were homologous to proteins with unknown functions: z0255 of e. coli strain edl933 (ehec) and rata of salmonella typhimurium strain lt2. both these chromosomal fragments, whose presence is correlated with serogroups o1 and o2 and to the virulence of apec strains belonging to these serogroups, are good candidates for being part of novel virulence determinants of apec. moreover, several fragments were shown to be located close to trna selc, asnt or thrw, which suggests they could be part of pathogenicity islands. six fragments that were shown to be part of whole orfs present in the apec strain mt 512 were also present in extra-intestinal pathogenic e. coli (expec) strains of human and animal origin. thus, the putative novel virulence factors identified in this study could be shared by expec strains of different origins.

TI  == mu-like prophage strong gyrase site sequences: analysis of properties required for promoting efficient mu dna replication.
AB  == the bacteriophage mu genome contains a centrally located strong gyrase site (sgs) that is required for efficient prophage replication. to aid in studying the unusual properties of the sgs, we sought other gyrase sites that might be able to substitute for the sgs in mu replication. five candidate sites were obtained by pcr from mu-like prophage sequences present in escherichia coli o157:h7 sakai, haemophilus influenzae rd, salmonella enterica serovar typhi ct18, and two strains of neisseria meningitidis. each of the sites was used to replace the natural mu sgs to form recombinant prophages, and the effects on mu replication and host lysis were determined. the site from the e. coli prophage supported markedly enhanced replication and host lysis over that observed with a mu derivative lacking the sgs, those from the n. meningitidis prophages allowed a small enhancement, and the sites from the haemophilus and salmonella prophages gave none. each of the candidate sites was cleaved specifically by e. coli dna gyrase both in vitro and in vivo. supercoiling assays performed in vitro, with the five sites or the mu sgs individually cloned into a puc19 reporter plasmid, showed that the mu sgs and the e. coli or n. meningitidis sequences allowed an enhancement of processive, gyrase-dependent supercoiling, whereas the h. influenzae or salmonella serovar typhi sequences did not. while consistent with a requirement for enhanced processivity of supercoiling for a site to function in mu replication, these data suggest that other factors are also important. the relevance of these observations to an understanding of the function of the sgs is discussed.

TI  == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB  == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided  effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

AB  == nad is an indispensable redox cofactor in all organisms. most of the genes required for nad biosynthesis in various species are known. ribosylnicotinamide kinase (rnk) was among the few unknown (missing) genes involved with nad salvage  and recycling pathways. using a comparative genome analysis involving reconstruction of nad metabolism from genomic data, we predicted and experimentally verified that bacterial rnk is encoded within the 3' region of the nadr gene. based on these results and previous data, the full-size multifunctional nadr protein (as in escherichia coli) is composed of (i) an n-terminal dna-binding domain involved in the transcriptional regulation of nad biosynthesis, (ii) a central nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase (nmnat) domain, and (iii) a c-terminal rnk domain. the rnk and nmnat enzymatic activities of recombinant nadr proteins from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and haemophilus influenzae were quantitatively characterized. we propose a model for the complete salvage pathway from exogenous n-ribosylnicotinamide to nad which involves the concerted action of the pnuc transporter and nrk, followed by the nmnat activity of the nadr protein. both the pnuc and nadr genes were proven to be essential for the growth and survival of h. influenzae, thus implicating them as potential narrow-spectrum drug targets.

TI  == molecular cloning and functional expression of the rfae gene required for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis in salmonella typhimurium.
AB  == the rfae (waae) gene of salmonella typhimurium is known to be located at 76min on the genetic map outside of the rfa gene cluster encoding core oligosaccharide biosynthesis of lipopolysaccharide(lps). the rfae mutant synthesizes heptose-deficient lps; its lps consists of only lipid a and 3-deoxy-d-manno-octulosonic acid (kdo), and the rfae gene is believed to be involved in the formation of adp-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose. mutants, which make incomplete lps, are known as rough mutants. salmonella typhimurium deep-rough mutants affected in the heptose region of the inner core often show reduced growth rate, sensitivity to high temperature and hypersensitivity to hydrophobic  antibiotics. we have cloned the rfae gene of s. typhimurium. the chromosomal region carrying this gene was isolated by screening a genomic library of s. typhimurium using the complementation of s. typhimurium rfae mutant. the 2.6-kb insert in the plasmid pheps appears to carry a functional rfae gene. sl1102 (rfae543) makes heptose-deficient lps and has a deep rough phenotype, but pheps complement the rfae543 mutation to give the smooth phenotype. the sensitivity of  sl1102 to bacteriophages (p22.c2, felix-o, br60) which use lps as their receptor  for adsorption is changed to that of wild-type strain. the permeability barrier of sl1102 to hydrophobic antibiotics (novobiocin) is restored to that of wild-type. lps produced by sl1102 (rfae543) carrying pheps makes lps indistinguishable from that of smooth strains. the rfae gene encoded a polypeptide of 477 amino acid residues highly homologous to the s. enterica rfae  protein (98% identity), e. coli (93% identity), yersenia pestis (85% identity), haemophilus influenzae (70% identity) and helicobacter pyroli (41% identity) with a molecular weight 53 kda.

TI  == inhibition of endotoxin effects on cultured human middle ear epithelium by bactericidal permeability-increasing protein.
AB  == hypothesis/background: endotoxin can induce morphologic changes to middle ear epithelium, which can disturb the mucociliary clearance system (mcs) and lead to  otitis media with effusion (ome). the bactericidal/permeability-increasing (bpi)  protein is a major component of neutrophil granules and binds with high affinity  to endotoxin. in this study, the capacity to inhibit the effects of endotoxin by  rbpi21, a recombinant amino-terminal analog derived from bpi, was investigated on cultured human middle ear epithelium using light microscopy and scanning- and transmission electron microscopy. methods: human middle ear epithelium was air-exposed cultured on a collagenous underlayer with different additions of endotoxin and rbpi21 to the culture medium. the tissue specimens were inspected after 4 weeks for the number of ciliated and secretory cells, thickness of the mucosal layer, and cell size. results: the morphologic changes induced by endotoxin were increased thickness of the mucosal layer and increased number of secretory cells. these changes were significantly diminished or even absent when  endotoxin was added with rbpi21 to the culture medium. conclusion: rbpi21 can inhibit morphologic changes in the middle ear epithelium due to endotoxin. hence, the authors believe that rbpi21 can be a new therapeutic agent in the treatment of ome.

TI  == serum amyloid p component bound to gram-negative bacteria prevents lipopolysaccharide-mediated classical pathway complement activation.
AB  == although serum amyloid p component (sap) is known to bind many ligands, its biological function is not yet clear. recently, it was demonstrated that sap binds to lipopolysaccharide (lps). in the present study, sap was shown to bind to gram-negative bacteria expressing short types of lps or lipo-oligosaccharide (los), such as salmonella enterica serovar copenhagen re and escherichia coli j5, and also to clinical isolates of haemophilus influenzae. it was hypothesized that sap binds to the bacteria via the lipid a part of lps or los, since the htrb mutant of the nontypeable h. influenzae strain nthi 2019-b29-3, which expresses a nonacetylated lipid a, did not bind sap. this was in contrast to the parental strain nthi 2019. the binding of sap resulted in a clear inhibition of the deposition of complement component c3 on the bacteria. sap inhibited only the activation of the classical complement pathway; the alternative route remained unaffected. in the classical route, sap prevented the deposition of the first complement component, clq, probably by interfering with the binding of clq to lps. since antibody-mediated clq activation was not inhibited by sap, sap seems to inhibit only the lps-induced classical complement pathway activation. the sap-induced inhibition of c3 deposition strongly diminished the complement-mediated lysis as well as the phagocytosis of the bacteria. the binding of sap to gram-negative bacteria, therefore, might influence the pathophysiology of an infection with such bacteria.

AB  == partial nucleotide sequences of the sapd and sapf genes of the sap operon (genbank accession no. af178651) from vibrio fischeri atcc 7744 have been determined, and the peptide transport system of atp-binding proteins sapd and sapf encoded by the genes have been deduced. alignment and comparison of the sap  proteins of v. fischeri, escherichia coli, salmonella typhimurium, and haemophilus influenzae rd show that these proteins are homologous. the sap operon residing in the genome enables v. fischeri to transport peptides and resist antimicrobial peptides. nucleotide sequence and functional analyses confirm that  the specific regulatory-region-like sequence r&r* that resides inside the sapd gene and before the sapf gene functions in gene expression and regulation; also,  it is regulated by the luxr-ai complex of the v. fischeri lux regulon. the putative upstream activator binding sequences sigmauasi, sigmauasii, sigmauasiii  tgtcgacttgggcctcgctgtccgtatgcaca (72nd to 103rd bp), tgtccgtatgcaca (90th to 103rd bp), and tgttcaagtaccagaaagaca (111st to 133rd bp) in the r&r* sequence, which are similar to the two-component regulator binding sequence tgt-n(8-12)-aca and the luxr-ai binding sequence acctgtaggatcgtacaggt in the regulatory region of the v. fischeri lux regulon, might be the specific sequences recognized by the luxr-ai complex for enhancement.

TI  == polyosides (encapsulated bacteria).
AB  == the polysaccharide capsule which surrounds bacterial species such as haemophilus  influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis and salmonella typhi is a potent virulence factor by protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis. the host responds with antibody production and specific antibodies plus complement binding to the capsule facilitate opsonization of the micro-organism, which is phagocytized and eliminated. purified capsular polysaccharides elicit t-independent antibody responses without a memory function, but are often poorly  immunogenic in infants where much of the invasive h. influenzae type b (hib) and  pneumococcal infections is seen. therefore purified polysaccharides have found limited use as vaccines. however, covalent linkage of the capsular polysaccharide, or fractions thereof, to immunogenic carrier proteins creates glycoconjugates which are t-dependent antigens and which elicit antibodies also in infants and which prime for boosting either with the glycoconjugate or the capsular polysaccharide. in the last decade hib glycoconjugate vaccines have been successfully introduced and in countries with very high immunization coverage the disease has been virtually eliminated and a decline of over 95% has been seen in  countries with slightly lower vaccine rates. world-wide use of hib glycoconjugate vaccines offers the possibility of elimination of invasive hib disease. pneumococcal (11 serotypes with coverage of approximately 85% of invasive disease), meningococcal (a, c, w 135, y but not b) and s. typhi glycoconjugates are in advanced development and offer the prospect of being as successful as the  hib glycoconjugates.

TI  == the rfae gene from escherichia coli encodes a bifunctional protein involved in biosynthesis of the lipopolysaccharide core precursor adp-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose.
AB  == the intermediate steps in the biosynthesis of the adp-l-glycero-d-manno-heptose precursor of inner core lipopolysaccharide (lps) are not yet elucidated. we isolated a mini-tn10 insertion that confers a heptoseless lps phenotype in the chromosome of escherichia coli k-12. the mutation was in a gene homologous to the previously reported rfae gene from haemophilus influenzae. the e. coli rfae gene  was cloned into an expression vector, and an in vitro transcription-translation experiment revealed a polypeptide of approximately 55 kda in mass. comparisons of the predicted amino acid sequence with other proteins in the database showed the  presence of two clearly separate domains. domain i (amino acids 1 to 318) shared  structural features with members of the ribokinase family, while domain ii (amino acids 344 to 477) had conserved features of the cytidylyltransferase superfamily  that includes the aut gene product of ralstonia eutrophus. each domain was expressed individually, demonstrating that only domain i could complement the rfae::tn10 mutation in e. coli, as well as the rfae543 mutation of salmonella enterica sl1102. dna sequencing of the rfae543 gene revealed that domain i had one amino acid substitution and a 12-bp in-frame deletion resulting in the loss of four amino acids, while domain ii remained intact. we also demonstrated that the aut::tn5 mutation in r. eutrophus is associated with heptoseless lps, and this phenotype was restored following the introduction of a plasmid expressing the e. coli domain ii. thus, both domains of rfae are functionally different and  genetically separable confirming that the encoded protein is bifunctional. we propose that domain i is involved in the synthesis of d-glycero-d-manno-heptose 1-phosphate, whereas domain ii catalyzes the adp transfer to form adp-d-glycero-d-manno-heptose.

TI  == incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5  years of age in slovakia.
AB  == owing partly to a lack of disease burden data, eastern and central european countries have not introduced universal infant immunization against haemophilus influenzae type b. to determine the incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age, data were examined from eight districts in slovakia that formed part of a national haemophilus influenzae type  b surveillance system. all invasive isolates of haemophilus influenzae type b identified from these districts during 24 months (1996-1997) were sent to a single central laboratory for serotype confirmation. thirty-five cases of confirmed haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis were identified, for a disease incidence among children under 5 years of 17.3 per 100,000 population per year. only 13 cases were identified during 1996, the first full year of the surveillance system. records were available for review at six of the eight district laboratories and showed that, using world health organization definitions, almost half of the cases of probable bacterial meningitis were culture negative, suggesting that the true incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis may be considerably higher than 17.3. the rate of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age in slovakia  is comparable to that found in western europe and north america during the prevaccine era. thus, universal, publicly funded infant vaccination in slovakia can be expected to have the same dramatic effect on haemophilus influenzae type b disease morbidity and mortality as has been demonstrated in other countries that  have adopted this approach.

TI  == structural changes in the rat middle ear mucosa due to endotoxin and eustachian tube obstruction.
AB  == the middle ears of 48 rats were used to examine the effects of endotoxin injection, eustachian tube obstruction or a combination of eustachian tube obstruction and endotoxin injection. animals were killed after 1, 2, 4, or 12 weeks and the middle ears processed for light and scanning electron microscopy. compared to the normal middle ear mucosa, the epithelial layer was more pseudostratified, cuboidal or cylindrical after endotoxin injection or obstruction of the eustachian tube. in the early phase, numerous ciliated cells occurred in areas originally almost devoid of these cells. at 3 months, degeneration of ciliated cells was observed. the combination of eustachian tube obstruction and endotoxin injection also induced a more pseudostratified, cuboidal or cylindrical epithelium with an increased number of goblet cells. however, an early decrease occurred in the number of ciliated cells in the tympanic orifice of the eustachian tube. furthermore, inflammatory cells, mainly  pmns, macrophages and lymphocytes, invaded the subepithelial layer after eustachian tube obstruction and endotoxin injection. these structural changes resulted in an impairment of the mucociliary transport system for clearance of the middle ear cavity. for this reason we believe that both endotoxin and eustachian tube obstruction or dysfunction play an important role in inducing persistent mucosal changes in the middle ear cavity, thereby prolonging otitis media with effusion.

AB  == in a prospective study conducted between mid 1993 and 1994, 437 adults and children were admitted with community-acquired septicaemia to an infectious diseases hospital in southern viet nam. gram-negative aerobes accounted for 90% of isolates and were predominantly salmonella typhi (67%), sal. para-typhi a (3%), escherichia coli (10%), and klebsiella spp. (5%). other salmonella spp. (1%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (1%), neisseria meningitidis (0.5%) and haemophilus  influenzae (0.2%) were uncommon. staphylococcus aureus (5.5%) and streptococcus pneumoniae (2%) were the most common gram-positive isolates. patients with enteric fever were younger (median age 16 years, range 1-63) than the other patients (median age 43 years, range 1-88) (p < 0.001) and had a lower mortality  rate (0.3% vs. 23%; relative risk 69.5, 95% confidence interval 9.5-507.8; p < 0.0001). over 70% of the sal. typhi isolated were multi-drug-resistant, and 4% were resistant to nalidixic acid. multidrug-resistant sal. typhi is a major cause of community-acquired septicaemia in viet nam.

TI  == potential and limitations of polysaccharide vaccines in infancy.
AB  == of infections caused by encapsulated bacteria, those due to haemophilus influenzae b (hib) are among the most restricted to infancy and require very early immunisation. hib capsular polysaccharide (cps) has the most typical t-cell independent profile. the absence of efficacy of this vaccine in infants triggered development of conjugate vaccines which are so effective that there is now no room for plain polysaccharide hib vaccines. pneumococcal infections pose similar  problems to hib, but are more complex. the immunogenicity of the different pneumococcal serotypes varies considerably in infancy. although the current cps vaccine provides limited protection in infancy, the burden of pneumococcal infection is so high that its use could be reconsidered should conjugate vaccines be available later than expected. meningococcal infections are less a specific problem for infants. again, serogroup immunogenicity varies widely. group b meningococcal cps is not immunogenic even in adults, group c behaves as hib cps,  whereas group a is immunogenic as early as 6 months of age. group a cps may prove of interest for an infant vaccine, especially in epidemic situations. typhoid fever is uncommon in infancy; vi cps is poorly immunogenic in infancy and is, therefore, of limited interest for use as an infant vaccine.

TI  == mutation of the htrb gene in a virulent salmonella typhimurium strain by intergeneric transduction: strain construction and phenotypic characterization.
AB  == the htrb gene product of haemophilus influenzae contributes to the toxicity of the lipooligosaccharide. the htrb gene encodes a 2-keto-3-deoxyoctulosonic acid-dependent acyltransferase which is responsible for myristic acid substitutions at the hydroxy moiety of lipid a beta-hydroxymyristic acid. mass spectroscopic analysis has demonstrated that lipid a from an h. influenzae htrb mutant is predominantly tetraacyl and similar in structure to lipid iv(a), which  has been shown to be nontoxic in animal models. we sought to construct a salmonella typhimurium htrb mutant in order to investigate the contribution of htrb to virulence in a well-defined murine typhoid model of animal pathogenesis.  to this end, an r- m+ gale muts recd strain of s. typhimurium was constructed (mgs-7) and used in inter- and intrastrain transduction experiments with both coliphage p1 and salmonella phage p22. the escherichia coli htrb gene containing  a mini-tn10 insertion was transduced from e. coli mlk217 into s. typhimurium mgs-7 via phage p1 and subsequently via phage p22 into the virulent salmonella strain sl1344. all s. typhimurium transductants showed phenotypes similar to those described for the e. coli htrb mutant. mass spectrometric analysis of the crude lipid a fraction from the lipopolysaccharide of the s. typhimurium htrb mutant strain showed that for the dominant hexaacyl form, a lauric acid moiety was lost at one position on the lipid a and a palmitic acid moiety was added at another position; for the less abundant heptaacyl species, the lauric acid was replaced with palmitoleic acid.

TI  == a salmonella typhimurium genetic locus which confers copper tolerance on copper-sensitive mutants of escherichia coli.
AB  == three distinct clones from a salmonella typhimurium genomic library were identified which suppressed the copper-sensitive (cu(s)) phenotype of cutf mutants of escherichia coli. one of these clones, pcutfs2, also increased the copper tolerance of cuta, -c, and -e mutants, as well as that of a lipoprotein diacylglyceryl transferase (lgt) mutant of e. coli. characterization of pcutfs2 revealed that the genes responsible for suppression of copper sensitivity (scs) reside on a 4.36-kb dna fragment located near 25.4 min on the s. typhimurium genome. sequence analysis of this fragment revealed four open reading frames (orf120, orf627, orf207, and orf168) that were organized into two operons. one operon consisted of a single gene, scsa (orf120), whereas the other operon contained the genes scsb (orf627), scsc (orf207), and scsd (orf168). comparison of the deduced amino acid sequences of the predicted gene products showed that scsb, scsc, and scsd have significant homology to thiol-disulfide interchange proteins (cuta2, dipz, cycz, and dsbd) from e. coli and haemophilus influenzae, to an outer membrane protein (com1) from coxiella burnetii, and to thioredoxin and thioredoxin-like proteins, respectively. the two operons were subcloned on compatible plasmids, and complementation analyses indicated that all four proteins are required for the increased copper tolerance of e. coli mutants. in addition, the scs locus also restored lipoprotein modification in lgt mutants of  e. coli. sequence analyses of the s. typhimurium scs genes and adjacent dnas revealed that the scs locus is flanked by genes with high homology to the cbpa (predicted curved dna-binding protein) and agp (acid glucose phosphatase) genes of e. coli located at 22.90 min (1,062.07 kb) and 22.95 min (1,064.8 kb) of the e. coli chromosome, respectively. however, examination of the e. coli chromosome  revealed that these genes are absent at this locus and no evidence has thus been  obtained for the occurrence of the scs locus elsewhere on the genome.

TI  == tumor necrosis factor during experimental lipopolysaccharide-induced otitis media.
AB  == studies in our laboratory and others have indicated that endotoxin is present in  a high percentage of human middle ear effusions, including those that are culture negative. endotoxin has been identified as one of the most potent inducers of tumor necrosis factor (tnf), but this relationship has not been investigated in regard to the pathogenesis of otitis media. the purpose of this study was to determine whether endotoxin induces the production of tnf in the middle ear. otitis media was induced in chinchillas by the injection of isolated lipopolysaccharide and middle ear fluids (mefs) and serum harvested and assayed for tnf content by means of a cytolytic assay using l-929 cells and the cell titer 96 assay (promega, madison, wi). the mef pools' tnf concentration ranged from 200 to 1,100 pg/ml mef. serum pools did not contain any detectable tnf. the  results of the present study suggest that endotoxin induces tnf production locally in the middle ear cleft, which may contribute to the pathogenesis of otitis media via any number of established inflammatory pathways.

AB  == salmonella enterica serovar blegdam has a restriction and modification system encoded by genes linked to serb. we have cloned these genes, putative alleles of  the hsd locus of escherichia coli k-12, and confirmed by the sequence similarities of flanking dna that the hsd genes of s. enterica serovar blegdam have the same chromosomal location as those of e. coli k-12 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium lt2. there is, however, no obvious similarity in their nucleotide sequences, and while the gene order in s. enterica serovar blegdam is serb hsdm, s and r, that in e. coli k-12 and s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2 is serb hsdr, m and s. the hsd genes of s. enterica serovar blegdam identify a third family of serb-linked hsd genes (type id). the polypeptide sequence predicted from the three hsd genes show some similarities (18-50% identity) with the polypeptides of known and putative type i restriction  and modification systems; the highest levels of identity are with sequences of haemophilus influenzae rd. the hsdm polypeptide has the motifs characteristic of  adenine methyltransferases. comparisons of the hsdr sequence with those for three other families of type i systems and three putative hsdr polypeptides identify two highly conserved regions in addition to the seven proposed dead-box motifs.

TI  == a human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB  == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with  acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection  from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20  bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing  loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with  the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the  rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

AB  == the cdna for the rat cytosolic branched chain aminotransferase (bcatc) has been cloned. the bcatc cdna encodes a polypeptide of 410 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 46.0 kda. by northern blot analysis, bcatc message of approximately 2.7 kilobases was readily detected in rat brain, but was absent from liver, a rat hepatoma cell line, kidney, and skeletal muscle. when expressed in cos-1 cells, the enzyme is immunologically indistinguishable from the native enzyme found in rat brain cytosol. comparison of the rat bcatc sequence with available data bases identified the escherichia coli (and salmonella typhimurium) branched chain aminotransferase (bcat) and revealed a haemophilus influenzae bcat, a yeast bcat, which is hypothesized to be a mitochondrial form of the enzyme, and the murine bcatc (protein eca39). calculated molecular masses for the complete proteins are 33.9 kda, 37.9 kda, 42.9 kda, and 43.6 kda, respectively. the rat bcatc sequence was 84% identical with murine bcatc, 45% identical with yeast, 33% identical with h. influenzae, 27% identical with the e. coli and s. typhimurium bcat, and 22% identical with the evolutionary related d-amino acid aminotransferase (d-aat) (tanizawa, k., asano, s., masu, y., kuramitsu, s., kagamiyama, h., tanaka, h., and soda, k. (1989) j. biol. chem. 264, 2450-2454). amino acid sequence alignment of bcatc with d-aat suggests that the folding pattern of the overlapping mammalian bcatc sequence is similar to that of d-aat and indicates that orientation of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor in the active  site of the eukaryotic bcat is the same as in d-aat. thus, bcat are the only eukaryotic aminotransferases to abstract and replace the proton on the re face of the pyridoxal phosphate cofactor. finally, requirements for recognition of substrate l-amino acid and alpha-carboxylate binding are discussed.

AB  == the structure-function relationship of bacterial prolipoprotein diacylgyceryl transferase (lgt) has been investigated by a comparison of the primary structures of this enzyme in phylogenetically distant bacterial species, analysis of the sequences of mutant enzymes, and specific chemical modification of the escherichia coli enzyme. a clone containing the gene for lgt, lgt, of the gram-positive species staphylococcus aureus was isolated by complementation of the temperature-sensitive lgt mutant of e. coli (strain sk634) defective in lgt activity. in vivo and in vitro assays for prolipoprotein diacylglyceryl modification activity indicated that the complementing clone restored the prolipoprotein modification activity in the mutant strain. sequence determination of the insert dna revealed an open reading frame of 837 bp encoding a protein of  279 amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 31.6 kda. s. aureus lgt showed 24% identity and 47% similarity with e. coli, salmonella typhimurium, and  haemophilus influenzae lgt.s. aureus lgt, while 12 amino acids shorter than the e. coli enzyme, had a hydropathic profile and a predicted pi (10.4) similar to those of the e. coli enzyme. multiple sequence alignment among e. coli, s. typhimurium, h. influenzae, and s. aureus lgt proteins revealed regions of highly conserved amino acid sequences throughout the molecule. three independent lgt mutant alleles from e. coli sk634, sk635, and sk636 and one lgt allele from s. typhimurium se5221, all defective in lgt activity at the nonpermissive temperature, were cloned by pcr and sequenced. the mutant alleles were found to contain a single base alteration resulting in the substitution of a conserved amino acid. the longest set of identical amino acids without any gap was h-103-gglig-108 in lgt from these four microorganisms. in e. coli lgt mutant sk634, gly-104 in this region was mutated to ser, and the mutant organism was temperature sensitive in growth and exhibited low lgt activity in vitro. diethylpyrocarbonate inactivated the e. coli lgt with a second-order rate constant of 18.6 m-1s-1, and the inactivation of lgt activity was reversed by hydroxylamine at ph 7. the inactivation kinetics were consistent with the modification of a single residue, his or tyr, essential for lgt activity.

AB  == the yersinia enterocolitica o:3 lipopolysaccharide o-antigen is a homopolymer of  6-deoxy-l-altrose. the cloned rfb region was sequenced, and 10 open reading frames were identified. transposon mutagenesis, deletion analysis and transcomplementation experiments showed that eight of the genes, organized into two operons, rfbabc and rfbdefgh, are essential for o-antigen synthesis. functional tandem promoters were identified upstream of both operons. of the deduced polypeptides rfba, rfbf and rfbg were similar to salmonella proteins involved in the dtdp-l-rhamnose biosynthesis. rhamnose and 6-deoxy-l-altrose are  c3-epimers suggesting that analogous pathways function in their biosynthesis. rfbd and rfbe were similar to capsular polysaccharide export proteins, e.g. kpsm  and kpst of escherichia coli. this and transposon mutagenesis showed that rfbd and rfbe function as o-antigen exporters.

AB  == heterogeneity in the lipooligosaccharides (los) of pathogenic haemophilus and neisseria species is evident from the multiplicity of components observed with electrophoretic analyses. knowledge of the precise structures that make up these  diverse los molecules is clearly the key to reaching an understanding of pathogenic processes such as phase variation and molecular mimicry. except for a  few cases, little is known about the specific structural features of los that underlie phase variation and molecular mimicry, partly because of the inherent difficulties in the structural elucidation of these complex glycolipids. in the lipopolysaccharides (lps) from salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, rough, or r-type, mutants have been isolated that have provided insight into the  biosynthetic pathways and associated genetics that control lps expression. nonetheless, recent work has shown that these r-type lps are more complex than originally thought, and significant heterogeneity is still observed, primarily in their phosphorylation states. in order to investigate the structures of lps and los in a more rapid fashion, we have determined the precise molecular weights of  los (and lps) preparations from various haemophilus, neisseria, and salmonella species by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry. the los (or lps) were first o-deacylated under mild hydrazine conditions to remove o-linked esters primarily  from the lipid a portion. under negative-ion conditions, the o-deacylated los yield abundant multiply deprotonated molecular ions, (m-nh)n-, where n refers to  the number of protons removed and therefore determines the absolute charge state, n = z. mass spectra from different los and lps preparations have provided detailed information concerning the structural basis for los (and lps) heterogeneity and corresponding saccharide compositions. the identification of sialic acid in the los of haemophilus and neisseria species and the variable phosphorylation of the core of s. typhimurium lps have afforded insights into the biosynthetic pathways used by these organisms. information of this type is important for understanding the underlying genetic and environmental factors controlling los and lps expression.

AB  == three gene libraries of bordetella avium 197 dna were prepared in escherichia coli le392 by using the cosmid vectors pcp13 and pya2329, a derivative of pcp13 specifying spectinomycin resistance. the cosmid libraries were screened with convalescent-phase anti-b. avium turkey sera and polyclonal rabbit antisera against b. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. one e. coli recombinant clone produced a 56-kda protein which reacted with convalescent-phase serum from a turkey infected with b. avium 197. in addition, five e. coli recombinant clones were identified which produced b. avium outer membrane proteins with molecular masses of 21, 38, 40, 43, and 48 kda. at least one of these e. coli clones, which encoded the 21-kda protein, reacted with both convalescent-phase turkey sera and  antibody against b. avium 197 outer membrane proteins. the gene for the 21-kda outer membrane protein was localized by tn5seq1 mutagenesis, and the nucleotide sequence was determined by dideoxy sequencing. dna sequence analysis of the 21-kda protein revealed an open reading frame of 582 bases that resulted in a predicted protein of 194 amino acids. comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the gene encoding the 21-kda outer membrane protein with protein sequences in the national biomedical research foundation protein sequence data base indicated significant homology to the ompa proteins of shigella dysenteriae, enterobacter aerogenes, e. coli, and salmonella typhimurium and to neisseria gonorrhoeae outer membrane protein iii, haemophilus influenzae protein p6, and pseudomonas aeruginosa porin protein f. the gene (ompa) encoding the b. avium 21-kda protein hybridized with 4.1-kb dna fragments from ecori-digested, chromosomal dna of bordetella pertussis and bordetella bronchiseptica and with 6.0- and 3.2-kb dna fragments from ecori-digested, chromosomal dna of b. avium and b. avium-like dna, respectively. a 6.75-kb dna fragment encoding the b. avium 21-kda protein was subcloned into the asd+ vector pya292, and the construct was introduced into the avirulent delta cya delta crp delta asd s. typhimurium chi 3987 for oral immunization of birds. the gene encoding the 21-kda protein was expressed equivalently in b. avium 197, delta asd e. coli chi 6097, and s. typhimurium chi 3987 and was localized primarily in the cytoplasmic membrane and  outer membrane. in preliminary studies on oral inoculation of turkey poults with  s. typhimurium chi 3987 expressing the gene encoding the b. avium 21-kda protein, it was determined that a single dose of the recombinant salmonella vaccine failed to elicit serum antibodies against the 21-kda protein and challenge with wild-type b. avium 197 resulted in colonization of the trachea and thymus with b. avium 197.

TI  == human immunodeficiency virus and infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta: report of three cases.
AB  == three patients who were seropositive for human immunodeficiency virus underwent surgery for infected aneurysm of the abdominal aorta. fever and abdominal pain were the principal presenting clinical features. none of the patients had any opportunistic infections or endocarditis. in two cases, a ruptured aneurysm was demonstrated radiographically. in the remaining case, sonograms were diagnostic.  the organisms responsible were salmonella, hemophilus influenzae, and mycobacterium tuberculosis. in two cases, the infectious origin was evidenced by  bacteriologic examination of the aortic wall, which revealed the presence of salmonella enteritidis and koch's bacillus. although hemophilus influenzae was not found in the aortic wall of the remaining case, the infectious origin of the  aneurysm was established because preoperative blood cultures were positive for this pathogen, and pathohistologic examination of the specimen showed destruction associated with leukocyte infiltration of the aneurysmal wall. an in situ prosthetic graft replacement protected by omentum was performed in all three cases. antibiotic therapy was continued for several weeks. all patients are well  with follow-up ranging from 10 to 21 months. infectious aneurysm associated with  human immunodeficiency virus seropositivity results in bacterial infestation of an atheromatous aorta. infected phenomena are promoted by cellular immunodeficiency. surgery was justified in these cases because of the immediate threat of rupture.

TI  == enzymatically deacylated neisseria lipopolysaccharide (lps) inhibits murine splenocyte mitogenesis induced by lps.
AB  == acyloxyacyl hydrolase is a leukocyte enzyme that selectively removes the secondary acyl chains from the lipid a moiety of gram-negative bacterial lipopolysaccharides (lps). as predicted by the reported contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of lipid a analogs, enzymatic deacylation of salmonella typhimurium rc lps substantially reduces its potency in the dermal shwartzman reaction and in several in vitro assays that measure responses of human endothelial cells and neutrophils, whereas the potency of this lps for inducing murine splenocyte mitogenesis is affected much less. in the experiments  described here, we studied the impact of acyloxyacyl hydrolysis on the bioactivities of several lps that differ from salmonella lps in carbohydrate and  lipid a structures. deacylated lps from escherichia coli, haemophilus influenzae, neisseria meningitidis, and s. typhimurium were similarly reduced in potency in the limulus lysate test (30- to 60-fold reduction in potency relative to the corresponding mock-treated lps), and the ability of all of these deacylated lps to stimulate neutrophil adherence to human endothelial cells was reduced by a factor of 100 or more. for lps from e. coli, h. influenzae, and pseudomonas aeruginosa, the impact of deacylation on spleen cell mitogenesis was also similar to that observed for s. typhimurium lps: deacylation reduced potency by less than 15-fold. unexpectedly, the potency of neisseria lps in the murine splenocyte mitogenicity test was reduced over 100-fold by deacylation, and deacylated neisseria lps could block the mitogenic activity of neisseria and salmonella lps. these studies indicate that the contribution of secondary acyl chains to the bioactivities of a given lps cannot be predicted with confidence from the reported structure-activity relationships of lipid a or from the behavior of other deacylated lps.

TI  == genetic mechanisms for modulating virulence determinants on the bacterial surface.
AB  == many pathogenic bacteria gain considerable advantage in being able to vary the nature of their surfaces. this means that the stimulus presented to the immune systems of their animal or human hosts is varied. consequently such pathogens can evade certain host defences and either prolong the course of disease or ensure that repeated infections are possible because the host does not develop lasting immunity. in recent years evidence has been accumulating for a complex variety of genetic mechanisms that allow bacteria to switch the expression of their surface  components on and off and also to vary the structural and antigenic nature of those components. most of the mechanisms that will be discussed here involve rearrangements of structural or controlling genes within the bacterial chromosome or in some cases between plasmids. the role of such changes in the evolution of pathogens and bacteria in general will be discussed.

TI  == ceftriaxone in the treatment of bacterial meningitis in adults.
AB  == twenty-six adults with acute bacterial meningitis were enrolled in an open randomized comparative study. the organisms isolated from csf were streptococcus  pneumoniae, staphylococcus epidermidis, haemophilus influenzae, escherichia coli  and salmonella typhi. 13 patients (group a) were treated once daily with intravenous ceftriaxone (rocephin). the 13 patients in group b received ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol in 4 doses/day. the mean duration of therapy in groups a and b was 9.9 and 12.3 days, respectively. this difference in the duration of therapy was statistically significant. all patients from group a showed clinical improvement and all were bacteriologically cured. in group b only 12 patients were clinically and bacteriologically cured; 1 patient had to be withdrawn from the therapy because csf culture remained positive after 48 h of therapy. ceftriaxone was well tolerated in all patients; ampicillin or ampicillin plus chloramphenicol were associated with diarrhea and skin rash in 6 patients.

TI  == effect of haemophilus influenzae type b lipopolysaccharide on complement activation and polymorphonuclear leukocyte function.
AB  == purified lipopolysaccharide (lps) from haemophilus influenzae type b (hib) was examined for its capacity to interact with human hemolytic complement, generate conversion products of c3, c4, and factor b, stimulate c5a activity, and affect human neutrophil chemiluminescence and phagocytosis. salmonella typhimurium lps and salmonella minnesota rb lps (r345 mutant) were examined for comparison. incubation of hib lps with human serum deficient in gamma-globulin or with normal human serum containing 10 mm egta and 7 mm mgcl2 resulted in some depletion of hemolytic complement and conversion of c3 to degradation products (determined by  inhibition of passive hemolysis and electrophoresis/immunofixation, respectively), indicating that complement activation occurred by the alternative  pathway. complement activation by hib lps and s. minnesota rb lps was similar, but significantly less effective than by s. typhimurium lps (p less than 0.01). solubilized hib lipid a, but not lps, induced conversion products of c4 in hypogammaglobulinemic serum, indicating activation of the classical pathway. similar levels of c5a activity were generated by incubation of hib lps and s. typhimurium lps in hypogammaglobulinemic serum, as determined by neutrophil shape change and neutrophil aggregation. hib lps directly stimulated neutrophil chemiluminescence, whereas s. typhimurium lps had little effect. phagocytosis of  radiolabeled, opsonized hib by neutrophils was diminished by s. minnesota rb lps, hib lps, or solubilized hib lipid a (p less than 0.001), but was slightly increased by s. typhimurium lps. neither the oligosaccharide of hib lps or hib capsular polysaccharide was capable of interacting with complement or altering neutrophil chemiluminescence or phagocytosis.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI  == binding of polymyxin b nonapeptide to gram-negative bacteria.
AB  == the binding of the outer membrane-disorganizing peptide polymyxin b nonapeptide (pmbn) to gram-negative bacteria was studied by using tritium-labeled pmbn. smooth salmonella typhimurium had a binding capacity of ca. 6 nmol of pmbn per mg (dry weight) of bacteria, which corresponds to ca. 1 x 10(6) to 2 x 10(6) molecules of pmbn per single cell. the binding was of relatively high affinity (kd, 1.3 microm). the isolated outer membrane of s. typhimurium bound ca. 100 nmol of pmbn per mg of outer membrane protein (kd, 1.1 microm), whereas the cytoplasmic membrane bound 9 to 10 times less. other bacteria which are susceptible to the action of pmbn (escherichia coli strains, pseudomonas aeruginosa, haemophilus influenzae) also bound large amounts of pmbn. the s. typhimurium pmra mutant, neisseria gonorrhoeae, and proteus mirabilis (all known  as resistant to polymyxin and pmbn) bound 3.3, 4, and 12 times less than s. typhimurium, respectively. the binding of pmbn to s. typhimurium was effectively  inhibited by low concentrations of polymyxin b, compound em49 (octapeptin), polylysine, and protamine. spermine, ca2+, and mg2+ also inhibited the pmbn binding although they were ca. 160, 700, and 2,400 times less active (based on molarity) than polymyxin b, respectively. no binding inhibition was found at the  tested concentrations of streptomycin, tetralysine, spermidine, or cadaverine.

TI  == bacteremia in hospitalized black south african children. a one-year study emphasizing nosocomial bacteremia and bacteremia in severely malnourished children.
AB  == during a one-year period, 315 of 5,397 children admitted to the general pediatric wards of a hospital had bacteremia. the commonest causative organisms were streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enteritidis, hemophilus influenzae, and escherichia coli. most episodes of bacteremia were associated with gastroenteritis, pneumonia, or meningitis. seventy-eight episodes occurred in children with severe protein-energy malnutrition, and 46 episodes were hospital acquired. the overall case fatality rate was 23.2%, being highest in children with severe malnutrition and in those with other underlying conditions. the high  proportion of bacteremias due to s pneumoniae and s enteritidis possibly reflects infections occurring in a lower socioeconomic group living in a temperate climate in crowded conditions. the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy for children who have suspected bacteremia in association with gastroenteritis or severe malnutrition is a combination of ampicillin sodium and gentamicin sulfate.

TI  == [immunostimulation in an animal model using intestinal bacteria preparations].
AB  == the treatment of mice with an injection preparation consisting of killed r-tribes of non-pathogenous e. coli caused an increase in microbicidic activities in the animal's blood and effects a significant protection against consecutive infections with salmonella typhimurium. the enhancement of the animal' resistance capacity appears to be non-specific, and connected with the activity of leucocytes. oral application of preparations of intestinal bacteria led to increased resistance against consecutive infections with salmonella typhimurium and haemophilus influenzae. three different oral vaccines have been used: streptococcus faecalis and e. coli, a viable vaccine of non-pathogenous streptococcus faecalis and a viable vaccine of e. coli. the enhancement of the resistance can be attributed to an induction of the chemotactic efficiency of the animal neutrophilic cells. the chemotactic response of these cells seems to be enhanced. the mode of action of both the other oral vaccines remains obscure.

TI  == comparative in vitro appraisal of piperacillin, including its activity against salmonella typhi.
AB  == piperacillin was evaluated in vitro against 711 clinical isolates of aerobic and  anerobic gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, including 76 isolates of salmonella typhi. piperacillin minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (mbcs) were compared with those of a range of beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and other antimicrobial agents, and inoculum size effects were considered. the relationship between dilution and disk diffusion tests was studied by regression analysis. in addition, piperacillin was assessed  in combination with aminoglycoside and other beta-lactam drugs. this investigation has confirmed the activity of piperacillin against a broad range of bacteria, including pseudomonas, enterobacteriaceae, neisseria, beta-lactamase-negative haemophilus influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus as well as enterococci, bacteroides fragilis, and other anaerobes. all strains of pseudomonas aeruginosa were inhibited by </=32 mug/ml or less, demonstrating again the potential usefulness of piperacillin in the treatment of pseudomonal infections. s. typhi proved susceptible to piperacillin, all isolates being inhibited by 1 mug/ml. inoculum size experiments showed that inocula of 10(8) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably higher than those resulting from inocula of 10(6) cfu, and inocula of 10(2) cfu resulted in mics and mbcs appreciably lower than those resulting from inocula of 10(4) cfu. piperacillin was active against all gentamicin-resistant pseudomonads tested, but not against gentamicin-resistant klebsiellas and enterobacters. combinations of piperacillin  with tobramycin and amikacin were consistently synergistic against pseudomonas and serratia isolates. less consistent results were shown when piperacillin was combined with aminoglycosides or cephalothin against klebsiella and indole-positive proteus isolates, although synergy was observed in most cases. occasional antagonistic reactions were encountered with piperacillin-cephalothin  or piperacillin-tobramycin combinations against the latter isolates.

AB  == heat-killed strains of staphylococcus aureus and staphylococcus albus can induce  in guinea pigs a state of altered reactivity to skin homografts which is indistinguishable from that which results from sensitization with homologous tissues or group a streptococci. challenge of suitably prepared recipients with first-set skin homografts obtained from unrelated randomly selected donors elicits white graft reactions or accelerated rejection of such grafts. other bacteria tested included lancefield streptococcal groups b, c, d, e, g, h, l, and o, pneumococcus types ii, iii, xiv and a rough strain, corynebacterium xerosis, bacillus subtilis, escherichia coli, aerobacter aerogenes, salmonella typhimurium, proteus vulgaris, neisseria catarrhalis, haemophilus influenzae, and two human virulent strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. none of these microorganisms was active in the induction of homograft sensitivity in the guinea pig. pretreatment of recipients with gram-negative bacterial suspensions was associated with a slight increase in the mean survival time of first-set skin homografts. results of this study suggest the presence in staphylococci, as well  as in group a streptococci, of antigens related in their biologic effects to tissue transplantation antigens.
