TI  == isolation and molecular characterization of antibiotic-resistant lactic acid bacteria from poultry and swine meat products.
AB  == the transfer via the food chain from animals to humans of microbes that are resistant to antimicrobial agents is of increasing concern. to determine the contributions of nonpathogenic microflora to the occurrence and spread of antibiotic resistance (ar) genes in the food chain, 123 lactic acid bacteria were isolated from 29 samples of raw and processed pork and chicken meat products that had previously tested positive for one or more ar genes that encode clinically relevant ars: tet(m), tet(o), tet(k), erm(a), erm(b), erm(c), aac (6')-ie aph (2")-ia, meca, and blaz. all of the isolates were initially tested for their ar gene profiles by pcr. the 59 isolates carrying a tet, erm, or blaz gene were taken through molecular identification, analyzed by determination of the mic, and subjected to genetic fingerprinting. lactococcus garvieae was the predominant species (28 isolates), followed by lactobacillus plantarum (11 isolates) and l. salivarius (6 isolates), whereas lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis, lactobacillus  johnsonii, l. reuteri, l. crispatus, and l. brevis were identified at lower frequencies. the tet(m) and erm(b) genes were the most frequently detected. assessment of multiple resistances in 18 tet positive (tet+) isolates revealed that tet(m) plus erm(b) and tet(k) plus erm(b) were the most frequent ar gene patterns. partial sequencing of the tet(m) open reading frame of three selected strains showed high sequence similarities (> 99%) with tet(m) genes previously found in human pathogens (listeria monocytogenes and neisseria meningitidis). southern hybridization with plasmid profiles revealed these strains contained tet(m)-carrying plasmids.

TI  == identification and antagonistic activity of lactic acid bacteria occurring in porcine blood from industrial slaughterhouses--a preliminary study.
AB  == ninety-seven lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from slaughterhouse porcine blood in order to select autochthonous lab strains for use as biopreservatives of this by-product. they were identified by 16s rdna sequencing; and their inhibition capacity was determined against four bacterial species frequently found in contaminated blood, i.e. staphylococcus aureus, escherichia coli, pseudomonas fluorescens and bacillus spp. the taxonomic study showed an unexpected low diversity of lab in blood, i.e. only 8 different species were found, from which just 4, i.e. enterococcus raffinosus, lactobacillus murinus, lactobacillus reuteri and lactococcus garvieae, amounted to more than 90% of all  isolates. inhibition tests in solid culture media proved that s. aureus and bacillus spp. were inhibited by most lab strains obtained from porcine blood. e.  coli was the indicator less affected by the isolated lab species. several isolates efficiently inhibited the growth of all tested indicators.
