TI  == analysis of symptomatic and asymptomatic primary root canal infections in adult norwegian patients.
AB  == introduction: this molecular study analyzed the microbiota of primary root canal  infections from adult norwegian patients. methods: samples were taken from the necrotic root canals of teeth with symptomatic (n = 13) or asymptomatic (n = 21)  apical periodontitis and chronic apical abscesses (n = 9). dna was extracted from samples, and bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 50 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: bacterial dna was detected in all cases. in teeth with asymptomatic apical periodontitis, the most frequent taxa were dialister invisus  (71%), fusobacterium nucleatum (62%), and porphyromonas endodontalis (62%). in chronic apical abscesses, the most prevalent taxa were p. endodontalis (100%), d. invisus (89%), parvimonas micra (78%), and solobacterium moorei (78%). in teeth with symptomatic apical periodontitis, the most prevalent taxa were d. invisus, p. endodontalis, s. moorei, propionibacterium acnes, and streptococcus species (all in 69%). none of the targeted taxa were significantly associated with either sinus tract or pain (p > .05), except for selenomonas sputigena, which was more frequently found in painful cases (p = .04). no taxa were found in significantly  higher levels in any conditions (p > .05). cluster analyses revealed bacterial groupings that differed between cases with and without pain. conclusions: although basically the same species were highly prevalent in the different conditions examined and none of the most prevalent taxa were positively associated with symptoms, results revealed that species formed different partnerships and associations in samples from teeth with or without pain. therefore, it is possible that more virulent multispecies communities can form as a result of overall bacterial combinations and give rise to acute inflammation.

TI  == comparison of the in vivo antimicrobial effectiveness of sodium hypochlorite and  chlorhexidine used as root canal irrigants: a molecular microbiology study.
AB  == introduction: the purpose of this clinical study was to compare the antimicrobial effects of 2.5% sodium hypochlorite (naocl) and 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (chx) when used as irrigants during treatment of teeth with apical periodontitis. methods: forty-seven single-rooted single-canal teeth with necrotic pulps and asymptomatic apical periodontitis were selected for this study according to stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria. bacterial samples were taken at the baseline (s1) and after (s2) chemomechanical preparation using 2.5% naocl (n = 30) or 0.12% chx (n = 17) as the irrigant. bacterial, archaeal, and fungal presence was evaluated by broad-range polymerase chain reaction (pcr), whereas bacterial identifications were performed by a closed-ended reverse-capture checkerboard approach targeting 28 candidate endodontic pathogens. results: all s1 samples were pcr positive for bacterial presence but negative for both archaea and fungi. both naocl- and chx-based protocols were significantly effective in reducing the bacterial levels and number of taxa. no significant differences were observed between them in all tested parameters including the incidence of negative pcr results in s2 (40% for naocl vs 47% for chx, p = 0.8), reduction in  the number of taxa per canal (p = 0.3), and reduction in the bacterial levels (p  = 0.07). the most prevalent taxa in s2 samples from the naocl group were propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus species, porphyromonas endodontalis, and selenomonas sputigena. in the chx group, the most prevalent taxa in s2 were dialister invisus, actinomyces israelii, prevotella baroniae, propionibacterium acidifaciens, and streptococcus species. conclusions: treatment protocols using irrigation with either naocl or chx succeeded in significantly reducing the the number of bacterial taxa and their levels in infected root canals, with no significant difference between these substances.

TI  == comparisons of subgingival microbial profiles of refractory periodontitis, severe periodontitis, and periodontal health using the human oral microbe identification microarray.
AB  == background: this study compared the subgingival microbiota of subjects with refractory periodontitis (rp) to those in subjects with treatable periodontitis (grs = good responders) or periodontal health (ph) using the human oral microbe identification microarray (homim). methods: at baseline, subgingival plaque samples were taken from 47 subjects with periodontitis and 20 individuals with ph and analyzed for the presence of 300 species by homim. the subjects with periodontitis were classified as having rp (n = 17) based on mean attachment loss (al) and/or more than three sites with al >or=2.5 mm after scaling and root planing, surgery, and systemically administered amoxicillin and metronidazole or  as grs (n = 30) based on mean attachment gain and no sites with al >or=2.5 mm after treatment. significant differences in taxa among the groups were sought using the kruskal-wallis and chi(2) tests. results: more species were detected in patients with disease (gr or rp) than in those without disease (ph). subjects with rp were distinguished from grs or those with ph by a significantly higher frequency of putative periodontal pathogens, such as parvimonas micra (previously peptostreptococcus micros or micromonas micros), campylobacter gracilis, eubacterium nodatum, selenomonas noxia, tannerella forsythia (previously t. forsythensis), porphyromonas gingivalis, prevotella spp., treponema spp., and eikenella corrodens, as well as unusual species (pseudoramibacter alactolyticus,  tm7 spp. oral taxon [ot] 346/356, bacteroidetes sp. ot 272/274, solobacterium moorei, desulfobulbus sp. ot 041, brevundimonas diminuta, sphaerocytophaga sp. ot 337, shuttleworthia satelles, filifactor alocis, dialister invisus/pneumosintes,  granulicatella adiacens, mogibacterium timidum, veillonella atypica, mycoplasma salivarium, synergistes sp. cluster ii, and acidaminococcaceae [g-1] sp. ot 132/150/155/148/135) (p <0.05). species that were more prevalent in subjects with ph than in patients with periodontitis included actinomyces sp. ot 170, actinomyces spp. cluster i, capnocytophaga sputigena, cardiobacterium hominis, haemophilus parainfluenzae, lautropia mirabilis, propionibacterium propionicum, rothia dentocariosa/mucilaginosa, and streptococcus sanguinis (p <0.05). conclusion: as determined by homim, patients with rp presented a distinct microbial profile compared to patients in the gr and ph groups.

TI  == microorganisms in root canal-treated teeth from a german population.
AB  == posttreatment apical periodontitis is usually associated with persistent or secondary intraradicular infection. this study evaluated the presence and relative levels of 28 bacterial taxa in treated root canals of teeth with posttreatment apical periodontitis from german patients using 16s ribosomal rna (rrna) gene probes in a reverse-capture checkerboard hybridization assay. species-specific polymerase chain reaction (pcr) was also performed to detect enterococcus faecalis and candida albicans. bacterial dna was detected in all samples. twenty of the 28 taxon-specific probes tested were reactive with at least one sample. taxa detected more frequently included streptococcus species (47%), lactobacillus species (35%), dialister invisus (29%), eubacterium infirmum (29%), prevotella intermedia (29%), selenomonas sputigena (29%), synergistes oral clone ba121 (29%), and treponema denticola (29%). only eight taxa were present at levels >10(5). of these, streptococci and t. denticola were the most prevalent. species-specific pcr detected e. faecalis in 47% of the cases and c. albicans in  6%. findings of this study confirm the strong association between persistent/secondary intraradicular infection and posttreatment apical periodontitis. most cases harbored a mixed infection, and e. faecalis, if present, was never the most dominant species in the consortium. several other bacterial taxa were detected, and an involvement with the etiology of posttreatment apical periodontitis is suspected.
