TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of angelica archangelica l.  (apiaceae) roots.
AB  == in this paper, the chemical composition and the antimicrobial activity of the essential oil of angelica archangelica l. (apiaceae) roots from central italy were analyzed. the major constituents of the oil were alpha-pinene (21.3%), delta-3-carene (16.5%), limonene (16.4%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.7%). the oil shows a good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, clostridium perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and candida albicans with minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values of 0.25, 0.25, 0.13, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50% v/v, respectively. a weaker antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli-very useful in the intestinal microflora-has also been shown with mic values >4.0% v/v.

TI  == comparative in vitro activities of smt19969, a new antimicrobial agent, against clostridium difficile and 350 gram-positive and gram-negative aerobic and anaerobic intestinal flora isolates.
AB  == the comparative in vitro activity of smt19969, a novel, narrow-spectrum, nonabsorbable agent, was studied against 50 ribotype-defined clostridium difficile strains, 174 gram-positive and 136 gram-negative intestinal anaerobes,  and 40 gram-positive aerobes. smt19969 was one dilution more active against c. difficile isolates (mic range, 0.125 to 0.5 mug/ml; mic90, 0.25 mug/ml), including ribotype 027 strains, than fidaxomicin (range, 0.06 to 1 mug/ml; mic90, 0.5 mug/ml) and two to six dilutions lower than either vancomycin or metronidazole. smt19969 and fidaxomicin were generally less active against gram-negative anaerobes, especially the bacteroides fragilis group species, than  vancomycin and metronidazole, suggesting that smt19969 has a lesser impact on the normal intestinal microbiota that maintain colonization resistance. smt19969 showed limited activity against other gram-positive anaerobes, including bifidobacteria species, eggerthella lenta, finegoldia magna, and peptostreptococcus anaerobius, with mic90s of >512, >512, 64, and 64 mug/ml, respectively. clostridium species showed various levels of susceptibility, with c. innocuum being susceptible (mic90, 1 mug/ml) and c. ramosum and c. perfringens being nonsusceptible (mic90, >512 mug/ml). activity against lactobacillus spp. (range, 0.06 to >512 mug/ml; mic90, >512 mug/ml) was comparable to that of fidaxomicin and varied by species and strain. gram-positive aerobic cocci (staphylococcus aureus, enterococcus faecalis, e. faecium, and streptococci) showed high smt19969 mic90 values (128 to >512 mug/ml).

TI  == essential oil composition and antimicrobial activity of aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa (apiaceae) from italy.
AB  == the chemical composition and antimicrobial activity of the essential oils obtained from the flowering aerial parts and ripe fruits of echinophora spinosa l. (apiaceae) from central italy were analyzed by gc/ms. the major constituents of the oil from the aerial parts were beta-phellandrene (34.7%), myristicin (16.5%), delta3-carene (12.6%), alpha-pinene (6.7%) and alpha-phellandrene (6.2%), and of the oil from the ripe fruits p-cymene (50.2%), myristicin (15.3%), alpha-pinene (15.1%) and alpha-phellandrene (8.1%). the two oils showed good antimicrobial activity against clostridium difficile, c. perfringens, enterococcus faecalis, eubacterium limosum, peptostreptococcus anaerobius and candida albicans with mic values respectively of 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 0.25, 2.25, and 0.50%, v/v, and 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 0.13, 2.25, 0.50%, v/v, for aerial parts and ripe fruits respectively. a less significant antimicrobial activity against bifidobacteria and lactobacilli, very important in the intestinal microflora, was also detected, with mic values higher than 4.0%, v/v.

TI  == antianaerobe activity of ceftobiprole, a new broad-spectrum cephalosporin.
AB  == agar dilution testing of 463 anaerobes showed most gram-positive beta-lactamase-negative strains (other than some clostridium difficile and peptostreptococcus anaerobius), as well as both beta-lactamase-positive and beta-lactamase-negative strains of fusobacterium nucleatum, to have ceftobiprole  mic values of < or =0.016 to 4 microg/ml. ceftobiprole was less active against beta-lactamase-positive gram-negative bacilli, especially the members of the bacteroides fragilis group. like ceftobiprole, piperacillin was active mainly against beta-lactamase-negative strains, though mic values for piperacillin were  often 1 to 2 dilutions higher than for ceftobiprole. carbapenems had mic values < or =4 microg/l against all except some c. difficile and 2 strains of b. fragilis. all strains were susceptible to metronidazole, and all bacteria, except c. difficile and a single bacteroides distasonis strain, were susceptible to chloramphenicol. clindamycin resistance was seen in most anaerobe groups, whereas high moxifloxacin mics were found mainly among the b. fragilis and prevotella groups, and a few c. difficile and f. nucleatum strains.

TI  == phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia  species analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry.
AB  == species of peptostreptococcus cause a variety of infections, primarily abscesses  of soft tissues, joints, and mucous membranes. the aim of this study was to compare the phospholipid analogue profiles of peptostreptococcus species, represented by p. anaerobius, p. asaccharolyticus, p. indolicus, p. lacrimalis, and p. prevotii; micromonas micros (p. micros) and finegoldia magna (p. magnus).  after anaerobic growth on blood-faa, lipids extracted by chloroform-methanol (2:1 v/v) were purified, then analysed by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry (fab-ms) in negative ion mode. the major peaks with mass to charge (m/z) 719, 721, and 749, corresponded to phosphatidylglycerol analogues, namely pg (32:1), pg (32:0), and pg (34:0), which have been found previously in lactobacillus spp., clostridium difficile, and staphylococcus spp. other major peaks observed, with m/z 619, 647, 665, 675, 677, 687, 691, 693, 701, 703, 707, 733, and 746 have also been reported in one or more of these three species. however, other major peaks found here in peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia have not been described elsewhere; these are 501, 514, 515, 618, 659, 673, 676, 688, 690, 692,  694, 700, 706, 715, 718, 722, and 750. we conclude that peptostreptococcus, micromonas, and finegoldia isolates are chemically unique.

TI  == [effect of a polyoxydonium immunoregulator on the biological properties of microorganisms].
AB  == the effect of the synthetic immunomodulator polyoxydonium (po) on some biological properties of pathogenic bacteria (shigella flexneri, salmonella enteritidis), opportunistic bacteria (klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, staphylococcus aureus, bacteroides fragilis, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, prevotella melaninogenica, propionibacterium propionicum, clostridium difficile) and fungi (candida albicans), isolated during enteric infections, enteric dysbiosis, pyoinflammatory diseases, was evaluated in a number of in vitro experiments. the study revealed that the recommended therapeutic concentration of po decreased antilysozyme activity (ala) and the anticomplement  activity in klebsiella, shigella, propionibacterium, clostridium, bacteroids, fungi of the genus candida, but increased ala in nonhemolytic escherichia. under  the action of po an increased sensitivity of the microorganisms under study to definite antibiotics of the lincosamide, fluoroquinolon, carbapenem and cephalosporin groups was noted. the data obtained in this study reveal one of the possible mechanisms of the corrective action of po on the microbiocenosis of the  intestine in dysbiosis, enteric infections and pyoinflammatory diseases.

TI  == in vitro activities of faropenem against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria.
AB  == the activity of faropenem, a new oral penem, was tested against 579 strains of anaerobic bacteria by using the nccls-approved reference method. drugs tested included amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefoxitin, clindamycin, faropenem, imipenem, and metronidazole. of the 176 strains of bacteroides fragilis group isolates tested, two isolates had faropenem mics of 64 micro g/ml and imipenem mics of >32 micro g/ml. faropenem had an mic of 16 micro g/ml for an additional isolate of b. fragilis; this strain was sensitive to imipenem (mic of 1 micro g/ml). both faropenem and imipenem had mics of < or=4 micro g/ml for all isolates of bacteroides capillosus (10 isolates), bacteroides splanchnicus (13 isolates), bacteroides ureolyticus (11 isolates), bilophila wadsworthia (11 isolates), porphyromonas species (42 isolates), prevotella species (78 isolates), campylobacter species (25 isolates), sutterella wadsworthensis (11 isolates), fusobacterium nucleatum (19 isolates), fusobacterium mortiferum/varium (20 isolates), and other fusobacterium species (9 isolates). faropenem and imipenem had mics of 16 to 32 micro g/ml for two strains of clostridium difficile; the mics for all other strains of clostridium tested (69 isolates) were < or =4 micro g/ml. faropenem had mics of 8 and 16 micro g/ml, respectively, for two strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (mics of imipenem were 2 micro g/ml). mics were < or =4 micro g/ml for all other strains of gram-positive anaerobic cocci (53 isolates) and non-spore-forming gram-positive rods (28 isolates). other results were as expected and reported in previous studies. no metronidazole resistance was seen in gram-negative anaerobes other than s. wadsworthensis (18% resistant); 63% of gram-positive non-spore-forming rods were resistant. some degree of clindamycin resistance was seen in most of the groups tested.

TI  == comparative anti-anaerobic activity of men 10700, a penem antibiotic.
AB  == the in vitro activity of men 10700, a new penem, has been compared with that of metronidazole, clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, co-amoxiclav, imipenem and three third generation cephalosporins against 120 strains of anaerobes. the organisms tested  comprised clostridium perfringens, clostridium difficile, bacteroides fragilis and speciated members of the genera fusobacterium, veillonella and peptostreptococcus. men 10700 showed activity similar to that of imipenem, and was more potent than metronidazole against all species except c. difficile and p. anaerobius. the spectrum of activity of men 10700 suggests this agent may be useful for treating infections caused by anaerobes.

TI  == characterization of cross-reactive proteins detected by culturette brand rapid latex test for clostridium difficile.
AB  == clostridium sporogenes, peptostreptococcus anaerobius, and bacteroides asaccharolyticus have been reported to react in the culturette brand rapid latex  test (marion scientific, div. marion laboratories, inc., kansas city, mo.) for clostridium difficile. from the results of this study we showed that c. sporogenes and p. anaerobius produce a protein which is very similar biochemically and immunologically to the protein of c. difficile that is detected by the test. thus, the positive latex reactions observed with c. sporogenes and p. anaerobius are due to a cross-reactive protein. we did not detect this cross-reactive protein in filtrates from b. asaccharolyticus, indicating that this bacterium reacts with the latex reagent by some other mechanism. we cloned the c. difficile gene that codes for the cross-reactive protein and showed that the protein produced by the recombinant organism is nontoxic and distinct from toxin a, thus confirming our earlier findings.

TI  == comparative activity of metronidazole and tinidazole against clostridium difficile and peptostreptococcus anaerobius.
AB  == broth dilution mics of metronidazole against 38 strains of clostridium difficile  (0.13 microgram/ml) and 11 strains of peptostreptococcus anaerobius (0.11 microgram/ml) were lower than those of tinidazole (0.16 and 0.17 microgram/ml, respectively). as molar concentrations the nitroimidazoles were equally active. the mics of the two drugs correlated positively, and the relative activity of tinidazole increased with decreasing susceptibility of both species.

TI  == leucine dissimilation to isovaleric and isocaproic acids by cell suspensions of amino acid fermenting anaerobes: the stickland reaction revisited.
AB  == freshly compared cell suspensions of clostridia (clostridium bifermentans, c. botulinum proteolytic type a, c. difficile, c. sordellii, and c. sporogenes) and  peptostreptococcus anaerobius converted leucine to isovaleric (iv) and isocaproic (ic) acids in the absence of other amino acids. the optimal ph for conversion was between 8 and 9 at 37 degrees c. the stoichiometry of reaction was compatible with that expected for the stickland reaction, as the ratio of iv to ic was 1:2,  the amount of co2 produced was equivalent to that of iv, and ammonium ion concentrations were equal to the total c5 and c6 acids formed. the presence of alanine and valine (proton donors in the stickland reaction) in incubations effectively increased the concentration of ic at the expense of iv production, implying that leucine acted there primarily as a proton acceptor. glycine and proline (proton acceptors) stimulated both iv and ic production from leucine, but increases in iv concentrations were proportionately greater than for ic so that leucine was primarily a proton donor in the presence of proton acceptors. glucose stimulated the conversion of leucine to volatile fatty acids but favoured ic production. production of ic from leucine was inhibited by surface active compounds (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide and desoxycholate) as well as arsenite  and iodoacetate. the redox dyes methyl viologen and phenosafranine inhibited ic production more severely than iv production, as did the nitroimidazole antimicrobial agent, metronidazole.
