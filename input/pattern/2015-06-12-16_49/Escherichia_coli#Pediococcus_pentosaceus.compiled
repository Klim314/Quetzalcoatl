TI  - Study of Lactic Acid Bacteria Community From Raw Milk of Iranian One Humped Camel and Evaluation of Their Probiotic Properties.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Camel milk is amongst valuable food sources in Iran. On the other hand, due to the presence of probiotic bacteria and bacteriocin producers in camel milk, probiotic bacteria can be isolated and identified from this food product. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of the present research were the isolation and molecular identification of lactic acid bacteria from camel milk and evaluation of their probiotic properties. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of ten samples of camel milk were collected from the Golestan province of Iran under aseptic conditions. Bacteria were isolated by culturing the samples on selective medium. Isolates were identified by amplification of the 16S rDNA and Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and were then screened and grouped by the Amplified Ribosomal DNA Restriction Analysis (ARDRA) method. To evaluate probiotic properties, representative isolates of different ARDRA profiles were analyzed. The antimicrobial activity of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) against Pediococcus pentosaceus, Escherichia coli and Bacillus cereus was examined by the agar diffusion assay. Acid and bile tolerance of isolates were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 64 isolates were analyzed based on biochemical tests and morphological characteristics. The most frequently isolated LAB was Enterococci. Weissella, Leuconostoc, Lactobacilli and Pediococci were less frequently found. Based on restriction analysis of the ITS, the isolates were grouped into nine different ARDRA patterns that were identified by ribosomal DNA sequencing as P. pentosaceus, Enterococcus faecium strain Y-2, E. faecium strain JZ1-1, E. faecium strain E6, E. durans, E. lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Lactobacillus casei and Weissella cibaria. The results showed that antimicrobial activity of the tested isolates was remarkable and P. pentosaceus showed the most antibacterial activity. In addition, E. durans, E. lactis, L. casei and P. pentosaceus were selected as probiotic bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the presence of bacteriocin-producing bacteria and probiotic bacteria in camel milk from the Golestan province of Iran.
TI  - Identification and antimicrobial activity detection of lactic Acid bacteria isolated from corn stover silage.
AB  - A total of 59 lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains were isolated from corn stover silage. According to phenotypic and chemotaxonomic characteristics, 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences and recA gene polymerase chain reaction amplification, these LAB isolates were identified as five species: Lactobacillus (L.) plantarum subsp. plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Enterococcus mundtii, Weissella cibaria and Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides, respectively. Those strains were also screened for antimicrobial activity using a dual-culture agar plate assay. Based on excluding the effects of organic acids and hydrogen peroxide, two L. plantarum subsp. plantarum strains ZZU 203 and 204, which strongly inhibited Salmonella enterica ATCC 43971(T), Micrococcus luteus ATCC 4698(T) and Escherichia coli ATCC 11775(T) were selected for further research on sensitivity of the antimicrobial substance to heat, pH and protease. Cell-free culture supernatants of the two strains exhibited strong heat stability (60 min at 100 degrees C), but the antimicrobial activity was eliminated after treatment at 121 degrees C for 15 min. The antimicrobial substance remained active under acidic condition (pH 2.0 to 6.0), but became inactive under neutral and alkaline condition (pH 7.0 to 9.0). In addition, the antimicrobial activities of these two strains decreased remarkably after digestion by protease K. These results preliminarily suggest that the desirable antimicrobial activity of strains ZZU 203 and 204 is the result of the production of a bacteriocin-like substance, and these two strains with antimicrobial activity could be used as silage additives to inhibit proliferation of unwanted microorganism during ensiling and preserve nutrients of silage. The nature of the antimicrobial substances is being investigated in our laboratory.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory properties of fermented soy milk with Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis S-SU2 in murine macrophage RAW264.7 cells and DSS-induced IBD model mice.
AB  - Six lactic acid bacteria strains (four Lactobacillus plantarum strains and one each of Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis and Pediococcus pentosaceus) have been isolated and shown to possess anti-oxidant activity. In this study, we determined their acid, bile, salt resistance, and adhesion activity on human enterocyte-like HT-29-Luc and Caco-2 cells. An isolate Lc. lactis S-SU2 showed highest bile resistance and adhesion activity compared to type strains. S-SU2 could ferment both 10% skimmed milk and soy milk while the type strain could not ferment soy milk. Soy milk fermented with S-SU2 showed an increased nitric oxide (NO) secretion in the mouse macrophage RAW264.7 cells without bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of the fermented soy milk on Escherichia coli O111 LPS-induced NO secretion were higher than those of fresh soy milk. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) was induced in mice fed either 5% (w/v) dextran sodium sulfate (DSS) in drinking water or 50% soy milk in drinking water. Shortening of colon length, breaking of epithelial cells, lowering liver and thymus weights, and enlargement of spleen are some of the characteristics observed in the IBD, which were prevented by the use of soy milk fermented with Lc. lactis S-SU2.
TI  - Behavior of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli relevant to lettuce washing processes and consideration of factors for evaluating washing process surrogates.
AB  - Postharvest processes for fresh produce commonly include washing in water containing antimicrobial chemicals, such as chlorine; however, if the antimicrobials are not present in sufficient levels, washing can promote the spread of contamination that might be present. To understand cross-contamination risk during washing, we tested a collection of Shiga toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC), including O157:H7 and other non-O157 strains, for certain traits during washing of fresh-cut lettuce, i.e., sensitivity to sublethal chlorine levels and ability to cross-contaminate (detach from and attach to) lettuce in the presence of sublethal chlorine levels. Nonpathogenic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and Pediococcus pentosaceus lactic acid bacterial species (LAB) were included as potential washing process validation surrogates. As measured by extension of the lag phase of growth in media containing 0.15 ppm of chlorine, chlorine sensitivity varied among the STECs. Cross-contamination was assessed by evaluating transfer of bacteria from inoculated to uninoculated leaves during washing. Without chlorine, similar transfer to wash water and uninoculated leaves was shown. In 1 ppm of chlorine, cross-contamination was not detected with most strains, except for the substantial transfer by a STEC O111 strain and EcN in some replicates. Strain O111 and EcN showed less inactivation in 0.25 ppm of chlorine water compared with O157 (P < 0.05). LAB showed similar transfer and similar chlorine inactivation to O157. Considering together the sublethal chlorine sensitivity and detachment/attachment traits, neither EcN nor LAB displayed optimal characteristics as washing process surrogates for the STEC strains, although further evaluation is needed. This work demonstrated a range of behaviors of STEC strains during lettuce washing and may be helpful in hazard characterization, identifying factors to consider for evaluating washing process efficacy, and identifying phenotypic traits to select surrogates to validate washing processes.
TI  - Assessment of probiotic properties in lactic acid bacteria isolated from wine.
AB  - Probiotic properties are highly strain-dependent but rarely studied in enological lactic acid bacteria (LAB). In this study, the probiotic features of 11 strains of Lactobacillus spp., Pediococcus spp., and Oenococcus oeni, including saliva and acid resistance, bile tolerance and exopolysaccharides' production, were investigated. The assays included two probiotic reference strains (Lactobacillus plantarum CLC 17 and Lactobacillus fermentum CECT5716). The Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains showed high resistance to lysozyme (>80% resistance to 100 mg/L of lysozyme under conditions simulating the in vivo dilution by saliva) and were capable of surviving at low pH values (pH 1.8) and bile salts, suggesting good adaptation of the wine strains to gastrointestinal conditions. The ability of the strains to adhere to the intestinal mucosa and the inhibition of the adhesion of Escherichia coli to human intestinal cells were also evaluated. Adhesion levels of enological LAB to Caco-2 cells varied from 0.37% to 12.2%, depending on the strain. In particular, Pediococcus pentosaceus CIAL-86 showed a high percentage of adhesion to intestinal cells (>12%), even higher than that shown by the probiotic reference strains, and a high anti-adhesion activity against E. coli CIAL-153 (>30%), all of which support this wine LAB strain as a potential probiotic.
TI  - Screening of lactic acid bacteria for their potential as microbial cell factories for bioconversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of fossil carbon sources for fuels and petrochemicals has serious impacts on our environment and is unable to meet the demand in the future. A promising and sustainable alternative is to substitute fossil carbon sources with microbial cell factories converting lignocellulosic biomass into desirable value added products. However, such bioprocesses require availability of suitable and efficient microbial biocatalysts, capable of utilizing C5 sugars and tolerant to inhibitory compounds generated during pretreatment of biomass. In this study, the performance of a collection of lactic acid bacteria was evaluated regarding their properties with respect to the conversion of lignocellulosic feedstocks. The strains were examined for their ability to utilize xylose and arabinose as well as their resistance towards common inhibitors from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass (furan derivatives, phenolic compounds, weak acids). RESULTS: Among 296 tested Lactobacillus and Pediococcus strains, 3 L. pentosus, 1 P. acidilactici and 1 P. pentosaceus isolates were found to be both capable of utilizing xylose and arabinose and highly resistant to the key inhibitors from chemically pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. When tested in broth with commonly found combinations of inhibitors, the selected strains showed merely 4%, 1% and 37% drop in growth rates for sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw and soft wood representatives, respectively, as compared to Escherichia coli MG1655 showing decreased growth rates by 36%, 21% and 90%, respectively, under the same conditions. CONCLUSION: The study showed that some strains of Lactobacilli and Pediococci have the potential to be used as production platforms for value-added products from pretreated lignocellulosic biomass. Selected Lactobacilli and Pediococci strains were able to tolerate the key inhibitors in higher concentrations compared to E.coli; in addition, as these isolates were also capable of fermenting xylose and arabinose, they constitute good candidates for efficient lignocellulosic feedstock bioconversions.
TI  - Enzymatic conversion of D-galactose to D-tagatose: cloning, overexpression and characterization of L-arabinose isomerase from Pediococcus pentosaceus PC-5.
AB  - The gene encoding L-arabinose isomerase from food-grade strain Pediococcus pentosaceus PC-5 was cloned and overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant protein was purified and characterized. It was optimally active at 50 degrees C and pH 6.0. Furthermore, this enzyme exhibited a weak requirement for metallic ions for its maximal activity evaluated at 0.6 mM Mn(2+) or 0.8 mM Co(2+). Interestingly, this enzyme was distinguished from other L-AIs, it could not use L-arabinose as its substrate. In addition, a three-dimensional structure of L-AI was built by homology modeling and L-arabinose and D-galactose were docked into the active site pocket of PPAI model to explain the interaction between L-AI and its substrate. The purified P. pentosaceus PC-5 L-AI converted D-galactose into D-tagatose with a high conversion rate of 52% after 24 h at 50 degrees C, suggesting its excellent potential in D-tagatose production.
TI  - Catabolism of serine by Pediococcus acidilactici and Pediococcus pentosaceus.
AB  - The ability to produce diacetyl from pyruvate and l-serine was studied in various strains of Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici isolated from cheese. After being incubated on both substrates, only P. pentosaceus produced significant amounts of diacetyl. This property correlated with measurable serine dehydratase activity in cell extracts. A gene encoding the serine dehydratase (dsdA) was identified in P. pentosaceus, and strains that showed no serine dehydratase activity carried mutations that rendered the gene product inactive. A functional dsdA was cloned from P. pentosaceus FAM19132 and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant enzyme catalyzed the formation of pyruvate from L- and D-serine and was active at low pH and elevated NaCl concentrations, environmental conditions usually present in cheese. Analysis of the amino acid profiles of culture supernatants from dsdA wild-type and dsdA mutant strains of P. pentosaceus did not show differences in serine levels. In contrast, P. acidilactici degraded serine. Moreover, this species also catabolized threonine and produced alanine and alpha-aminobutyrate.
TI  - [Screening of food-grade microorganisms for biotransformation of D-tagatose and cloning and expression of L-arabinose isomerase].
AB  - L-Arabinose isomerase (L-AI) is an intracellular enzyme that catalyzes the reversible isomerization of D-galactose and D-tagatose. Given the widespread use of D-tagatose in the food industry, food-grade microorganisms and the derivation of L-AI for the production of D-tagatose is gaining increased attention. In the current study, food-grade strains from different foods that can convert D-galactose to D-tagatose were screened. According to physiological, biochemical, and 16S rDNA gene analyses, the selected strain was found to share 99% identity with Pediococcus pentosaceus, and was named as Pediococcus pentosaceus PC-5. The araA gene encoding L-AI from Pediococcus pentosaceus PC-5 was cloned and overexpressed in E. coli BL21. The yield of D-tagatose using D-galactose as the substrate catalyzed by the crude enzyme in the presence of Mn2+ was found to be 33% at 40 degrees C.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of microflora from ovine cheese.
AB  - Strains identified in ovine cheese and bryndza by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight analysis belonged to ten species of non-enterococcal lactic acid bacteria and included Lactobacillus casei/Lactobacillus paracasei, Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, Lactobacillus helveticus, Lactobacillus delbrueckii, Lactobacillus fermentum, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus pentosaceus and Pediococcus acidilactici. The susceptibility toward antibiotics was determined in lactobacilli, lactococci and pediococci and also in Escherichia coli for comparison. Analysis of L. fermentum and pediococci revealed the presence of non-wild-type epidemiological cut-offs in streptomycin, clindamycin or gentamicin. E. coli were resistant to ampicillin, tetracycline, enrofloxacin and florfenicol. No extended spectrum beta-lactamases were detected.
TI  - Characterization of D-lactate dehydrogenase producing D-3-phenyllactic acid from  Pediococcus pentosaceus.
AB  - D-Lactate dehydrogenase (D-LDH) from Pediococcus pentosaceus ATCC 25745 was found to produce D-3-phenyllactic acid from phenylpyruvate. The optimum pH and temperature for enzyme activity were pH 5.5 and 45 degrees C. The Michaelis-Menten constant (K(m)), turnover number (k(cat)), and catalytic efficiency (k(cat)/K(m)) values for the substrate phenylpyruvate were estimated to be 1.73 mmol/L, 173 s(-1), and 100 (mmol/L)(-1) s(-1) respectively.
TI  - Influence of NaCl and NaNO3 on sinigrin hydrolysis by foodborne bacteria.
AB  - The glucosinolate sinigrin (SNG) is converted by endogenous plant myrosinase or by bacterial myrosinase-like activity to form the potent antimicrobial allyl isothiocyanate. In order to use SNG as a natural antimicrobial precursor in food, it became important to better understand the ability of bacteria to synthesize the enzyme(s) and understand factors influencing this synthesis at a constant SNG concentration. Eight spoilage, pathogenic, or starter culture bacteria were grown separately in medium containing individual or combined salts with SNG. SNG degradation by the bacteria and the formation of its major degradation product, allyl isothiocyanate, were followed for 12 days at 30 or 35 degrees C. The bacterial strains varied in their ability to metabolize SNG, and this was enhanced by NaCl and/or NaNO(3). SNG hydrolysis took place after 4 days, and the greatest amount occurred by day 12. At 12 days, Escherichia coli O157:H7 showed the greatest capacity to hydrolyze SNG (45.3% degradation), followed by Staphylococcus carnosus (44.57%), while Pseudomonas fluorescens was not active against SNG. The ability of tested strains to metabolize SNG, in decreasing order, was as follows: Escherichia coli O157:H7 > Staphylococcus carnosus > Staphylococcus aureus > Pediococcus pentosaceus > Salmonella Typhimurium > Listeria monocytogenes > Enterococcus faecalis > Pseudomonas fluorescens.
TI  - LysA2, the Lactobacillus casei bacteriophage A2 lysin is an endopeptidase active  on a wide spectrum of lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The lysin gene (lysA2) of the Lactobacillus casei bacteriophage A2 was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. LysA2 is an endopeptidase that hydrolyzes the bond between the terminal D: -alanine of the peptidoglycan tetrapeptide and the aspartic acid residue that forms the bridge with the L: -lysine of a neighboring peptidoglycan chain, characteristic of Gram-positive bacteria included into the A4 peptidoglycan subgroup. This includes most lactobacilli, Lactococcus lactis, Pediococcus acidilactici, and Pediococcus pentosaceus, the walls of all of which were substrates for the enzyme. Specific binding of LysA2 to the wall of these bacteria is mediated by its C-terminal moiety, does not need the N-terminal catalytic domain for recognition, and is stable: at least 88% of the molecules were still bound to L. casei after 3 days in phosphate buffer at 4 degrees C. The enzyme acts as a monomer, is active at pH values between 4 and 6, and at temperatures ranging between 18 degrees C and 50 degrees C while being independent of divalent cation addition. The enzyme showed strong resistance to incubation at high and low pH values but became progressively inactivated at 50 degrees C and above. LysA2 is bactericidal, the viability of L. casei cultures dropping to 1% in 10 min, under the standard conditions used for the enzymatic assay.
TI  - Evaluation of beneficial attributes for phytate-degrading Pediococcus pentosaceus CFR R123.
AB  - In this study we have screened and selected potent phytate-degrading lactic acid  bacteria (LAB), and evaluated their beneficial attributes. Around 60 LAB strains were isolated from several cereal- and pulse-based conventional fermented preparations. They were screened for their ability to degrade myo-inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) by cobalt chloride qualitative staining method (plate assay). One of the cultures, Pediococcus pentosaceus CFR R123, was capable of degrading both calcium and sodium salts of phytic acid. Additionally, we have carried out an in vitro evaluation for the beneficial attributes of phytate degrading CFR R123. P. pentosaceus CFR R123 showed 53% survivability at pH 2 and 62% at pH 2.5, whereas cultures of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG showed a survivability of 55% and 82%, respectively. CFR R123 could also withstand 0.3% ox-bile, whereas no growth was observed for GG. The strain CFR R123 exhibited 62.8% hydrophobicity to xylene whereas 59% was found for GG. Both the tested strains showed a good spectrum of antibacterial activity against food-borne pathogens like Escherichia coli, Listeria monocytogenes Scott A, etc. P. pentosaceus CFR R123 possessed beta-galactosidase activity and cholesterol reduction ability. In conclusion, LAB with phytate degrading ability and several beneficial attributes could potentially be used as a starter culture to improve the nutritional security of functional food.
TI  - Microbial and chemical origins of the bactericidal activity of thermally treated  yellow mustard powder toward Escherichia coli O157:H7 during dry sausage ripening.
AB  - Work examines the origin of bactericidal activity in mustard flour and explores the relative contribution from starter cultures, E. coli O157:H7 itself and other sources. Bacteria can degrade naturally occurring glucosinolates in mustard and form isothiocyanates with antimicrobial activity. In the present work, 24 starter cultures (mostly from commercial mixtures) were screened for their capacity to decompose the glucosinolate, sinalbin. The most active pair, Pediococcus pentosaceus UM 121P and Staphylococcus carnosus UM 123 M, were used together for the production of dry fermented sausage contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 (~6.5 log CFU/g). They were compared to industrial starters used previously (P. pentosaceus UM 116P and S. carnosus UM 109 M) for their reduction of E. coli O157:H7 viability. Sausage batches containing hot mustard powder (active myrosinase), cold mustard powder (inactivated myrosinase), autoclaved mustard powder (inactivated myrosinase) and no mustard flour (control) were prepared. Interestingly, both pairs of starter cultures yielded similar results. Elimination of E. coli O157:H7 (>5 log CFU/g) occurred after 31 days in the presence of hot flour and in 38 days when the cold flour was added. Reductions >5 log CFU/g of the pathogen did not occur (up to 38 days) in the control group. It was found that E. coli O157:H7 itself had a greater effect on sinalbin conversion than either pair of starter cultures, and glucosinolate degradation by the starter cultures was less important in determining E. coli survival. The autoclaved powder caused more rapid bactericidal action against E. coli O157:H7, yielding a >5 log CFU/g reduction in 18 days. This may have been a result of the formation and/or release of antimicrobial substances by the autoclave treatment. Autoclaved mustard powder could potentially solve an important challenge facing the meat industry as it strives to manufacture safe dry fermented sausages.
TI  - Identification of Escherichia coli O157:H7 surrogate organisms to evaluate beef carcass intervention treatment efficacy.
AB  - We compared the survival of potential pathogen surrogates-meat-hygiene indicators (non-Escherichia coli coliforms), biotype I E. coli, and lactic acid bacteria starter cultures-with survival of an E. coli O157:H7 (ECO157:H7) inoculum in beef carcass intervention trials. Survival of one lactic acid bacteria starter culture (Bactoferm LHP Dry [Pediococcus acidilactici and Pediococcus pentosaceus]), a five-isolate biotype I inoculum, and a five-isolate non-E. coli coliform inoculum, was compared with survival of a 12-isolate ECO157:H7 inoculum in interventions by using beef brisket (adipose and lean), cod fat membrane, or neck tissue. Treatments were grouped by abattoir size: small (6-day dry aging; 22 degrees C acid treatment [2.5% acetic acid, 2% lactic acid, or Fresh Bloom], followed by 1-day dry aging; hot water) and large (warm acid treatment [5% acetic acid or 2% lactic acid] with or without a preceding hot water treatment). Reductions in pathogen and surrogate inocula were determined with excision sampling. A surrogate was considered a suitable replacement for ECO157:H7 if the intervention produced a reduction in surrogate levels that was not significantly greater (P>/=0.05) than that observed for ECO157:H7. All three surrogate inocula were suitable as ECO157 surrogates for dry aging and acid spray plus dry-aging treatments used by small abattoirs. No one inoculum was suitable as an ECO157 surrogate across all intervention treatments used by large abattoirs. Effects seen on neck tissue were representative of other tissues, and the low value of the neck supports its use as the location for evaluating treatment efficacy in in-plant trials. Results support using nonpathogenic surrogate organisms to validate beef carcass intervention efficacy.
TI  - Gene cloning, expression, and characterization of phenolic acid decarboxylase from Lactobacillus brevis RM84.
AB  - Phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD) catalyzes the synthesis of vinyl phenols from hydroxycinnamic acids. The gene encoding PAD from Lactobacillus brevis was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli. The recombinant PAD enzyme is a heat-labile enzyme that functions optimally at 22 degrees C and pH 6.0. The purified enzyme did not show thermostability at temperatures above 22 degrees C. L. brevis PAD is able to decarboxylate exclusively the hydroxycinnamic acids, such as p-coumaric, caffeic, and ferulic acids, with K (m) values of 0.98, 0.96, and 0.78 mM, respectively. The substrate specificity exhibited by L. brevis PAD is similar to the PAD isolated from Bacillus subtilis and B. pumilus, but different from that of L. plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus. As the C-terminal region may be involved in determining PAD substrate specificity and catalytic capacity, amino acid differences among these proteins could explain the differences observed. The substrate specificity shown by L. brevis PAD shows promise for the synthesis of high-added value products from plant wastes.
TI  - Control of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in corn silage with or without various inoculants: efficacy and mode of action.
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 commercial bacterial inoculants at controlling Escherichia coli O157:H7 in corn silages during ensiling and feedout phases of silage production. A second objective was to determine whether the inoculants exhibited and transferred antibacterial activity against E. coli O157:H7 to the silages. Chopped corn forage was ensiled after treatment with the following: distilled water (control); 5 x 10(5) cfu/g of E. coli O157:H7 (EC); EC and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of Pediococcus pentosaceus and Propionibacterium freudenreichii (EC+BII); EC and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of Lactobacillus buchneri (EC+LB); and EC and 1 x 10(6) cfu/g of L. buchneri and P. pentosaceus (EC+B500). Each treatment was ensiled in triplicate in mini silos for 3, 7, 31, and 82 d and analyzed for pH and E. coli O157:H7 counts. Samples from d 82 were also analyzed for volatile fatty acids, lactate, and aerobic stability. Antibacterial activity of inoculants and silages was determined by the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion test. The pH of silages from all treatments decreased below 4 within 3 d of ensiling and remained low until d 82. Therefore, E. coli O157:H7 was not detected in silages after any of the ensiling durations. Applying inoculants containing L. buchneri resulted in less lactate, more acetate, and greater aerobic stability compared with the control. Applying EC+BII containing P. freudenreichii did not increase propionate or aerobic stability. Subsamples of d 82 silages were reinoculated with 1 x 10(5) cfu/g of E. coli O157:H7 either immediately after silo opening on d 82 or after 144h of aerobic exposure (d 88), and E. coli were enumerated 24h later. All silages reinoculated with the pathogen on d 82 had similar, low pH values (<4) and no E. coli were detected 24h later. Control, EC, and EC+BII silages reinoculated with the pathogen after 144h of aerobic exposure had relatively greater pH values (4.71, 5.67, and 6.03, respectively) and E. coli counts (2.87, 6.73, and 6.87 log cfu/g, respectively) 24h later, whereas those treated with L. buchneri had low pH values (<4) and undetectable (EC+B500) or 10-fold lower (1.97, cfu/g; EC+LB) E. coli counts. All pure cultures of commercial bacterial inoculants exhibited antibacterial activity independent of pH against E. coli O157:H7, but the pH-independent activity did not persist in the treated silages, suggesting that E. coli elimination from silages was mediated by pH reduction.
TI  - Bacteriocin production by Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from marula (Scerocarya birrea).
AB  - Strain ST44AM, isolated from marula, was identified as Pediococcus pentosaceus based on biochemical tests, sugar fermentation reactions (API 50CHL), PCR with species-specific primers and 16S rDNA sequencing. Strain ST44AM produces a 6.5 kDa class IIa bacteriocin, active against lactic acid bacteria, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Listeria innocua, Listeria ivanovii subsp. ivanovii and Listeria monocytogenes. The peptide is inactivated by proteolytic enzymes, but not when treated with alpha-amylase, Triton X-100, Triton X-114, SDS, Tween 20, Tween 80, urea, NaCl and EDTA. No change in activity was recorded after 2 h at pH values between 2.0 and 12.0, and after treatment at 100 degrees C for 120 min or 121 degrees C for 20 min. The mode of activity against L. ivanovii susbp. ivanovii ATCC19119 and Enterococcus faecium HKLHS is bactericidal, resulting in cell lyses and enzyme- and DNA-leakage. No significant differences in cell growth and bacteriocin production were observed when strain ST44AM was cultured in MRS broth at 26 degrees C, 30 degrees C and 37 degrees C for 24 h and tested against the same target strain. L. ivanovii subsp. ivanovii ATCC 19119 and E. faecium HKLHS did, however, differ in sensitivity to bacteriocin ST44AM (3.3x10(6) AU/mL and 2.6x10(4) AU/mL, respectively). Peptide ST44AM adsorbs at high levels (1600 AU/mL) to producer cells. Bacteriocin ST44AM may be a derivative of pediocin PA-1. This is the first report on the presence of P. pentosaceus in marula and a pediocin PA-1 derivative produced by this species. We are also the first to report on the synergetic effect ciprofloxacin has on a pediocin-like bacteriocin.
TI  - Characterization of pRS5: a theta-type plasmid found in a strain of Pediococcus pentosaceus isolated from wine that can be used to generate cloning vectors for lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - The nucleotide sequence of pRS5 (10153bp) is reported. Through sequence analysis, 9 open reading frames (ORFs) were identified and the following features observed: a region likely involved in replication whose structural features indicate that pRS5 belongs to the pUCL287 group of theta-type replicons, and hypothetical proteins putatively involved in plasmid copy number control, restriction-modification system, toxin-antitoxin system and a putative integrase. Shuttle vectors for Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) as well as a small cloning vector for direct use in LAB were constructed using the replication region of pRS5. The ability of such vectors to accept and express other genes was assessed. All pRS5-derivatives were maintained at a high rate over 200 generations without selective pressure.
TI  - Inhibition of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in ripening dry fermented sausage by ground yellow mustard.
AB  - Compounds generated by the enzymatic hydrolysis of glucosinolates naturally present in mustard powder are potently bactericidal against Escherichia coli O157:H7. Because E. coli O157:H7 can survive the dry fermented sausage manufacturing process, 2, 4, and 6% (wt/wt) nondeheated (hot) mustard powder or 6% (wt/wt) deheated (cold) mustard powder were added to dry sausage batter inoculated with E. coli O157:H7 at about 7 log CFU/g to evaluate the antimicrobial effectiveness of the powders. Reductions in E. coli O157:H7 populations, changes in pH and water activity (aw), effects on starter culture (Pediococcus pentosaceus and Staphylococcus carnosus) populations, and effects of mustard powder on sausage texture (shear) were monitored during ripening. Nondeheated mustard powder at 2, 4, and 6% in dry sausage (0.90 aw) resulted in significant reductions in E. coli O157:H7 (P < 0.05) of 3.4, 4.4, and 6.9 log CFU/g, respectively, within 30 days of drying. During fermentation and drying, mustard powder did not affect P. pentosaceus and S. carnosus activity in any of the treatments. Extension of drying to 36 and 48 days reduced E. coli O157:H7 by >5 log CFU/g in the 4 and 2% mustard powder treatments, respectively. The 6% deheated mustard powder treatment provided the most rapid reductions of E. coli O157:H7 (yielding <0.20 log CFU/g after 24 days) by an unknown mechanism and was the least detrimental (P < 0.05) to sausage texture.
TI  - The effect of probiotics and organic acids on Shiga-toxin 2 gene expression in enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7.
AB  - Probiotics are known to have an inhibitory effect against the growth of various foodborne pathogens, however, the specific role of probiotics in Shiga-toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) virulence gene expression has not been well defined. Shiga toxins are members of a family of highly potent bacterial toxins and are the main virulence marker for STEC. Shiga toxins inhibit protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells and play a role in hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome. STEC possesses Shiga toxin 1 (Stx1) and Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2), both of which have A and B subunits. Although STEC containing both Stx1 and Stx2 has been isolated from patients with hemorrhagic colitis, Stx2 is more frequently associated with human disease complications. Thus, the effect of Lactobacillus, Pediococcus, and Bifidobacterium strains on stx2A expression levels in STEC was investigated. Lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria were isolated from farm animals, dairy, and human sources and included L. rhamnosus GG, L. curvatus, L. plantarum, L. jensenii, L. acidophilus, L. casei, L. reuteri, P. acidilactici, P. cerevisiae, P. pentosaceus, B. thermophilum, B. boum, B. suis and B. animalis. E. coli O157:H7 (EDL 933) was coincubated with sub-lethal concentrations of each probiotic strain. Following RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, relative stx2A mRNA levels were determined according to a comparative critical threshold (Ct) real-time PCR. Data were normalized to the endogenous control glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the level of stx2A expression between treated and untreated STEC was compared. Observed for all probiotic strains tested, stx2A was down-regulated, when compared to the control culture. Probiotic production of organic acids, as demonstrated by a decrease in pH, influenced stx2A gene expression.
TI  - High resolution crystal structure of PedB: a structural basis for the classification of pediocin-like immunity proteins.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pediocin-like bacteriocins, ribosomally-synthesized antimicrobial peptides, are generally coexpressed with cognate immunity proteins in order to protect the bacteriocin-producer from its own bacteriocin. As a step for understanding the mode of action of immunity proteins, we determined the crystal structure of PedB, a pediocin-like immunity protein conferring immunity to pediocin PP-1. RESULTS: The 1.6 A crystal structure of PedB reveals that PedB consists of an antiparallel four-helix bundle with a flexible C-terminal end. PedB shows structural similarity to an immunity protein against enterocin A (EntA-im) but some disparity to an immunity protein against carnobacteriocin B2 (ImB2) in both the C-terminal conformation and the local structure constructed by alpha3, alpha4, and their connecting loop. Structure-inspired mutational studies reveal that deletion of the last seven residues of the C-terminus of PedB almost abolished its immunity activity. CONCLUSION: The fact that PedB, EntA-im, and ImB2 share a four-helix bundle structure strongly suggests the structural conservation of this motif in the pediocin-like immunity proteins. The significant difference in the core structure and the C-terminal conformation provides a structural basis for the classification of pediocin-like immunity proteins. Our mutational study using C-terminal-shortened PedBs and the investigation of primary sequence of the C-terminal region, propose that several polar or charged residues in the extreme C-terminus of PedB which is crucial for the immunity are involved in the specific recognition of pediocin PP-1.
TI  - Survival of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in dry fermented sausages containing micro-encapsulated probiotic lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Escherichia coli O157:H7 is capable of surviving the rigorous processing steps during the manufacture of dry fermented sausages. The effect of adding two probiotic organisms, Lactobacillus reuteri and Bifidobacterium longum as co-cultures with the meat starter cultures Pediococcus pentosaceus and Staphylococcus carnosus on the viability of E. coli O157:H7 in dry fermented sausages was studied. A 5 strain cocktail of E. coli O157:H7 was added at 7.4 log cfu/g to the sausage batter and challenged with either or both Lb. reuteri or B. longum before or after they were micro-encapsulated. Sausages were fermented at < or = 26 degrees C and 88% relative humidity (RH) followed by drying at 75% RH and 13 degrees C for 25 d. The pH, water activity (aw), protein, moisture, and numbers of all inoculated organisms were monitored during processing. The pH and aw decreased from 5.7 and 0.98 to 4.9 and 0.88 at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. These processes reduced E. coli O157:H7 by 1.0 and 0.7 log cfu/g at the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. Unencapsulated Lb. reuteri with or without B. longum reduced E. coli O157:H7 by 3.0 log cfu/g and B. longum caused a 1.9 log cfu/g reduction. While micro-encapsulation increased survival of Lb. reuteri and B. longum, it reduced their inhibitory action against E. coli O157:H7.
TI  - Elimination of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from fermented dry sausages at an organoleptically acceptable level of microencapsulated allyl isothiocyanate.
AB  - Four sausage batters (17.59% beef, 60.67% pork, and 17.59% pork fat) were inoculated with two commercial starter culture organisms (>7 log(10) CFU/g Pediococcus pentosaceus and 6 log(10) CFU/g Staphylococcus carnosus) and a five-strain cocktail of nonpathogenic variants of Escherichia coli O157:H7 to yield 6 to 7 log(10) CFU/g. Microencapsulated allyl isothiocyanate (AIT) was added to three batters at 500, 750, or 1,000 ppm to determine its antimicrobial effects. For sensory analysis, separate batches with starter cultures and 0, 500, or 750 ppm microencapsulated AIT were produced. Sausages were fermented at < or =26 degrees C and 88% relative humidity (RH) for 72 h. Subsequently sausages were dried at 75% RH and 13 degrees C for at least 25 days. The water activity (a(w)), pH, and levels of starter cultures, E. coli O157:H7, and total bacteria were monitored during fermentation and drying. All sausages showed changes in the initial pH from 5.57 to 4.89 and in a(w) from 0.96 to 0.89 by the end of fermentation and drying, respectively. Starter culture numbers were reduced during sausage maturation, but there was no effect of AIT on meat pH reduction. E. coli O157:H7 was reduced by 6.5 log(10) CFU/g in sausages containing 750 and 1,000 ppm AIT after 21 and 16 days of processing, respectively. E. coli O157:H7 numbers were reduced by 4.75 log(10) CFU/g after 28 days of processing in treatments with 500 ppm AIT, and the organism was not recovered from this treatment beyond 40 days. During sensory evaluation, sausages containing 500 ppm AIT were considered acceptable although slightly spicy by panelists.
TI  - Crystallization and preliminary X-ray crystallographic analysis of the pediocin immunity protein (PedB) from Pediococcus pentosaceus at 1.35 A resolution.
AB  - PedB, a bacterial immunity protein conferring immunity to a newly identified pediocin (pediocin PP-1), was crystallized by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method at 296 K. A 1.35 A data set has been collected from a single crystal at 100 K using synchrotron-radiation source. The PedB crystals belong to the hexagonal space group P6(2) or P6(4), with unit cell parameters a = b = 62.2, c = 39.9 A. Analysis of the packing density shows that the asymmetric unit probably contains one molecule with a solvent content of 33.8%.
TI  - Cloning, deletion, and characterization of PadR, the transcriptional repressor of the phenolic acid decarboxylase-encoding padA gene of Lactobacillus plantarum.
AB  - Lactobacillus plantarum displays a substrate-inducible padA gene encoding a phenolic acid decarboxylase enzyme (PadA) that is considered a specific chemical stress response to the inducing substrate. The putative regulator of padA was located in the padA locus based on its 52% identity with PadR, the padA gene transcriptional regulator of Pediococcus pentosaceus (L. Barthelmebs, B. Lecomte, C. Divies, and J.-F. Cavin, J. Bacteriol. 182:6724-6731, 2000). Deletion of the L. plantarum padR gene clearly demonstrates that the protein it encodes is the transcriptional repressor of divergently oriented padA. The padR gene is cotranscribed with a downstream open reading frame (ORF1), the product of which may belong to a group of universal stress proteins (Usp). The padR deletion mutant overexpressed padA constitutively, and the padA promoter appears to be tightly regulated in this bacterium. Gel mobility shift assays using the padA gene promoter region and purified PadR expressed in Escherichia coli indicated that operator DNA binding by PadR was not eliminated by addition of p-coumarate. Gel mobility shift assays using partially purified extracts of native PadR protein from both phenolic acid-induced and noninduced L. plantarum cells demonstrate that inactivation of PadR by phenolic acids requires the integrity of L. plantarum and mediation by a specific protein absent in E. coli.
TI  - A PCR-based method for identification of lactobacilli at the genus level.
AB  - We developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method for the identification of lactobacilli at the genus level. One specific primer, LbLMA1-rev, was designed by analysing similarities between the nucleotide sequence of the spacer between the 16S and 23S rRNA genes in a number of Lactobacillus strains. Amplification with LbLMA1-rev and R16-1, a universal primer, generated a PCR product for 23 Lactobacillus species. Electrophoresis did not reveal any discrete bands when Escherichia coli, Lactococcus lactis, Leuconostoc mesenteroides, Streptococcus thermophilus, Carnobacterium pissicola, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bifidobacterium bifidum, Weissella confusa, Enterococcus hirae, Staphylococcus aureus or Listeria monocytogenes DNA were used as template.
TI  - Persistence of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in barley silage: effect of a bacterial inoculant.
AB  - AIMS: The effect of a lactic acid producing bacterial (LAB) inoculant on the elimination of Escherichia coli O157:H7 from barley forage was assessed. METHODS AND RESULTS: Triplicate mini-silos were prepared for four treatments and six sampling times (1, 3, 7, 15, 30 and 42 d post-ensiling). The treatments were (i) 10(5) cfu g(-1) Pediococcus pentosaceus and Propionibacterium jenzenii (P2); (ii) 10(5) cfu g(-1) E. coli O157:H7 strain 3081 and 10(5) cfu g(-1) E. coli Biotype 1 strains 719IE10, 719IE14 and 614ME49 (EC); (iii) P2 + EC; and (iv) the control (sterile distilled water). Triplicate mini-silos were opened at each sampling time for pH, volatile fatty acid (VFA) and lactate determinations and E. coli, E. coli O157:H7 and LAB were enumerated. On d 3 and 7, numbers of E. coli O157:H7 in P2 + EC were significantly lower than in EC (P < 0;05). Escherichia coli O157:H7 was not detected in P2 + EC and EC at 7 and 15 d post-ensiling, respectively. On d 15 through 42, E. coli Biotype 1 was not detected in P2 + EC or EC. Populations of LAB were higher in P2 and P2 + EC than in the control and EC on d 3 and 7 (P < 0.05). After 3 d of ensiling, lactate levels were higher (P < 0.05) and pH was lower (P < 0.05) in P2 and P2 + EC as compared to the control and EC. Bacteriocins of P2 were not found to be inhibitory to E. coli O157:H7 using the agar-spot procedure. Escherichia coli O157:H7 inoculated into the control silage at a level of 10(3) cfu g(-1) and exposed to aerobic conditions at 22 degrees C was not detected after 1 d and remained undetectable for the 28 d exposure period. CONCLUSIONS: Silage inoculant P2 increased lactate levels and decreased pH more rapidly during ensiling, which appeared to hasten the elimination of E. coli O157:H7 from the silage. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Results emphasize the importance of adequate ensiling since E. coli O157:H7 may be maintained and spread among cattle through feed.
TI  - Expression in Escherichia coli of native and chimeric phenolic acid decarboxylases with modified enzymatic activities and method for screening recombinant E. coli strains expressing these enzymes.
AB  - Four bacterial phenolic acid decarboxylases (PAD) from Lactobacillus plantarum, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Bacillus subtilis, and Bacillus pumilus were expressed in Escherichia coli, and their activities on p-coumaric, ferulic, and caffeic acids were compared. Although these four enzymes displayed 61% amino acid sequence identity, they exhibit different activities for ferulic and caffeic acid metabolism. To elucidate the domain(s) that determines these differences, chimeric PAD proteins were constructed and expressed in E. coli by exchanging their individual carboxy-terminal portions. Analysis of the chimeric enzyme activities suggests that the C-terminal region may be involved in determining PAD substrate specificity and catalytic capacity. In order to test phenolic acid toxicity, the levels of growth of recombinant E. coli displaying and not displaying PAD activity were compared on medium supplemented with different concentrations of phenolic acids and with differing pHs. Though these acids already have a slight inhibitory effect on E. coli, vinyl phenol derivatives, created during decarboxylation of phenolic acids, were much more inhibitory to the E. coli control strain. To take advantage of this property, a solid medium with the appropriate pH and phenolic acid concentration was developed; in this medium the recombinant E. coli strains expressing PAD activity form colonies approximately five times smaller than those formed by strains devoid of PAD activity.
TI  - Inducible metabolism of phenolic acids in Pediococcus pentosaceus is encoded by an autoregulated operon which involves a new class of negative transcriptional regulator.
AB  - Pediococcus pentosaceus displays a substrate-inducible phenolic acid decarboxylase (PAD) activity on p-coumaric acid. Based on DNA sequence homologies between the three PADs previously cloned, a DNA probe of the Lactobacillus plantarum pdc gene was used to screen a P. pentosaceus genomic library in order to clone the corresponding gene of this bacteria. One clone detected with this probe displayed a low PAD activity. Subcloning of this plasmid insertion allowed us to determine the part of the insert which contains a 534-bp open reading frame (ORF) coding for a 178-amino-acid protein presenting 81.5% of identity with L. plantarum PDC enzyme. This ORF was identified as the padA gene. A second ORF was located just downstream of the padA gene and displayed 37% identity with the product of the Bacillus subtilis yfiO gene. Subcloning, transcriptional analysis, and expression studies with Escherichia coli of these two genes under the padA gene promoter, demonstrated that the genes are organized in an autoregulated bicistronic operonic structure and that the gene located upstream of the padA gene encodes the transcriptional repressor of the padA gene. Transcription of this pad operon in P. pentosaceus is acid phenol dependent.
TI  - Analysis of the genetic determinant for production of the pediocin P of Pediococcus pentosaceus Pep1.
AB  - Pediococcus pentosaceus Pep1 is a vacuum-packaged Turkish sausage isolate which produces a potentially novel bacteriocin of the pediocin (anti-Listeria) family of peptides designated as pediocin P. Curing experiments and plasmid profile analysis indicated that both bacteriocin immunity and production determinants were linked and encoded by 9.0 MDa plasmid, pHD1.0. Attempts to transform purified plasmid pHD1.0 into recipient Escherichia coli JM109 cells by electroporation were successful but none of the E. coli JM109 cells were able to express and/or release pediocin P. However, P. pentosaceus PC, a plasmid-cured variant of P. pentosaceus Pep1 was successfully transformed with pHD1.0 by electroporation and Bac-Bacs P. pentosaceus PC cells restarted to express and/or release pediocin P again as indicated by the presence of zone of growth inhibition of L. plantarum NCDO 955 around colonies.
TI  - Production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  - A total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of Turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. For detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. Lactobacillus sake Lb790, Listeria monocytogenes Li6, Staphylococcus aureus St44 and Escherichia coli NRRL B-3704 were used as indicator organisms. Strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against Clostridium perfringens 4TTK, Clostridium botulinum type A. 7948, Bacillus cereus NRRL B-3711, Micrococcus luteus NRRL B-4376 and Yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following: 19 Lactobacillus plantarum, 4 L. curvatus, 4 Pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 P. acidilactici, 2 L. pentosus, 2 L. sake, 1 L. delbrueckii, 1 L. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified Lactobacillus spp. P. pentosaceus 416, P. acidilactici 413, 419 and 446, L. curvatus 348, L. plantarum 452 and 495, and Lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.
TI  - Enterocin 012, a bacteriocin produced by Enterococcus gallinarum isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich.
AB  - Enterococcus gallinarum strain 012, isolated from the duodenum of ostrich, produced enterocin 012 which is active against Ent. faecalis, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lact. sake, Listeria innocua, Propionibacterium acidipropionici, Propionibacterium sp., Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Salmonella typhimurium. One of the four pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli isolated from the intestinal tract of ostrich was inhibited by enterocin 012. No antimicrobial activity was recorded against Bacillus cereus, Cl. sporogenes, Cl. tyrobutyricum, Leuconostoc cremoris, Pediococcus pentosaceus, Staphylococcus carnosus and Streptococcus thermophilus. Enterocin 012 was resistant to treatment with lysozyme, catalase, lipase and papain, but sensitive to Proteinase K, alpha-chymotrypsin, trypsin and pepsin. Treatment of enterocin 012 with gastric juice from the duodenum resulted in a 50% loss of antibacterial activity. Half of the activity was lost when incubated at 80 degrees C for 30 min, or when kept overnight at a pH of 1.0-5.0 and pH 11.0 and 12.0, respectively. Enterocin 012 production started in mid-logarithmic growth and reached a maximum of 800 AU ml-1, but increased further to 1600 AU ml-1 in the stationary growth phase. The peptide is approximately 3.4 kDa in size, as determined after partial purification with Amberlite XAD-1180 and ammonium sulphate precipitation, followed by tricine-sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The mechanism of antimicrobial activity against Lact. sake LMG 13558 is bactericidal and caused cell lysis of active growing cells.
TI  - Conservation of the major cold shock protein in lactic acid bacteria.
AB  - Primers designed from consensus regions of the major cold shock gene of different bacterial species were used in PCR amplification of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB). An appropriately-sized PCR product was obtained from Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis LL43-1 and MG1363; Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris LC10-1, LC11-1, and LC12-1; Streptococcus thermophilus ST1-1; Enterococcus faecalis EF1-1; Lactobacillus acidophilus LA1-1; Lactobacillus helveticus LH1-1; Pediococcus pentosaceus PP1-1; and Bifidobacterium animalis BA1-1. The PCR products were cloned and sequenced. The deduced amino acid sequences displayed high sequence similarity with the major cold shock proteins of Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and the human Y-box factor. The amino acid residues of the cold shock domain implicated in nucleic acid binding in several unrelated species were also highly conserved in the LAB strains. It is possible, therefore, that this protein in LAB may also act as a transcriptional enhancer to other cold shock genes and/or act as an RNA chaperone unwinding tightly folded RNA molecules.
TI  - Identification of a cold shock gene in lactic acid bacteria and the effect of cold shock on cryotolerance.
AB  - When Lactic Acid Bacterial cultures were frozen at -20 degrees C for 24 h, the cell viability decreased drastically, but when they were cold shocked at 10 degrees C for 2 h prior to freezing, viability improved significantly for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis strains (25-37%) and Pediococcus pentosaceus PO2 (18%), but not for the Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strains tested or for one strain of Lactobacillus helveticus LB1 and Streptococcus thermophilus TS2. When the period for cold shock was extended to 5 h, the viability increased even further for those strains that displayed cold shock cryotolerance. Use of degenerate PCR primers based on the major cold shock protein (csp) of both Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis resulted in PCR products from all strains tested. The PCR product from Lactococcus lactis ssp. lactis M474 was cloned and sequenced, and the deduced amino acid sequence displayed a high sequence similarity to other csp's. Use of PCR primers based on the M474 sequence resulted in PCR products being produced only from the lactococcal strains studied and not from the Lactobacillus helveticus, Streptococcus thermophilus, or Pediococcus pentosaceus strains tested.
TI  - Molecular characterization of the replicon of the Pediococcus pentosaceus 43200 pediocin A plasmid pMD136.
AB  - The pediocin A-encoding plasmid of Pediococcus pentosaceus 43200, pMD136, was characterized by restriction enzyme analysis. Analysis of its replicon was facilitated by the construction of a probe vector consisting of the Escherichia coli plasmid pSP72 and the cat gene from Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pC194. The replication region of pMD136 was localized on a 1.6-kb EcoRI/BglII fragment. Sequencing analysis revealed a non-coding region, repA, spanning the first 440 bp, followed by an open reading frame, repB, encoding a putative protein of 390 amino acids. The non-coding region contained two sets of 6-bp and two sets of 22-bp direct repeats and two sets of inverted repeats upstream of the open reading frame. Strong homology of the isolated replicon was found to theta-type replicons of Lactococcus lactis plasmids. Segregational stability assay suggested at least two regions as potentially involved in the stabilization of pMD136. The plasmid's strong homology to other theta-type replicons and its relatively high stability suggest that pMD136 belongs to the widespread family of theta-replication plasmids.
TI  - Cloning and expression of the glutamate racemase gene of Bacillus pumilus.
AB  - A glutamate racemase gene (murI) was found in Bacillus pumilus cells and cloned into Escherichia coli WM335, a D-glutamate auxotroph, by means of a genetic complement method. MurI of B. pumilus encodes a 272-amino acid protein with an unusual initiation codon, TTG. The deduced amino acid sequence shows significant similarity with those of glutamate racemases from E. coli (ratio of identical residues, 28%), Pediococcus pentosaceus (44%), and Staphylococcus haemolyticus (49%). B. pumilus MurI was expressed as a fusion protein connected to the N-terminal 12 residues of beta-galactosidase; the fusion protein showed glutamate racemase activity, and resembled the enzyme of P. pentosaceus in physicochemical and enzymological properties.
TI  - Functional analysis of the pediocin operon of Pediococcus acidilactici PAC1.0: PedB is the immunity protein and PedD is the precursor processing enzyme.
AB  - The bacteriocin pediocin PA-1 operon of Pediococcus acidilactici PAC1.0 encompasses four genes: pedA, pedB, pedC and pedD. Transcription of the operon results in the formation of two overlapping transcripts, probably originating from a single promoter upstream of pedA. The major transcript comprises pedA, pedB, and pedC, while a minor transcript encompasses all of these genes and pedD. By deletion analysis and overexpression of pedB in Pediococcus pentosaceus we demonstrate that this gene encodes the pediocin PA-1 immunity protein. Prepediocin is active in Escherichia coli and when pedA was expressed concomitantly with pedD both the precursor and the mature form of pediocin were observed intracellularly. Extracellular pediocin was only detected if both pedC and pedD were present. The N-terminal domains of PedD and a subgroup of bacteriocin ABC-transporters are conserved. Expression of only this domain of PedD in cells producing prepediocin was sufficient for prepediocin processing. From these results we conclude that both PedC and PedD are essential for pediocin transport, and that PedD is capable of processing prepediocin.
TI  - UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine functions as an activator in the regulation of the  Escherichia coli glutamate racemase activity.
AB  - D-Glutamate is an essential component of the bacterial peptidoglycan. In Escherichia coli, the biosynthesis of D-glutamate is catalyzed by a glutamate racemase (encoded by the dga gene) and is regulated by UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine [Doublet et al. (1994) Biochemistry 33, 5285], a bacterial peptidoglycan subunit precursor. Investigation was conducted to elucidate the interaction between the enzyme and its regulator. Whole and N-terminal truncated enzymes, encoded by individual constructs containing either a full-length or an N-terminal truncated dga gene, were evaluated. In the absence of the regulator, the purified whole enzyme showed a low-level basal racemase activity for which a Km value of 18.9 mM and a Vmax of 0.4 mumol/(min.mg) were determined, using D-glutamate as the substrate. Using the same substrate, in the presence of 6.5 microM UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-L-alanine, a Km value of 4.2 mM and a Vmax of 34 mumol/(min.mg) were measured. Similar kinetic parameters for the activated enzyme were obtained using L-glutamate as the substrate. The N-terminal truncated E. coli enzyme, with a 21 amino acid region removed, is similar in size to the Pediococcus pentosaceus glutamate racemase. Effects of the regulator on the full-length and the N-terminal truncated enzyme in the dialyzed cell lysate were compared. A host cell line, E. coli WM335 delta recA, containing a nonfunctional chromosomal dga gene was used to minimize the background interference. With 6.5 microM regulator added, the N-terminal truncated enzyme displayed a loss of more than 80% of the activity compared to the full-length enzyme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Effect of chitosan in meat preservation.
AB  - The effect of chitosan in meat preservation, including microbiological, chemical, sensory and color qualities, was examined. In liquid medium, chitosan (0.01%) inhibited the growth of some spoilage bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis IFO 3025, Escherichia coli RB, Pseudomonas fragi IFO 3458 and Staphylococcus aureus IAM 1011. At higher concentrations (0.1 and 1.0%) it inhibited the growth of the meat starter cultures, Lactobacillus plantarium IAM 1216, Pediococcus pentosaceus IAM 12296 and Micrococcus varians IFO 3765. In meat, during incubation at 30 degrees C for 48 h or storage at 4 degrees C for 10 days, 0.5-1.0% chitosan inhibited the growth of spoilage bacteria, reduced lipid oxidation and putrefaction, and resulted in better sensory attributes. Chitosan also had a good effect on the development of the red color of meat during storage.
TI  - The Escherichia coli Dga (MurI) protein shares biological activity and structural domains with the Pediococcus pentosaceus glutamate racemase.
AB  - The Pediococcus pentosaceus glutamate racemase gene product complemented the D-glutamate auxotrophy of Escherichia coli WM335. Amino acid sequence analysis of the two proteins revealed 28% identity, primarily in six clusters scattered throughout the sequence. Further analyses indicated secondary structure similarities between the two proteins. These data support a recent report that the dga (murI) gene product is a glutamate racemase.
TI  - Expression of glr (murI, dga) gene encoding glutamate racemase in Escherichia coli.
AB  - The murI (dga) gene of Escherichia coli is required for the biosynthesis of D-glutamate, an essential component of bacterial peptidoglycan (Doublet, P., van Heijetnoort, J., and Mengin-Lecreulx, D. (1992) J. Bacteriol. 174, 5772-5779; Dougherty, T. J., Thanassi, J. A., and Pucci, M. J. (1993) J. Bacteriol. 175, 111-116), but its gene product has not been identified. We found that the amino acid sequence of protein deduced from the nucleotide sequence of the open reading frame of murI gene (ORF1) shows a significant homology with that of glutamate racemase of Pediococcus pentosaceus. The amino acid sequence of glutamate racemase of Lactobacillus fermenti recently reported also shows a homology with the deduced amino acid sequence of ORFI (Gallo, K. A., and Knowles, J. R. (1993) Biochemistry 32, 3981-3990). The murI (dga) gene was ligated into a plasmid, pKK223-3, with a designed ribosome binding site and expressed in E. coli JM109 cells. Glutamate racemase was produced by the transformant cells, whereas the enzyme was not found in the host cells. Accordingly, we newly termed the gene glr, which is more relevant than murI and dga. We partially purified the enzyme to characterize it. The enzyme consists of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of about 31,000 in contrast to the P. pentosaceus enzyme, a monomer protein.
TI  - The occurrence and growth of microorganisms during the fermentation of fish sausage.
AB  - Minced fish (mullet) sausage mixes containing added sugar, salt, nitrate, nitrite and spices were fermented (48 h, 30 degrees C) by indigenous flora or by a starter culture (Pediococcus acidilactici) and the microbial ecology and behaviour of various bacteria was monitored. Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus plantarum dominated the indigenous fermentation, achieving populations of 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g by 48 h, and decreasing the pH of the mix to 4.5-4.7. Significant growth (10(5)-10(7) cfu/g) of Staphylococcus warneri, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis. Micrococcus varians and Micrococcus luteus also occurred during this fermentation. Less growth was exhibited by Bacillus megaterium and yeasts. Pediococcus acidilactici dominated the fermentation when it was inoculated as a starter culture, but indigenous lactic acid bacteria (P. pentosaceus and L. plantarum) also grew to 10(7)-10(8) cfu/g. The growth of other bacteria and yeasts was restricted during fermentation with starter culture. Inoculated Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella sofia, and Staphylococcus aureus grew to 10(6)-10(7) cfu/g in the sausage mix during indigenous fermentation. Lesser growth occurred for Bacillus cereus, Clostridium perfringens and Vibrio parahaemolyticus. Growth of these bacteria was significantly inhibited in sausage mix fermented with P. acidilactici.
TI  - Overproduction of glutamate racemase of Pediococcus pentosaceus in Escherichia coli clone cells and its purification.
AB  - We previously isolated a 6.0-kb DNA fragment that specifies glutamate racemase activity from the chromosomal DNA of Pediococcus pentosaceus by digestion with HindIII (N. Nakajima, K. Tanizawa, H. Tanaka, and K. Soda, 1986), Agric. Biol. Chem. 50, 2823-2830). We digested it further with EcoRI to obtain a fragment of 1.8 kb, which was blunt-ended and ligated into the SmaI site of vector plasmid pKK223-3. The recombinant plasmid showed a high glutamate racemase activity upon transformation of Escherichia coli W3110 cells with it; the plasmid was named pICR223. Glutamate racemase was overproduced in the clone cells and occurred in inclusion bodies in the cells. The enzyme was solubilized with 6 M urea, renatured by dialysis to remove urea, and purified to homogeneity with an overall yield of about 70% after a single DEAE-cellulose column chromatography. The amount of enzyme produced by the clone cells corresponded to about 38% of the total insoluble protein.
