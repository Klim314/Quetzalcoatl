TI  - One-pot microbial production, mechanical properties, and enzymatic degradation of isotactic P[(R)-2-hydroxybutyrate] and its copolymer with (R)-lactate.
AB  - P[(R)-2-hydroxybutyrate] [P((R)-2HB)] is an aliphatic polyester analogous to poly(lactic acid) (PLA). However, little has been known for its properties because of a high cost of commercially available chiral 2HB as a starting substance for chemical polymer synthesis. In this study, P[(R)-2HB] and P[(R)-2HB-co-(R)-lactate] [P((R)-2HB-co-(R)-LA)] with a new monomer combination were successfully synthesized in recombinant Escherichia coli LS5218 from less-expensive racemic 2HB using an R-specific polyester synthase. The cells expressing an engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3 and propionyl-CoA transferase from Megasphaera elsdenii were grown on LB medium containing 2HB and glucose in a shake flask and accumulated up to 17 wt % of P[(R)-2HB] with optical purity of >99.1%. In addition, the same cells cultured in a jar-fermentor produced P(86 mol % 2HB-co-LA) copolymer. Notably, the molecular weights (Mw) of P(2HB) (27000) and P(2HB-co-LA) (39000) were 2- and 3-fold higher than that of P(2HB) previously synthesized by chemical polycondensation. P(2HB) was processed into a transparent film by solvent-casting and it had flexible properties with elongation at break of 173%, which was contrast to the rigid PLA. Regarding mechanical properties, P(2HB-co-LA) was tougher but less stretchy than P(2HB). These results demonstrated that P(2HB) has useful properties and LA units in 2HB-based polymers can act as a controllable modulator of the material properties. In addition, P[(R)-2HB] was efficiently degraded by treatment of Novozym 42044 (lipase) but not Savinase 16L (protease), indicating that the degrading behavior of the polymer was similar to that of P[(R)-LA].
TI  - Biosynthesis of glycolate-based polyesters containing medium-chain-length 3-hydroxyalkanoates in recombinant Escherichia coli expressing engineered polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase.
AB  - Glycolate(GL)-based polyesters were for the first time produced in the recombinant Escherichia coli fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway reinforcing mutant LS5218, using extracellularly added GL as a monomer precursor. Cells expressing a Ser325Thr/Gln481Lys mutant of polyhydroxyalkanoate synthase (PhaC1STQK) from Pseudomonas sp. 61-3, propionyl-CoA transferase from Megasphaera elsdenii and enoyl-CoA hydratase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa grown on GL and dodecanoate were found to produce novel copolymers of GL with 3-hydroxyalkanoates (3HAs) (C(4)-C(12)), P(GL-co-3HA), with a weight-average molecular weight of 34,000. The (1)H and (13)C NMR analyses of the copolymer revealed the incorporation of GL units into the polymer chain. This result demonstrates that PhaC1STQK polymerized glycolyl-CoA as a monomer substrate. Additionally, the novel lactate(LA)-based polyester P(LA-co-3HA) was produced by substituting GL with LA, indicating that the method is versatile and allows the production of a variety of biopolymers.
TI  - Chlortetracycline-resistant intestinal bacteria in organically raised and feral Swine.
AB  - Organically raised swine had high fecal populations of chlortetracycline (CTC)-resistant (growing at 64 mug CTC/ml) Escherichia coli, Megasphaera elsdenii, and anaerobic bacteria. By comparison, CTC-resistant bacteria in feral swine feces were over 1,000-fold fewer and exhibited lower taxonomic diversity.
TI  - Rumen microbiome composition determined using two nutritional models of subacute  ruminal acidosis.
AB  - Subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) is a metabolic disease in dairy cattle that occurs during early and mid-lactation and has traditionally been characterized by low rumen pH, but lactic acid does not accumulate as in acute lactic acid acidosis. It is hypothesized that factors such as increased gut permeability, bacterial lipopolysaccharides, and inflammatory responses may have a role in the etiology of SARA. However, little is known about the nature of the rumen microbiome during SARA. In this study, we analyzed the microbiome of 64 rumen samples taken from eight lactating Holstein dairy cattle using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphisms (TRFLP) of 16S rRNA genes and real-time PCR. We used rumen samples from two published experiments in which SARA had been induced with either grain or alfalfa pellets. The results of TRFLP analysis indicated that the most predominant shift during SARA was a decline in gram-negative Bacteroidetes organisms. However, the proportion of Bacteroidetes organisms was greater in alfalfa pellet-induced SARA than in mild or severe grain-induced SARA (35.4% versus 26.0% and 16.6%, respectively). This shift was also evident from the real-time PCR data for Prevotella albensis, Prevotella brevis, and Prevotella ruminicola, which are members of the Bacteroidetes. The real-time PCR data also indicated that severe grain-induced SARA was dominated by Streptococcus bovis and Escherichia coli, whereas mild grain-induced SARA was dominated by Megasphaera elsdenii and alfalfa pellet-induced SARA was dominated by P. albensis. Using discriminant analysis, the severity of SARA and degree of inflammation were highly correlated with the abundance of E. coli and not with lipopolysaccharide in the rumen. We thus suspect that E. coli may be a contributing factor in disease onset.
TI  - Isolation of tetracycline-resistant Megasphaera elsdenii strains with novel mosaic gene combinations of tet(O) and tet(W) from swine.
AB  - Anaerobic bacteria insensitive to chlortetracycline (64 to 256 microg/ml) were isolated from cecal contents and cecal tissues of swine fed or not fed chlortetracycline. A nutritionally complex, rumen fluid-based medium was used for culturing the bacteria. Eight of 84 isolates from seven different animals were identified as Megasphaera elsdenii strains based on their large-coccus morphology, rapid growth on lactate, and 16S ribosomal DNA sequence similarities with M. elsdenii LC-1(T). All eight strains had tetracycline MICs of between 128 and 256 microg/ml. Based on PCR assays differentiating 14 tet classes, the strains gave a positive reaction for the tet(O) gene. By contrast, three ruminant M. elsdenii strains recovered from 30-year-old culture stocks had tetracycline MICs of 4 microg/ml and did not contain tet genes. The tet genes of two tetracycline-resistant M. elsdenii strains were amplified and cloned. Both genes bestowed tetracycline resistance (MIC = 32 to 64 microg/ml) on recombinant Escherichia coli strains. Sequence analysis revealed that the M. elsdenii genes represent two different mosaic genes formed by interclass (double-crossover) recombination events involving tet(O) and tet(W). One or the other genotype was present in each of the eight tetracycline-resistant M. elsdenii strains isolated in these studies. These findings suggest a role for commensal bacteria not only in the preservation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance in the intestinal tract but also in the evolution of resistance.
TI  - Diet influences the ecology of lactic acid bacteria and Escherichia coli along the digestive tract of cattle: neural networks and 16S rDNA.
AB  - In this manuscript, the authors have sought to gain a better understanding of the interactions between Escherichia coli and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) isolated from Rogossa MRS agar along the digestive tract of grain- and forage-fed cattle. E. coli from cattle receiving a high-grain diet were more numerous (P<0.05) than from the high-forage diet and the highest numbers were in the faeces. Isolates on Rogossa MRS agar were always greater in the high-grain diet (P<0.05) and contained a significant number of LAB. A random set of Rogossa MRS agar colonies was selected and artificial neural networks were used to develop a relationship between colony description and species which was validated using sequence analysis (16S rDNA). The neural networks correctly predicted species in more than 80 % of cases and was composed, primarily, of Lactobacillus vitulinus, Lactobacillus ruminis, Selenomonas ruminantium, Streptococcus bovis, Acidaminococcus fermentans and Megasphaera elsdenii. In conjunction with statistical diversity indices, it was demonstrated that diversity in the high-fibre diet was always lower and was a consequence of the dominance of Str. bovis. In contrast, the diversity in the high-grain diet was greater (P<0.05) and was a consequence of the decline in Str. bovis. These data demonstrate that there is a positive relationship between coliform and LAB isolates throughout the digestive tract of cattle, and diet is the major factor regulating bacterial composition.
TI  - Cloning, sequencing and expression of the gene for flavodoxin from Megasphaera elsdenii and the effects of removing the protein negative charge that is closest to N(1) of the bound FMN.
AB  - The gene for the electron-transfer protein flavodoxin has been cloned from Megasphaera elsdenii using the polymerase chain reaction. The recombinant gene was sequenced, expressed in an Escherichia coli expression system, and the recombinant protein purified and characterized. With the exception of an additional methionine residue at the N-terminus, the physico-chemical properties of the protein, including its optical spectrum and oxidation-reduction properties, are very similar to those of native flavodoxin. A site-directed mutant, E60Q, was made to investigate the effects of removing the negatively charged group that is nearest to N(1) of the bound FMN. The absorbance maximum in the visible region of the bound flavin moves from 446 to 453 nm. The midpoint oxidation-reduction potential at pH 7 for reduction of oxidized flavodoxin to the semiquinone E2 becomes more negative, decreasing from -114 to -242 mV; E1, the potential for reduction of semiquinone to the hydroquinone, becomes less negative, increasing from -373 mV to -271 mV. A redox-linked pKa associated with the hydroquinone is decreased from 5.8 to < or = 4.3. The spectra of the hydroquinones of wild-type and mutant proteins depend on pH (apparent pKa values of 5.8 and < or = 5.2, respectively). The complexes of apoprotein and all three redox forms of FMN are much weaker for the mutant, with the greatest effect occurring when the flavin is in the semiquinone form. These results suggest that glutamate 60 plays a major role in control of the redox properties of M. elsdenii flavodoxin, and they provide experimental support to an earlier proposal that the carboxylate on its side-chain is associated with the redox-linked pKa of 5.8 in the hydroquinone.
TI  - Cloning and analysis of the genes for a novel electron-transferring flavoprotein  from Megasphaera elsdenii. Expression and characterization of the recombinant protein.
AB  - The genes that encode the two different subunits of the novel electron-transferring flavoprotein (ETF) from Megasphaera elsdenii were identified by screening a partial genomic DNA library with a probe that was generated by amplification of genomic sequences using the polymerase chain reaction. The cloned genes are arranged in tandem with the coding sequence for the beta-subunit in the position 5' to the alpha-subunit coding sequence. Amino acid sequence analysis of the two subunits revealed that there are two possible dinucleotide-binding sites on the alpha-subunit and one on the beta-subunit. Comparison of M. elsdenii ETF amino acid sequence to other ETFs and ETF-like proteins indicates that while homology occurs with the mitochondrial ETF and bacterial ETFs, the greatest similarity is with the putative ETFs from clostridia and with fixAB gene products from nitrogen-fixing bacteria. The recombinant ETF was isolated from extracts of Escherichia coli. It is a heterodimer with subunits identical in size to the native protein. The isolated enzyme contains approximately 1 mol of FAD, but like the native protein it binds additional flavin to give a total of about 2 mol of FAD/dimer. It serves as an electron donor to butyryl-CoA dehydrogenase, and it also has NADH dehydrogenase activity.
TI  - Cloning of the gene for flavodoxin from the anaerobic bacterium Megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  
TI  - Cyclic AMP in ruminal and other anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - An examination of cAMP levels in predominant species of ruminal bacteria and other anaerobic bacteria was conducted. Cellular cAMP concentrations of glucose-grown cultures of Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens 49, Prevotella ruminicola D31d, Selenomonas ruminantium HD4 and D, Megasphaera elsdenii B159, Streptococcus bovis JB1, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron 5482, and Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 were determined at various times during growth by a competitive binding radioimmunoassay procedure. The results were compared to those for Escherichia coli NRRL B3704. The levels of cAMP ranged from undetectable for B. thetaiotaomicron to approximately 15 pmol/mg cell protein for P. ruminicola D31d. Varying the growth substrate in a manner previously shown to elicit regulatory response did not alter the level of cAMP in these organisms. In general, cAMP concentrations present in these organisms were much lower than the 6-25 pmol/mg cell protein observed for E. coli. The levels of cAMP in P. ruminicola were consistently higher than levels in other anaerobes, particularly during the early exponential and stationary phases of growth. Based on these data it seems unlikely that cAMP is involved in regulation of substrate catabolism in the anaerobic bacteria examined except in P. ruminicola where it may have an unknown regulatory function.
TI  - Characterization of wild-type and an active-site mutant in Escherichia coli of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase from Megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  - The objective of this work is to determine the molecular mechanism and regulation of short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) from Megasphaera elsdenii. To achieve this, the gene coding for SCAD from M. elsdenii was cloned and sequenced. Site-directed mutagenesis was then used to identify an amino acid residue that is required for the proposed mechanism. To clone the gene, the amino acid sequence of the 50 N-terminal residues of SCAD from M. elsdenii was determined. This sequence information was utilized to synthesize two sets of mixed oligonucleotide primers which were then used to generate a 120-bp specific probe from M. elsdenii DNA by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The 120-bp probe was used to screen a M. elsdenii genomic DNA library cloned into Escherichia coli. The gene encoding M. elsdenii SCAD was identified from this library, sequenced, and expressed. The cloned SCAD gene contained an open reading frame which revealed a high degree of sequence identity with an open reading frame protein sequence of the human SCAD and the rat medium-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD) (44% and 36% identical residues in paired comparisons for human SCAD and rat MCAD, respectively). Recombinant SCAD expressed from a pUC119 vector accounted for 35% of the cytosolic protein in the Escherichia coli crude extract. The expressed protein had similar activity, redox potential properties, and nearly identical amino acid composition to native M. elsdenii SCAD. In addition, a site-directed Glu367 Gln mutant of SCAD expressed from a pUC119 vector was shown to have minimal reductive and oxidative pathway activity with butyryl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Antibiotic activity of an isocyanide metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum against rumen bacteria.
AB  - A metabolite of Trichoderma hamatum, 3-(3-isocyanocyclopent-2-enylidene)propionic acid, was tested for its effects on growth of and carbohydrate metabolism in 11 strains of functionally important rumen bacteria. To standardize the biological activity of this unstable metabolite, a rapid, aerobic disc diffusion assay was developed using Escherichia coli ATCC 11775. In an anaerobic broth dilution assay using a medium lacking rumen fluid and containing a soluble carbohydrate, the minimum inhibitory concentration of the metabolite which completely inhibited growth of the rumen bacteria for 18 h at 39 degrees C was generally less than 10 micrograms X mL-1; however, the minimum inhibitory concentrations for Megasphaera elsdenii B159 and Streptococcus bovis Pe(1)8 were 10-25 and 25-64 micrograms X mL-1, respectively. In general, the Gram-negative strains were more sensitive than the Gram positive. The minimum inhibitory concentration for Bacteroides ruminicola 23 grown with glucose was 1 micrograms X mL-1; for B. ruminicola GA33 (glucose), B. succinogenes S85 (cellobiose), and Succinivibrio dextrinosolvens 24 (maltose), it was 2 microgram X mL-1. When added to a cellulose-containing rumen fluid medium, 1-4 micrograms X mL-1 of the metabolite delayed cellulose hydrolysis by B. succinogenes S85, Ruminococcus albus 7, and R. flavefaciens FD1 for up to 4 days, and 6-7 micrograms X mL-1 prevented hydrolysis for at least 1 month. In the presence of the metabolite, the proportion of acetate produced from soluble carbohydrate by the majority of strains increased, but with some strains net production of acetate decreased relative to production of other acidic fermentation products.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Inhibition of the autoxidation of ascorbate and norepinephrine by extracts of Clostridium butyricum, Megasphaera elsdenii and Escherichia coli.
AB  - The autoxidation of ascorbate and of norepinephrine in Krebs Ringer phosphate medium, pH 7.4, was studied. The autoxidation of the two substances was determined spectrophotometrically at 265 and 480 nm respectively. The effect of dialyzed extracts (m.w. greater than 12,000) from Escherichia coli (aerobe), Megasphaera elsdenii, and Clostridium butyricum (obligate anaerobes) was examined and compared to similarly prepared extracts from rat serum and cerebral cortex. The assay medium contained cellular components diluted 10(3)-10(6)-fold. Up to 10(4)-fold dilution there was a substantial reduction in the rate of both autoxidation reactions, but the preparations from M. elsdenii and C. butyricum were conspicuously less effective. After 5 min heat treatment at 100 degrees C the anaerobic preparations produced less than 20% inhibition, while the activity of the other preparations remained unchanged at 75-95% inhibition. These and earlier experiments involving additional mammalian species (Mishra and Kovachich, Neurosci. Lett., 43: 103-108, 1983) and plants (Mishra and Kovachich, Life Sci., 34: 2207-2212, 1984) suggest that a high level of heat-stable antioxidant activity in one or both of these autoxidation tests (denatured plant extracts only inhibit ascorbate autoxidation) is a general characteristic of organisms that thrive in oxygen-rich atmosphere.
TI  - The uptake and utilization of Entodinium caudatum, bacteria, free amino acids and glucose by the rumen ciliate Entodinium bursa.
AB  - Washed suspensions of Entodinium bursa were incubated anaerobically with Entodinium caudatum, ten species of bacteria and a yeast. The rate of uptake and digestion of these micro-organisms was investigated. Protozoa grown in vivo did not engulf Proteus mirabilis or Klebsiella aerogenes but rapidly took up Bacillus megaterium. Selenomonas ruminantium, Torulopsis glabrata and Streptococcus bovis, although only the last was digested with release of soluble material into the medium. Protozoa grown in vitro engulfed each of the bacteria tested, taking up Megasphaera elsdenii and Proteus mirabilis most rapidly. Individual bacterial species and mixed rumen bacteria were engulfed more rapidly (up to 20 times) by protozoa grown in vivo than those grown in vitro, although the latter digested over 80% of the B. megaterium, Escherichia coli and P. mirabilis taken up. Labelled Ent. caudatum was extensively digested after engulfment by Ent. bursa. Some of the digestion products were released into the medium but individual amino acids were transferred as such from Ent. caudatum protein to Ent. bursa protein. Engulfed bacteria and polysaccharide granules were transferred intact from one protozoon to the other. Free amino acids were also taken up intact from the medium into protozoal protein but there was little biosynthesis of amino acids from glucose. When available for engulfment Ent. caudatum was quantitatively a much more valuable source of amino acids for protein synthesis by Ent. bursa than free amino acids or bacteria.
TI  - Phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent sugar phosphotransferase activity in Megasphaera elsdenii.
AB  - Megasphaera elsdenii was found to possess an inducible phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar  phosphotransferase system for glucose and fructose but not for other hexoses, hexosamines, or hexitols. The complexity of the Megasphaera phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system lies intermediate to systems found in photoautotrophic bacteria and enteric bacteria. Megasphaera elsdenii phosphotransferase proteins exhibited enzymatic cross-reactivity with those from Escherichia coli; however, differences were found in substrate specificities and the physical characteristics of the proteins from these organisms. Sugar uptake was reduced in M. elsdenii stationary-phase as compared with log-phase cells and this loss correlated with a reduction in enzyme II function.
TI  - Studies on some characteristics of hydrogen production by cell-free extracts of rumen anaerobic bacteria.
AB  - Hydrogen production was studied in the following rumen anaerobes: Bacteroides clostridiiformis, Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens, Enbacterium limosum, Fusobacterium necrophorum, Megasphaera elsdenii, Ruminococcus albus, and Ruminococcus flavefaciens. Clostridium pasteurianum and Escherichia coli were included for comparative purposes. Hydrogen production from dithionite, dithionite-reduced methyl viologen, pyruvate, and formate was determined. All species tested produced hydrogen from dithionite-reduce methyl viologen, but only C. pasteurianum, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, and M. elsdenii produced hydrogen from dithionite. All species except E. coli produced hydrogen from pyruvate, but activity was low or absent in extracts of E. limosum, F. necrophorum, R. albus, and R. flavefaciens unless methyl viologen was added. Hydrogen was produced from formate only by E. coli, B. clostridiiformis, E. limosum, F. necrophorum, and R. flavefaciens. Extracts were subjected to ultracentrifugation in an effort to determine the solubility of hydrogenase. The hydrogenase of all species except E. coli appeared to be soluble, although variable amounts of hydrogenase activity were detected in the pellet. Treatment of extracts of the rumen microbial species with DEAE-cellulose resulted in loss ofhydrogen production from pyruvate. Activity was restored by the addition of methyl viologen. It is concluded that hydrogen production in these rumen microorganisms is similar to that in the saccharolytic clostridia.
