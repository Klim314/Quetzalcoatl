TI  == a novel combinatorial biocatalytic approach for producing antibacterial compounds effective against mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb).
AB  == two bacterial hosts expressing cloned aromatic oxygenases were used to catalyze the oxidation and polymerization of indole and related substrates, creating mixtures of indigoid compounds comprised of novel dimers and trimers. crude extracts and purified compounds were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of gram-positive organisms, in general, and mycobacterium tuberculosis (tb), in particular. of the 74 compounds tested against m. tuberculosis, ~66 % had minimum inhibitory concentrations (mic) of 5 mug/ml or less. the most effective antibiotic found was designated sab-p1, a heterodimer of indole and anthranil, which had a mic of 0.16 mug/ml, and did not inhibit kidney cells (ic(50)) at concentrations of >8 mug/ml. combinatorial biocatalysis was used to create a series of halogenated derivatives of sab-p1 with a wider therapeutic window. none of the derivatives had mic values that were superior to sab-p1, but  some had a wider therapeutic window because of decreased kidney cell toxicity. generally, the indigoid dimers that were effective against tb appeared to be specific for tb. some of the trimers generated, however, had a broader spectrum of activity inhibiting not only tb (mic = 1.1 mug/ml) but also the growth of mycobacterium smegmatis mc2 155, bacillus cereus, enterococcus faecalis, staphylococcus epidermidis, bacillus subtilis 168, and clostridium acetobutylicum. the structure of two of the novel dimers (sab-c4 and sab-p1) and  a trimer (sab-r1) were solved using x-ray crystallography.

TI  == biosynthesis of enantiopure (s)-3-hydroxybutyric acid in metabolically engineered escherichia coli.
AB  == a biosynthetic pathway for the production of (s)-3-hydroxybutyric acid (s3hb) from glucose was established in recombinant escherichia coli by introducing the beta-ketothiolase gene from ralstonia eutropha h16, the (s)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa  dehydrogenase gene from r. eutropha h16, or clostridium acetobutylicum atcc824, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase gene from bacillus cereus atcc14579. artificial operon consisting of these genes was constructed and was expressed in  e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus under t7 promoter by isopropyl beta-d: -thiogalactoside (iptg) induction. recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus expressing the beta-ketothiolase gene, the (s)-3-hydroxybutyryl-coa dehydrogenase gene, and the 3-hydroxyisobutyryl-coa hydrolase gene could synthesize enantiomerically pure s3hb to the concentration of 0.61 g l(-1) from 20 g l(-1) of glucose in luria-bertani medium. fed-batch cultures of recombinant e. coli bl21 (de3) codon plus were carried out to achieve higher titer of s3hb with varying induction time and glucose concentration during fermentation. protein expression was induced by addition of 1 mm iptg when cell concentration reached 10 and 20 g l(-1) (od(600) = 30 and 60), respectively. when protein expression was induced at 60 of od(600) and glucose was fed to the concentration of 15 g l(-1), 10.3 g l(-1) of s3hb was obtained in 38 h with the s3hb productivity of 0.21 g l(-1)h(-1). lowering glucose concentration to 5 g l(-1) and induction of protein expression at 30 of od(600) significantly reduced final s3hb concentration to 3.7 g l(-1), which also resulted in the decrease of the s3hb productivity to 0.05 g l(-1)h(-1).

TI  == organization and nucleotide sequence of the glutamine synthetase (glna) gene from lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus.
AB  == a 3.3-kb bamhi fragment of lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna was cloned and sequenced. it complements an escherichia coli glna deletion strain and hybridizes strongly to a dna containing the bacillus subtilis glna gene. dna sequence analysis of the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna showed it to contain the glna gene encoding class i glutamine synthetase, as judged by extensive homology with other prokaryotic glna genes. the sequence suggests that  the enzyme encoded in this gene is not controlled by adenylylation. based on a comparison of glutamine synthetase sequences, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus is much closer to gram-positive eubacteria, especially clostridium acetobutylicum, than to gram-negative eubacteria and archaebacteria. the fragment contains another open reading frame encoding a protein of unknown function consisting of 306 amino acids (orf306), which is also present upstream of glna of bacillus cereus. in b. cereus, a repressor gene, glnr, is found between the open reading frame and glna. two proteins encoded by the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus gene were identified by the maxicell method; the sizes of these proteins are consistent with those of the open reading frames of orf306 and glna. the lack of  a glnr gene in the l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus dna in this position may indicate a gene rearrangement or a different mechanism of glna gene expression.

TI  == selective medium for isolation of clostridium butyricum from human feces.
AB  == a selective medium, clostridium butyricum isolation medium (bim), is described for the isolation of c. butyricum from human feces. the bim is a synthetic minimal medium and contains trimethoprim (16 micrograms/ml), d-cycloserine (10 micrograms/ml), and polymyxin b sulfate (20 micrograms/ml) as selective inhibitory agents. qualitative tests indicated that c. butyricum and other butyric acid-producing clostridia grew on bim, clostridium sphenoides and bacillus cereus produced small colonies, and other clostridia and other obligate  anaerobic or facultatively anerobic bacteria were inhibited. quantitative recovery of c. butyricum from cultures or seeded fecal samples was comparable with bim and with complex medium, but the quantitative recovery of the other butyric acid-producing clostridia tested (c. beijerinckii, c. acetobutylicum) was lower with bim than with complex medium. the bim should aid the rapid isolation of c. butyricum from fecal samples and should be useful for bacteriological investigation of neonatal necrotizing enterocolitis.
