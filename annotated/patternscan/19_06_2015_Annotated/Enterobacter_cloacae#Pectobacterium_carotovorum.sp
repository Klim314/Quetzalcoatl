TI  == ecdysone triggered pgrp-lc expression controls drosophila innate immunity.
AB  == throughout the animal kingdom, steroid hormones have been implicated in the defense against microbial infection, but how these systemic signals control immunity is unclear. here, we show that the steroid hormone ecdysone controls the expression of the pattern recognition receptor pgrp-lc in drosophila, thereby tightly regulating innate immune recognition and defense against bacterial infection. we identify a group of steroid-regulated transcription factors as well as two gata transcription factors that act as repressors and activators of the immune response and are required for the proper hormonal control of pgrp-lc expression. together, our results demonstrate that drosophila use complex mechanisms to modulate innate immune responses, and identify a transcriptional hierarchy that integrates steroid signalling and immunity in animals.

TI  == oem--a new medium for rapid isolation of onion-pathogenic and onion-associated bacteria.
AB  == onions (allium cepa l.) are plagued by a number of bacterial pathogens including  pantoea ananatis, p. agglomerans, burkholderia cepacia, enterobacter cloacae, pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum, xanthomonas axonopodis pv. axonopodis and several pseudomonas spp. we developed a semi-selective medium, termed onion extract medium (oem), to selectively and rapidly isolate bacteria pathogenic to and associated with onions and onion-related samples including bulbs, seeds, sets, transplant seedlings, soil and water. most strains of interest grow sufficiently on oem in 24h at 28 degrees c for tentative identification based on colony morphology, facilitating further characterization  by microbiological and/or molecular means.

TI  == carbohydrate and ethane release with erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum--induced necrosis.
AB  == erwinia carotovora subspecies betavasculorum, also known as e. betavasculorum and pectobacterium betavasculorum, is a soil bacterium that has the capacity to cause root rot necrosis of sugarbeets. the qualitatively different pathogenicity exhibited by the virulent e. carotovora strain and two avirulent strains, a citrobacter sp. and an enterobacter cloacae, was examined using digital analysis  of photographic evidence of necrosis as well as for carbohydrate, ethane, and ethylene release compared with uninoculated potato tuber slices. visual scoring of necrosis was superior to digital analysis of photographs. the release of carbohydrates and ethane from potato tuber slices inoculated with the soft rot necrosis-causing erwinia was significantly greater than that of potato tuber slices that had not been inoculated or that had been inoculated with the nonpathogenic e. cloacae and citrobacter sp. strains. interestingly, ethylene production from potato slices left uninoculated or inoculated with the nonpathogenic citrobacter strain was 5- to 10-fold higher than with potato slices inoculated with the pathogenic erwinia strain. these findings suggest that (1) carbohydrate release might be a useful measure of the degree of pathogenesis, or  relative virulence; and that (2) bacterial suppression of ethylene formation may  be a critical step in root rot disease formation.
