TI  == white-spot lesions and gingivitis microbiotas in orthodontic patients.
AB  == white-spot lesions (wsl) associated with orthodontic appliances are a cosmetic problem and increase risk for cavities. we characterized the microbiota of wsl, accounting for confounding due to gingivitis. participants were 60 children with  fixed appliances, aged between 10 and 19 yrs, half with wsl. plaque samples were  assayed by a 16s rrna-based microarray (homim) and by pcr. mean gingival index was positively associated with wsl (p = 0.018). taxa associated with wsl by microarray included granulicatella elegans (p = 0.01), veillonellaceae sp. hot 155 (p < 0.01), and bifidobacterium cluster 1 (p = 0.11), and by qpcr, streptococcus mutans (p = 0.008) and scardovia wiggsiae (p = 0.04) taxa associated with gingivitis by microarray included: gemella sanguinis (p = 0.002), actinomyces sp. hot 448 (p = 0.003), prevotella cluster iv (p = 0.021), and streptococcus sp. hot 071/070 (p = 0.023); and levels of s. mutans (p = 0.02) and bifidobacteriaceae (p = 0.012) by qpcr. species' associations with wsl were minimally changed with adjustment for gingivitis level. partial least-squares discriminant analysis yielded good discrimination between children with and those without wsl. granulicatella, veillonellaceae and bifidobacteriaceae, in addition  to s. mutans and s. wiggsiae, were associated with the presence of wsl in adolescents undergoing orthodontic treatment. many taxa showed a stronger association with gingivitis than with wsl.

TI  == use of groesl as a target for identification of abiotrophia, granulicatella, and  gemella species.
AB  == we determined the groesl sequences of three species of nutritionally variant streptococci (abiotrophia defectiva, granulicatella adiacens, and granulicatella  elegans) and three gemella species (gemella morbillorum, gemella haemolysans, and gemella sanguinis). the nucleotide sequence similarities between the groes and groel genes of the above genera were 41.7 to 85.9% and 63.7 to 84.3%, respectively. the intraspecies similarities of groesl sequences for the isolates  of abiotrophia and granulicatella species were 94.4 to 97.8% for groes and 94.0 to 98.2% for groel. for ge. morbillorum and ge. sanguinis, all strains showed the same groesl spacer length (8 bp), and sequence identities within species were >97.8% for groes and >96.1% for groel. however, higher intraspecies heterogeneity was observed in ge. haemolysans. phylogenetic analysis of groel sequences separated the 6 isolates of ge. haemolysans into two subgroups. among these isolates, three isolates with the same groesl spacer region length (45 bp) clustered together but were distant from the atcc reference strain (with a spacer length of 8 bp). the remaining three isolates, with a spacer length of 50 or 8 bp, clustered together. although 16s rrna gene sequence analysis did not provide  enough discrimination for the 6 ge. haemolysans isolates, rpob gene sequence analysis supported the subgrouping. based on the obtained groesl sequences, we developed a multiplex pcr that enables simple, rapid, and accurate identification of abiotrophia, granulicatella, and gemella at the genus level. this assay would  be helpful for identifying these fastidious and slow-growing organisms in clinical laboratories.
