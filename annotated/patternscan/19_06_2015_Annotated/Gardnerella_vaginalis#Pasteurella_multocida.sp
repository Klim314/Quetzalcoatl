TI  == cellular fatty acid composition of haemophilus species, pasteurella multocida, actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and haemophilus vaginalis (corynebacterium vaginale).
AB  == the fatty acid composition of 35 haemophilus influenzae strains was found to be grossly similar and characterized by relatively large amounts of 14:0, 3-oh-14:0, 16:1 and 16:0. the three c18 fatty acids 18:2, 18:1 and 18:0 were also present, but in much lower concentrations. this general pattern was also found for most of the other species of haemophilus examined (h. aegyptius, h. aphrophilus, h. canis, h. gallinarum, h. haemolyticus, and h. parainfluenzae). small but distinct quantitative discrepancies were detected for h. ducreyi and the haemin-independent species h. paraphrohaemolyticus, h. paraphrophilus and h. suis. actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans was found to be indistinguishable from h. influenzae. pasteurella multocida also exhibited a fatty acid pattern closely  related to that of haemophilus, but could be distinguished by its higher concentration levels of the c18 fatty acids. the fatty acid pattern of h. vaginalis was considerably different from those of the other species examined. this species lacked 3-oh-14:0 and 18:2 and contained small amounts of 14:0 and 16:0, whereas 18:1 and 18:0 were the major constituents.
