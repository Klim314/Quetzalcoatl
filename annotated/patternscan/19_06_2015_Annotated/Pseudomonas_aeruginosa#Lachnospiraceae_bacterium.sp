TI  == the lung microbiome of ugandan hiv-infected pneumonia patients is compositionally and functionally distinct from that of san franciscan patients.
AB  == sub-saharan africa represents 69% of the total number of individuals living with  hiv infection worldwide and 72% of aids deaths globally. pulmonary infection is a common and frequently fatal complication, though little is known regarding the lower airway microbiome composition of this population. our objectives were to characterize the lower airway microbiome of ugandan hiv-infected patients with pneumonia, to determine relationships with demographic, clinical, immunological,  and microbiological variables and to compare the composition and predicted metagenome of these communities to a comparable cohort of patients in the us (san francisco). bronchoalveolar lavage samples from a cohort of 60 ugandan hiv-infected patients with acute pneumonia were collected. amplified 16s ribosomal rna was profiled and aforementioned relationships examined. ugandan airway microbiome composition and predicted metagenomic function were compared to us hiv-infected pneumonia patients. among the most common bacterial pulmonary pathogens, pseudomonas aeruginosa was most prevalent in the ugandan cohort. patients with a richer and more diverse airway microbiome exhibited lower bacterial burden, enrichment of members of the lachnospiraceae and sulfur-reducing bacteria and reduced expression of tnf-alpha and matrix metalloproteinase-9. compared to san franciscan patients, ugandan airway microbiome was significantly richer, and compositionally distinct with predicted  metagenomes that encoded a multitude of distinct pathogenic pathways e.g secretion systems. ugandan pneumonia-associated airway microbiome is compositionally and functionally distinct from those detected in comparable patients in developed countries, a feature which may contribute to adverse outcomes in this population.
