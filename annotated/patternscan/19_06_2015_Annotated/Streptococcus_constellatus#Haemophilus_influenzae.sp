TI  == [clinical efficacy of oral clarithromycin monotherapy in patients with mild or moderate community-acquired pneumonia].
AB  == clarithromycin (cam) is a new macrolide antibiotic which is active against a wide range of organisms responsible for community-acquired pneumonia (cap) and has superior pharmacokinetics and tolerance compared to erythromycin. in this study,  we evaluated the clinical efficacy and antimicrobial activity of cam in the empirical treatment of patients with cap. cam (200 mg given twice daily for 2 weeks) was orally administered to 26 patients with mild or moderate suspected atypical pneumonia, including 15 patients in whom treatment with beta-lactam antibiotics was largely ineffective. causative pathogens were identified on the basis of quantitative sputum cultures, blood cultures, and routine serological testings; m. pneumoniae was most commonly observed in patients with cap (38.5%; 10/26), followed by h. influenzae (11.5%; 3/26), c. pneumoniae (3.8%; 1/26), and  s. constellatus (3.8%; 1/26). penicillin-resistant, or penicillin-susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae were isolated from 1 patient (3.8%) and 2 patients (7.7%), respectively out of 26 patients with cap. there were no detectable pathogens in 8 of 26 patients. the treatment of cam resulted in complete resolution of all signs and symptoms of pneumonia in all the patients and was not accompanied with any adverse events. the overall incidence of laboratory abnormalities was not detectable in the patients evaluated. although it is important to make differential diagnosis of atypical from bacterial pneumonia in  designing therapeutic strategy, it is often difficult to make an appropriate diagnosis in patients with cap. because of diagnostic difficulties, cam with a broad antimicrobial spectrum is recommended as the first-line drug for the treatment of lower respiratory infections, particularly in patients with suspected atypical pneumonia.

TI  == [bilateral jugular thrombosis in lemierre syndrome].
AB  == an adolescent presented with a rhinosinusitis complicated with bilateral jugular  veins and left superior ophthalmic vein thrombosis and respiratory distress with  pulmonary hypertension. blood culture was positive for haemophilus influenzae and sinus puncture for streptococcus constellatus. evolution was under control after  1 week of appropriate antibiotherapy, antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory treatment. he had no neurologic, respiratory or ophthalmologic sequelae 6 months  later. despite lack of pharyngitis or isolation of anaerobic species on blood cultures, the picture was considered compatible with lemierre syndrome. the risk  for such a complication should be considered in cases of severe otorhinolaryngologic infection in young adults.

TI  == [antibacterial activities of cefmenoxime against recent fresh clinical isolates from patients in sinusitis].
AB  == in order to evaluate antimicrobial activity of cefmenoxime (cmx), minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) of cmx and control drugs were determined against clinical isolates from patients of sinusitis that were obtained in our laboratory from october of 1993 to march of 1994. the results are summarized as follows; 1.  cmx showed strong antimicrobial activities against streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae and moraxella subgenus branhamella catarrhalis that were 3 major aerobic bacteria from sinusitis. antimicrobial activities of cmx against benzylpenicillin (pcg)-insensitive s. pneumoniae (pisp) and pcg-resistant s. pneumoniae (prsp) were stronger than those of ampicillin (abpc), and these strong activities suggested that cmx might have strong antimicrobial activities against  beta-lactamase producing h. influenzae and m. (b.) catarrhalis. 2. antimicrobial  activities of cmx against microaerophiles, streptococcus constellatus, streptococcus intermedius and gemella morbillorum and against peptostreptococcus  spp., from chronic sinusitis and odontogenic maxillary sinusitis, were stronger than those of most of the control drugs. 3. the mic90's of cmx against isolates from patients of sinusitis were < or = 0.025-0.39 micrograms/ml. these values were lower than transitional concentrations in mucous membrane of maxillary sinus obtained when "1% cmx nasal solution" was used with nebulizer. it appears likely  that sufficient concentrations exceeding mics against main organisms would be obtained by nebulizer treatment using cmx nasal solution.
