TI  == [role of infectious agents in the emergence of malignant tumors].
AB  == according to the data of the international agency for research on cancer (iarc),  at least 6 virus species (hpv, ebv, hhv-8/kshv, htlv-1, hbv, hcv), 4 helminthes species (schistosoma haematobium and japonicum, opisthorchis viverrini, clonorchis sinensis) and i bacterium species (helicobacter pylori) have been proved to be capable of causing the development of cancer. the analysis of the data available shows that merkel cell polyomavirus (mcv), herpes simplex virus (hsv), john cunningham polyomavirus (jcv), monkey virus 40 (sv40), cytomegalovirus (cmv), xenotropic murine leukemia virus (xmrv), helicobacter bilis and hepaticus, campylobacter jejuni, fusobacterium varium, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, enterotoxigenic bacteroides fragilis, bacteroides vulgatus, prevotella spp., streptococcus bovis and anginosus, treponema denticola, salmonella typhi, paratyphi and typhimurium, borrelia burgdorferi, bartonella spp., mycobacterium tuberculosis, chlamydia pneumoniae, trachomatis and psittaci, neisseria gonorrhoeae, propionibacterium acnes, tropheryma whippelii, schistosoma mansoni, opistorchis felineus, strongyloides stercoralis, taenia solium, candida  spp., paracoccidioides brasiliensis, histoplasma capsulatum and trichomonas vaginalis can also be potential etiological agents of cancer. apparently, detection of new associations between infectious agents and risk of the development of cancer will facilitate progress in elaboration of prophylaxis measures, early diagnostic methods and, probably, methods of treatment of malignant tumors.

TI  == use of fura-2/am to measure intracellular free calcium in selenomonas ruminantium.
AB  == this paper describes a procedure for loading the acetoxymethyl ester of fura-2 (fura-2/am), and the subsequent measurement of the concentration of intracellular free ca2+ ([ca2+]i) in selenomonas ruminantium (s. ruminantium) using this technique. to ascertain the optimal loading conditions, the effect was examined on the loading of fura-2/am of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid (edta), lysozyme, pluronic f127 alone, or the simultaneous application of edta and pluronic f127. individual administration of either edta, lysozyme or pluronic f127 did not produce an optimal loading of fura-2/ am. the co-application of pluronic f127 and bovine serum albumin after treatment with edta increased the ratio of the fluorescence due to excitation at 340 nm to that at 380 nm (r340/380) markedly, with a high signal intensity for intracellular fura-2, indicating that adequate loading had been obtained. using the present loading method, it was found that the resting free [ca2+]i of s. ruminantium was 48.1 +/- 2.2 nm (n = 6). this is approximately one half that found in escherichia coli, propionibacterium acnes, streptococcus bovis and eucaryote cells. this is the first measurement of free [ca2+]i using fura-2/am in the gram-negative strict anaerobe s. ruminantium.

TI  == [community- and hospital-acquired bacteremia: a retrospective study in a regional hospital. iii. microbiological aspects].
AB  == a retrospective study was made of all blood cultures performed over a 40-month period at the ivrea-castellamonte hospital (turin, italy). a total of 4386 vials  from 619 patients were examined. there were 619 positive vials (14.1%) from 131 patients (21.2%) corresponding to 145 bacteremia episodes, including 129 monomicrobial (89%) and 16 polymicrobial (11%). ten patients (1.6%) had more than one episode. there were 73 polluted vials (1.7%). a total of 165 microorganism were isolated: gram-positive (52.7%) and gram-negative (46%) bacteria, and mycetes (1.2%), anaerobic flora (9.7%). the predominant families were: enterobacteriaceae (29.5%), micrococcaceae (27.3%), pseudomonadaceae (4.8%), bacteroidaceae (4.8%) and streptococcus "genus" (18.8%). the species frequencies  were: escherichia coli (20%), staphylococcus aureus (15.8%), enterococcus (8.5%), staphylococcus epidermidis (7.3%), pseudomonas aeruginosa (4.8%), proteus mirabilis (4.2%), brucella spp. (2.4%), bacteroides fragilis, streptococcus bovis e propionibacterium acnes (1.8%). these findings are compared with those published in the italian and international literature. stress is laid on periodical review of the isolations from samples of this kind as a useful aid towards the diagnosis and treatment of hospital infections, and in their monitoring and epidemiological evaluation.

TI  == effect of ph on growth rates of rumen amylolytic and lactilytic bacteria.
AB  == the relationship between the ph of the medium and specific growth rates, in well-buffered media at 38.5 degrees c, was determined for three strains of butyrivibrio fibrisolvens and for one strain each of streptococcus bovis, selenomonas ruminantium subsp. lactilytica. megasphaera elsdenii, veillonella alcalescens, and propionibacterium acnes. the ph optima for growth were between 6.1 and 6.6 for all six species, and the upper ph limits were between 7.3 and 7.8. the lower limit ph values for growth on glucose were 5.4 for b. fibrisolvens, near 5.0 for v. alcalescens, and between 4.4 and 4.8 for the other  four species. these values fall within the minimum ph ranges found when these species are grown in poorly buffered medium with nonlimiting glucose concentrations. acid sensitivity per se could cause the washout of b. fibrisolvens, but not of the other five species, from the rumens of animals on high-starch diets.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.

TI  == immunotherapy of the guinea pig line 10 hepatocarcinoma with a variety of nonviable bacteria.
AB  == a variety of heat-killed bacteria were tested for their capacity to induce regressions of established line 10 hepatocarcinomas in syngeneic guinea pigs. multiple intralesional injections of heat-killed escherichia coli, streptococcus  mutans, listeria monocytogenes, and propionibacterium acnes resulted in complete  regression of the tumor in a majority of guinea pigs. repeated injections of heat-killed mycobacterium bovis strain bacillus calmette-guerin caused no regressions. surviving animals were immune to subsequent challenge with line 10 cells but not l2c cells, another syngeneic tumor.

TI  == tumor-immunotherapeutic efficacy of serratia marcescens polyribosomes.
AB  == the ability of polyribosomes, obtained from several bacterial species, to suppress the development of cutaneous sad2 fibrosarcomas in dba/2 mice were evaluated. suppression of tumor appearance depended upon the tumor load at the time of treatment, dose of polyribosomes, and species source of polyribosomes, with serratia marcescens being superior to escherichia coli, streptococcus pneumoniae, mycobacterium bovis (pasteur), mycobacterium smegmatis, and propionibacterium acnes (formerly corynebacterium parvum). a single injection of  5 or 50 microgram of serratia polyribosomes at the tumor site 72 hr after the intradermal administration of 1.5 x 10(3) sad2 cells resulted in 66 to 95% survival. all untreated animals expired within 50 days. tumor suppression occurred at both flank and footpad sites. presensitization with polyribosomes and incorporation of polyribosomes into adjuvant were not required for the tumor-suppressive effect. treatment of serratia polyribosomes with rnase or pronase reduced the number of survivors. endotoxin was not detectable with the limulus amebocyte lysate assay.
