TI  - Phytase modulates ileal microbiota and enhances growth performance of the broiler chickens.
AB  - Phytase is well studied and explored, however, little is known about its effects  on the microbial ecology of the gastrointestinal tract. In total, 400 one-day-old female Ross 308 chicks were randomly distributed to four experimental groups. The dietary treatments were arranged as a 2 x 2 complete factorial design, with the factors being adequate (PC) or insufficient calcium (Ca) and digestible phosphor (dP)(NC) and with or without 5000 phytase units (FTU)/kg of Escherichia coli 6-phytase. The gastrointestinal tract pH values, ileal microbial communities and short-chain fatty acid concentrations in the digesta were determined. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly affected pH in the crop and caeca, and addition of phytase to the NC resulted in a pH increase in the ileum. The reduction in Ca and dP concentration significantly lowered, while phytase supplementation increased ileal total bacterial counts. Additionally, the deficient diet reduced butyrate- but increased lactate-producing bacteria. The addition of phytase increased Lactobacillus sp./Enterococcus sp. whereas in case of Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale cluster, Bifidobacterium sp. and Streptococcus/Lactococcus counts, a significant Ca and dP level x phytase interaction was found. However, the recorded interactions indicated that the effects of phytase and Ca and dP levels were not consistent. Furthermore, the reduction of Ca and dP level lowered Clostridium perfringens and Enterobacteriaceae counts. The analysis of fermentation products showed that reducing the Ca and dP content in the diet reduced total SCFA, DL-lactate, and acetic acid in the ileum whereas phytase increased concentrations of these acids in the NC group. This suggests that P is a factor which limits fermentation in the ileum. It may be concluded that phytase plays a role in modulating the gut microbiota of chicken, however, this is clearly linked with the levels of P and Ca in a diet.
TI  - Intestine-derived Clostridium leptum induces murine tolerogenic dendritic cells and regulatory T cells in vitro.
AB  - Patients with autoimmune and allergic diseases frequently present with reduced numbers and functionally impaired regulatory T cells (Tregs) and/or tolerogenic dendritic cells (tDCs). tDC-mediated regulation of Treg proliferation (numbers) and activation is crucial to establishing and maintaining an appropriate level of immune tolerance. Colonic colonization of Clostridium spp. is associated with accumulation of Tregs, which inhibits development of inflammatory lesions. To investigate whether infection with the Clostridium leptum sp. can specifically induce Tregs and/or tDCs bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were cultured in the presence or absence of C. leptum then co-cultured with CD4(+)CD25(-) T cells or not. Changes in tDC numbers, Treg numbers, percentages of T cell subsets, and expression of cytokines related to Tregs (IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta1)), DCs (IL-12p40 and IL-6) and effector T cells (IFN-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-17A) were measured. In the co-culture system, C. leptum-stimulated tDCs were able to increase the percentage and total number of Tregs attenuate activation of T helper cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17), and decrease the amount of secreted IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, IFN-gamma and IL-17A. Thus, C. leptum exposure can induce the tDC-mediated stimulation of Tregs while disrupting the immune inflammatory response mediated by Th1, Th2 and Th17 cells.
TI  - Time-dependent post mortem changes in the composition of intestinal bacteria using real-time quantitative PCR.
AB  - Post mortem or even normal changes during life occurring in major gut bacterial populations are not known. We investigated Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Streptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacteriacaea ratios in 7 fecal samples from healthy volunteers and in 61 autopsies rectum and cecum samples and studied the effect of post mortem time using quantitative real-time PCR. Bacterial ratios in stool samples from volunteers and rectum samples from autopsy cases were similar and did not change significantly up to 5 days post mortem. In cecum, significant post mortem time-dependent differences were observed in ratios of Bacteroides sp. (p = 0.014) and Lactobacillus sp. (p = 0.024). Our results showed that ratios of Bacteroides sp., Bifidobacterium sp., Clostridium leptum, Clostridium coccoides, Streptococcus sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Enterobacteriacaea can be investigated in autopsy rectum samples up to 5 days after death.
TI  - Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov., an anaerobic, butyrate-producing bacterium isolated from the caecal content of a broiler chicken.
AB  - Five isolates that produced large amounts of butyrate were obtained in the course of a study on the butyrate-producing microbiota from the caecal content of a 4-week-old broiler chicken. The five isolates were virtually indistinguishable in biochemical and genetic terms, suggesting that they were derived from a single bacterial clone colonizing this habitat. A phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences demonstrated that the five isolates represented a unique lineage within the Clostridium leptum subgroup of the clostridia, with Eubacterium desmolans as the closest phylogenetic neighbour (about 93 % similarity). These data indicate that the five novel isolates represent a single novel species within a novel genus, for which we propose the name Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum is 25-3(T) (=LMG 24109(T) =CCUG 55265(T)). The DNA G+C content of strain 25-3(T) was 54.5 mol% .
TI  - Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 consumed in a food supplement survived human digestive transit without modifying microbiota equilibrium as assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the survival of Lactobacillus rhamnosus R11 and Lactobacillus acidophilus R52 in the human digestive tract and their effects on the microbiota homeostasis. We designed an open human trial including 14 healthy volunteers. A 3-week exclusion period of fermented products was followed by a 12-day consumption period of 4 capsules daily containing 2 x 10(9)L. rhamnosus R11 and 1 x 10(8)L. acidophilus R52, and a 12-day wash-out period. The 2 strains and dominant bacterial groups of the microbiota were quantified by real-time polymerase chain reaction. At the end of the capsule consumption period, high levels of L. rhamnosus R11 were detected in faecal samples from all volunteers, reaching a mean value of 7.1 log(10) colony-forming unit (CFU) equivalents/g of stool. L. acidophilus R52 was detected in the stools of only 1 volunteer, reaching a maximum level of 6.1 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool. Dilution plating enumerations performed in parallel provided less consistent and generally lower levels. No significant effect of capsule consumption was observed on microbiota homeostasis for the dominant faecal populations. Mean values of 8.8, 9.2, 9.9 and 10.6 log(10) CFU equivalents/g of stool were obtained for the Clostridium coccoides, Bifidobacterium sp., Bacteroides sp. and Clostridium leptum groups, respectively.
TI  - Molecular analyses of the intestinal microbiota of chimpanzees in the wild and in captivity.
AB  - Little information is available regarding the intestinal bacteria of chimpanzees  in the wild, due to the technical difficulties of studying intestinal bacteria in the field. In this study, molecular-based bacterial analyses were performed to overcome this difficulty because polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods, such as temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TGGE) and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene can be applied to ethanol-fixed fecal samples. The common presence of bacteria belonging to the Clostridium rRNA sub-group XIVa, such as Ruminococcus obeum and Eubacterium sp., was indicated for Bossou wild chimpanzees by ARDRA. TGGE on partial 16S rDNA followed by hierarchical clustering analysis showed a systematic difference in the composition of intestinal microbiota between wild and captive chimpanzees. However, several TGGE bands commonly shared by wild and captured chimpanzees were excised, and their sequences were obtained. They were suggested to be the Clostridium leptum subgroup bacteria, Lactobacillus gasseri-like bacterium, and Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum- or B. catenulatum-like bacterium. These may be considered as common intestinal bacteria for chimpanzees, and may be transmitted vertically over generations.
TI  - Subdoligranulum variabile gen. nov., sp. nov. from human feces.
AB  - During studies on the microflora of human feces we have isolated a strictly anaerobic, non-spore-forming, Gram-negative staining organism which exhibits a somewhat variable coccus-shaped morphology. Comparative 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing studies show the unidentified organism is phylogenetically a member of the Clostridium leptum supra-generic rRNA cluster and displays a close affinity to some rDNA clones derived from human and pig feces. The nearest named relatives of the unidentified isolate corresponded to Faecalibacterium prausnitzii (formerly Fusobacterium prausnitzii) displaying a 16S rRNA sequence divergence of approximately 9%, with Anaerofilum agile and A. pentosovorans the next closest relatives of the unidentified bacterium (sequence divergence approximately 10%). Based on phenotypic and phylogenetic considerations, it is proposed that the unusual coccoid-shaped organism be classified as a new genus and species, Subdoligranulum variabile. The type strain of S. variabile is BI 114(T) (=CCUG 47106(T)=DSM 15176(T)).
TI  - Acetanaerobacterium elongatum gen. nov., sp. nov., from paper mill waste water.
AB  - Two mesophilic anaerobic bacterial strains (Z7(T) and Z1) were isolated from waste water sludge of the Xinanzhang paper mill, Beijing, China. The strains were Gram-positive, non-spore-forming and motile. Cells were thin rods (0.2-0.4x4.0-8.0 microm). Growth of the strains was observed at 20-42 degrees C and pH 5.0-7.5. Both strains hydrolysed gelatin and aesculin and fermented several kinds of mono-, di- and oligosaccharides. The fermentation end products formed from glucose were acetate, ethanol, hydrogen and carbon dioxide. The predominant cellular fatty acids were the branched-chain fatty acids isoC(15 : 0) (42.83 %) and isoC(14 : 0) (32.11 %). The DNA G+C contents of strains Z7(T) and Z1 were 50.4 and 48.6 mol%, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed that the isolates represent a new phyletic sublineage within the Clostridium leptum rRNA cluster, with <91 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to currently described species. On the basis of polyphasic evidence from this study, Acetanaerobacterium elongatum gen. nov., sp. nov., a novel genus and species, is proposed, with strain Z7(T) (=JCM 12359(T)=AS 1.5012(T)) as the type strain.
TI  - Anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov., from human faeces.
AB  - Phenotypic and phylogenetic studies were performed on two isolates of an unidentified Gram-positive, anaerobic, non-spore-forming, rod-shaped bacterium that was isolated from human faeces. The organisms were catalase-negative, produced acetic and butyric acids as end products of metabolism and possessed a DNA G+C content of approximately 54 mol%. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing demonstrated that the two isolates were related closely to each other and formed a hitherto unknown sublineage within the Clostridium leptum rRNA cluster of organisms. Based on phylogenetic and phenotypic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown bacterium should be classified in a novel genus as Anaerotruncus colihominis gen. nov., sp. nov. The type strain of Anaerotruncus colihominis is WAL 14565(T)=CCUG 45055(T)=CIP 107754(T).
TI  - 16S rRNA-based analysis of microbiota from the cecum of broiler chickens.
AB  - The microbiota of the intestinal tract of chickens plays an important role in inhibiting the establishment of intestinal pathogens. Earlier culturing and microscopic examinations indicated that only a fraction of the bacteria in the cecum of chickens could be grown in the laboratory. Therefore, a survey of cecal bacteria was done by retrieval of 16S rRNA gene sequences from DNA isolated from the cecal content and the cecal mucosa. The ribosomal gene sequences were amplified with universal primers and cloned or subjected to temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE). Partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were determined from the clones and from the major bands in TTGE gels. A total of 1,656 partial 16S rRNA gene sequences were obtained and compared to sequences in the GenBank. The comparison indicated that 243 different sequences were present in the samples. Overall, sequences representing 50 phylogenetic groups or subgroups of bacteria were found, but approximately 89% of the sequences represented just four phylogenetic groups (Clostridium leptum, Sporomusa sp., Clostridium coccoides, and enterics). Sequences of members of the Bacteroides group, the Bifidobacterium infantis subgroup, and of Pseudomonas sp. each accounted for less than 2% of the total. Sequences related to those from the Escherichia sp. subgroup and from Lactobacillus, Pseudomonas, and Bifidobacterium spp. were generally between 98 and 100% identical to sequences already deposited in the GenBank. Sequences most closely related to those of the other bacteria were generally 97% or less identical to those in the databases and therefore might be from currently unknown species. TTGE and random cloning indicated that certain phylogenetic subgroups were common to all birds analyzed, but sequence data from random cloning also provided evidence for qualitative and quantitative differences among the cecal microbiota of individual birds reared under very similar conditions.
TI  - Isolation of nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants of nitroreductase-producing Clostridium sp. strains from the human intestinal tract.
AB  - Five spontaneous nitrofurantoin-resistant mutants (one each of Clostridium leptum, Clostridium paraputrificum, two other Clostridium spp. strains from the human intestinal microflora, and Clostridium perfringens ATCC 3626) were selected by growth on a nitrofurantoin-containing medium. All of the Clostridium wild-type and mutant strains produced nitroreductase, as was shown by the conversion of 4-nitrobenzoic acid to 4-aminobenzoic acid. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis of the mutants during incubation with 50 microg of nitrofurantoin per ml showed the gradual disappearance of the nitrofurantoin peak. The nitrofurantoin peak also disappeared when cell-free supernatants instead of cultures of each of the resistant and wild-type bacteria were used, but it persisted if the cell-free supernatants had been inactivated by heat. At least two of the mutants converted nitrofurantoin to metabolites without antibacterial activity, as was shown by a bioassay with a nitrofurantoin-susceptible Bacillus sp. strain. Nitrofurantoin at a high concentration (50 microg/ml) continued to exert some toxicity, even on the resistant strains, as was evident from the longer lag phases. This study indicates that Clostridium strains can develop resistance to nitrofurantoin while retaining the ability to produce nitroreductase; the mutants metabolized nitrofurantoin to compounds without antibacterial activity.
TI  - Anaerofilum pentosovorans gen. nov., sp. nov., and Anaerofilum agile sp. nov., two new, strictly anaerobic, mesophilic, acidogenic bacteria from anaerobic bioreactors.
AB  - Strictly anaerobic, gram-positive, nonsporing, thin rod-shaped organisms whose cells were 0.2 to 0.6 by 3 to 6 microns were isolated from a Hoechst Biohochreaktor (strain FaeT [T = type strain]) and from the biofilm population of a fixed-film reactor treating sour whey (strain FT). Strain FT was vigorously motile during early logarithmic growth by means of peritrichously inserted flagella, while strain FaeT was seldom motile and usually possessed no flagella. During the stationary growth phase both strains formed spheroplasts. The temperature optimum was close to 37 degrees C (temperature range for growth, > or = 17 to < 45 degrees C) and the pH optimum was 7.0 to 7.4 (pH range, 6.5 to 8.0) for both strains. The two organisms grew chemoorganotrophically on a number of mono- and disaccharides, including glucose and xylose; yeast extract was required for growth. The principal fermentation products from glucose included lactate, acetate, ethanol, formate, and CO2. Hydrogen was not generated. The G + C contents of the DNAs of strains FaeT and FT were 55 and 54.5 mol%, respectively. The cell wall architecture was typical of gram-positive bacteria; the cells had an extraordinarily thin type A3 alpha' peptidoglycan layer containing muramic acid. Analysis of 16S ribosomal DNA sequences of the two new isolates demonstrated that they represent members of a new genus of bacteria in Clostridium cluster IV of the domain Bacteria and that the misclassified organism Fusobacterium prausnitzii and Clostridium leptum are among their closest relatives. The names Anaerofilum pentosovorans gen. nov., sp. nov. (type strain, strain Fae [= DSM 7168]) and Anaerofilum agile sp. nov. (type strain, strain F [= DSM 4272]) are proposed.
TI  - Phylogeny of the ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, and Clostridium aminophilum sp. nov.
AB  - In previous studies, gram-positive bacteria which grew rapidly with peptides or an amino acid as the sole energy source were isolated from bovine rumina. Three isolates, strains C, FT (T = type strain), and SR, were considered to be ecologically important since they produced up to 20-fold more ammonia than other ammonia-producing ruminal bacteria. On the basis of phenotypic criteria, the taxonomic position of these new isolates was uncertain. In this study, the 16S rRNA sequences of these isolates and related bacteria were determined to establish the phylogenetic positions of the organisms. The sequences of strains C, FT, and SR and reference strains of Peptostreptococcus anaerobius, Clostridium sticklandii, Clostridium coccoides, Clostridium aminovalericum, Acetomaculum ruminis, Clostridium leptum, Clostridium lituseburense, Clostridium acidiurici, and Clostridium barkeri were determined by using a modified Sanger dideoxy chain termination method. Strain C, a large coccus purported to belong to the genus Peptostreptococcus, was closely related to P. anaerobius, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.6%. Strain SR, a heat-resistant, short, rod-shaped organism, was closely related to C. sticklandii, with a level of sequence similarity of 99.9%. However, strain FT, a heat-resistant, pleomorphic, rod-shaped organism, was only distantly related to some clostridial species and P. anaerobius. On the basis of the sequence data, it was clear that strain FT warranted designation as a separate species. The closest known relative of strain FT was C. coccoides (level of similarity, only 90.6%). Additional strains that are phenotypically similar to strain FT were isolated in this study.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - Reduction of nitroaromatic compounds by anaerobic bacteria isolated from the human gastrointestinal tract.
AB  - Human intestinal microbial flora were screened for their abilities to reduce nitroaromatic compounds by growing them on brain heart infusion agar plates containing 1-nitropyrene. Bacteria metabolizing 1-nitropyrene, detected by the appearance of clear zones around the colonies, were identified as Clostridium leptum, Clostridium paraputrificum, Clostridium clostridiiforme, another Clostridium sp., and a Eubacterium sp. These bacteria produced aromatic amines from nitroaromatic compounds, as shown by thin-layer chromatography, high-pressure liquid chromatography, and biochemical tests. Incubation of three of these bacteria with 1-nitropyrene, 1,3-dinitropyrene, and 1,6-dinitropyrene inactivated the direct-acting mutagenicity associated with these compounds. Menadione and o-iodosobenzoic acid inhibited nitroreductase activity in all of the isolates, indicating the involvement of sulfhydryl groups in the active site of the enzyme. The optimum pH for nitroreductase activity was 8.0. Only the Clostridium sp. required added flavin adenine dinucleotide for nitroreductase activity. The nitroreductases were constitutive and extracellular. An activity stain for the detection of nitroreductase on anaerobic native polyacrylamide gels was developed. This activity stain revealed only one isozyme in each bacterium but showed that the nitroreductases from different bacteria had distinct electrophoretic mobilities.
