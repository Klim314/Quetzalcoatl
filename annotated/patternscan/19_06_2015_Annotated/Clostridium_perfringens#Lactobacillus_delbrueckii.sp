TI  == screening in a lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus collection to select a strain able to survive to the human intestinal tract.
AB  == objectives: genetic diversity and resistance of lactobacillus bulgaricus sbsp. delbrueckii collection with 100 isolates from different home-made yogurt in rural bulgarian areas were determined. methods: the strain k98 was the most resistant to bile salts and low ph. survival and effects on short chain fatty acids production were tested in 20 healthy volunteers. high genetic diversity was observed in the l. bulgaricus collection by rapd, whereas the ability of tolerate high deoxycholic acid concentrations, and different acid phs was variable. the strain k98 was selected and used to prepare a homemade yogurt which was administered to 20 healthy volunteers (500 ml/day during 15d). a basal faecal sample and another after yogurt intake were recovered. results: dgge experiments, using both universal and lactic acid bacteria (lab) primers, demonstrated no significant changes in the qualitative composition of gut microbiota. a band corresponding to l. bulgaricus was observed in all 20 samples. viable l. bulgaricus k98 strain was only recovered in one volunteer. after yogurt intake we found an increase of lab and clostridium perfringens, and a decrease of bacteroides- prevotella-porphyromonas. in addition, increases of acetic, butyric  and 2-hydroxy-butyric acids in faeces were detected. conclusions: genetic diversity of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus especie is high we have isolated a  probiotic resistant strain to bile and high acidity, l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus-k98. qualitative and quantitative changes in the intestinal microbiota are found after ingestion of a homemade yogurt containing this strain, with a concomitant increase in faecal scfa. our findings support the interest in developing further studies providing different amounts of l. delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus-k98, and should evaluate its clinical effects in human disease.

TI  == analysis of bacterial communities of traditional fermented west african cereal foods using culture independent methods.
AB  == in this study, the microbial composition of kunu-zaki and ogi, two popular foods  in nigeria produced after natural, uncontrolled fermentation of cereals, was assessed by culture-independent molecular profiling methods. in particular, pcr-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and construction of 16s rrna gene clone libraries revealed the presence of diverse bacterial communities. dna sequencing of the highly variable v3 region of the 16s rrna genes obtained from pcr-dgge fingerprints identified species related to weissella confusa, lactobacillus fermentum, lactobacillus amylolyticus, lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus, bacillus spp. and lactococcus lactis spp lactis from food samples obtained from northern and southern geographical locations. a more comprehensive analysis of 272 full-length 16s rrna gene inserts revealed that 70% of them were assigned to the lactobacillaceae family and 19% to the streptococcaceae family. interestingly, sequences associated with a particular food type were also identified. for example, l. plantarum, l. pantheris and l. vaccinostercus were found in ogi but not in kunu-zaki while w. confusa, streptococcus lutetiensis and streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. macedonicus were  found in kunu-zaki but not in ogi. phylotypes corresponding to potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as clostridium perfringens and bacillus cereus were also detected highlighting the need for controlled fermentation processes.

TI  == molecular analysis of yogurt containing lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus in human intestinal microbiota.
AB  == background: yogurt has traditionally been considered a probiotic-carrier food with health-promoting effects. despite the universal assumption of this assertion, several researchers have evaluated the real capability of the yogurt bacteria lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus to survive and proliferate in the human intestine and have found contradictory results. objective: this double-blind crossover study assessed the  qualitative and quantitative effects of fresh and heat-treated yogurt on bacterial intestinal microbiota from healthy subjects. design: the subjects were  divided into experimental (n=63) and control (n=16) groups. the experimental group consumed fresh and heat-treated yogurt for 15 d according to a crossover design with a washout period of 2 wk. three different fecal samples per individual were recovered: at baseline, after fresh yogurt intake, and after heat-treated yogurt intake. qualitative changes in microbiota were studied by denaturing gel gradient electrophoresis (dgge) with universal and lactic acid bacteria (lab) 16s-rrna primers. quantitative changes in lab, clostridium coccoides, clostridium perfringens, and bacteroides groups were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. results: a particular dgge stable band pattern was observed in each sample. no significant qualitative differences were  detected in any fecal sample. however, a significantly higher density of lab and  c. perfringens and a significant decrease in the density of bacteroides was observed after consumption of both types of yogurt. microbiota density was not significantly different between the fresh and heat-treated yogurt groups, except  for lab, which was significantly greater in the fresh yogurt group. conclusion: the main change in human microbiota observed after yogurt consumption was an increase in the density of lab and c. perfringens to the detriment of bacteroides. bacterial changes were not different after the consumption of fresh  and heat-treated yogurt.

TI  == production of bacteriocin-like metabolites by lactic acid cultures isolated from  sucuk samples.
AB  == a total of 51 sucuk samples, obtained from different regions of turkey, were examined for lactic acid bacteria (lab) strains producing putative bacteriocin-like metabolites. for detection of antagonistic activity, agar spot and well diffusion assay tests were used. lactobacillus sake lb790, listeria monocytogenes li6, staphylococcus aureus st44 and escherichia coli nrrl b-3704 were used as indicator organisms. strains having antimicrobial activity were also tested against clostridium perfringens 4ttk, clostridium botulinum type a. 7948,  bacillus cereus nrrl b-3711, micrococcus luteus nrrl b-4376 and yersinia enterocolitica type 103. 57 of 424 isolates from sucuk samples were putative producers of bacteriocin-like metabolistes and were identified as the following:  19 lactobacillus plantarum, 4 l. curvatus, 4 pediococcus pentosaceus, 3 p. acidilactici, 2 l. pentosus, 2 l. sake, 1 l. delbrueckii, 1 l. rhamnosus and 21 unidentified lactobacillus spp. p. pentosaceus 416, p. acidilactici 413, 419 and  446, l. curvatus 348, l. plantarum 452 and 495, and lactobacillus spp. 411 strains have the best potential for use as sucuk starter cultures.

TI  == detection, identification and characterization of bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria from retail food products.
AB  == forty bacteriocin-producing (bac+) lactic acid bacteria (lab) were isolated from  food samples purchased from retail supermarkets and local farms. of the 40 bac+ isolates, 18 were isolated from 85 food samples by enrichment (21% isolation rate) whereas eight were obtained from 63 samples by direct plating (13% isolation rate). by direct plating, bac+ lab were detected at levels up to 2.4 x  10(5) cfu/g in ready-to-eat meats. the bac+ isolates were identified by carbohydrate fermentation patterns, sds-page protein patterns, and other biochemical characteristics; sds-page proved invaluable in identifying strains that could not be identified by other means. differential inhibitory spectra against indicator microorganisms assisted in the identification of 19 unique bac+ isolates. bac+ lab included enterococcus faecalis, lactobacillus curvatus, lb. delbrueckii, lb. plantarum, lactococcus lactis, and pediococcus acidilactici. lb. curvatus (four strains) and lc. lactis (nine strains) were the only isolates inhibitory to foodborne pathogens including listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, clostridium perfringens and staphylococcus aureus. some lc. lactis isolates inhibited as many as nine gram-positive genera. lb. curvatus fs47 and fs65 grew to high cell densities and produced bacteriocin at 6 degrees c; however, lc. lactis fs56 produced greater levels of bacteriocin at lower cell densities. the high incidence of bac+ lab detected in retail foods indicates that the public is consuming a wide variety of bac+ lab that occur as natural contaminants. these data suggest a greater role for bacteriocins as biopreservatives in food.
