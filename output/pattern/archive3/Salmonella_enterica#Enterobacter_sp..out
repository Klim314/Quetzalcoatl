extraction, characterization and antimicrobial activity of sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins.
sulfated polysaccharides were extracted from gray triggerfish (gtsp) and smooth hound (shsp) skins. their chemical and physical characteristics were determined using x-ray diffraction and infrared spectroscopic analysis. the antibacterial activities of gtsp and shsp against listeria monocytogenes (atcc 43251), staphylococcus aureus (atcc 25923), enterococcus faecalis (atcc 29212), escherichia coli (atcc 25922), salmonella enterica (atcc 43972) and enterobacter sp were evaluated by determining clear growth inhibition zone diameters and the minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) values and by essays in liquid media. gtsp and shsp were fractionated by a diethylaminoethyl-cellulose chromatography. fraction fgii, from gtsp, and fraction fsii, from shsp, showed the most important inhibitory effects against the tested bacterial species. the sulfated polysaccharides from fish skins did not show hemolytic activity towards bovine erythrocytes. overall, the results suggested that those polysaccharides could offer promising sources of polysaccharides for future application as dietary ingredients in the nutraceutical industry.
