TI  - Ceftaroline plus avibactam demonstrates bactericidal activity against pathogenic  anaerobic bacteria in a one-compartment in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model.
AB  - Anaerobic pathogens are often associated with polymicrobial infections, such as diabetic foot infections. Patients with these infections are often treated with broad-spectrum, multidrug therapies targeting resistant Gram-positive bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as Gram-negative bacteria and anaerobes. The broad-spectrum, non-beta-lactam, beta-lactamase inhibitor avibactam has been combined with ceftaroline and may provide a single-product alternative for complicated polymicrobial infections. We compared the activity of ceftaroline-avibactam (CPA) to that of ertapenem (ERT) against common anaerobic pathogens in an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) model. Simulations of doses of ceftaroline-fosamil at 600 mg every 8 h (q8h) (maximum free drug concentration [fCmax], 17.04 mg/liter, and half-life [t1/2], 2.66 h) plus avibactam at 600 mg q8h (fCmax, 11.72 mg/liter, and t1/2, 1.8 h) and of ertapenem at 1 g q24h (fCmax, 13 mg/liter, and t1/2, 4 h) were evaluated against two strains of Bacteroides fragilis, one strain of Prevotella bivia, and one strain of Finegoldia magna in an anaerobic one-compartment in vitro PK/PD model over 72 h with a starting inoculum of approximately 8 log10 CFU/ml. Bactericidal activity was defined as a reduction of >/=3 log10 CFU/ml from the starting inoculum. Both CPA and ERT were bactericidal against all four strains. CPA demonstrated improved activity against Bacteroides strains compared to that of ERT but had similar activity against Finegoldia magna and P. bivia, although modest regrowth was observed with CPA against P. bivia. No resistance emerged from any of the models. The pharmacokinetics achieved were 92 to 105% of the targets. CPA has potent in vitro activity against common anaerobic pathogens at clinically relevant drug exposures and may be a suitable single product for the management of complicated polymicrobial infections.
TI  - Anti-anaerobic activity of serum from patients treated with tigecycline for skin/soft tissue infections.
AB  - To gain additional data concerning the anti-anaerobic activity of tigecycline in  serum, we analyzed blood samples from six patients with a complicated skin/soft tissue infection who were receiving IV tigecycline 50 mg every 12 h. Venous blood samples were obtained after multiple doses of tigecycline at 1, 6 and 12 h after the initiation of a 1 h IV infusion. Sera from these samples were tested to determine serum inhibitory and bactericidal activity over time against 4 anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Peptoniphilus asaccharolyticus, Prevotella bivia and Finegoldia magna). An analysis of serum titers found that tigecycline exhibited early (1 h) and prolonged (12 h) inhibitory activity against each study isolate. Moreover, it provided bactericidal activity for 12 h against these strains with the exception of F. magna. Tigecycline was found to exhibit antibacterial activity at serum concentrations below the MICs of the anaerobic bacteria tested. This finding further supports that the antimicrobial activity of tigecycline can be greater than that suggested by the free fraction of drug and that serum appears to enhance this antibacterial activity.
TI  - Serum bactericidal activities of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against aerobic and anaerobic intra-abdominal pathogens.
AB  - We studied the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) of moxifloxacin and levofloxacin against common pathogens associated with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Ten healthy volunteers received a single dose of moxifloxacin (400 mg) and levofloxacin (750 mg) and serum samples were collected at 2, 4, 8, 12, and 24h after the dose of each drug. Bactericidal titers in serum over time were determined for aerobic gram-negative bacilli (Escherichia coli, Klebseilla pneumoniae, and Enterobacter cloacae) and anaerobic bacteria (Bacteroides fragilis, Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron, Prevotella bivia, and Finegoldia magna). Both fluoroquinolones provided rapid (2h) attainment and prolonged (24h) SBA (titers > or = 1:8) against each of the aerobic bacilli studied. SBA was observed for at least 12h against B. fragilis strains with MICs < or = 2 microg/ml to moxifloxacin and < or = 4 microg/ml to levofloxacin. Prolonged (12h) SBA (titers > or = 1:2) was also observed against isolates of B. thetaiotaomicron, P. bivia, and F. magna with moxifloxacin < or = MICs 2 microg/ml.
TI  - Human serum activity of telithromycin, azithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate against common aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens.
AB  - Telithromycin is a new ketolide antimicrobial with a good in vitro activity against both aerobic and anaerobic respiratory pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity over time of telithromycin (800mg), azithromycin (500mg), and amoxicillin/clavulanate (875/125mg) in serum following single oral doses of these agents to 10 healthy subjects. Inhibitory and bactericidal titers were determined at 2, 6, 12, and 24h after each dose and the median titer was used to determine antibacterial activity. Against two azithromycin-resistant strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae, both telithromycin (MIC=0.25 and 0.5 microg/mL) and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited inhibitory and cidal activity for at least 6h. All three antibiotics provided prolonged (>or=12h) inhibitory activity against strains of Hemophilus influenzae (telithromycin MIC=4.0 microg/ml). Both telithromycin and amoxicillin/clavulanate exhibited rapid and prolonged inhibitory activity (>or=12h) against each of the anaerobes studied (Finegoldia [Peptostreptococcus] magna Peptostreptococcus micros, Prevotella bivia, and Prevotella melaninogenica). Moreover, both agents provided bactericidal activity against both Prevotella species. In this ex vivo pharmacodynamic study, we found that telithromycin provided rapid and prolonged antibacterial activity in serum against macrolide-resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, beta-lactamase-positive and -negative strains of H. influenzae, and common respiratory anaerobic pathogens. These findings suggest that telithromycin could have clinical utility in the treatment of community-acquired mixed aerobic-anaerobic respiratory tract infections, including chronic sinusitis and aspiration pneumonia.
TI  - In vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telithromycin is one of the ketolides, characterised by a 3-keto group instead of L-cladinose and a C(11)-C(12) carbamate link by an alkyl chain to a pyridinum and imidazolium ring side chain. We evaluated in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities of telithromycin against gynaecological pathogens. METHODS: In the vitro study, the antibacterial activity of telithromycin against 180 isolates (isolated in the year 2000) of Streptococcus agalactiae (n = 33), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 22), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (n = 30), Peptostreptococcus anaerobius (n = 20), Finegoldia magna (n = 20), Bacteroides fragilis (n = 25) and Prevotella bivia (n = 30) was compared with that of erythromycin A, clarithromycin, azithromycin, ampicillin and levofloxacin. In the in vivo study, the efficacy of telithromycin was evaluated using experimental intra-abdominal abscesses in mice caused by B. fragilis (minimum inhibitory concentration of telithromycin 0.5 mg/l). RESULTS: In the in vitro study, telithromycin inhibited more than 50% of clinical isolates of S. agalactiae, E. faecalis, N. gonorrhoeae, P. anaerobius, F. magna, B. fragilis and P. bivia at concentrations of 0.016, 0.063, 0.063, 0.032, 0.032, 0.5 and 0.25 mg/l, respectively. Telithromycin inhibited more than 90% of these clinical isolates at concentrations of 0.016, 4, 0.125, 0.063, 0.063, 4 and 1 mg/l, respectively. In the in vivo study, telithromycin inhibited abscess formation and significantly decreased viable cell counts in abscesses in comparison with the untreated group. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro and in vivo antibacterial activities suggest that telithromycin could be a potential candidate for the treatment of bacterial infections complicated by chlamydial infection.
