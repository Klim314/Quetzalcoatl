TI  == pasteurella canis and granulicatella adiacens conjunctivitis outbreak resistant to empirical treatment in a child welfare agency.
AB  == purpose: to investigate pathogens associated with bacterial conjunctivitis resistant to the empirical treatment and their antibiotic resistance in a child welfare agency. methods: twenty-eight eyes in 14 children with a median age of 3  months with conjunctivitis resistant to the empirical treatment were included in  this study. samples were taken three times from the inferior fornix in both eyes  using cotton swabs, cultured onto chocolate and blood agar, and prepared for gram staining. antibiograms were evaluated according to the clinical and laboratory standards institute criteria by disc diffusion method. results: the conjunctival  culture positivity rate was 35.7% in eyes with conjunctivitis resistant to the empirical treatment. the most common isolated bacteria were pasteurella canis (25%), penicillin-nonsusceptible streptococcus pneumoniae (7.1%), and granulicatella adiacens (3.6%). according to culture results, ophthalmic solutions of vancomycin (50 mg/ml) or gentamicin (30 mg/ml) were applied in eyes  with positive conjunctival culture. previously applied multiple treatments were stopped in eyes with negative conjunctival culture. all eyes improved clinically  during follow-up. conclusion: because unusual pathogens may cause a conjunctivitis outbreak, physicians should not insist on empirical treatment. taking conjunctival culture and antibiotic switching according to antibiogram may be helpful.

TI  == fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) accelerates identification of gram-positive cocci in positive blood cultures.
AB  == sepsis is a life-threatening disease with a high mortality rate. rapid identification of blood culture isolates plays a crucial role in adequate antimicrobial therapy in sepsis patients. to accelerate microbiological diagnosis, a comprehensive panel of oligonucleotide probes for fluorescence in situ hybridisation (fish) targeting gram-positive cocci was compiled and evaluated on 428 positive blood culture specimens. by combining genus-specific and species-specific probes, the assay allowed discrimination of staphylococci, streptococci and enterococci as well as differentiation of therapy-relevant pathogens such as staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus faecium/durans. furthermore, the newly designed fish probes strep2, enco and granu targeted streptococcus pneumoniae/mitis, enterococcus spp. (except e. faecalis) and granulicatella adiacens group, respectively. the fish assay achieved an overall sensitivity of 98.65% and a specificity of 99.0% and therefore allowed rapid and  reliable molecular identification of gram-positive cocci in blood culture specimens.

TI  == antimicrobial susceptibility of abiotrophia adiacens and abiotrophia defectiva.
AB  == the susceptibilities of 27 abiotrophia adiacens (proposed reclassification granulicatella adiacens comb.nov., collins & lawson, 2000) and 12 abiotrophia defectiva isolates were tested by microdilution in pyridoxal hydrochloride and lysed horse blood supplemented mueller-hinton broth. according to nccls interpretative criteria for streptococcus spp. not streptococcus pneumoniae, the  susceptibilities of a. adiacens and a. defectiva were, respectively: penicillin,  55% and 8%; amoxicillin, 81% and 92%; ceftriaxone, 63% and 83%; meropenem, 96% and 100%; and 100% for both species with clindamycin, rifampin, levofloxacin, ofloxacin, quinupristin/dalfopristin, and vancomycin.
