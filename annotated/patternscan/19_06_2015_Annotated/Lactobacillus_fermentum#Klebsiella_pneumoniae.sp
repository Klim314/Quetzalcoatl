TI  == antimicrobial and safety properties of lactobacilli isolated from two cameroonian traditional fermented foods.
AB  == twenty-one lactobacillus isolates from "sha'a" (a maize - based fermented beverage) and "kossam" (traditionally fermented cow milk) were selected in accordance with their antagonistic activities and tested for their bacteriocinogenic potential as well as safety properties. these isolates were preliminarily identified as lactobacillus plantarum (62%), lactobacillus rhamnosus (24%), lactobacillus fermentum (10%) and lactobacillus coprophilus (4%) based on phenotypic characteristics and rep-pcr genomic fingerprinting. twelve (57.1%) out of the 21 strains tested were found to be bacteriocin producers, as revealed by the sensitivity of their antimicrobial substances to proteolytic enzymes (trypsin, proteinase k) and inhibition of other lactobacillus spp. these  bacteriocinogenic strains showed no positive haemolytic and gelatinase activities and proved to be sensitive to penicillin g, ampicillin, tetracycline, erythromycin, amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, co-trimoxazole and doxycyclin, but resistant to ciprofloxacin and gentamicin. the bacteriocins showed a broad inhibitory activity against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogenic bacteria,  several of which are classified as especially dangerous by the world health organization, as well as multidrug-resistant strains. these include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovare typhi, bacillus cereus, streptococcus mutans, escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa,  klebsiella pneumoniae and shigella flexneri. these lactobacillus strains are promising candidates for use as protective cultures in food fermentation.

TI  == the microbiota of lafun, an african traditional cassava food product.
AB  == lafun is a fermented cassava food product consumed in parts of west africa. in the present work the microorganisms (aerobic bacteria (ab), lactic acid bacteria  (lab) and yeasts) associated with the fermentation of lafun under traditional conditions have for the first time been studied using a combination of pheno- and genotypic methods. during lafun fermentation the ab count ranged from 6-7 log(10) cfu/g at the beginning to 9 log(10) cfu/g at the end. similarly, the number of lab increased from 5 log(10) cfu/g to 9 log(10) cfu/g during the process while the yeast load increased from 3 log(10) cfu/g at the onset of the fermentation to 5-6 log(10) cfu/g at the end of the fermentation. a total of 168 isolates (31 ab, 88 lab, and 49 yeasts) were isolated and identified by means of phenotypic tests, pcr-based methods and 16s rrna gene sequencing. the aerobic bacteria were mostly  identified as belonging to the bacillus cereus group (71%). the b. cereus isolates lacked the genetic determinant specific for cereulide producers but harboured several genes encoding the heat-labile toxins hemolysin bl and nonhemolytic enterotoxin as detected by pcr. the other aerobic bacteria isolated  were gram negative and identified as klebsiella pneumoniae and pantoea agglomerans. the dominant lab were identified as lactobacillus fermentum (42% of  lab isolates) followed by lactobacillus plantarum (30%) and weissella confusa (18%). seven isolates remained unidentified and constitute probably a novel lab species. the predominant yeast species associated with lafun fermentation were saccharomyces cerevisiae (22% of yeast isolates), pichia scutulata (20%), kluyveromyces marxianus (18%), hanseniaspora guilliermondii (12%), pichia rhodanensis (8%) and candida glabrata (8%) as well as pichia kudriavzevii, candida tropicalis and trichosporon asahii at lower incidence (<5% each).

TI  == comparison of bacteriocins produced by lactic-acid bacteria isolated from boza, a cereal-based fermented beverage from the balkan peninsula.
AB  == boza is a low-ph and low-alcohol cereal-based beverage produced in the balkan peninsula. from a total population of 9 x 10(6) colony-forming units ml(-1), four isolates (jw3bz, jw6bz, jw11bz, and jw15bz) produced bacteriocins active against  a broad spectrum of gram-positive bacteria. bacteriocin jw15bz inhibited the growth of klebsiella pneumoniae. the producer strains were identified as lactobacillus plantarum (strains jw3bz and jw6bz) and l. fermentum (strains jw11bz and jw15bz). the spectrum of antimicrobial activity, characteristics, and  mode of action of these bacteriocins were compared with bacteriocins previously described for lactic-acid bacteria isolated from boza.

TI  == characterisation of the microflora of attieke, a fermented cassava product, during traditional small-scale preparation.
AB  == attieke is a fermented cassava product consumed mainly in cote d'ivoire. the aim  of this study was to characterise the attieke fermentation by examining products  from 15 small-scale production sites at various stages of its preparation. for the preparation of attieke, fresh cassava is grated to a pulp and inoculated with 10% of a spontaneous traditional inoculum. the inocula contained aerobic mesophiles at mean numbers of 8.2 x 10(7) cfu/g and lactic and acetic acids at mean concentrations of 0.2% and 0.1%, respectively. the mean ph was 5.0. lactic acid bacteria were the dominant microorganisms in cassava pulp throughout fermentation with the mean numbers being 1.2 x 10(9) cfu/g after 15 h. the identification to the species level of microorganisms from one representative attieke production of good quality showed that, at the start of fermentation, leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. mesenteroides was present in the highest numbers, accounting for 20% of all lactic acid bacteria. as the fermentation proceeded, this species was replaced by homofermentative lactic acid bacteria, lactobacillus salivarius and lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. delbrueckii, present at 20% and 16%, respectively, and obligate heterofermentatives, lactobacillus fermentum and lactobacillus confusus at 12% and 10%, respectively,  of total lactic acid bacteria in the flora at the end of fermentation. high numbers of acid-sensitive microorganisms, bacillus circulans, bacillus lentus, enterobacter sakazakii, enterobacter cloacae and klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, were transferred to the pulp in the inocula, but acidification to a mean ph of 4.4 with mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.59% and 0.2%, respectively, prevented their growth and reduced their numbers to less than 10(2) cfu/g at the end of fermentation. the mean numbers of candida tropicalis, the main yeast present, remained relatively constant at about 10(5) cfu/g throughout  attieke production. the mean numbers of aerobic mesophiles decreased to below 10(2) cfu/g as a result of the steaming process. the finished attieke had a mean  ph of 4.4 and mean lactic and acetic acid concentrations of 0.6% and 0.1%, respectively.

TI  == activity of cecropin p1 and fa-ll-37 against urogenital microflora.
AB  == two mammalian antimicrobial peptides, fa-ll-37 and cecropin p1, were tested for activity against six uropathogens and five lactobacillus strains by broth microdilution assay. both peptides inhibited escherichia coli at 25 microm (fa-ll-39), and 1.56 microm (cecropin p1), pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5 microm, and 25 microm), and klebsiella pneumoniae, (50 microm, and 1.56 microm), but not  enterococcus faecalis and staphylococcus epidermidis. fa-ll-37 acted bacteriocidally against e. coli and bacteriostatically against the other two gram-negative organisms. cecropin p1 was bacteriocidal to all susceptible bacteria. lactobacilli were resistant to both peptides, with the exception of poultry isolate lactobacillus fermentum b-54, which was susceptible to fa-ll-37 at 100 microm. the differential activities of these peptides toward gram-negative uropathogens versus urogenital lactobacilli demonstrate their potential as a topical treatment for urinary tract infections. in addition, production of such peptides in vivo could be a natural mechanism to aid in the maintenance of the lactobacilli-dominated urogenital flora at the expense of pathogens.

TI  == a bifunctional urease enhances survival of pathogenic yersinia enterocolitica and morganella morganii at low ph.
AB  == to infect a susceptible host, the gastrointestinal pathogen yersinia enterocolitica must survive passage through the acid environment of the stomach.  in this study, we showed that y. enterocolitica serotype o8 survives buffered acidic conditions as low as ph 1.5 for long periods of time provided urea is available. acid tolerance required an unusual cytoplasmically located urease that was activated 780-fold by low-ph conditions. acid tolerance of helicobacter species has also been attributed to urease activity, but in that case urease was  not specifically activated by low-ph conditions. a ure mutant strain of y. enterocolitica was constructed which was hypersensitive to acidic conditions when urea was available and, unlike the parental strain, was unable to grow when urea  was the sole nitrogen source. examination of other urease-producing gram-negative bacteria indicated that morganella morganii survives in acidic conditions but escherichia coli 1021, klebsiella pneumoniae, proteus mirabilis, providencia stuartii, and pseudomonas aeruginosa do not. consistent with these results, biochemical evidence demonstrated that y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases  were activated in vitro by low ph with an unusually low activity optimum of ph 5.5. in whole cells activation occurred as medium values decreased below ph 3.0 for y. enterocolitica and ph 5.5 for m. morganii, suggesting that in vivo activation occurs as a result of cytoplasmic acidification. dna sequence analysis of portions of the m. morganii ure locus showed that the predicted primary structure of the enzyme structural subunits is most similar to those of y. enterocolitica urease. one region of similarity between these two ureases located near the active site is distinct from most other ureases but is present in the urease of lactobacillus fermentum. this region of similarity may be responsible for the unique properties of the y. enterocolitica and m. morganii ureases since  the l. fermentum urease also has been shown to have a low ph optimum for activity.

TI  == [reciprocal effect of klebsiella pneumoniae and lactobacillus on their cytadhesion].
AB  == reciprocal effect of 4 strains of klebsiella pneumoniae and 6 lactobacillus strains on their cytadhesion in mixed populations was studied on a model of formalinized human erythrocytes. the lactobacillus strains included 2 strains of  lactobacillus casei subsp. casei, 2 strains of l. plantarum and 2 strains of l. fermentum. it was shown that adhesion of both the klebsiella and the lactobacillus strains changed under their reciprocal effect. the changes were characterized by the strain differences and depended on the quantitative ratio of the microorganisms.

TI  == effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial population of nigerian orange juice.
AB  == the effect of different preservative treatments on the microbial load of nigerian orange juice was studied over a period of 1 month. results obtained indicated that pasteurization at 60 degrees and 80 degrees c for 20 to 40 min, freezing at  -5 degrees c, and addition of sodium benzoate at a concentration of 0.1 to 0.4% (w/v) could form a microbiological basis for the preservation of the juice for 1  month. leuconostoc mesenteroides, l. paramesenteroides, streptococcus avium, lactobacillus plantarum, l. fermentum, l. fructivorans, klebsiella pneumoniae and saccharomyces cerevisiae were the micro-organisms isolated from the untreated and treated juice samples.

TI  == purification and certain properties of a bacteriocin from streptococcus mutans.
AB  == an inhibition factor from streptococcus mutans strain c3603 (serotype c) was purified and isolated, and its properties indicated that it was a bacteriocin. bacteriocin c3603 is a basic protein with a pi value of 10 and a molecular weight of 4,800. the activity of this bacteriocin was not affected by ph over a range of 1.0 to 12.0 or by storage at 100 degrees c for 10 min at ph 2.0 to 7.0 or storage at 121 degrees c for 15 min at ph 4.0. pronase; papain, phospholipase c, trypsin, and alpha-amylase had no effect on the activity of the bacteriocin, whereas alpha-chymotrypsin and pancreatin were partially active against it. bacteriocin activity was greater against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes b, c, e, and  f than against certain s. mutans strains of serotypes a, d, and g. bacteriocin c3603 was also effective against selected strains of s. sanguis, s. salivarius, s. bovis, s. faecium, s. lactis, lactobacillus casei, l. plantarum, l. fermentum, bifidobacterium bifidum, bifidobacterium longum, propionibacterium acnes, and bacteroides melaninogenicus, but it was not effective against certain strains of  escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, corynebacterium parvum, and candida albicans. the inhibition of s. mutans strains bht and ps-14 by bacteriocin c3603  was found to be due to the bacteriocidal activity of the bacteriocin. when water  or a diet containing bacteriocin c3603 was consumed by gnotobiotic and specific pathogen-free rats infected with s. mutans ps-14, the caries score was found to be significantly reduced.
