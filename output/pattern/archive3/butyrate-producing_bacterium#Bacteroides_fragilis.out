xylo-oligosaccharides and inulin affect genotoxicity and bacterial populations differently in a human colonic simulator challenged with soy protein.
high dietary intakes of some protein sources, including soy protein, can increase colonic dna damage in animals, whereas some carbohydrates attenuate this. we investigated whether inulin and xylo-oligosaccharides (xos) could be protective against dna strand breaks by adding them to a human colonic simulator consisting of a proximal vessel (pv) (ph 5.5) and a distal vessel (dv) (ph 6.8) inoculated with human faeces and media containing soy protein. genotoxicity of the liquid phase and microbial population changes in the vessels were measured. soy protein (3%) was fermented with 1% low amylose cornstarch for 10 day followed by soy protein with 1% xos or 1% inulin for 10 day. inulin did not alter genotoxicity but xos significantly reduced pv genotoxicity and increased dv genotoxicity. inulin and xos significantly increased butyrate concentration in the dv but not pv. numbers of the key butyrate-producing bacterium faecalibacterium prausnitzii were significantly increased in the pv and dv by inulin but significantly decreased by xos in both vessels. other bacteria examined were also significantly impacted by the carbohydrate treatments or by the vessel (i.e., ph). there was a significant overall inverse correlation between levels of damage induced by the ferments and levels of sulphate-reducing bacteria, bacteroides fragilis, and acetate. in conclusion, dietary xos can potentially modulate the genotoxicity of the colonic environment and specific bacterial groups and short chain fatty acids may mediate this.
