TI  - Antiviral, Antifungal and Antibacterial Activities of a BODIPY-Based Photosensitizer.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI) employing the BODIPY-based photosensitizer 2,6-diiodo-1,3,5,7-tetramethyl-8-(N-methyl-4-pyridyl)-4,4'-difluoro-boradiazainda cene (DIMPy-BODIPY) was explored in an in vitro assay against six species of bacteria (eight total strains), three species of yeast, and three viruses as a complementary approach to their current drug-based or non-existent treatments. Our best results achieved a noteworthy 5-6 log unit reduction in CFU at 0.1 muM for Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC-2913), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (ATCC-44), and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (ATCC-2320), a 4-5 log unit reduction for Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC-19606 (0.25 muM), multidrug resistant A. baumannii ATCC-1605 (0.1 muM), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC-97 (0.5 muM), and Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC-2146 (1 muM), and a 3 log unit reduction for Mycobacterium smegmatis mc2155 (ATCC-700084). A 5 log unit reduction in CFU was observed for Candida albicans ATCC-90028 (1 muM) and Cryptococcus neoformans ATCC-64538 (0.5 muM), and a 3 log unit reduction was noted for Candida glabrata ATCC-15545 (1 muM). Infectivity was reduced by 6 log units in dengue 1 (0.1 muM), by 5 log units (0.5 muM) in vesicular stomatitis virus, and by 2 log units (5 muM) in human adenovirus-5. Overall, the results demonstrate that DIMPy-BODIPY exhibits antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal photodynamic inactivation at nanomolar concentrations and short illumination times.
TI  - Multidrug-Resistant Bacterial Outbreaks in Burn Units: A Synthesis of the Literature According to the ORION Statement.
AB  - The objective of this study is to review the literature on multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDRB) outbreaks in burn units according to the outbreak reports and intervention studies of nosocomial infection statement. A PubMed search engine was enlisted to identify reports, in English and French, on MDRB outbreaks in burn units, with no date restrictions, using the following key words: ("burn" OR "burns" OR "severe burn") AND ("unit" OR "critical care" OR "acute care" OR "intensive care" OR "center" OR "centre" OR "department") AND ("outbreak" OR "epidemic") AND ("resistant" OR "multidrug-resistant" OR "resistance" OR "MDR" OR "MDRO"). Twenty-nine articles on such outbreaks in burn units were analyzed. A wide variety of these outbreaks were studied in terms of the microbial agents involved, length of outbreak, and attack rate (1.9-66.7%). The most frequent bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Screening of staff revealed carrier rates of 0 to 20% in 16 studies. Environmental samples were taken in 21 studies and were positive in 14 of them. The mortality rate among infected patients varied from 0 to 33%. Implementation of isolation precautions did not always suffice, with unit closure being necessary in five outbreaks. The lack of consensus on how to manage such outbreak was highlighted. MDRB infections or colonizations are responsible for increased morbidity and mortality in vulnerable burn patients. Their management is problematic because of multifactorial transmission and limited therapeutic possibilities.
TI  - Microbiology and antibiotic resistance in severe burns patients: A 5 year review  in an adult burns unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections are a major problem in burns patients. Knowledge of the incidence and antimicrobial sensitivities of the microorganisms commonly encountered within each institution's burns unit is important as it informs and directs empiric antibiotic therapy. METHODS: This was a retrospective review of patients admitted from 1 January 2008 to 31 December 2012 to an adult burns intensive care unit. Specimens chosen for analysis were wound swabs, blood cultures, venous catheter tips, tracheal aspirates, sputum, urine and wound tissue. Records were accessed from the admission register and laboratory information system to obtain the relevant data. RESULTS: During the study period, 352 patients were admitted to the adult burns intensive care unit, of which, 341 patients were included. The mortality rate was 44.6%. Flame burns were the commonest. Mortality rate amongst patients with bacteremia was 46.9%. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were found to be the most common organisms cultured in most specimens. CONCLUSION: The main three organisms identified in specimen cultures in our adult burns intensive care unit were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa and MRSA. This study has helped establish a better empiric approach to the management of our septic burns patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial Activity of Copper Alloys Against Invasive Multidrug-Resistant Nosocomial Pathogens.
AB  - The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance demanded novel approaches for the prevention of nosocomial infections, and metallic copper surfaces have been suggested as an alternative for the control of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in surfaces in the hospital environment. This study aimed to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of copper material for invasive MDR nosocomial pathogens isolated over time, in comparison to stainless steel. Clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n:4), OXA-23 and OXA-58 positive, MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (n:6) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n:4) were evaluated. The antimicrobial activity of coupons containing 99 % copper and a brass alloy containing 63 % copper was assessed against stainless steel. All the materials demonstrated statistically significant differences within each other for the logarithmic reduction of microorganisms. Among the three materials, the highest reduction of microorganisms was seen in 99 % copper and the least in stainless steel. The result was statistically significant especially for 0, 2, and 4 h (P = 0.05). 99 % copper showed a bactericidal effect at less than 1 h for MRSA and at 2 h for P. aeruginosa. 63 % copper showed a bactericidal effect at 24 h for P. aeruginosa strains only. Stainless steel surfaces exhibited a bacteriostatic effect after 6 h for P. aeruginosa strains only. 99 % copper reduced the number of bacteria used significantly, produced a bactericidal effect and was more effective than 63 % copper. The use of metallic copper material could aid in reducing the concentration of bacteria, especially for invasive nosocomial pathogens on hard surfaces in the hospital environment.
TI  - Device-associated infection rates and bacterial resistance in six academic teaching hospitals of Iran: Findings from the International Nocosomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC).
AB  - Device-associated health care-acquired infections (DA-HAIs) pose a threat to patient safety, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU). However, few data regarding DA-HAI rates and their associated bacterial resistance in ICUs from Iran are available. A DA-HAI surveillance study was conducted in six adult and pediatric ICUs in academic teaching hospitals in Tehran using CDC/NHSN definitions. We collected prospective data regarding device use, DA-HAI rates, and lengths of stay from 2584 patients, 16,796 bed-days from one adult ICU, and bacterial profiles and bacterial resistance from six ICUs. Among the DA-HAIs, there were 5.84 central line-associated bloodstream infections (CLABs) per 1000 central line-days, 7.88 ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAPs) per 1000 mechanical ventilator-days and 8.99 catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) per 1000 urinary catheter-days. The device utilization ratios were 0.44 for central lines, 0.42 for mechanical ventilators and 1.0 for urinary catheters. The device utilization ratios of mechanical ventilators and urinary catheters were higher than those reported in the ICUs of the INICC and the CDC's NHSN reports, but central line use was lower. The DA-HAI rates in this study were higher than the CDC's NHSN report. However, compared with the INICC report, the VAP rate in our study was lower, while the CLAB rate was similar and the CAUTI rate was higher. Nearly 83% of the samples showed a mixed-type infection. The most frequent pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterococcus spp. In the S. aureus isolates, 100% were resistant to oxacillin. Overall resistances of A. baumannii and K. pneumonia to imipenem were 70.5% and 76.7%, respectively. A multiple drug resistance phenotype was detected in 68.15% of the isolates. The DA-HAI rates in Iran were shown to be higher than the CDC-NHSN rates and similar to the INICC rates. Resistance to oxacillin and imipenem was higher as well. Comparing device use, DA-HAI rates, and bacterial resistance for the primary isolated bacteria indicated a direct association between urinary catheter use and the rates of CAUTI.
TI  - Influence of 4'-O-Glycoside Constitution and Configuration on Ribosomal Selectivity of Paromomycin.
AB  - A series of 20 4'-O-glycosides of the aminoglycoside antibiotic paromomycin were  synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit protein synthesis by bacterial, mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes. Target selectivity, i.e., inhibition of the bacterial ribosome over eukaryotic mitochondrial and cytosolic ribosomes, which is predictive of antibacterial activity with reduced ototoxicity and systemic toxicity, was greater for the equatorial than for the axial pyranosides, and greater for the d-pentopyranosides than for the l-pentopyranosides and d-hexopyranosides. In particular, 4'-O-beta-d-xylopyranosyl paromomycin shows antibacterioribosomal activity comparable to that of paromomycin, but is significantly more selective showing considerably reduced affinity for the cytosolic ribosome and for the A1555G mutant mitochondrial ribosome associated with hypersusceptibility to drug-induced ototoxicity. Compound antibacterioribosomal activity correlates with antibacterial activity, and the ribosomally more active compounds show activity against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The paromomycin glycosides retain activity against clinical strains of MRSA that are resistant to paromomycin, which is demonstrated to be a consequence of 4'-O-glycosylation blocking the action of 4'-aminoglycoside nucleotidyl transferases by the use of recombinant E. coli carrying the specific resistance determinant.
TI  - Immobilization and orientation-dependent activity of a naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide.
AB  - A naturally occurring antimicrobial peptide, SMAP-29, was synthesized with an n-terminal or c-terminal cysteine, termed c_SMAP and SMAP_c, respectively, for site-directed immobilization to superparamagnetic beads. Immobilized SMAP orientation-dependent activity was probed against multiple bacteria of clinical interest including Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus anthracis sterne and Staphylococcus aureus. A kinetic microplate assay was employed to reveal both concentration and time-dependent activity for elucidation of minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) and sub-lethal effects. Immobilized SMAP activity was equivalent or reduced compared with soluble SMAP_c and c_SMAP regardless of immobilization orientation, with only one exception. A comparison of immobilized SMAP_c and c_SMAP activity revealed a bacteria-specific potency dependent on immobilization orientation, which was contrary to that seen in solution, wherein SMAP_c was more potent against all bacteria than c_SMAP. Sub-MBC kinetic studies displayed the influence of peptide exposure to the cells with multiple bacteria exhibiting increased susceptibility and efficacy at lower concentrations upon extended exposure (i.e. MBC enhancement). For instances in which complete killing was not achieved, two predominant effects were evident: retardation of growth rate and an increased lag phase. Both effects, seen independently and concomitantly, indicate some degree of induced cellular damage that can serve as a predictor toward eventual cell death. SMAP_c immobilized on glass through standard silanization chemistry was also investigated to ascertain the influence of substrate on activity against select bacteria. Published 2015. This article is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA.
TI  - Pathogen transfer and high variability in pathogen removal by detergent wipes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rise in health care-associated infections has placed a greater emphasis on cleaning and disinfection practices. The majority of policies advocate using detergent-based products for routine cleaning, with detergent wipes increasingly being used; however, there is no information about their ability to remove and subsequently transfer pathogens in practice. METHODS: Seven detergent wipes were tested for their ability to remove and transfer Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Clostridium difficile spores using the 3-stage wipe protocol. RESULTS: The ability of the detergent wipes to remove S aureus, A baumannii, and C difficile spores from a stainless steel surface ranged from 1.50 log10 (range, 0.24-3.25), 3.51 log10 (range, 3.01-3.81), and 0.96 log10 (range, 0.26-1.44), respectively, following a 10-second wiping time. All wipes repeatedly transferred significant amounts of bacteria/spores over 3 consecutive surfaces, although the percentage of total microorganisms transferred from the wipes after wiping was low for a number of products. CONCLUSIONS: Detergent-based wipe products have 2 major drawbacks: their variability in removing microbial bioburden from inanimate surfaces and a propensity to transfer pathogens between surfaces. The use of additional complementary measures such as combined detergent/disinfectant-based products and/or antimicrobial surfaces need to be considered for appropriate infection control and prevention.
TI  - [Bloodstream infections in southwestern China: 2012 Whire Union report on bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the susceptibility of blood culture isolates to antibiotics in a sample of hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. METHODS: Blood culture samples were taken and tested from the patients under the Whire Union surveillance in three tertiary hospitals in Southwestern China in 2012. We performed antimicrobial susceptibility analyses on the blood culture isolates using WHONET5. 5 and SPSS19.0. RESULTS: A total of 1745 isolates were identified: 877 Gram-positive (50.26%); 868 Gram-negative (49.74%). Coagulase-negative Staphylococcius (CNS, 541 strains, 31.00%), Escherichia coli (ECO, 379 strains, 21.72%), Klebsiella spp. (170 strains, 9.74%), Enterococcus spp. (143 strains, 8.20%) and Staphylococcus aureus (SAU, 128 strains, 7.34%) comprised the majority of isolates. Methicillin-resistant was found in 37.5% of S. aureus and 85.4% of CNS, respectively. Zero and 6.3% resistance to vancomycin were found for Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, respectively,compared with a 1.4% and 7.9% resistance to linezolid, respectively. Imipenem-resistance occurred in 0.7% E. coli, 3.6% Klebsiella spp., and 11.1% Enterobacter spp.. Nonfermenters were highly resistant to carbapenems, with an imipenem resistance rate of 25.0% in P. aeruginosa and 79.1% in Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial usage and critical-care units were identified as risk factors for MRSA and multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections. Patients undergoing tracheotomy/endotracheal intubation were likely to develop multi-drug-resistant A. baumannii infections than others. CONCLUSION: CNS, E. coli,Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus spp. and S. aureus were the predominant organisms in bloodstream infections in Southwestern China. Low methicillin-resistant rate was found in Staphylococcus aureus. But vancomycin-resistant rate was high in E. faecium. Imipenem-resistant rates varied in Enterobacteriaceae: higher in non-fermenting bacteria especially in Acinetobacter spp. Use of abtimicrobial drugs and invasive procedures can lead to development of antimicrobial drugs-resistance.
TI  - Development of two real-time multiplex PCR assays for the detection and quantification of eight key bacterial pathogens in lower respiratory tract infection.
AB  - The frequent lack of a positive and timely microbiological diagnosis in patients  with lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) is an important obstacle to antimicrobial stewardship. Patients are typically prescribed broad-spectrum empirical antibiotics while microbiology results are awaited, but as these are often slow, negative or inconclusive, de-escalation to narrow-spectrum agents rarely occurs in clinical practice. The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate two mRT-PCR assays for the sensitive detection and accurate quantification of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. We found that all eight bacterial targets could be reliably quantified from sputum samples down to a concentration of 100 cfu/reaction (8333 cfu/ml). Furthermore, all 249 positive control isolates were correctly detected with our assay, demonstrating effectiveness on both reference strains and local clinical isolates. Specificity was 98% on a panel of nearly 100 negative control isolates. Bacterial load was quantified accurately when three bacterial targets were present in mixtures of varying concentrations, mimicking likely clinical scenarios in LRTI. Concordance with culture was 100% for culture-positive sputa, 90% for bronchoalveolar lavage fluids and additional culture-negative bacterial infections were detected and quantified. In conclusion, a quantitative molecular test for eight key bacterial causes of LRTI has the potential to provide a more sensitive decision-making tool, closer to the time point of patient admission than current standard methods. This should facilitate de-escalation from broad-spectrum to narrow-spectrum antibiotics, substantially improving patient management and supporting efforts to curtail inappropriate antibiotic use.
TI  - Hydroxy tricyclic 1,5-naphthyridinone oxabicyclooctane-linked novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors as broad-spectrum antibacterial agents-SAR of RHS moiety (Part-3).
AB  - Novel bacterial topoisomerase inhibitors (NBTIs) are a new class of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents targeting bacterial Gyrase A and ParC and have potential utility in combating antibiotic resistance. (R)-Hydroxy-1,5-naphthyridinone left-hand side (LHS) oxabicyclooctane linked pyridoxazinone right-hand side (RHS) containing NBTIs showed a potent Gram-positive antibacterial profile. SAR around the RHS moiety, including substitutions around pyridooxazinone, pyridodioxane, and phenyl propenoids has been described. A fluoro substituted pyridoxazinone showed an MIC against Staphylococcus aureus of 0.5mug/mL with reduced functional hERG activity (IC50 333muM) and good in vivo efficacy [ED90 12mg/kg, intravenous (iv) and 15mg/kg, oral (p.o.)]. A pyridodioxane-containing NBTI showed a S. aureus MIC of 0.5mug/mL, significantly improved hERG IC50 764muM and strong efficacy of 11mg/kg (iv) and 5 mg/kg (p.o.). A phenyl propenoid series of compounds showed potent antibacterial activity, but also showed potent hERG binding activity. Many of the compounds in the hydroxy-tricyclic series showed strong activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, but reduced activity against Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bicyclic heterocycles appeared to be the best RHS moiety for the hydroxy-tricyclic oxabicyclooctane linked NBTIs.
TI  - Bactericidal efficacy of atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) against  the ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - The emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens within the clinical environment is presenting a mounting problem in hospitals worldwide. The 'ESKAPE' pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) have been highlighted as a group of causative organisms in a majority of nosocomial infections, presenting a serious health risk due to widespread antimicrobial resistance. The stagnating pipeline of new antibiotics requires alternative approaches to the control and treatment of nosocomial infections. Atmospheric pressure non-thermal plasma (APNTP) is attracting growing interest as an alternative infection control approach within the clinical setting. This study presents a comprehensive bactericidal assessment of an in-house-designed APNTP jet both against biofilms and planktonic bacteria of the ESKAPE pathogens. Standard plate counts and the XTT metabolic assay were used to evaluate the antibacterial effect of APNTP, with both methods demonstrating comparable eradication times. APNTP exhibited rapid antimicrobial activity against all of the ESKAPE pathogens in the planktonic mode of growth and provided efficient and complete eradication of ESKAPE pathogens in the biofilm mode of growth within 360s, with the exception of A. baumannii where a >4log reduction in biofilm viability was observed. This demonstrates its effectiveness as a bactericidal treatment against these pathogens and further highlights its potential application in the clinical environment for the control of highly antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Repurposing Non-antimicrobial Drugs and Clinical Molecules to Treat Bacterial Infections.
AB  - There is a pressing need to develop novel antimicrobials to circumvent the scourge of antimicrobial resistance. The objective of this study is to identify non-antibiotic drugs with potent antimicrobial activity, within an applicable clinical range. A library, containing 727 FDA approved drugs and small molecules, was screened against ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobactercloacae). Drugs that showed antimicrobial activity in an applicable clinical range were further tested in vitro and in vivo in an infected mouse model. The initial screening identified 24 non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules active against Gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) isolates. Two non-antibiotic drugs showed activity against Gram-negative pathogens. Among the active non-antibiotic drugs, only ebselen (EB) and 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine (FdUrd), showed bactericidal activity, in an applicable clinical range, against multi-drug-resistant Staphylococcus isolates including MRSA, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (VRSA), and vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (VISA).The minimum inhibitory concentration at which 90% of clinical isolates of S. aureus were inhibited (MIC90) was found to be 0.25 and 0.0039mg/L for EB and FdUrd, respectively. Treatment with EB orally significantly increased mice survival in a lethal model of septicemic MRSA-infection by (60%) compared to that of control. FdUrd oral and intraperitoneal treatment significantly enhanced mouse survival by 60% and 100%, respectively. These data encourage screening and repurposing of non-antibiotic drugs and clinical molecules to treat multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Global in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents: Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004-2013.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global  antimicrobial susceptibility surveillance study which has been ongoing since 2004. This report examines the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against clinically important pathogens collected globally between 2004 and 2013. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using guidelines published by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The Cochran Armitage Trend Test was used to identify statistically significant changes in susceptibility between 2004 and 2013. RESULTS: Among the Enterobacteriaceae susceptibility was highest to the carbapenems [imipenem 97.1% (24,655/25,381), meropenem 97.0% (90,714/93,518)], tigecycline (97.0%, 115,361/118,899) and amikacin (96.9%, 115,200/118,899). Against Acinetobacter baumannii the highest rates of susceptibility were for minocycline (84.5%, 14,178/16,778) and imipenem (80.0%, 3,037/3,795). The MIC90 for tigecycline was 2 mg/L. 40% (6,743/16,778) of A. baumannii isolates were multidrug-resistant. Enterococci were highly susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid (>99%); vancomycin resistance was observed among 2% of Enterococcus faecalis (325/14,615) and 35% of Enterococcus faecium (2,136/6,167) globally. 40% (14,647/36,448) of Staphylococcus aureus were methicillin-resistant while 15% (2,152/14,562) of Streptococcus pneumoniae were penicillin-resistant. Against S. aureus and S. pneumoniae susceptibility to linezolid, vancomycin, and tigecycline was >/=99.9%. Globally, 81% (331/410) of statistically significant susceptibility changes during the study period were decreases in susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Amikacin, the carbapenems, and tigecycline were active against most gram-negative pathogens while linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin retained activity against most gram-positive pathogens collected in TEST during 2004-2013.
TI  - Alkanna tinctoria leaves extracts: a prospective remedy against multidrug resistant human pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Plants are rich source of chemical compounds that are used to accomplish biological activity. Indigenously crude extracts of plants are widely used as herbal medicine for the treatment of infections by people of different ethnic groups. The present investigation was carried out to evaluate the biological potential of Alkanna tinctoria leaves extract from district Charsadda, Pakistan against multidrug resistant human pathogenic bacteria including Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. METHODS: Anti-multi-drug resistant bacterial activity of aqueous, chloroform, ethanol and hexane extracts of Alkanna tinctoria leaves were evaluated by well diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of different extracts were determined. Moreover qualitative phytochemicals screening of the studied extracts was performed. RESULTS: All four selected bacteria including A. baumannii, E. coli, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus were categorized as multi-drug resistant (MDR) as they were found to be resistant to 13, 10, 19 and 22 antibiotics belonging to different groups respectively. All the four extract showed potential activity against S. aureus as compare to positive control antibiotic (Imipenem). Similarly among the four extracts of Alkanna tinctoria leaves, aqueous extract showed best activity against A. baumannii (10 +/- 03 mm), P. aeruginosa (12 +/- 0.5 mm), and S. aureus (14 +/- 0.5 mm) as compare to Imipenem. The MICs and MBCs results also showed quantitative concentration of plant extracts to inhibit or kill MDR bacteria. When phytochemicals analysis was performed it was observed that aqueous and ethanol extracts showed phytochemicals with large number as well as volume, especially Alkaloides, Flavonoides and Charbohydrates. CONCLUSION: The undertaken study demonstrated that all the four extracts of Alkanna tinctoria leaves exhibited considerable antibacterial activity against MDR isolates. Finding from the current study will be helpful for further elucidation of lead molecules from Alkanna tinctoria leaves for future therapeutic use against MDR pathogens.
TI  - Repurposing Salicylanilide Anthelmintic Drugs to Combat Drug Resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - Staphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive bacterium that has become the leading cause of hospital acquired infections in the US. Repurposing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs for antimicrobial therapy involves lower risks and costs compared to de novo development of novel antimicrobial agents. In this study, we examined the antimicrobial properties of two commercially available anthelmintic drugs. The FDA approved drug niclosamide and the veterinary drug oxyclozanide displayed strong in vivo and in vitro activity against methicillin resistant S. aureus (minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC): 0.125 and 0.5 mug/ml respectively; minimum effective concentration: </= 0.78 mug/ml for both drugs). The two drugs were also effective against another Gram-positive bacteria Enterococcus faecium (MIC 0.25 and 2 mug/ml respectively), but not against the Gram-negative species Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter aerogenes. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of niclosamide and oxyclozanide were determined against methicillin, vancomycin, linezolid or daptomycin resistant S. aureus clinical isolates, with MICs at 0.0625-0.5 and 0.125-2 mug/ml for niclosamide and oxyclozanide respectively. A time-kill study demonstrated that niclosamide is bacteriostatic, whereas oxyclozanide is bactericidal. Interestingly, oxyclozanide permeabilized the bacterial membrane but neither of the anthelmintic drugs exhibited demonstrable toxicity to sheep erythrocytes. Oxyclozanide was non-toxic to HepG2 human liver carcinoma cells within the range of its in vitro MICs but niclosamide displayed toxicity even at low concentrations. These data show that the salicylanilide anthelmintic drugs niclosamide and oxyclozanide are suitable candidates for mechanism of action studies and further clinical evaluation for treatment of staphylococcal infections.
TI  - Evaluation of regional antibiograms to monitor antimicrobial resistance in Hampton Roads, Virginia.
AB  - We studied recent antibiograms (2010 to 2011) from 12 hospitals in the Hampton Roads area, Virginia, that refer patients to a tertiary-care facility affiliated with Eastern Virginia Medical School. The data was compiled into a regional antibiogram, and sensitivity rates of common isolates from the tertiary-care facility (central) were compared to those of referring hospitals grouped by locale. Staphylococcus aureus was the most common Gram- positive and E. coli the most common Gram- negative organism grown from clinical samples in the area. Overall 53% of S.aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. There was a broad scatter of MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) for vancomycin within the susceptibility range, and MIC of 4 mug/mL was reported in 2012. Penicillin resistance was seen in 50% and erythromycin resistance in 45% of Streptococcus pneumoniae. Vancomycin resistance was seen in 75% of Enterococcus faecium and 2% of Enterococcus faecalis respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most resistant Gram negative organism in the data compiled. Among the Escherichia coli, 26%, 44% and 52%were resistant to Trimethoprim/Sulfamethoxazole ( SXT) ampicillin- sulbactam and ampicillin respectively. We found significant differences in methodology, interpretation and antibiotic panels used by area laboratories. Based on these findings, we are now prospectively following resistance patterns in the tertiary-care facility, sharing data, and creating a consistent approach to antimicrobial susceptibility testing in the region.
TI  - Microbiological characteristics of sepsis in a University hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Microbiological characteristics of sepsis and antimicrobial resistance are well studied, although in State University of Campinas, no data has been published yet. METHODS: The main agents related to sepsis and antimicrobial resistance were analyzed. The blood culture records requested from 4,793 hospitalized patients were analyzed. The samples were processed using the Bact/Alert(R) system for agent identification and antimicrobial susceptibility. RESULTS: A total of 1,017 patients met the inclusion criteria for a sepsis diagnosis, with 2,309 samples tested (2.27 samples/patient). There were 489 positive samples (21% positive) isolated from 337 patients (33.13%), but more rigorous criteria excluding potential contaminants resulted in analysis being restricted to 266 patients (315 agents). The prevalent microorganisms were coagulase negative Staphylococcus (CNS) (15.87%), Escherichia coli (13.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.7%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.8%), Enterobacter sp (9.5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (9.2%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.7%) and Candida sp (5.1%). Examining antimicrobial resistance in the agents revealed that 51% of the S. aureus isolates were methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and 80% of the CNS isolates were oxacillin-resistant. For A. baumannii, the ideal profile drugs were ampicillin sulbactam and piperacillin/tazobactam, and for P. aeruginosa, they were piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftazidime. Enterobacteria showed on average 32.5% and 35.7% resistance to beta-lactams and ciprofloxacin, respectively. When all Gram-negative bacteria were considered, the resistance to beta-lactams rose to 40.5%, and the resistance to ciprofloxacin rose to 42.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Eighty percent of the agents identified in blood cultures from patients with sepsis belonged to a group of eight different agents. For empirical treatment, carbapenems and vancomycin unfortunately still remain the best therapeutic choice, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, for which piperacillin/tazobactan is the best option.
TI  - Trends in paediatric bloodstream infections at a South African referral hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of paediatric bloodstream infection (BSI) in Sub-Saharan Africa is poorly documented with limited data on hospital-acquired sepsis, impact of HIV infection, BSI trends and antimicrobial resistance. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed paediatric BSI (0-14 years) at Tygerberg Children's Hospital between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2013 (excluding neonatal wards). Laboratory and hospital data were used to determine BSI rates, blood culture contamination, pathogen profile, patient demographics, antimicrobial resistance and factors associated with mortality. Fluconazole resistant Candida species, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae were classified as antimicrobial resistant pathogens. RESULTS: Of 17001 blood cultures over 6 years, 935 cultures isolated 979 pathogens (5.5% yield; 95% CI 5.3-5.7%). Contamination rates were high (6.6%, 95% CI 6.4-6.8%), increasing over time (p = 0.003). Discrete BSI episodes were identified (n = 864) with median patient age of 7.5 months, male predominance (57%) and 13% HIV prevalence. BSI rates declined significantly over time (4.6-3.1, overall rate 3.5 per 1000 patient days; 95% CI 3.3-3.7; Chi square for trend p = 0.02). Gram negative pathogens predominated (60% vs 33% Gram positives and 7% fungal); Klebsiella pneumoniae (154; 17%), Staphylococcus aureus (131; 14%) and Escherichia coli (97; 11%) were most prevalent. Crude BSI mortality was 20% (176/864); HIV infection, fungal, Gram negative and hospital-acquired sepsis were significantly associated with mortality on multivariate analysis. Hospital-acquired BSI was common (404/864; 47%). Overall antimicrobial resistance rates were high (70% in hospital vs 25% in community-acquired infections; p < 0.0001); hospital-acquired infection, infancy, HIV-infection and Gram negative sepsis were associated with resistance. S. pneumoniae BSI declined significantly over time (58/465 [12.5%] to 33/399 [8.3%]; p =0.04). CONCLUSION: Although BSI rates declined over time, children with BSI had high mortality and pathogens exhibited substantial antimicrobial resistance in both community and hospital-acquired infections. Blood culture sampling technique and local options for empiric antimicrobial therapy require re-evaluation.
TI  - Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in veterinary medicine--emergence of  an underestimated pathogen?
AB  - The proportion of multidrug resistant bacteria causing infections in animals has  continuously been increasing. While the relevance of ESBL (extended spectrum beta-lactamase)-producing Enterobacteriaceae spp. and MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus) is unquestionable, knowledge about multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in veterinary medicine is scarce. This is a worrisome situation, as A. baumannii are isolated from veterinary clinical specimens with rising frequency. The remarkable ability of A. baumannii to develop multidrug resistance and the high risk of transmission are known in human medicine for years. Despite this, data regarding A. baumannii isolates of animal origin are missing. Due to the changing role of companion animals with closer contact between animal and owner, veterinary intensive care medicine is steadily developing. It can be assumed that the number of "high risk" patients with an enhanced risk for hospital acquired infections will be rising simultaneously. Thus, development and spread of multidrug resistant pathogens is envisioned to rise. It is possible, that A. baumannii will evolve into a veterinary nosocomial pathogen similar to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and MRSA. The lack of attention paid to A. baumannii in veterinary medicine is even more worrying, as first reports indicate a transmission between humans and animals. Essential questions regarding the role of livestock, especially as a potential source of multidrug resistant isolates, remain unanswered. This review summarizes the current knowledge on A. baumannii in veterinary medicine for the first time. It underlines the utmost significance of further investigations of A. baumannii animal isolates, particularly concerning epidemiology and resistance mechanisms.
TI  - Kibdelomycin is a bactericidal broad-spectrum aerobic antibacterial agent.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics continues to grow and pose serious challenges, while the discovery rate for new antibiotics declines. Kibdelomycin is a recently discovered natural-product antibiotic that inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting the bacterial DNA replication enzymes DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV. It was reported to be a broad-spectrum aerobic Gram-positive agent with selective inhibition of the anaerobic bacterium Clostridium difficile. We have extended the profiling of kibdelomycin by using over 196 strains of Gram-positive and Gram-negative aerobic pathogens recovered from worldwide patient populations. We report the MIC50s, MIC90s, and bactericidal activities of kibdelomycin. We confirm the Gram-positive spectrum and report for the first time that kibdelomycin shows strong activity (MIC90, 0.125 mug/ml) against clinical strains of the Gram-negative nonfermenter Acinetobacter baumannii but only weak activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. We confirm that well-characterized resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae show no cross-resistance to kibdelomycin and quinolones and coumarin antibiotics. We also show that kibdelomycin is not subject to efflux in Pseudomonas, though it is in Escherichia coli, and it is generally affected by the outer membrane permeability entry barrier in the nonfermenters P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, which may be addressable by structure-based chemical modification.
TI  - Bioburden Increases Heterotopic Ossification Formation in an Established Rat Model.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Heterotopic ossification (HO) develops in a majority of combat-related amputations wherein early bacterial colonization has been considered a potential early risk factor. Our group has recently developed a small animal model of trauma-induced HO that incorporates many of the multifaceted injury patterns of combat trauma in the absence of bacterial contamination and subsequent wound colonization. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: We sought to determine if (1) the presence of bioburden (Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]) increases the magnitude of ectopic bone formation in traumatized muscle after amputation; and (2) what persistent effects bacterial contamination has on late microbial flora within the amputation site. METHODS: Using a blast-related HO model, we exposed 48 rats to blast overpressure, femur fracture, crush injury, and subsequent immediate transfemoral amputation through the zone of injury. Control injured rats (n = 8) were inoculated beneath the myodesis with phosphate-buffered saline not containing bacteria (vehicle) and treatment rats were inoculated with 1 x 106 colony-forming units of A baumannii (n = 20) or MRSA (n = 20). All animals formed HO. Heterotopic ossification was determined by quantitative volumetric measurements of ectopic bone at 12-weeks postinjury using micro-CT and qualitative histomorphometry for assessment of new bone formation in the residual limb. Bone marrow and muscle tissue biopsies were collected from the residual limb at 12 weeks to quantitatively measure the bioburden load and to qualitatively determine the species-level identification of the bacterial flora. RESULTS: At 12 weeks, we observed a greater volume of HO in rats infected with MRSA (68.9 +/- 8.6 mm3; 95% confidence interval [CI], 50.52-85.55) when compared with A baumannii (20.9 +/- 3.7 mm3; 95% CI, 13.61-28.14; p < 0.001) or vehicle (16.3 +/- 3.2 mm3; 95% CI, 10.06-22.47; p < 0.001). Soft tissue and marrow from the residual limb of rats inoculated with A baumannii tested negative for A baumannii infection but were positive for other strains of bacteria (1.33 x 102 +/- 0.89 x 102; 95% CI, -0.42 x 102-3.08 x 102 and 1.25 x 106 +/- 0.69 x 106; 95% CI, -0.13 x 106-2.60 x 106 colony-forming units in bone marrow and muscle tissue, respectively), whereas tissue from MRSA-infected rats contained MRSA only (4.84 x 101 +/- 3.22 x 101; 95% CI, -1.47 x 101-11.1 x 101 and 2.80 x 107 +/- 1.73 x 107; 95% CI, -0.60 x 107-6.20 x 107 in bone marrow and muscle tissue, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that persistent infection with MRSA results in a greater volume of ectopic bone formation, which may be the result of chronic soft tissue inflammation, and that early wound colonization may be a key risk factor. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Interventions that mitigate wound contamination and inflammation (such as early debridement, systemic and local antibiotics) may also have a beneficial effect with regard to the mitigation of HO formation and should be evaluated with that potential in mind in future preclinical studies.
TI  - [Bacteriological aspects of catheter cultures: study over 24 months].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Catheter-related infections are the sixth leading cause of nosocomial infections with approximately 7% of cases. AIM: The aim of this work was to establish the bacterial epidemiology of the catheter and TIC culture (totally implantable catheter) at the Mohamed V Military Teaching Hospital (MVHMI), and to study the antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria isolated. METHODS: this is a retrospective study over 24 months, including the venous and arterial catheters as well as the TIC treated at the Microbiology laboratory of the MVHMI. The culture was realized by the quantitative Brun Buisson method. The antibiotic susceptibility was made according to the French Society guidelines. RESULTS: We have collected 282 cases with 255 catheters and 27 TIC. The significant rate culture was 51,42% (n=145) for catheters and TIC, including 90,43% catheters and 9,57% TIC. These catheters and TIC with positive culture emanated primarily from hemodialysis (32,41%) and surgical intensive care unit (28,97%) services. The microorganisms distribution by species showed the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus (15,91%) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (14,77%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7,39%). The meticilline resistance rate in Staphylococcus aureus was 7,14%. The Acinetobacter baumannii resistance rate was 64%, and 80,8% for imipenem and ceftazidime respectively. The rate of resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to imipenem and ceftazidime was 69.23% for each. CONCLUSION: The bacterial epidemiology of the catheters and TIC cultures is dominated by the potentially nosocomial bacteria. Multidrug resistance of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa requires an improved catheters management and strengthening nosocomial infections prevention.
TI  - Arbekacin Activity against Contemporary Clinical Bacteria Isolated from Patients  Hospitalized with Pneumonia.
AB  - Arbekacin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside licensed for systemic use in Japan and under clinical development as an inhalation solution in the United States. We evaluated the occurrence of organisms isolated from pneumonias in U.S. hospitalized patients (PHP), including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), and the in vitro activity of arbekacin. Organism frequency was evaluated from a collection of 2,203 bacterial isolates (339 from VAP) consecutively collected from 25 medical centers in 2012 through the SENTRY Antimicrobial Surveillance Program. Arbekacin activity was tested against 904 isolates from PHP collected in 2012 from 62 U.S. medical centers and 303 multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms collected worldwide in 2009 and 2010 from various infection types. Susceptibility to arbekacin and comparator agents was evaluated by the reference broth microdilution method. The four most common organisms from PHP were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp., and Enterobacter spp. The highest arbekacin MIC among S. aureus isolates from PHP (43% methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) was 4 mug/ml. Among P. aeruginosa isolates from PHP, only one had an arbekacin MIC of >16 mug/ml (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 and 4 mug/ml), and susceptibility rates for gentamicin, tobramycin, and amikacin were 88.0, 90.0, and 98.0%, respectively. Arbekacin (MIC50, 2 mug/ml) and tobramycin (MIC50, 4 mug/ml) were the most potent aminoglycosides tested against Acinetobacter baumannii. Against Enterobacteriaceae from PHP, arbekacin and gentamicin (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 to 1 and 1 to 8 mug/ml for both compounds) were generally more potent than tobramycin (MIC50 and MIC90, 0.25 to 2 and 1 to 32 mug/ml) and amikacin (MIC50 and MIC90, 1 to 2 and 2 to 32 mug/ml). Arbekacin also demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a worldwide collection of well-characterized MDR Gram-negative and MRSA strains.
TI  - Non-aqueous glycerol monolaurate gel exhibits antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Skin and surgical infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are causes of patient morbidity and increased healthcare costs. These organisms grow planktonically and as biofilms, and many strains exhibit antibiotic resistance. This study examines the antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of glycerol monolaurate (GML), as solubilized in a non-aqueous vehicle (5% GML Gel), as a novel, broadly-active topical antimicrobial. The FDA has designated GML as generally recognized as safe for human use, and the compound is commonly used in the cosmetic and food industries. METHODS: In vitro, bacterial strains in broths and biofilms were exposed to GML Gel, and effects on bacterial colony-forming units (CFUs) were assessed. In vivo,subcutaneous incisions were made in New Zealand white rabbits; the incisions were closed with four sutures. Bacterial strains were painted onto the incision sites, and then GML Gel or placebo was liberally applied to cover the sites completely. Rabbits were allowed to awaken and were examined for CFUs as a function of exposure time. RESULTS: In vitro, GML Gel was bactericidal for all broth culture and biofilm organisms in <1 hour and <4 hour, respectively; no CFUs were detected after the entire 24 h test period. In vivo, GML Gel inhibited bacterial growth in the surgical incision sites, compared to no growth inhibition in controls. GML Gel significantly reduced inflammation, as viewed by lack of redness in and below the incision sites. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that 5% GML Gel is useful as a potent topical antibacterial and anti-inflammatory agent for prevention of infections.
TI  - White and blue light induce reduction in susceptibility to minocycline and tigecycline in Acinetobacter spp. and other bacteria of clinical importance.
AB  - Minocycline (MIN) and tigecycline (TIG) are antibiotics currently used for treatment of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. In this work, we show that blue light, as well as white light, modulates susceptibility to these antibiotics in a temperature-dependent manner. The modulation of susceptibility by light depends on the content of iron; an increase in iron results in a reduction in antibiotic susceptibility both under light and in the dark, though the effect is more pronounced in the latter condition. We further provide insights into the mechanism by showing that reduction in susceptibility to MIN and TIG induced by light is likely triggered by the generation of (1)O2, which, by a yet unknown mechanism, would ultimately lead to the activation of resistance genes such as those coding for the efflux pump AdeABC. The clinical relevance of these results may lie in surface-exposed wound infections, given the exposure to light in addition to the relatively low temperatures recorded in this type of lesion. We further show that the modulation of antibiotic susceptibility occurs not only in Acinetobacter baumannii but also in other micro-organisms of clinical relevance such as Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. Overall, our findings allow us to suggest that MIN and TIG antibiotic treatments may be improved by the inclusion of an iron chelator, in addition to keeping the wounds in the dark, a condition that would increase the effectiveness in the control of infections involving these micro-organisms.
TI  - Characterization of a potential beta-lactamase inhibitory metabolite from a marine Streptomyces sp. PM49 active against multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Actinobacteria is a prolific producer of complex natural products; we isolated a  potential marine Streptomyces sp. PM49 strain from Bay of Bengal coastal area of India. The strain PM49 exhibited highly efficient antibacterial properties on multidrug-resistant pathogens with a zone of inhibition of 14-17 mm. SSF was adopted for the production of the secondary metabolites from PM49 with ISP2; utilizing agricultural wastes for compound extraction was also attempted. Bioactive fraction of Rf value 0.69 resolved using chloroform and ethyl acetate (1:1, v/v) was obtained and subjected to further analysis. Based on UV, IR, ESI-MS, and (1)H and (13)C NMR spectral analysis, it was revealed that the compound is closely similar to cyslabdan with a molecular mass of 467.66 corresponding to the molecular formula C25H41NO5S. ESBL and MBL production was screened in the hospital test isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. PCR amplification in the phenotypically positive strains was positive for bla IMP, bla SHV, bla CTX-M, and mec genes. The beta-lactamase enzyme from tested strains had cephalosporinase activity with a 31-kDa protein and isolated compound from the strain possessing beta-lactamase inhibitory potential. MIC of the active fraction was 16-32 mug/ml on ATCC strains; the ceftazidime and meropenem sensitive and resistant test strains showed MIC of 64-256 mug/ml. The Streptomyces sp. PM49 aerial mycelium was rectiflexibile; the 16S rRNA showed 99 % identity with Streptomyces rochei and submitted at Genbank with accession no JX904061.1.
TI  - Hydrophilic/hydrophobic characters of antimicrobial peptides derived from animals and their effects on multidrug resistant clinical isolates.
AB  - Multidrug resistant (MDR) pathogen infections are serious threats to hospitalized patients because of the limited therapeutic options. A novel group of antibiotic candidates, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs), have recently shown powerful activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Unfortunately, the viability of using these AMPs in clinical settings remains to be seen, since most still need to be evaluated prior to clinical trials and not all of AMPs are potent against MDR clinical isolates. To find a connection between the characteristics of several of these AMPs and their effects against MDR pathogens, we selected 14 AMPs of animal origin with typical structures and evaluated their in vitro activities against clinical strains of extensive drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa and extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli. Our results showed that these peptides' hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics, rather than their secondary structures, may explain their antibacterial effects on these clinical isolates. Peptides that are amphipathic along the longitudinal direction seemed to be effective against Gram-negative pathogens, while peptides with hydrophilic terminals separated by a hydrophobic intermediate section appeared to be effective against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Among these, cathelicidin-BF was found to inhibit all of the Gram-negative pathogens tested at dosages of no more than 16 mg/L, killing a pandrug-resistant A. baumannii strain within 2 h at 4xMICs and 4 h at 2xMICs. Tachyplesin III was also found capable of inhibiting all Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens tested at no more than 16 mg/L, and similarly killed the same A. baumannii strain within 4 h at 4xMICs and 2xMICs. These results suggest that both cathelicidin-BF and tachyplesin III are likely viable targets for the development of AMPs for clinical uses.
TI  - Potentiation of antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation mediated by a cationic fullerene by added iodide: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation with fullerenes bearing cationic charges may overcome resistant microbes. METHODS & RESULTS: We synthesized C60-fullerene (LC16) bearing decaquaternary chain and deca-tertiary-amino groups that facilitates electron-transfer reactions via the photoexcited fullerene. Addition of the harmless salt, potassium iodide (10 mM) potentiated the ultraviolet A (UVA) or white light-mediated killing of Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and fungal yeast Candida albicans by 1-2+ logs. Mouse model infected with bioluminescent Acinetobacter baumannii gave increased loss of bioluminescence when iodide (10 mM) was combined with LC16 and UVA/white light. CONCLUSION: The mechanism may involve photoinduced electron reduction of (1)(C60>)* or (3)(C60>)* by iodide producing I. or I2 followed by subsequent intermolecular electron-transfer events of (C60>)-. to produce reactive radicals.
TI  - Spectral and biological evaluation of a synthetic antimicrobial peptide derived from 1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid.
AB  - Ac-GF(A6c)G(A6c)K(A6c)G(A6c)F(A6c)G(A6c)GK(A6c)KKKK-amide (A6c=1-aminocyclohexane carboxylic acid) is a synthetic antimicrobial peptide (AMP) that exhibits in vitro inhibitory activity against drug resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterococcus faecium at concentrations ranging from 10.9 to 43muM. Spectroscopic investigations were conducted to determine how this AMP interacts with simple membrane model systems in order to provide insight into possible mechanisms of action. CD and 2D-(1)H NMR experiments indicated this AMP on binding to SDS and DPC micelles adopts conformations with varying percentages of helical and random coil conformers. CD investigations in the presence of three phospholipid SUVs consisting of POPC, 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC revealed: (1) The interactions occurring with POPC SUVs have minimal effect on the conformational diversity of the AMP yielding conformations similar to those observed in buffer. (2) The interactions with 4:1 POPC/POPG, and 60% POPE/21%POPG/19%POPC SUVs exhibited a greater influence on the percentage of different conformers contributing to the CD spectra. (3) The presence of a high of percentage of helical conformers was not observed in the presence of SUVs as was the case with micelles. This data indicates that the diversity of surface bound conformations adopted by this AMP are very different from the diversity of conformations adopted by this AMP on insertion into the lipid bilayer. CD spectra of this AMP in the presence of SUVs consisting of LPS isolated from P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and Escherichia coli exhibited characteristics associated with various helical conformations.
TI  - Chlorine dioxide is a superior disinfectant against multi-drug resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the antibacterial activity of chlorine dioxide (ClO2) compared with sodium hypochlorite (NaClO) on various multidrug-resistant strains in the presence of bovine serum albumin and sheep erythrocytes to mimic the frequent blood contamination in clinical environment. The 3 most important species causing nosocomial infections, i.e., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRA) were evaluated, with 3 representative strains from each. At a 10 ppm-concentration, ClO2 drastically reduced the number of all MDRP and MDRA, and 2 out of 3 MRSA strains, but NaClO was unable to cause any remarkable attenuation for any of the 9 strains tested in 60 seconds. Increased concentration of 100 ppm enabled ClO2 to completely kill MRSA strains, whereas NaClO failed to significantly lower the number of 2 MRSA and 1 MDRA strains. A time-course experiment demonstrated that, within 15 seconds, 100 ppm of ClO2 could kill completely all tested strains but NaClO at this concentration failed to do so. Together, these data suggest that ClO2 is more effective than NaClO against MRSA, MDRP and MDRA, and 100 ppm could be a practical concentration of ClO2 against these multidrug-resistant strains, which may cause fatal nosocomial infections.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia: epidemiology and prognostic indicators of 30-day mortality.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective cohort study in the medical intensive care unit of Chaing Mai University Hospital to describe the epidemiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and identify prognostic indicators of 30-day VAP mortality. A total of 621 patients diagnosed with VAP between January 2005 and December 2011 were included. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 44.4%. The major causative pathogens were Acinetobacter baumannii (54.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.2%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (15.1%). Most A. baumannii (90.2%) comprised drug-resistant strains. Identified prognostic indicators were co-morbid malignancy (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.60; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-2.42; P = 0.040), septic shock (HR = 2.51; 95% CI, 1.60-4.00; P < 0.001), Simplified Acute Physiology Score II >45 (HR = 1.62; 95% CI, 1.03-2.56; P = 0.041), Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score >5 (HR = 3.40; 95% CI 2.00-5.81; P < 0.001), and delayed inappropriate empirical antibiotic treatment (HR = 2.23; 95% CI, 1.12-4.45; P = 0.022). VAP was associated with high mortality. The major causative pathogen was drug-resistant A. baumannii. Therefore, early detection of VAP by surveillance in mechanically ventilated patients leading to earlier treatment may improve patient outcomes. Guidelines for prescribing appropriate empirical antibiotics to cover drug-resistant bacteria could be established using local epidemiological data.
TI  - A longitudinal assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility among important pathogens collected as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) in France between 2004 and 2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinically important Gram-positive and -negative isolates were collected from patients in France between 2004 and 2012 as a part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial. METHODS: MICs were determined using methodology described by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: In total, 17,135 isolates were contributed by 29 medical centres; respiratory (25.1%) and cardiovascular (20.3%) sources predominated. High susceptibility was observed among Enterococcus spp. and Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA]) to linezolid (100%), tigecycline (>/=99.8%) and vancomycin (>/=94.6%). The percentage of MRSA decreased from 34.3% in 2004 to 20.0% in 2009 before increasing to 34.7% in 2012. Vancomycin, linezolid, levofloxacin and carbapenems were highly active (>/=99.6%) against Streptococcus pneumoniae; 3.2% were PRSP. Escherichia coli showed peak susceptibility to the carbapenems (>/=99.9%), tigecycline (99.3%) and amikacin (97.9%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in susceptibility were observed for ampicillin, cefepime and ceftriaxone between 2004 and 2012. ESBL production among E. coli increased from 3.0% (2004) to 14.9% (2012). High susceptibility was noted among Haemophilus influenzae to levofloxacin (100%), amoxicillin-clavulanate (99.2%), carbapenems (>/=98.7%) and ceftriaxone (98.5%); beta-lactamase production fluctuated with no notable trend between 18.1% (2007) and 27.7% (2011). Klebsiella spp. were highly susceptible to carbapenems (>/=99.6%) and amikacin (>/=96.4%); significant (p < 0.01) decreases in amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefepime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, piperacillin-tazobactam and tigecycline susceptibility were observed among K. pneumoniae between 2004 and 2012. Only imipenem was highly active (96.5% susceptible) against Acinetobacter baumannii. Imipenem and amikacin (87.7% and 87.1% susceptible) were the most active agents against P. aeruginosa; 10.2% of isolates were categorized as multidrug resistant. CONCLUSIONS: Carbapenems, linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin conserved good in vitro activity against most pathogens (according to their spectrum of activity) in France between 2004 and 2012.
TI  - Evaluation of the efficacy of akacid plus(R) fogging in eradicating causative microorganism in nosocomial infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The novel polymeric guanidine Akacid Plus(R) is a member of the cationic family of disinfectants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the activity of Akacid Plus(R) against bacteria which cause nosocomial infections and remain viable after contaminating the environment and determine the effects of organic materials to the activity. METHODS: Closed room and control room were created for experimental disinfection. Bacterial suspensions of 0.5 McFarland were prepared from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and vancomycine-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE) strains. A 0.1 mL of each suspension was applied on the chipboard (25 cm(2)) and tile (25 cm(2)) test surfaces without albumin and with 2% albumin to simulate organic dirt, and the test surfaces were placed in the test and control rooms after drying. Before testing, cotton swab premoistened with serum physiologic was used to obtain samples from various surfaces in the environment and the samples were transferred onto 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37 degrees C. Akacid Plus(R) solution at a concentration of 0.5% was nebulized with an aerosol applicator (Prowi-06, Germany) for 45 minutes. After a 2-hour waiting period, 1 mL neutralizing broth (Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth, Fluka) was transferred on the test surfaces, and samples were collected with a swab from the test surfaces and various surfaces in the testing room and inoculated on 5% sheep blood agar for incubation at 37oC for 24 hours. At the end of the incubation period, number of colonies were evaluated on the control and test plates. RESULTS: Although coagulase-negative staphylococci, Bacillus spp., and fungi were grown in cultured samples obtained from the environment of experimental laboratory, no growth was observed in the test plates after room disinfection with Akacid Plus(R). After room disinfection, MRSA and A. baumannii were not detectable in the cultured media prepared from the test surfaces with or without albumin. The bacterial count for vancomyine-resistant E. faecium was reduced from 10(7) to 5x10(2) on surfaces without albumin and from 10(7) to 2.5x10(3) on surfaces with albumin. All test plates prepared from the surfaces in the control room showed abundant growth of the microorganism. CONCLUSION: The nebulization of Akacid plus(R) solution at a concentration of 0.5% proved to be an efficient means of disinfection for the removal of pathogenic microorganisms that cause hospital outbreaks and use of isolation measures.
TI  - Rates of susceptibility of carbapenems, ceftobiprole, and colistin against clinically important bacteria collected from intensive care units in 2007: Results from the Surveillance of Multicenter Antimicrobial Resistance in Taiwan (SMART).
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on susceptibility to ceftobiprole and colistin, and the complete evolutionary trends of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of important carbapenem agents among important pathogens collected in intensive care units (ICUs) in Taiwan are lacking. METHODS: We surveyed the MIC distribution patterns of ceftobiprole and colistin and susceptibility profiles of some important pathogens collected from patients hospitalized in intensive care units (ICUs) of major teaching hospitals throughout Taiwan in 2007. We also investigated the rates of nonsusceptibility to powerful carbapenems (imipenem, meropenem) among four important species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Proteus mirabilis) collected during the same period. MIC breakpoints recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute in 2014 were applied. RESULTS: Colistin showed excellent in vitro activity (susceptibility rate, 96%) against Acinetobacter baumannii isolates but moderate (73-77% susceptibility rate) activity against isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and E. cloacae. The ceftobiprole MIC90 value was 4 mug/mL for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 16 mug/mL for P. aeruginosa. The phenotype of methicillin resistance did not markedly increase the MIC value of ceftobiprole among S. aureus isolates. Interestingly, the proportion of isolates that displayed nonsusceptibility to imipenem was significantly higher among P. mirabilis isolates than among isolates of the other three Enterobacteriaceae species, regardless of the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase. CONCLUSION: Continuous monitoring of susceptibility profiles of ICU pathogens to important antibiotics is warranted to provide appropriate antimicrobial regimens against infections in the ICU.
TI  - Epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections caused by acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Acinetobacter baumannii is a frequent cause of infections in hospitals around the world, which is very difficult to control and treat. It is particularly prevalent in intensive care wards. AIM: The main objective of the research was to establish the application of epidemiological monitoring of nosocomial infections (NIs) caused by A. baumannii in order to determine: the type and distribution of NIs, and to investigate antimicrobial drug resistance of A. baumannii. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 855 patients treated at the Clinic of Anesthesiology and Reanimation, University Clinical Center Tuzla during 2013 were followed prospectively for the development of NIs. Infections caused by A. baumannii were characterized by the anatomical site and antibiotics resistance profile. RESULTS: NIs were registered in 105 patients (12.3%; 855/105). The predominant cause of infection was A. baumannii with an incidence of 51.4% (54/105), followed by ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae with 15.2% (16/105) of cases, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus with 8.6% (9/105), and ESBL-producing Proteus mirabilis with 7.6% (8/105). According to the anatomical site, and type of NIs caused by A. baumannii, the most frequent were respiratory infections (74.1%; 40/54). Infections of surgical sites were registered in 11.1% (6/54) of cases, while bloodstream infections in 9.2% (5/54). A. baumannii isolates tested resistant against most antibiotics examined, but showed a high degree of susceptibility to tobramycin (87%; 47/54) and colistin (100%; 54/54). CONCLUSION: The increasing incidence of multi- and extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter spp. emphasizes the importance of administration of an adequate antibiotic strategy and the implementation of strict monitoring of the measures for controlling nosocomial infections.
TI  - Efficiency of hydrogen peroxide in improving disinfection of ICU rooms.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary objective of this study was to determine the efficiency of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) techniques in disinfection of ICU rooms contaminated with multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) after patient discharge. Secondary objectives included comparison of the efficiency of a vaporizator (HPV, Bioquell(R)) and an aerosolizer using H2O2, and peracetic acid (aHPP, Anios(R)) in MDRO environmental disinfection, and assessment of toxicity of these techniques. METHODS: This prospective cross-over study was conducted in five medical and surgical ICUs located in one University hospital, during a 12-week period. Routine terminal cleaning was followed by H2O2 disinfection. A total of 24 environmental bacteriological samplings were collected per room, from eight frequently touched surfaces, at three time-points: after patient discharge (T0), after terminal cleaning (T1) and after H2O2 disinfection (T2). RESULTS: In total 182 rooms were studied, including 89 (49%) disinfected with aHPP and 93 (51%) with HPV. At T0, 15/182 (8%) rooms were contaminated with at least 1 MDRO (extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli 50%, imipenem resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 29%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 17%, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime or imipenem 4%). Routine terminal cleaning reduced environmental bacterial load (P <0.001) without efficiency on MDRO (15/182 (8%) rooms at T0 versus 11/182 (6%) at T1; P = 0.371). H2O2 technologies were efficient for environmental MDRO decontamination (6% of rooms contaminated with MDRO at T1 versus 0.5% at T2, P = 0.004). Patient characteristics were similar in aHPP and HPV groups. No significant difference was found between aHPP and HPV regarding the rate of rooms contaminated with MDRO at T2 (P = 0.313). 42% of room occupants were MDRO carriers. The highest rate of rooms contaminated with MDRO was found in rooms where patients stayed for a longer period of time, and where a patient with MDRO was hospitalized. The residual concentration of H2O2 appears to be higher using aHPP, compared with HPV. CONCLUSIONS: H2O2 treatment is efficient in reducing MDRO contaminated rooms in the ICU. No significant difference was found between aHPP and HPV regarding their disinfection efficiency.
TI  - Application of whole-genome sequencing for bacterial strain typing in molecular epidemiology.
AB  - Nosocomial infections pose a significant threat to patient health; however, the gold standard laboratory method for determining bacterial relatedness (pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [PFGE]) remains essentially unchanged 20 years after its introduction. Here, we explored bacterial whole-genome sequencing (WGS) as an alternative approach for molecular strain typing. We compared WGS to PFGE for investigating presumptive outbreaks involving three important pathogens: vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (n=19), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=17), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=15). WGS was highly reproducible (average</=0.39 differences between technical replicates), which enabled a functional, quantitative definition for determining clonality. Strain relatedness data determined by PFGE and WGS roughly correlated, but the resolution of WGS was superior (P=5.6x10(-8) to 0.016). Several discordant results were noted between the methods. A total of 28.9% of isolates which were indistinguishable by PFGE were nonclonal by WGS. For A. baumannii, a species known to undergo rapid horizontal gene transfer, 16.2% of isolate pairs considered nonidentical by PFGE were clonal by WGS. Sequencing whole bacterial genomes with single-nucleotide resolution demonstrates that PFGE is prone to false-positive and false-negative results and suggests the need for a new gold standard approach for molecular epidemiological strain typing.
TI  - [Analyses of microbiology and antibiotic susceptibility in prosthetic knee infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the microbiological etiology of prosthetic knee infections  during two-staged revision and analyze antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria so as to provide clinical recommendations for empiric antibiotic therapy. METHODS: A retrospective review was performed for 78 hospitalized patients for prothetic knee infections undergoing two-staged revision between January 1, 2007 and February 28, 2014.Suspicious intra-operative tissues were collected and cultured. Microbiological data sets and antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Micro-organisms were isolated from 65 patients. The negative culture rate was 16.7%. The most common genus encountered was Gram-positive isolates (75.7%), followed by Gram-negative isolates (20.5%) and fungi isolates (2.7%). Polymicrobialinfections accounted for 15.4% of patients. The most common causative organism of infection was coagulase-negative staphylococci (46.6%) and followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.5%). The detection rate of methicillin-resistant staphylococcus(MRS) was 34.3% (25/73) and it accounted for 47.5% of staphylococcus.Gram-negative isolates were dominated by Escherichia coli (4/15) and Acinetobacter baumannii (4/15). All A.baumanniiscame from polymicrobial infection. Coagulase-negative staphylococci and A. baumannii were the most common causative organisms of polymicrobial infection. The results of antibiotic susceptibility showed cefazolin and cefuroxime were poorly susceptible to isolates. The drug resistance rates were 43.5% and 53.6%.Some third or fourth generation cephalosporins also have problems of bacterial resistance.Some antibiotics such as vancomycin, linezolid, imipenem, rifampin, cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin had high rates of drug sensitivity. CONCLUSION: Most infections are caused by staphylococci. The proportion of isolated MRS is high.Empiric prophylacticantibiotics therapy may include vancomycin and cefoperazone/sulbactam to cover Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.Empiric therapeutic antibiotics therapy includes vancomycin and carbapenems. After the results of antibiotic susceptibility, antibiotics should be timely adjusted.
TI  - End group modification: Efficient tool for improving activity of antimicrobial peptide analogues towards Gram-positive bacteria.
AB  - Increased incidence of infections with multidrug-resistant bacterial strains warrants an intensive search for novel potential antimicrobial agents. Here, an antimicrobial peptide analogue with a cationic/hydrophobic alternating design displaying only moderate activity against Gram-positive pathogens was optimized. Generally, introduction of hydrophobic moieties at the N-terminus resulted in analogues with remarkably increased activity against multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecium. Interestingly, the potency against Escherichia coli strains was unaffected, whereas modification with hydrophobic moieties led to increased activity towards the Gram-negative Acinetobacter baumannii. Despite increased cytotoxicity against murine fibroblasts and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, the optimized peptide analogues exhibited significantly improved cell selectivity. Overall, the most favorable hydrophobic activity-inducing moieties were found to be cyclohexylacetyl and pentafluorophenylacetyl groups, while the presence of a short PEG-like chain had no significant effect on activity. Introduction of cationic moieties conferred no effect or merely a moderate activity-promoting effect to the analogues.
TI  - [A study on the epidemic of pneumonia among children in Ningbo City, Zhejiang province, 2009-2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the epidemiological characteristics and the bacterial pathogen composition of pneumonia among children under 5 years old in Ningbo. METHODS: In 2013 February-April, we selected pediatric ward in three hospitals according to stratified cluster random sampling, and from which we collected all 57 556 hospitalized cases in January 2009-December 2012 period of children under 5 years old. A total of 16 740 medical records and bacterial spectrum records of pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia cases among children under 5 years old were described to calculate the proportions of children pneumonia or bronchial pneumonia hospitalized cases accounted for hospitalized children over the same period(referred to as proportions of pneumonia incidence), the detection rate of bacterial pathogens, proportions of bacterial spectrum, and to analyze the characteristics and bacterial pathogen composition of pneumonia among children under 5 years. RESULTS: The proportions of children pneumonia in 2009-2012 were 26.16% (2 882/11 017), 31.23% (4 004/12 819), 29.35% (4 898/16 689) and 29.10% (4 956/17 031)(Z = 3.13, P < 0.01), and were in a downward trend by the increasing of age(Z = -113.74, P < 0.01). The proportions of children pneumonia of 0-5 age group were 50.71% (6 756/13 318), 26.60% (3 159/11 877), 24.17% (2 574 /10 648), 22.36% (2 509 /11 223) and 16.63% (1 745 /10 490). The proportions of children pneumonia with different season were 26.90% (3 725/13 850), 26.51% (3 788/14 287), 29.59% (4 442/15 011) and 33.21% (4 785 /14 408) (chi(2) = 198.77, P < 0.01). The proportions of severe children pneumonia of 0-5 age group were 1.10% (74/6 753), 0.47% (15/3 159), 0.19% (5 /2 574),0.08% (2 /2 509) and 0.06% (1 /1 745), with a downward trend by the age(F = 57.62, P < 0.01). The detection rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae,Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus pneumoniae was 19.3% (540/2 805), 16.4% (460/2 805), 13.6% (381/2 805), 11.9% (335/2 805), 11.5% (323/2 805) and 6.8% (192/2 805). CONCLUSION: In 2009-2012, the proportions of children pneumonia under 5 year old constituted a relatively high proportion in Ningbo city. Children under 1 year old were the major suffering group of pneumonia and severe pneumonia, which should be the key prevention group. The major bacterial pathogens of children's pneumonia in Ningbo are gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - The ongoing revolution of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry for microbiology reaches tropical Africa.
AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) represents a revolution in routine pathogen identification in clinical microbiology laboratories. A MALDI-TOF MS was introduced to tropical Africa in the clinical microbiology laboratory of the Hopital Principal de Dakar (Senegal) and used for routine pathogen identification. Using MS, 2,429 bacteria and fungi isolated from patients were directly assayed, leading to the identification of 2,082 bacteria (85.7%) and 206 fungi (8.5%) at the species level, 109 bacteria (4.5%) at the genus level, and 16 bacteria (0.75%) at the family level. Sixteen isolates remained unidentified (0.75%). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent species (25.8%) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (14.8%), Streptococcus agalactiae (6.2%), Acinetobacter baumannii (6.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (5.9%). MALDI-TOF MS has also enabled the detection of rare bacteria and fungi. MALDI-TOF MS is a powerful tool for the identification of bacterial and fungal species involved in infectious diseases in tropical Africa.
TI  - Evaluation of hydrogen peroxide vapor for the inactivation of nosocomial pathogens on porous and nonporous surfaces.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clostridium difficile spores and multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, are important nosocomial pathogens that are difficult to eliminate from the hospital environment. We evaluated the efficacy of hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV), a no-touch automated room decontamination system, for the inactivation of a range of pathogens dried onto hard nonporous and porous surfaces in an operating room (OR). METHODS: Stainless steel and cotton carriers containing >4 log10 viable MRSA, VRE, or MDR A baumannii were placed at 4 locations in the OR along with 7 pouched 6 log10Geobacillus stearothermophilus spore biologic indicators (BIs). HPV was then used to decontaminate the OR. The experiment was repeated 3 times. RESULTS: HPV inactivated all spore BIs (>6 log10 reduction), and no MRSA, VRE, or MDR A baumannii were recovered from the stainless steel and cotton carriers (>4-5 log10 reduction, depending on the starting inoculum). HPV was equally effective at all carrier locations. We did not identify any difference in efficacy for microbes dried onto stainless steel or cotton surfaces, indicating that HPV may have a role in the decontamination of both porous and nonporous surfaces. CONCLUSION: HPV is an effective way to decontaminate clinical areas where contamination with bacterial spores and MDR organisms is suspected.
TI  - Drug resistance and molecular epidemiology of aerobic bacteria isolated from puerperal infections in bangladesh.
AB  - Puerperal infection is a common complication during postnatal period in developing countries. Bacterial species, drug resistance, and genetic characteristics were investigated for a total of 470 isolates from puerperal infections in Bangladesh for a 2-year period (2010-2012). The most common species was Escherichia coli (n=98), followed by Enterococcus faecalis (n=54), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (n=33), Proteus mirabilis (n=32), Staphylococcus aureus (n=27), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=22), and Enterobacter cloacae (n=21). S. aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii were isolated at a higher frequency from wound infections after cesarean section, while E. coli, E. cloacae, and K. pneumoniae were isolated from community-acquired endometritis and urinary tract infections. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was frequent for Enterobacteriacae, and was mainly mediated by blaCTX-M-1 group beta-lactamases. The CTX-M gene in E. coli from the four phylogroups was identified as blaCTX-M-15, and phylogroup B2 isolates with blaCTX-M-15 were classified into ST131 with O25b allele, harboring aac(6')-Ib-cr and various virulence factors. Carbapenemase genes blaNDM-1 and blaNDM-7 were identified in one isolate each of phylogroup A E. coli. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus isolates had type IV or V SCCmec, including isolates of ST361 (CC672), which is related to an emerging ST672 clone in the Indian subcontinent. This study revealed the recent epidemiological status of aerobic bacteria causing puerperal infections in Bangladesh, providing useful information to improve clinical practice and infection control.
TI  - The impact of hospital-acquired infections with multidrug-resistant bacteria in an oncology intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe overall site-specific hospital-acquired infection (HAI) rates and to describe the microbiological and antibiotic resistance profiles of infecting pathogens, together with their impact on multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria-associated mortality. METHODS: We conducted a 5-year retrospective descriptive study of HAI in patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a cancer center in Mexico from January 2007 to December 2011. The following information was collected: patient characteristics and comorbidities, data related to the neoplasm and its treatment, microbiology, and the resistance pattern of all isolates. RESULTS: During the study period, 1418 patients were admitted to the ICU; 134 of them developed 159 infections, with an incidence of 11.2/100 hospitalized patients and 32.2/per 1000 patient-days. Two hundred sixty-six microorganisms were isolated. The overall prevalence of MDR-HAI was 39.5%. The most frequent organisms were as follows: 54 (20%) Escherichia coli (94.4% of these were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers), 32 (12%) Staphylococcus aureus (90.6% of these were methicillin-resistant), 32 (12%) Enterococcus faecium (18.7% of these were vancomycin-resistant), and 20 (6%) Acinetobacter baumannii (all were MDR). Among patients admitted to the ICU, 252 (17.8%) died. Death was related to the HAI in 58 (23%) of these patients (p<0.001) and 51 (88%) had a MDR organism isolated (p=0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The emergence of MDR bacteria poses a difficult task for physicians, who have limited therapeutic options. Critically ill cancer patients admitted to the ICU are at major risk of a bacterial MDR-HAI that will impact adversely on mortality.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of alcoholic extracts obtained from vegetative organs of A. retroflexus.
AB  - In vitro antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of Amaranthus retroflexus leaves and inflorescence alcoholic (ethanol 70%) extracts of various concentrations ranging from 0.78 to 400 muL/ml were analyzed on different clinical and reference bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtills, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii) and fungal strains (Candida albicans, C. famata, C. utilis, Saccharomyces cerevisiae) using agar disk diffusion method and broth dilution method (MIC determination) for antimicrobial activity and TEAC (Trolox capacity) assay for the evaluation of the antioxidant activity. The adapted diffusion method was used to test the antimicrobial effect of the extracts separately and in combination with a range of standard antibiotics, in order to evidence any synergic effects of A. retroflexus extracts on the antibiotics activity. The extracts showed the highest inhibitory effect against K. pneumoniae and B. subtilis with no activity against S. aureus among the bacterial strains, while in case of the fungal strains the most intensive effect was exhibited against C. famata by both extracts. The A. retroflexus leaves extract improved the ciprofloxacin and ticarcillin-clavulanic acid activity towards the P. aeruginosa clinical strain. The inflorescences extract significantly increased chloramphenicol activity on B. subtilis strain. The antioxidant activity assay showed that the studied extracts exhibited the ability to neutralize the free radicals leading to the conclusion that the tested extracts bear compounds with a broad spectrum of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity that could represent a potential alternative for treating various infectious diseases.
TI  - [Efficacy of tigecycline in treating severe infections of patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of tigecycline in treating secondary infections of patients with hematological diseases. METHODS: A total of 85 cases of hematological patients with secondary infections were classified into empirical and targeted therapy groups. Empirical therapy group was composed of patients receiving tigecycline as an alternative due to ineffective anti-infection treatment for 3-5 days in the absence of microbiological evidence while those taking tigecycline based on microbiological evidence belonged to targeted therapy group. Dosage regimen of tigecycline: loading dose 100 mg, 50 mg every 12 hours as maintenance therapy for 2-4 weeks. RESULTS: Among them, except for 11 cases of bloodstream infections and 2 cases of fever for unknown reasons, the most common site for infection was lower respiratory tract. Among 45 isolated bacterial strains, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (40%) was the most commonly seen while extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLS)+ multidrug resistant gram negative bacilli 15.6%. Among 5 bacterial strains, there were 3 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus+golden staphylococci strains and 2 excrement enterococci. The total effective rate of tigecycline was 72.9%. And the bacterial clearance rates of acinetobacter baumannii, ESBLS+ gram-negative bacillus and stenotrophomonas maltophilia were 85%, 70% and 55% respectively. The effect of tigecycline was equivalent for two groups. Pneumonia patients obtained an effective rate of 71%, compared to those with bloodstream infections (54.5%). For patients whose absolute neutrophil counts were less than 0.2 x 10(9)/L, the effective rate decreased obviously (45% vs 81.5%, P = 0.003). Adverse reaction was mild due to mostly gastrointestinal symptoms. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline is a new treatment choice in treating secondary multidrug resistant infections of patients with hematological diseases. Empirical therapy of tigecycline may improve the therapeutic efficacy of patients non-responding favorably to conventional anti-infectives.
TI  - [Trends in antibiotic resistance in Medellin and municipalities of the Metropolitan Area between 2007 and 2012: Results of six years of surveillance].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bacterial resistance is a global phenomenon, but it presents geographic and temporal variations; this is the importance of local surveillance programs. OBJECTIVE: To determine trends in antibiotic resistance in hospitals between 2007 and 2012 in Medellin and its Metropolitan Area. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Percentages of antibiotic resistance between 2007 and 2012 in 22 institutions were obtained using WHONET 5.6 program. For interpretation of susceptibility results, CLSI standards of 2009 and 2012 were used. Using the Epi-Info 6.04 program a trends analysis of antibiotic resistance was done using the chi-square for linear trend with a confidence level of 95%, a value of p=0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: In six years of surveillance of antibiotic resistance we found a decrease of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (p=0.0006) and an increase of vancomycin resistance in Enterococcus faecium (p=0.0000). In Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens an increase of resistance to ceftazidime was found, in contrast to a decrease in Klebsiella pneumoniae (p=0.0000) and Enterobacter cloacae (p=0.058). K. pneumoniae , S. marcescens and E. cloacae showed an increase of carbapenem resistance in contrast to a reduction of carbapenem resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii . CONCLUSIONS: The resistance surveillance identified important findings as the emergence of E. faecium resistant to vancomycin and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae . It is essential to determine the antibiotic use in the region to establish their influence on the resistance profiles, as well as ensuring the quality of information and microbiological procedures in the microbiology laboratories.
TI  - Risk factors for mortality in liver transplant recipients with ESKAPE infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections caused by the pathogens Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp (ESKAPE) have recently been identified as serious emerging problems in solid organ transplant, no information in liver transplant (LT) recipients is available. We sought to investigate the risk factors for associated mortality in LT recipients with ESKAPE infections. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of infection after LT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE infection were identified. RESULTS: Fifty-three episodes of infections caused by ESKAPE were documented in 51 LT recipients. The main sites of infection were the bloodstream (49.0%), the lungs (33.3%), and the intra-abdominal/biliary tract (17.6%). The risk factors for mortality independently associated with ESKAPE infection were female sex (odds ratio [OR] = 6.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-40.8, P = .042), septic shock (OR = 30.1, 95% CI = 3.7-244.8, P = .001), and lymphocyte counts <300/mm(3) (OR = 20.2, 95% CI = 2.9-142.2, P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the results of LT, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when female LT recipients with ESKAPE infection present with septic shock and decreased lymphocyte counts.
TI  - Differential impact of infection control strategies on rates of resistant hospital-acquired pathogens in critically ill surgical patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There were two major outbreaks of multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter  baumannii (MDRA) in our general surgery and trauma intensive care units (ICUs) in 2004 and 2011. Both required aggressive multi-faceted interventions to control. We hypothesized that the infection control response may have had a secondary benefit of reducing rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Clostridium difficile (C. diff). METHODS: We analyzed data retrospectively from a prospective infection control database at a major university hospital and calculated the incidence rates of nosocomial MRSA, VRE, and C. diff before and after the two MDRA outbreaks (2004 and 2011) in the general surgery and trauma ICUs, and two unaffected control ICUs: thoracic surgery ICU and medical ICU. We tracked incidence rates in 6 mos segments for 24 mos per outbreak and created a composite variable of "any resistant pathogen" for comparison. RESULTS: The incidence rates of "any resistant pathogen" were significantly lower in the general surgery ICU after both outbreaks (24 to 11 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.045 and 7.7 ->4.0 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.04). This did not persist after 6 mos. The trauma ICU's rate of "any resistant pathogen" did not change after either outbreak (16 ->16.5 cases per 1000 patient days in 2004, p=0.44 and 4.6 ->1.9 cases per 1000 patient days in 2011, p=0.41). The rates in the control ICUs were unchanged during the study periods. CONCLUSIONS: Rates of resistant pathogens were lower in the general surgery ICU after response to MDRA outbreaks in both 2004 and 2011 although the rates increased again with time. There were no changes in rates of resistant pathogens in the trauma ICU after MDRA outbreaks in 2004 and 2011. Outbreak responses may have a differential impact in general surgery ICU versus trauma ICUs.
TI  - Trends and correlation of antibacterial usage and bacterial resistance: time series analysis for antibacterial stewardship in a Chinese teaching hospital (2009-2013).
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to describe the effect of antibacterial stewardship and evaluate the trends and correlation of antibacterial resistance and usage from 2009 to 2013 in a tertiary-care teaching hospital in northwest China. Antibacterial usage was expressed as defined daily doses per 100 patients per day (DDDs/100 PDs). Hospital-wide population-level data and time series analysis were used to evaluate the trends and determine associations between antibacterial exposure and acquisition of resistance. Yearly consumption of overall antibacterials significantly decreased from 66.54 to 28.08 DDDs/100 PDs (beta = -10.504, p < 0.01). The resistant rates of the five most frequently isolated species (including Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae) significantly decreased or remained stable, and none of them showed a statistically significant upward trend. The medical quality indicators got better or remained stable. Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models demonstrated that the monthly resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to imipenem was strongly correlated with antipseudomonal carbapenems usage (beta = 34.94, p < 0.001), as did the correlation of P. aeruginosa to meropenem with antipseudomonal third-generation cephalosporins usage (beta = 32.76, p < 0.01) and K. pneumoniae to amikacin with aminoglycosides usage (beta = 22.01, p < 0.001). The decreased antibacterial use paralleled the improved bacterial resistance without deteriorating medical quality indicators during antimicrobial stewardship. It also suggests that optimum antibiotic use is necessary to alleviate the threat posed by resistant microorganisms at the hospital level.
TI  - A study on the ability of quaternary ammonium groups attached to a polyurethane foam wound dressing to inhibit bacterial attachment and biofilm formation.
AB  - Bacterial infection of acute and chronic wounds impedes wound healing significantly. Part of this impediment is the ability of bacterial pathogens to grow in wound dressings. In this study, we examined the effectiveness of a polyurethane (PU) foam wound dressings coated with poly diallyl-dimethylammonium chloride (pDADMAC-PU) to inhibit the growth and biofilm development by three main wound pathogens, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii, within the wound dressing. pDADMAC-PU inhibited the growth of all three pathogens. Time-kill curves were conducted both with and without serum to determine the killing kinetic of pDADMAC-PU. pDADMAC-PU killed S. aureus, A. baumannii, and P. aeruginosa. The effect of pDADMAC-PU on biofilm development was analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative analysis, colony-forming unit assay, revealed that pDADMAC-PU dressing produced more than eight log reduction in biofilm formation by each pathogen. Visualization of the biofilms by either confocal laser scanning microscopy or scanning electron microscopy confirmed these findings. In addition, it was found that the pDADMAC-PU-treated foam totally inhibited migration of bacteria through the foam for all three bacterial strains. These results suggest that pDADMAC-PU is an effective wound dressing that inhibits the growth of wound pathogens both within the wound and in the wound dressing.
TI  - Fast and effective photodynamic inactivation of multiresistant bacteria by cationic riboflavin derivatives.
AB  - Photodynamic inactivation of bacteria (PIB) proves to be an additional method to  kill pathogenic bacteria. PIB requires photosensitizer molecules that effectively generate reactive oxygen species like singlet oxygen when exposed to visible light. To allow a broad application in medicine, photosensitizers should be safe when applied in humans. Substances like vitamin B2, which are most likely safe, are known to produce singlet oxygen upon irradiation. In the present study, we added positive charges to flavin derivatives to enable attachment of these molecules to the negatively charged surface of bacteria. Two of the synthesized flavin derivatives showed a high quantum yield of singlet oxygen of approximately 75%. Multidrug resistant bacteria like MRSA (Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), EHEC (enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii were incubated with these flavin derivatives in vitro and were subsequently irradiated with visible light for seconds only. Singlet oxygen production in bacteria was proved by detecting its luminescence at 1270 nm. After irradiation, the number of viable bacteria decreased up to 6 log10 steps depending on the concentration of the flavin derivatives and the light dosimetry. The bactericidal effect of PIB was independent of the bacterial type and the corresponding antibiotic resistance pattern. In contrast, the photosensitizer concentration and light parameters used for bacteria killing did not affect cell viability of human keratinocytes (therapeutic window). Multiresistant bacteria can be safely and effectively killed by a combination of modified vitamin B2 molecules, oxygen and visible light, whereas normal skin cells survive. Further work will include these new photosensitizers for topical application to decolonize bacteria from skin and mucosa.
TI  - Ecological competition and the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii bloodstream infections in a teaching hospital in Southeastern Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, pathogen ecology has been recognized as an important epidemiological determinant of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs). Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most important agents known to cause HAIs. It is widespread in healthcare settings and exhibits seasonal variations in incidence. Little is known about the impact of competition with other hospital pathogens on the incidence of A. baumannii infection. METHODS: We conducted an ecological study, enrolling patients who presented with healthcare-associated bloodstream infections (HA-BSIs) from 2005 to 2010 at a 450-bed teaching hospital in Brazil. HA-BSIs were said to be present when bacteria or fungi were recovered from blood cultures collected at least three days after admission. Monthly incidence rates were calculated for all HA-BSIs (overall or caused by specific pathogens or groups of pathogens). Multivariate Poisson regression models were used to identify the impacts of the incidence of several pathogens on the incidence of A. baumannii. RESULTS: The overall incidence rate of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was 2.5 per 10,000 patient-days. In the multivariate analysis, the incidence of HA-BSI caused by A. baumannii was negatively associated with the incidence rates of HA-BSI due to Staphylococcus aureus (rate ratio [RR]=0.88; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.80-0.97), Enterobacter spp. (RR=0.84; 95%CI=0.74-0.94) and a pool of less common gram-negative pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that competition between pathogens influences the etiology of HA-BSIs. It would be beneficial to take these findings into account in infection control policies.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii universal stress protein A plays a pivotal role in stress response and is essential for pneumonia and sepsis pathogenesis.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most significant threats to global public health. This threat is compounded by the fact that A. baumannii is rapidly becoming resistant to all relevant antimicrobials. Identifying key microbial factors through which A. baumannii resists hostile host environment is paramount to the development of novel antimicrobials targeting infections caused by this emerging pathogen. An attractive target could be a molecule that plays a role in the pathogenesis and stress response of A. baumannii. Accordingly, the universal stress protein A (UspA) was chosen to be fully investigated in this study. A platform of A. baumannii constructs, expressing various levels of the uspA gene ranging from zero to thirteen folds of wild-type level, and a recombinant E. coli strain, were employed to investigate the role of UspA in vitro stress and in vivo pathogenesis. The UspA protein plays a significant role in protecting A. baumannii from H(2)O(2), low pH, and the respiratory toxin 2,4-DNP. A. baumannii UspA protein plays an essential role in two of the deadliest types of infection caused by A. baumannii; pneumonia and sepsis. This distinguishes A. baumannii UspA from its closely related homolog, the Staphylococcus aureus Usp2, as well as from the less similar Burkholderia glumae Usps. Heterologous and overexpression experiments suggest that UspA mediates its role via an indirect mechanism. Our study highlights the role of UspA as an important contributor to the A. baumannii stress and virulence machineries, and polishes it as a plausible target for new therapeutics.
TI  - Stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins mediate selective broad-spectrum photoinactivation of drug-resistant pathogens at nanomolar concentrations.
AB  - Three stable synthetic mono-substituted cationic bacteriochlorins (BC37, BC38 and BC39) were recently reported to show exceptional activity (low nanomolar) in mediating photodynamic killing of human cancer cells after a 24h incubation upon excitation with near-infrared light (730 nm). The presence of cationic quaternary ammonium groups in each compound suggested likely activity as antimicrobial photosensitizers. Herein this hypothesis was tested against a panel of pathogenic microorganisms that have all recently drawn attention due to increased drug-resistance (Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis; Gram-negative bacteria, Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii; and fungal yeasts, Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans). All three bacteriochlorins were highly effective against both Gram-positive species (>6 logs of eradication at 200 nM and 10 J/cm(2)). The dicationic bacteriochlorin (BC38) was best against the Gram-negative species (>6 logs at 1-2 muM) whereas the lipophilic monocationic bacteriochlorin (BC39) was best against the fungi (>6 logs at 1 muM). The bacteriochlorins produced substantial singlet oxygen (and apparently less Type-1 reactive-oxygen species such as hydroxyl radical) as judged by activation of fluorescent probes and comparison with 1H-phenalen-1-one-2-sulfonic acid; the order of activity was BC37 > BC38 > BC39. A short incubation time (30 min) resulted in selectivity for microbial cells over HeLa human cells. The highly active photodynamic inactivation of microbial cells may stem from the amphiphilic and cationic features of the bacteriochlorins.
TI  - Disease burden of intensive care unit-acquired pneumonia in China: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Intensive care unit (ICU)-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are associated with poor clinical and economic outcomes. Data regarding ICU-acquired pneumonia and VAP are not readily available from developing countries, including China. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the incidence, mortality rate, length of stay, and pathogens associated with ICU-acquired pneumonia in China. METHODS: A meta-analysis and systematic review of 334 publications published between January 2007 and May 2012 and retrieved from the Chinese BioMedical database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP Chinese Science and Technique Journals database, Wanfang database, and PubMed was conducted. RESULTS: The incidences of ICU-acquired pneumonia and VAP were 16.2% (95% confidence interval (CI) 12.8-20.4%) and 33.7% (95% CI 31.4-36.1%), respectively; mortality rates were 37.4% (95% CI 24.6-52.2%) and 34.5% (95% CI 29.2-40.1%), respectively. The durations of stay in the ICU and hospital were 12.4 (95% CI 9.6-15.3) and 17.7 (95% CI 15.6-19.7) days and 18.0 (95% CI 16.5-19.6) and 30.5 (95% CI 26.4-34.7) days for ICU-acquired pneumonia and VAP, respectively. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (19.9%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (13.9%) were the most frequently isolated pathogens, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%); 82.9% of S. aureus isolates were reported to be methicillin-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: ICU-acquired pneumonia/VAP remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients in the ICU in China. Data on organisms causing disease in this population could help guide appropriate prevention strategies and treatment.
TI  - Anti-cancer, immunoregulatory, and antimicrobial activities of the frog skin host-defense peptides pseudhymenochirin-1Pb and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa.
AB  - Pseudhymenochirin-1Pb (Ps-1Pb) and pseudhymenochirin-2Pa (Ps-2Pa) are host-defense peptides, first isolated from skin secretions of the frog Pseudhymenochirus merlini (Pipidae). Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa are highly cytotoxic (LC50<12 muM) against non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells but are also hemolytic against human erythrocytes (LC50=28+/-2 muM for Ps-1Pb and LC50=6+/-1 muM for Ps-2Pa). Ps-2Pa shows selective cytotoxicity for tumor cells (LC50 against non-neoplastic human umbilical vein (HUVEC) cells=68+/-2 muM). Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa (5 mug/mL) significantly inhibit production of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and the multifunctional cytokine IL-6 from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice and enhance the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-23 from both unstimulated and LPS-stimulated macrophages. Ps-1Pb potently (MIC</=10 muM) inhibits growth of multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Ps-2Pa shows the same high potency (MIC</=10 muM) against the Gram-positive bacteria but is 2-4 fold less potent against the Gram-negative isolates. Ps-1Pb at 4xMIC kills 99.9% of Escherichia coli within 30 min and 99.9% of S. aureus within 180 min. In conclusion, cytotoxicity against tumor cells, cytokine-mediated immunomodulatory properties, and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity suggest that the Ps-1Pb and Ps-2Pa represent templates for design of non-hemolytic analogs for tumor therapy and for treatment of infections in cancer patients produced by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Gorilla gorilla gorilla gut: a potential reservoir of pathogenic bacteria as revealed using culturomics and molecular tools.
AB  - Wild apes are considered to be the most serious reservoir and source of zoonoses. However, little data are available about the gut microbiota and pathogenic bacteria in gorillas. For this propose, a total of 48 fecal samples obtained from 21 Gorilla gorilla gorilla individuals (as revealed via microsatellite analysis) were screened for human bacterial pathogens using culturomics and molecular techniques. By applying culturomics to one index gorilla and using specific media supplemented by plants, we tested 12,800 colonies and identified 147 different bacterial species, including 5 new species. Many opportunistic pathogens were isolated, including 8 frequently associated with human diseases; Mycobacterium bolletii, Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Clostridium botulinum. The genus Treponema accounted for 27.4% of the total reads identified at the genus level via 454 pyrosequencing. Using specific real-time PCR on 48 gorilla fecal samples, in addition to classical human pathogens, we also observed the fastidious bacteria Bartonella spp. Borrelia spp., Coxiella burnetii and Tropheryma whipplei in the gorilla population. We estimated that the prevalence of these pathogens vary between 4.76% and 85.7%. Therefore, gorillas share many bacterial pathogens with humans suggesting that they could be a reservoir for their emergence.
TI  - Active screening of multi-drug resistant bacteria effectively prevent and control the potential infections.
AB  - Our objective is to determine if actively screen the multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDRB) infection in intensive care unit (ICU) to prevent, control, and decrease the infection rate and transmission of MDRB. The patients admitted in ICU of one hospital in 2013 were analyzed. The throat swab, blood, defecation, and urine of patients were actively collected for bacteria cultures to screen Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii in patients. All patients received screening of MDRB infection and colonization within 2 days and after 2 days of admission, the results showed that there were 418 infectious bacterial strains in total and P. aeruginosa was the main bacterium. The asymptomatic infection rates of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli, S. aureus, and A. baumannii were 39.02, 24.74, 44.00, 29.17, and 33.33 %, respectively; the symptomatic infection rates were 60.98, 75.26, 56.00, 70.83, and 66.67 %. 59.70 % patients received antibiotics treatment, 27.45 % patients received trachea cannula, 32.95 % patients received mechanism ventilation, 2.27 % patients received arterial cannula or venous cannula and 4.00 % patients received indwelling urinary catheters. The main MDRB in ICU is P. aeruginosa. The active screening of MDRB infection and colonization can provide the opportunity to take the life-saving measure against MDRB and treat patients. This can decrease the infection risk and the nosocomial transmission of MDRB.
TI  - Intracranial malignant lesions correlate with the requirement for a long treatment course in postoperative central nervous system infection.
AB  - AIM: Our aim was to study the clinical features of postoperative meningitis after neurosurgery and identify the factors affecting the duration of treatment. METHODS: This retrospective study assessed 283 patients with postoperative bacterial meningitis in the Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Beijing, People's Republic of China, between January and December 2012. Patients' clinical data were reviewed, and multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify the factors associated with a prolonged treatment course. RESULTS: The mortality rate was 0.4% in these patients, of whom 12.4% were found with pathogens in the cerebrospinal fluid. Among the three most common pathogens detected were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The mean treatment course was 13.5+/-2.1 days. Interestingly, the treatment duration for postoperative meningitis was significantly longer in patients with intracranial malignant tumors than in those with benign lesions. Single-factor analysis showed that male sex (P=0.042) and malignant (rather than benign) lesions (P<0.001) were significantly associated with prolonged treatment duration. Multivariate analysis further confirmed that malignant intracranial lesions represented an independent risk factor for prolonged treatment duration (odds ratio: 2.5962; 95% confidence interval: 1.1092-6.6134). CONCLUSION: The nature of the intracranial lesion is an independent risk factor for the duration of treatment in postoperative meningitis after neurosurgery.
TI  - Blood infections in patients treated at transplantation wards of a clinical hospital in Warsaw.
AB  - Establishment of the etiology in blood infection is always advisable. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the proportion of different bacterial species, including aerobic and anaerobic bacteria in blood cultures of patients hospitalized in transplantation wards of a large clinical hospital between 2010 and 2012. A total of 1994 blood samples from patients who were treated at one of two transplantation wards of a large hospital in Warsaw were analyzed using an automated blood culture system, BacT/ALERT (bioMerieux, France). The 306 bacterial strains were obtained from the examined samples. The highest proportion were bacteria from the family Enterobacteriaceae (112 strains; 36.6%) with Escherichia coli (61 strains), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30 strains), and Enterobacter cloacae (10 strains) most commonly isolated. The non-fermenting bacilli constituted 21.6% (66 strains), with most common Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (31 strains), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14 strains), Achromobacter spp. (12 strains), and Acinetobacter baumannii (3 strains). Most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were staphylococci (25.2%). Of 77 staphylococcal strains, 56 were coagulase-negative staphylococci and 21 Staphylococcus aureus. Other Gram-positive bacteria included enterococci (14 strains) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1 strain). Obligatory anaerobic bacteria were represented by 19 strains (6.2% of total isolates). Among all Enterobacteriaceae, 49 isolates (43.7%) produced extended-spectrum ss-lactamases (ESBLs). Resistance to methicillin was detected in 62% of S aureus isolates and in 46% of coagulase-negative staphylococci. Of 14 enterococci cultured from blood samples, 2 strains (14.3%) were resistant to vancomycin. Both were Enterococcus faecium. Resistant strains of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria are significant problems for patients in the transplantation ward.
TI  - Differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in lower respiratory tract infections between general wards and RICU.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) are common among patients  in hospitals worldwide, especially in patients over the age of 60. This study investigates the differences in distribution and drug sensitivity of pathogens in LRTIs. METHODS: The clinical and laboratory data of 4,762 LRTI patients in the general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital (Changsha) were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The infection rate of Gram-negative bacteria was significantly higher than that of Gram-positive bacteria in both the general ward and RICU (P<0.05). The incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection was significantly higher in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05), whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection is less in the RICU than in the general ward (P<0.05). In the general ward, the incidence of Gram-negative bacteria infection significantly increased (P<0.05) over time, whereas the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection significantly decreased from 1996 to 2011 (P<0.05). In the RICU, the incidence of Gram-positive bacteria infection decreased, while Gram-negative bacteria infections increased without statistical significance (P>0.05). Staphylococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus were found to be the predominant Gram-positive strains in the general ward (34.70-41.18%) and RICU (41.66-54.87%), respectively (P>0.05). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant gram negative strains in the general ward (19.17-21.09%) and RICU (29.60-33.88%), respectively (P>0.05). Streptococcus pneumoniae is sensitive to most antibiotics with a sensitivity of more than 70%. Staphylococcus aureus is highly sensitive to vancomycin (100%), linezolid (100%), chloramphenicol (74.36-82.19%), doxycycline (69.57-77.33%), and sulfamethoprim (67.83-72.46%); however, its sensitivity to other antibiotics is low and decreased each year. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to most beta-lactam, aminoglycoside, and quinolone group antibiotics decreased each year. CONCLUSIONS: The distribution and drug sensitivity of LRTI pathogens exhibit a high divergence between the general ward and RICU. Streptococcus pneumoniae may not be the predominant pathogen in LRTIs in some areas of China.
TI  - Molecular characterization and in vitro susceptibilities of beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus to CSE1034 and other beta-lactams.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) among 663 clinical isolates obtained from various parts of India and to study the occurrence of different variants of ESBLs among these isolates. METHODS: Phenotypic characterization and susceptibility studies were performed according to the methods described in Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. The occurrence of ESBL variants was analyzed with PCR using the previously reported primers. RESULTS: Among the six hundred sixty three isolates, the identified isolates were Acinetobacter baumannii (72), Escherichia coli (218), Klebsiella pneumoniae (30), Klebsiella oxytoca (63), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (264) and Staphylococcus aureus (16). PCR results revealed that approximately 89.0% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were positive for ESBL followed by Escherichia coli (85.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (76.6%), Klebsiella oxytoca (73.0%), Acinetobacter baumannii (72.2%) and Staphylococcus aureus (31.2%). The overall prevalence of ESBL was 82.5%. The presence of TEM type ESBLs were the predominant (in 186 isolates), followed by SHV (138), OXA (92), CTX-M (65), AmpC (33), KPC (28) and blaZ (5). Of the drugs involved in the study, CSE1034 was found to be the most efficacious against all of ESBL positive clinical isolates showing susceptibility approximately 95.7% with minimal inhibitory concentration values between 0.125 and 8.000 mug/mL for all strains tested. The susceptibilities of penems (meropenem and imipenem and cilastatin) ranged between 83% and 93% for all the isolates. The susceptibilities of other drugs like piperacillin and tazobactam, amoxicillin and clavulanic acid, cefoperazone and sulbactam were <45% for all the isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Results of the present study indicated that majority of the isolates was susceptible to CSE1034 and it could be a potent antibacterial agent for the treatment of severe bacterial infections caused by such organisms.
TI  - Etiological factors causing lower respiratory tract infections isolated from hospitalized patients.
AB  - Lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) account for 20-30 % of all hospital-acquired contagions. They are characterized by high mortality of hospitalized patients. The most serious form of LRTI is pneumonia, and the most common etiological factors in such cases are bacteria. The article gives the analysis of bacterial flora samples obtained from lower respiratory tract of hospitalized patients. In vitro susceptibility of pathogens to selected antibiotics has also been assessed. We carried out a retrospective analysis of 1,171 bacterial strains isolated from 1,171 patients treated in clinics of the Military Institute of Medicine in Warsaw, Poland. In most cases the samples were collected from an endotracheal or tracheostomic tube (71.5 %) and from bronchoalveolar lavage (21.7 %). The most commonly isolated pathogens included Acinetobacter baumannii (35.8 %), Staphylococcus aureus (27.6 %), Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.4 %), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.2 %). Multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria exhibited 100 % susceptibility to colistin only. Klebsiella pneumoniae ESBL+ and Acinetobacter baumannii were most susceptible to carbapenems, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains to ceftazidime. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were 100 % susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline. In conclusion, identifying the etiological factors causing infections of the lower respiratory tract and determining their drug-susceptibility is of key importance in empirical treatment.
TI  - One-step species-specific high resolution melting analysis for nosocomial bacteria detection.
AB  - Nosocomial infections are a major public health concern worldwide. Early and accurate identification of nosocomial pathogens which are often multidrug resistant is crucial for prompt treatment. Hence, an alternative real-time polymerase chain reaction coupled with high resolution melting-curve analysis (HRMA) was developed for identification of five nosocomial bacteria. This assay targets species-specific regions of each nosocomial bacteria and produced five distinct melt curves with each representing a particular bacterial species. The melting curves were characterized by peaks of 78.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C for Acinetobacter baumannii, 82.7 +/- 0.2 degrees C for Escherichia coli, 86.3 +/- 0.3 degrees C for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 88.8 +/- 0.2 degrees C for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 74.6 +/- 02 degrees C for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The assay was able to specifically detect the five bacterial species with an overall detection limit of 2 x 10(-2) ng/muL. In conclusion, the HRM assay developed is a simple and rapid method for identification of the selected nosocomial pathogens.
TI  - Arbekacin: another novel agent for treating infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens.
AB  - Arbekacin sulfate (ABK), an aminoglycoside antibiotic, was discovered in 1972 and was derived from dibekacin to stabilize many common aminoglycoside modifying enzymes. ABK shows broad antimicrobial activities against not only Gram-positive bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) but also Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. ABK has been approved as an injectable formulation in Japan since 1990, under the trade name Habekacin, for the treatment of patients with pneumonia and sepsis caused by MRSA. The drug has been used in more than 250,000 patients, and its clinical benefit and safety have been proven over two decades. ABK currently shows promise for the application for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacterial infections such as multidrug-resistant strains of P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii because of its synergistic effect in combination with beta-lactams.
TI  - Evaluation of the effectiveness of an infection control program in adult intensive care units: a report from a middle-income country.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rates of hand hygiene improvement and health care-associated infections (HAIs) were evaluated after the introduction in 2004 of an infection surveillance and prevention program at a university teaching hospital in a low- to middle-income country. METHODS: Data on hand hygiene compliance, HAI rate, multiresistant organisms, and antibiotic consumption in 4 adult intensive care units (ICUs; medical, general surgery, anesthesiology and reanimation, and neurosurgery) were collected retrospectively for each year from 2004 to 2012. Negative binomial regression modeling with a log link was used to adjust for overdispersion in observations, and the first year of observations served as the baseline for comparing changes in incidence rate ratio (IRR) over the subsequent years. RESULTS: Total hand hygiene compliance improved from 30.5% in 2004 to 43.5% by 2010 (IRR, 1.3; P <.0001) and reached 63.8% by 2012 (IRR, 1.9; P < .0001). The HAI rate was 42.6/1,000 patient-days at baseline and increased significantly thereafter until 2012, when it decreased by 20% to 33.6/1,000 patient-days (IRR, 0.8; P = .001). The rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection was 7.85 (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.89-10.26)/1,000 catheter-days in 2004 and increased to 12.4 (95% CI, 9.98-14.39)/1,000 catheter-days in 2012 (IRR, 1.5; P = .024). The rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia remained stable from the 2004 baseline rate of 31.66/1,000 ventilator-days to the 2012 rate of 24.04/ 1,000 ventilator-days (IRR, 0.88; P = .574). The rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection remained relatively stable between 2004 and 2012 (from 7.92/1,000 catheter-days to 4.97/1,000 catheter-days; P = .101). The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection was 6.24/1,000 patient-days at baseline and decreased significantly to 0.73/1,000 patient-days by 2007 (IRR, 0.13; P <.001) and continued to remain below 2/1,000 patient-days for the next 5 years. The rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection decreased significantly from 8.66/1,000 patient-days in 2004 to 6.09/1,000 patient-days in 2010 (IRR, 0.72; P = .026) and to 5.44/1,000 patient-days by 2012 (IRR, 0.63; P = .002). The rate of Acinetobacter baumannii infection was 14.3/1,000 patient-days at baseline, decreased significantly by 2005 (IRR, 0.73; P = .012), fluctuated between 2006 and 2010, and then decreased significantly to 10.44/1,000 patient-days in 2011 (IRR, 0.74; P = .007) and then to 7.6/1,000 patient-days in 2012 (IRR, 0.53; P < .001). Antibiotic consumption did not decrease noticeably over the 9-year study period. CONCLUSIONS: Hand hygiene improved in all of the ICUs evaluated. Measuring changes in HAI rates in a single health care setting can be statistically challenging, and a bias in the detection rates is not uncommon in the early years of a new infection prevention program. Here, for the first time, implementation of an infection surveillance and prevention program was associated with a reduction in HAI rate.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii neonatal mastitis: a case report.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Neonatal mastitis is a rare infection. When it does occur, infants  younger than 2 months of age are typically affected and the majority of cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. We present the first reported case of neonatal mastitis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii, an unusual organism for this type of infection. CASE PRESENTATION: A 15-day-old full-term Caucasian male neonate presented to our emergency room following fever at home and was admitted for routine neonatal sepsis evaluation. After admission, he developed purulent drainage from his right nipple, was diagnosed with mastitis, and was started on empiric therapy with clindamycin and cefotaxime with presumed coverage for S. aureus. Drainage culture identified pan-susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii/haemolyticus and antibiotic therapy was changed to ceftazidime. He was discharged after 5 days of ceftazidime with complete resolution of his symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: This case illustrates the importance of obtaining drainage cultures in mastitis cases because of the possibility of organisms besides S. aureus causing infection. Acinetobacter baumannii is considered part of the normal human flora and is associated with serious infections in intensive care units. This is the first case report describing Acinetobacter baumannii as an etiologic agent of neonatal mastitis and highlights the importance of including unusual organisms in the differential for infectious etiologies for general practitioners.
TI  - [Etiology of surgical site infections in orthopedic surgery after multiple injuries].
AB  - Surgical site infection is one of the most severe complications in patients with  multiple injuries. It causes elongation of hospitalization time, greatly increases costs of treatment and may directly endanger patient's life. The aim of the study was to analyze bacterial flora causing surgical site infections in group of patients with multiple injuries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on medical history of 31 patients with multiple injuries, who in years 2011-2012 due to surgical site infections required further treatment in Department of Musculoskeletal System Infections. RESULTS: In analyzed material majority of infections were caused by multiple bacteria species--18 (58%). Throughout the isolated flora the most frequent were gram-negative bacteria, especially A. baumanii--16 (29.6%) and P. areuginosa--5 (9.3%). Participation of gram-positive flora which until now was dominating as a cause of musculoskeletal system infections, has significantly decreased. Additionally, in this group we can see dominance of bacteria from Enterococcus genus--E. fecalis--10 (18.5%), and not as it used to be from Staphylococcus--S. aureus--6 (11%), S. epidermidis--3 (5.6%). CONCLUSIONS: The most common were acute infections caused by multiple bacteria species with dominance of gram-negative flora. Very interesting is the fact of fall of infection rate caused by Staphylococci. Monitoring of bacterial etiological factors has a key role in proper antibiotic administration, with is essential in successful surgical treatment.
TI  - Conformational analysis and cytotoxic activities of the frog skin host-defense peptide, hymenochirin-1Pa.
AB  - Hymenochirin-1Pa (LKLSPKTKDTLKKVLKGAIKGAIAIASMA-NH2) is a host-defense peptide first isolated from skin secretions of the frog Pseudhymenochirus merlini (Pipidae). A nuclear magnetic resonance structural investigation demonstrates that the peptide has a random coil conformation in water but, in the membrane-mimetic solvent 50% (v/v) trifluoroethanol-water adopts a well-defined conformation characterized by two alpha-helical domains from residues K6 to G17 and from G21 to M28, with the N-terminal region unfolded. The presence of a GXXXG domain, the most common structural motif found at the interface between interacting trans-membrane helices, between residues 17 and 21, introduces a kink corresponding to a deviation from linearity of 93 +/- 31 degrees . Hymenochirin-1Pa shows broad spectrum anti-bacterial activity, including high potency against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The peptide also shows high cytotoxic potency against human non-small lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, breast adenocarcinoma MDA-MB-231 cells, and colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cells but its therapeutic potential as an anti-cancer agent is limited by moderate hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes and lack of selectivity for tumor cells. Increasing cationicity of the peptide by substituting the Asp(9) residue by either L-Lys (K) or D-Lys (k) has relatively minor effects on antimicrobial and anti-tumor potencies but the [D9k] analog is non-hemolytic LC50 > 400 muM. Thus, [D9k]hymenochirin-1Pa may serve as a template for the design of non-toxic antimicrobial agents for use against multidrug-resistant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia after cardiac surgery: a meta-analysis and systematic review.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common and serious nosocomial infection that threatens patients who have undergone cardiac surgery. This article summarizes its clinical characteristics and provides theoretical evidence for prevention and treatment. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Web of Knowledge databases and by manual search. Data involving the prevalence, etiology, risk factors, or clinical outcomes were extracted for systematic review and meta-analysis. RESULTS: Eleven studies on VAP after cardiac surgery were included. When the results were merged the VAP rate was 21.27/1000 ventilator-days. The prevalence reached 6.37% of all patients and 35.2% of patients who were on mechanical ventilation for more than 48 hours. Among the isolated pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa had the highest detection rate, with an average of 23.19%, followed by Staphylococcus aureus (20.15%), Haemophilus influenzae (19.53%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), Escherichia coli (10.18%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.52%), and Candida albicans (7.20%). Risk factors were also analyzed. We found that New York Heart Association cardiac function class IV, pulmonary hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral vascular disease, renal disease, emergency surgery, intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic crossclamp time, mechanical ventilation time, reintervention, and reintubation were closely related to the occurrence of VAP; there was no association with gender and diabetes mellitus. Once patients had VAP, mortality and length of stay in the intensive care unit were significantly increased. CONCLUSIONS: VAP in patients after cardiac surgery is common and has a poor prognosis. It is mainly caused by gram-negative bacteria, and could be affected by a series of factors.
TI  - In vitro activity of WQ-3810, a novel fluoroquinolone, against multidrug-resistant and fluoroquinolone-resistant pathogens.
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the in vitro antibacterial activity of WQ-3810, a new fluoroquinolone, against clinically relevant pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae, including multidrug-resistant (MDR) and fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) isolates, compared with those of ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin. WQ-3810 demonstrated the most potent activity against the antimicrobial-resistant pathogens tested. Against A. baumannii, including MDR isolates, the potency of WQ-3810 [minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms (MIC(90))=1 mg/L] was more than eight-fold higher than that of ciprofloxacin (64 mg/L) and levofloxacin (8 mg/L). Against E. coli and S. pneumoniae, including FQR isolates, WQ-3810 (MIC(90)=4 mg/L and 0.06 mg/L, respectively) was also more active than ciprofloxacin (64 mg/L and 2 mg/L) and levofloxacin (32 mg/L and 2 mg/L). Furthermore, WQ-3810 was the most potent among the fluoroquinolones tested against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae, including FQR isolates. In particular, WQ-3810 demonstrated highly potent activity against FQR isolates of A. baumannii, E. coli and S. pneumoniae with amino acid mutation(s) in the quinolone resistance-determining region of DNA gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV, which are the target enzymes of fluoroquinolones. An enzyme inhibition study performed using FQR E. coli DNA gyrase suggested that the potent antibacterial activity of WQ-3810 against drug-resistant isolates partly results from the strong inhibition of the target enzymes. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that WQ-3810 exhibits extremely potent antibacterial activity over the existing fluoroquinolones, particularly against MDR and FQR pathogens.
TI  - Evaluation of high-resolution melting curve analysis of ligation-mediated real-time PCR, a rapid method for epidemiological typing of ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter Species) pathogens.
AB  - A single-tube method, ligation-mediated real-time PCR high-resolution melt analysis (LMqPCR HRMA), was modified for the rapid typing of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp. (ESKAPE) pathogens. A 97% agreement (60/62 isolates) was achieved in comparison to pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) results, which indicates that LMqPCR HRMA is a rapid and accurate screening tool for monitoring nosocomial outbreaks.
TI  - Changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The rates of postneurosurgical infections, particularly meningitis and the most common pathogens have been reported variable during the recent years. The aim of this research was to determine the prevalence of postneurosurgical meningitis and its current spectrum of infectious agent. METHODS: In a descriptive study, the postneurosurgical patients' cerebrospinal fluid was cultured on blood and MacConkey agar plates and evaluated at Microbiology Laboratory. 55 significant isolates as species level were recognized by bacteriological techniques. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) was the most common organism [29(52.7%)], followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae [8(14.5%)], Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [6(10.9%)], Staphylococcus saprophyticus [5(9.1%)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [3(5.5%)], Methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [3(5.5%)], and Enterococcus faecalis [1(1.8%)]. The majority of A. baumannii isolates were carbapenem-resistant. CONCLUSION: Our research revealed that the rate of postneurosurgical meningitis due to carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has been increased. This finding emphasized the importance of preventive strategies against A. baumannii. The changing pattern of infectious agents in postneurosurgical meningitis over time suggests the necessity of other studies.
TI  - Risks for multidrug-resistant pathogens in the ICU.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The impact of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) is rising  and often underestimated. The epidemiology of MDROs is extremely complex and multifactorial. There is increasing antibiotic resistance, mainly related to antibiotic pressure and patients' characteristics. RECENT FINDINGS: Emphasis on MDRO epidemiology is needed to better understand current strategies of prevention and management. Among them, antibiotic stewardship has been one of the most successful strategies. It is important to note that there is a controversial issue when considering community and healthcare-related infections. In addition, different strategies have been determined to find the impact and optimal use of recently launched antibiotics for MDRO treatment. SUMMARY: Infections with MDROs can prolong hospital stay, promote antibiotic use and prolong duration of mechanical ventilation. Some points should be further explored in clinical research such as the heterogeneity of healthcare-associated pneumonia and the need of new drug development. Resistance to non fermentative Gram-negative bacilli, rising minimum inhibitory concentration in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and spread of MDROs in patients without known risk factors suggest a review of guideline validation, taking into account ecology and severity of patient illness to provide timely and appropriate empiric therapy.
TI  - Preventing microbial colonisation of catheters: antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities of cellobiose dehydrogenase.
AB  - The ability of cellobiose dehydrogenase (CDH) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) for antimicrobial and antibiofilm functionalisation of urinary catheters was investigated. A recombinantly produced CDH from Myriococcum thermophilum was shown to completely inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus both in liquid and solid media when supplemented with either 0.8 mM or 2 mM cellobiose as substrate. Biofilm formation on silicone films was prevented by CDH when supplemented with 1mM cellobiose. The CDH/cellobiose system also successfully inhibited many common urinary catheter-colonising micro-organisms, including multidrug-resistant S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Proteus mirabilis, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Interestingly, CDH was also able to produce H(2)O(2) during oxidation of extracellular polysaccharides (exPS) formed by micro-organisms in the absence of cellobiose. The H(2)O(2) production and consequently antimicrobial and antibiofilm activities on these exPS were enhanced by incorporation of glycoside hydrolases such as amylases. Hydrolysis of polysaccharides by these enzymes increases the number of terminal reducing sugars as substrates for CDH as well as destabilises the biofilm. Furthermore, CDH suspended in catheter lubricants killed bacteria in biofilms colonising catheters. Incorporation of the CDH/cellobiose system in the lubricant therefore makes it an easy strategy for preventing microbial colonisation of catheters.
TI  - [Prevalence and features of pathogenic bacteria in the department of hematology without bone marrow transplantation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital from 2010 to 2012].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence, pathogens, and clinical features of infection in consecutive cases from 2010 to 2012 in Peking Union Medical College Hospital. METHOD: The incidence, pathogen, treatment, and outcomes of patients with hematological diseases who had positive findings of bacterium in their samples from 2010 to 2012 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: There were 449 positive samples (5.8%) from 4 890 patients during this period, among which 388 were proved to be with pathogenic bacteria. Samples separated from patients with community-aquired infections accounted for 8.4% of all positive samples. Most community-aquired infections were caused by Gram-negative bacteria (75%), although no multidrug-resistant bacteria was observed. Samples separated from patients with nosocomial infections accounted for 91.6% of all positive samples. Respiratory tract (49.4%) and peripheral blood (32.6%) were the most common samples with positive results. Skin soft tissues (10.4%), and urine (3.7%) were less common samples. Most of the pathogenic bacteria of the nosocomial infections were Gram-negative (66.9%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria included Escherichia coli (13.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.1%), and Klebsiella pneumonia (12.1%), while Staphylococcus aureus (10.4%), Enterococcus faecium (7.0%), and Staphylococcus epidermidis (5.1%) were the most common Gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative bacteria consisted of most of sputum samples and peripheral blood samples. Samples from the surface of skin wound and anal swab were composed largely by Gram-positive bacteria (63.8%). The detection rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumonia/Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, and Proteus mirabilis were 24.0%, 87.9% and 38.4%, respectively. The resistance to Acinetobacter baumannii was serious. Multidrug-resistant, extensive drug resistant and pan drug resistant A. baumannii acountted for 74% of all A. Baumannii infections. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed low resistance to sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, levofloxacin and minocycline. Also, 22 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Epidermidis were detected, which were only sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin, and linezolid. All patients were treated in the haematology wards and most of them were under agranulocytosis or immunosuppression. Finally, 22 patients reached clinical recovery through anti-infective therapy, whereas 49 patients died. Among those deaths, 42 patients attributed to severe infections and infection-associated complications. Fourteen of all the deaths might be infected with drug-resistance bacteria. There were 61 samples proved to be bacteria colonization. Nonfermenters such as Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia made up for a large amount of bacteria colonization. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of nosocomial infections in the hematology ward are mainly Gram-negative bacteria. The incidences and pathogens vary from different infection sites. Nosocomial infection still has a higher mortality rate. Once nonfermenters are detected positive, the pathogenic or colonial bacteria should be distinguished.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Lavandula coronopifolia essential oil against antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB  - The aim of this study was to analyse the composition of the essential oil (EO) of Lavandula coronopifolia from Morocco and to evaluate its in vitro antibacterial activity against antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from clinical infections. The antimicrobial activity was assessed by a broth micro-well dilution method using multiresistant clinical isolates of 11 pathogenic bacteria: Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae, Klebsiella ornithinolytica, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Providencia rettgeri, Citrobacter freundii, Hafnia alvei, Salmonella spp., Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The main compounds of the oil were carvacrol (48.9%), E-caryophyllene (10.8%) and caryophyllene oxide (7.7%). The oil showed activity against all tested strains with minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values ranging between 1% and 4%. For most of the strains, the MIC value was equivalent to the minimal bactericidal concentration value, indicating a clear bactericidal effect of L. coronopifolia EO.
TI  - Efficacy of medical grade honey against multidrug-resistant organisms of operational significance: part I.
AB  - BACKGROUND: MEDIHONEY (Derma Sciences, Inc., Toronto, Ontario M1S 3S4, Canada) was cleared by the Food and Drug Administration for use on tramatic wounds, diabetic ulcers, and second-degree burns against normal skin flora but not necessarily against multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) infecting these wounds or its associated recovery and healing rate. METHODS: Here, we report on the efficacy of this medical grade honey treatment against two MDROs (Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA]). In this initial phase (Part I), an in-laboratory validation and characterization of the efficacy against antibiotic-resistant bacteria were performed in vitro. RESULTS: The antimicrobial resistance of both MDROs was confirmed in vitro using standard microbiology techniques and species' DNA signatures. The minimum inhibitory concentration of the MEDIHONEY was determined to be 3.5% for MRSA and 8.5% for A. baumannii. The minimum bactericidal concentrations determined against MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii were shown to be 9.5% and 10.5%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our in vitro findings support the efficacy of MEDIHONEY against MRSA and A. baumannii as requested by first responders. We also conducted screening assays using other "supermarket brands" of honey. All cultures from the latter showed bacterial and fungal growths. The use of supermarket brand honey for wound treatment is discouraged.
TI  - Microbiology, resistance patterns, and risk factors of mortality in ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia in a Northern Thai tertiary-care university based general surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) occurrence, causative pathogens, and resistance patterns in surgical intensive care units (SICU) are different between Western and developing Asian countries. In Thailand, resistant organisms have progressively increased in the last decade. However, the evidence describing causes of VAP and its outcomes, especially secondary to resistant pathogens, in Asian developing countries' SICUs is very limited. Therefore, the objective of this study was to describe the incidence, pathogen characteristics, and risk factors that impact mortality and patient survival following VAP in a tertiary Northern Thai SICU. METHODS: Between 2008 and 2012, VAP occurred in a total of 150 patients in Chiang Mai University's general SICUs (6.3+/-2.8 cases per 1,000 mechanical ventilator days). The following clinical data were collected from 46 patients who died and 104 patients who survived: microbiologic results, susceptible patterns, and survival status at hospital discharge. Antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were classified as susceptible, multidrug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR), and pan-drug resistant (PDR). The hazard ratio (HR) was calculated for risk factor analysis. RESULTS: Regarding the microbiology, gram negative organisms were the major pathogens (n=142, 94.7%). The first three most common organisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (38.7% of all organisms, mortality 41.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (17.3%, mortality 30.8%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.7%, mortality 16%) respectively. The most common gram positive organism was Staphylococcus aureus (4.0%, mortality 50%). The median day of VAP occurrence were significantly different between the three groups (P<0.01): susceptible (day 4), MDR (day 5), and XDR (day 6.5). Only half of all VAP cases were caused by susceptible organisms. Antibiotic resistance was demonstrated by 49.3% of the gram negative organisms and 62.5% of the gram positive organisms. Extensive drug resistance was evident only in Acinetobacter baumannii (30.6%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1.3%). No pan-drug resistance was found during surveillance. The significant HR risk factors were age (P=0.03), resistant organisms (P=0.04), XDR (P=0.02), and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II score (<0.01). Acinetobacter baumannii (P=0.06) and intubation due to severe sepsis (P=0.08) demonstrated a trend toward a significant increase in the HR. On the other hand, there were significantly decreased HRs in trauma patients (P=0.01). Initial administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy had a tendency toward a significant decrease in the HR (P=0.08). CONCLUSION: Gram negative organisms were the primary cause of bacterial VAP in Chiang Mai University's general SICU. Resistant strains were present in half of all VAP cases and were associated with the day of VAP onset. Regarding risk factors, age, acute physiology, chronic health evaluation II score, resistant organisms (especially XDR), and being a non-trauma patient increased the risk of mortality.
TI  - [Pathogenic analysis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the pediatric intensive care unit in high-altitude areas].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)  and their drug resistance in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) in high-altitude areas and to provide a clinical basis for the prevention and treatment of VAP. METHODS: A total of 94 children with VAP hospitalized in the PICU in high-altitude areas between June 2011 and June 2013 were recruited. Their lower respiratory tract secretions were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity test. RESULTS: Of the 94 children with VAP, 22 (23%) had a single bacterial infection, and 72 (77%) had mixed infections, mostly with Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii (17 cases, 27%). Of the 178 isolated strains of pathogens, 139 (78%) were Gram-negative bacteria (G(-) bacteria), mainly including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 26 (15%) were Gram-positive bacteria (G(+) bacteria), mainly including Staphylococcus aureus, and 13 (7%) were fungi, mainly including Candida albicans. Most G(-) bacteria had a high drug resistance. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was extensively drug-resistant. Acinetobacter baumannii was only highly sensitive to cefoperazone/sulbactam and imipenem. Multidrug resistance (methicillin resistance) was found in G(+) bacteria, for which vancomycin was effective. CONCLUSIONS: The pathogens of VAP in high-altitude areas are mostly G- bacteria, which may cause mixed infections and develop drug resistance. This provides guidance for the rational use of antimicrobial drugs and the development of key prevention and control measures for VAP.
TI  - Mechanisms of beta-lactam antimicrobial resistance and epidemiology of major community- and healthcare-associated multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Alexander Fleming's discovery of penicillin heralded an age of antibiotic development and healthcare advances that are premised on the ability to prevent and treat bacterial infections both safely and effectively. The resultant evolution of antimicrobial resistant mechanisms and spread of bacteria bearing these genetic determinants of resistance are acknowledged to be one of the major public health challenges globally, and threatens to unravel the gains of the past decades. We describe the major mechanisms of resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics - the most widely used and effective antibiotics currently - in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and also briefly detail the existing and emergent pharmacological strategies to overcome such resistance. The global epidemiology of the four major types of bacteria that are responsible for the bulk of antimicrobial-resistant infections in the healthcare setting - methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Enterobactericeae, and Acinetobacter baumannii - are also briefly described.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antibiofilm potential of biosurfactants isolated from lactobacilli against multi-drug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biosurfactants (BS) are amphiphilic compounds produced by microbes, either on the cell surface or secreted extracellularly. BS exhibit strong antimicrobial and anti-adhesive properties, making them good candidates for applications used to combat infections. In this study, our goal was to assess the in vitro antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities of BS produced by Lactobacillus jensenii and Lactobacillus rhamnosus against clinical Multidrug Resistant (MDR) strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Cell-bound BS from both L. jensenii and L. rhamnosus were extracted and isolated. The surface activities of crude BS samples were evaluated using an oil spreading assay. The antimicrobial, anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities of both BS against the above mentioned MDR pathogens were determined. RESULTS: Surface activities for both BS ranged from 6.25 to 25 mg/ml with clear zones observed between 7 and 11 cm. BS of both L. jensenii and L. rhamnosus showed antimicrobial activities against A. baumannii, E. coli and S. aureus at 25-50 mg/ml. Anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm activities were also observed for the aforementioned pathogens between 25 and 50 mg/ml. Finally, analysis by electron microscope indicated that the BS caused membrane damage for A. baumannii and pronounced cell wall damage in S. aureus. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that BS isolated from two Lactobacilli strains has antibacterial properties against MDR strains of A. baumannii, E. coli and MRSA. Both BS also displayed anti-adhesive and anti-biofilm abilities against A. baumannii, E. coli and S. aureus. Together, these capabilities may open up possibilities for BS as an alternative therapeutic approach for the prevention and/or treatment of hospital-acquired infections.
TI  - Frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in solid organ transplantation and the risk factors for mortality.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although bacteremias caused by the 6 ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) have recently been highlighted as a serious complication in solid organ transplant (SOT), more information is urgently needed. We sought to investigate the frequency and clinical outcomes of ESKAPE bacteremia in SOT and determine the risk factors for mortality. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of bacteremia after SOT was reviewed. Risk factors for mortality caused by ESKAPE bacteremia were identified. RESULTS: Eighty-four episodes of bacteremia were caused by ESKAPE strains. Of these strains, 41 were caused by resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms. The only factor for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with ESKAPE was septic shock (odds ratio [OR] = 21.017, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.038-87.682, P < 0.001). The factors for bacteremia-related mortality independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were septic shock (OR = 16.558, 95% CI = 6.620-104.668, P = 0.003) and age >/=40 years (OR = 7.521, 95% CI = 1.196-47.292, P = 0.031). CONCLUSIONS: To improve the outcomes of transplantation, more effective therapeutic treatments are of paramount importance when older SOT recipients with bacteremia due to ESKAPE/rESKAPE organisms present with septic shock.
TI  - Outcomes of surgical site infections in orthopedic trauma surgeries in a tertiary care centre in India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical site infections (SSIs) still cause significant morbidity and mortality despite advances in trauma care. We have studied in this paper the rate of SSIs, their outcomes in patients undergoing interventions for trauma and SSI trends in developing countries. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 16-month study (May, 2011- August, 2012) was carried out. Patients undergoing interventions for orthopedic trauma were followed and assessed for SSIs and their outcomes and antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the micro-organisms isolated were noted and correlated. RESULTS: A total of 40 (4.4%) confirmed cases of SSIs were identified among 852 patients of orthopedic trauma. Based on the new CDC criteria, after ruling out cellulitis, only 24 (2.6%) were found to have SSIs. A total of 12.5% of the SSIs were detected during follow-up. Acinetobacter baumannii was the predominant organism as also Staphylococcus aureus. Outcomes observed included changes in antibiotic regime, revision surgery, readmission to hospital and deaths. CONCLUSION: SSI is prevalent in orthopaedic trauma patients and an active surveillance program will help in early management and prevention.
TI  - Preventing the transmission of multidrug-resistant organisms: modeling the relative importance of hand hygiene and environmental cleaning interventions.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hand hygiene and environmental cleaning are essential infection prevention strategies, but the relative impact of each is unknown. This information is important in assessing resource allocation. METHODS: We developed an agent-based model of patient-to-patient transmission-via the hands of transiently colonized healthcare workers and incompletely terminally cleaned rooms-in a 20-patient intensive care unit. Nurses and physicians were modeled and had distinct hand hygiene compliance levels on entry and exit to patient rooms. We simulated the transmission of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci for 1 year using data from the literature and observed data to inform model input parameters. RESULTS: We simulated 175 parameter-based scenarios and compared the effects of hand hygiene and environmental cleaning on rates of multidrug-resistant organism acquisition. For all organisms, increases in hand hygiene compliance outperformed equal increases in thoroughness of terminal cleaning. From baseline, a 2ratio1 improvement in terminal cleaning compared with hand hygiene was required to match an equal reduction in acquisition rates (eg, a 20% improvement in terminal cleaning was required to match the reduction in acquisition due to a 10% improvement in hand hygiene compliance). CONCLUSIONS: Hand hygiene should remain a priority for infection control programs, but environmental cleaning can have significant benefit for hospitals or individual hospital units that have either high hand hygiene compliance levels or low terminal cleaning thoroughness.
TI  - Highly drug-resistant pathogens implicated in burn-associated bacteremia in an Iraqi burn care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In low- and middle-income countries, bloodstream infections are an important cause of mortality in patients with burns. Increasingly implicated in burn-associated infections are highly drug-resistant pathogens with limited treatment options. We describe the epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with burns in a humanitarian surgery project in Iraq. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, descriptive study of blood culture isolates identified between July 2008 and September 2009 among patients with burns in a single hospital in Iraq who developed sepsis. RESULTS: In 1169 inpatients admitted to the burn unit during the study period, 212 (18%) had suspected sepsis, and 65 (6%) had confirmed bacteremia. Sepsis was considered the primary cause of death in 198 patients (65%; 95% CI 65-70) of the 304 patients that died. The most commonly isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22 isolates [34%]), Staphylococcus aureus (17 [26%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (8 [12%]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (7 [11%]), Acinetobacter baumannii (6 [9%]), and Enterobacter cloacae (5 [8%]). A high proportion of Enterobacteriaceae strains produced extended-spectrum beta-lactamase and S. aureus isolates were uniformly methicillin-resistant. For gram-negative bacteria, the most reliably active antibiotics were imipenen and amikacin. CONCLUSIONS: Burn patients with sepsis in Iraq were commonly found to have bloodstream pathogens resistant to most antibiotics available locally. Effective empirical therapy of burn sepsis in this region of Iraq would consist of vancomycin or teicoplanin and a carbapenem-class antibiotic with antipseudomonal activity.
TI  - Factors influencing ventilator-associated pneumonia in cancer patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With increasing survival periods and diversification of treatment methods, treatment of critically ill cancer patients has become an important factor influencing patient prognosis. Patients with cancer are at high risk of infections and subsequent complications. This study investigated the incidence and factors contributing to the development of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study investigated the incidence of VAP and factors leading to infection in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a cancer center from January 1, 2012 to December 31, 2013. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP was 2.13 cases per 1,000 days of intubation, and 13 of 288 patients (4.5%) developed VAP. Lung cancer was the most common cancer associated with VAP (N=7, 53.9%), and longer hospital stays and intubation were associated with increased VAP incidence. In the group using a "ventilator bundle," the incidence was 1.14 cases per 1,000 days compared to 2.89 cases per 1,000 days without its use; however, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.158). Age (>/= 65, OR=5.56, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.29-23.95), surgery (OR=3.78, 95%CI=1.05- 13.78), and tracheotomy (OR=4.46, 95%CI=1.00-19.85) were significant VAP risk factors. The most common causative organisms were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=4, 30.8% each), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans (N=2, 15.4% each). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of pneumonia among critically ill cancer patients is highest in those with lung cancer, but lower than among non-cancer patients. The length of hospital stay and time on mechanical ventilation are important risk factors for development of VAP. Although not statistically significant, "ventilator bundle" care is an effective intervention that delays or reduces incidence of VAP. Major risk factors for VAP include age (>/= 65 years), surgery, and tracheostomy, while fungi, gram-negative bacteria, and multidrug-resistant organisms were identified as the major causative pathogens of VAP in this study.
TI  - Recombinant scorpine produced using SUMO fusion partner in Escherichia coli has the activities against clinically isolated bacteria and inhibits the Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro.
AB  - Scorpine, a small cationic peptide from the venom of Pandinus imperator, which has been shown to have anti-bacterial and anti-plasmodial activities, has potential important applications in the pharmaceutical industries. However, the isolation of scorpine from natural sources is inefficient and time-consuming. Here, we first report the expression and purification of recombinant scorpine in Escherichia coli, using small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) fusion partner. The fusion protein was expressed in soluble form in E. coli, and expression was verified by SDS-PAGE and western blotting analysis. The fusion protein was purified to 90% purity by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni2+-NTA) resin chromatography. After the SUMO-scorpine fusion protein was cleaved by the SUMO protease, the cleaved sample was reapplied to a Ni2+-NTA column. Tricine/SDS-PAGE gel results indicated that Scorpine had been purified successfully to more than 95% purity. The recombinantly expressed Scorpine showed anti-bacterial activity against two standard bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 and Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, and clinically isolated bacteria including S. aureus S, S. aureus R, A. baumannii S, and A. baumannii R. It also produced 100% reduction in Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in vitro. Thus, the expression strategy presented in this study allowed convenient high yield and easy purification of recombinant Scorpine for pharmaceutical applications in the future.
TI  - [A prospective randomized controlled trial on effect of norvancomycin tube sealing for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection in critical patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical value of tube-sealing with norvancomycin and  heparin saline mixture for prevention of central venous catheter-related infection (CRI). METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled trial was performed. 120 patients who were admitted to department of critical care medicine from January 2012 to January 2014 were included, with their subclavian vein catheterization installation time longer than 48 hours, age over 18 years and younger than 80 years, and acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) score reaching 10-29. The patients were divided into two groups using a random number table, and finally 116 patients were enrolled. Norvancomycin and heparin saline mixture were used for tube sealing in the intervention group (n=56), while only heparin saline was used in the control group (n=60). The incidence of CRI, catheter correlated spectrum of pathogens, adverse events, mortality, hospital day, catheter retention time, and hospital costs were compared between two groups. RESULTS: (1) There was no significant difference in the incidence of CRI between intervention group and control group [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000]. There was no catheter pathogenic colonization in the intervention group, but there were 2 cases of catheter pathogenic colonization in control group. (2) A total of 7 pathogens were found in two groups. Three cases with pathogenic bacteria was found in the intervention group, with 1 case of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1 case Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1 case fungi. Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, fungi, and Acinetobacter baumannii was found in the control group, with 1 case of each. There was no significantly statistical difference between two groups (all P>0.05), but there was a decreasing trend of Gram-positive cocci infection in the intervention group. (3) There was no significant difference in the catheter thrombosis, local bleeding or hematoma, catheter dislocation and other adverse events between intervention group and control group [21.43% (12/56) vs. 23.33% (14/60), chi(2)=0.060, P=0.806]. (4) There were no significant differences in mortality [7.14% (4/56) vs. 8.33% (5/60), chi(2)=0.058, P=1.000], hospital day (35.9+/-15.2 days vs. 34.1+/-16.3 days, t=16.330, P=0.620), catheter retention time (25.0+/-4.5 days vs. 24.5+/-5.1 days, t=26.427, P=2.560) and cost of hospitalization (10 thousand Yuan: 3.42+/-1.22 vs. 3.72+/-1.30, t=13.215, P=1.560) between intervention group and control group. CONCLUSIONS: For patients with central venous catheter, application norvancomycin with heparin saline mixture for tube sealing did not reduce the incidence of CRI, the incidence of adverse events and mortality, does not reduce hospitalization time, catheter retention time and hospital costs, but may reduce the catheter colonization and infection of Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water.
AB  - AIM: Super-oxidized water is one of the broad spectrum disinfectants, which was introduced recently. There are many researches to find reliable chemicals which are effective, inexpensive, easy to obtain and use, and effective for disinfection of microorganisms leading hospital infections. Antimicrobial activity of super-oxidized water is promising. The aim of this study was to investigate the in-vitro antimicrobial activity of different concentrations of Medilox(R) super-oxidized water that is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as high level disinfectant. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this study, super-oxidized water obtained from Medilox(R) [Soosan E & C, Korea] device, which had been already installed in our hospital, was used. Antimicrobial activities of different concentrations of super-oxidized water (1/1, 1/2, 1/5, 1/10, 1/20, 1/50, 1/100) at different exposure times (1, 2, 5, 10, 30 min) against six ATCC strains, eight antibiotic resistant bacteria, yeasts and molds were evaluated using qualitative suspension test. Dey-Engley Neutralizing Broth [Sigma-Aldrich, USA] was used as neutralizing agent. RESULTS: Medilox(R) was found to be effective against all standard strains (Acinetobacter baumannii 19606, Escherichia coli 25922, Enterococcus faecalis 29212, Klebsiella pneumoniae 254988, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 27853, Staphylococcus aureus 29213), all clinical isolates (Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Myroides spp.), and all yeastsat 1/1 dilution in >/=1 minute. It was found to be effective on Aspergillus flavus at 1/1 dilution in >/=2 minutes and on certain molds in >/=5 minutes. CONCLUSION: Medilox(R) super-oxidized water is a broad spectrum, on-site producible disinfectant, which is effective on bacteria and fungi and can be used for the control of nosocomial infection.
TI  - A broad-spectrum antibiofilm peptide enhances antibiotic action against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - Biofilm-related infections account for at least 65% of all human infections, but  there are no available antimicrobials that specifically target biofilms. Their elimination by available treatments is inefficient since biofilm cells are between 10- and 1,000-fold more resistant to conventional antibiotics than planktonic cells. Here we describe the synergistic interactions, with different classes of antibiotics, of a recently characterized antibiofilm peptide, 1018, to potently prevent and eradicate bacterial biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens. Combinations of peptide 1018 and the antibiotic ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, or tobramycin were synergistic in 50% of assessments and decreased by 2- to 64-fold the concentration of antibiotic required to treat biofilms formed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella enterica, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Furthermore, in flow cell biofilm studies, combinations of low, subinhibitory levels of the peptide (0.8 mug/ml) and ciprofloxacin (40 ng/ml) decreased dispersal and triggered cell death in mature P. aeruginosa biofilms. In addition, short-term treatments with the peptide in combination with ciprofloxacin prevented biofilm formation and reduced P. aeruginosa PA14 preexisting biofilms. PCR studies indicated that the peptide suppressed the expression of various antibiotic targets in biofilm cells. Thus, treatment with the peptide represents a novel strategy to potentiate antibiotic activity against biofilms formed by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Impact of appropriate antimicrobial treatment on transition from ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis to ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Two small randomized controlled trials have suggested beneficial effects of antibiotic treatment in patients with ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT). The primary aim of this study is to determine the impact of appropriate antibiotic treatment on transition from VAT to ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in critically ill patients. The secondary objective was to determine the incidence of VAP in patients with VAT. METHODS: This was a prospective observational multicenter study. All patients with a first episode of VAT were eligible. Patients with tracheostomy at intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and those with VAP prior to VAT were excluded. VAT was defined using all the following criteria: fever > 38 degrees C with no other cause, purulent tracheal secretions, positive tracheal aspirate (>/= 10(5) cfu/mL), and absence of new infiltrate on chest X ray. Only VAP episodes diagnosed during the 96 h following VAT, and caused by the same bacteria, were taken into account. Antibiotic treatment was at the discretion of attending physicians. Risk factors for transition from VAT to VAP were determined using univariate and multivariate analysis. All variables from univariate analysis with P values <0.1 were incorporated in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One thousand seven hundred and ten patients were screened for this study. Eighty-six, and 123 patients were excluded for tracheostomy at ICU admission, and VAP prior to VAT; respectively. One hundred and twenty two (7.1%) patients were included. 17 (13.9%) patients developed a subsequent VAP. The most common microorganisms in VAT patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30%), Staphylococcus aureus (18%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10%). Seventy-four (60%) patients received antimicrobial treatment, including 58 (47.5%) patients who received appropriate antimicrobial treatment. Appropriate antibiotic treatment was the only factor independently associated with reduced risk for transition from VAT to VAP (OR [95% CI] 0.12[0.02-0.59], P = 0.009). The number of patients with VAT needed to treat to prevent one episode of VAP, or one episode of VAP related to P. aeruginosa was 5, and 34; respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate antibiotic treatment is independently associated with reduced risk for transition from VAT to VAP.
TI  - Genome Sequences of Two Carbapenemase-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST258 Isolates.
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae, an ESKAPE group (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogen, has acquired multiple antibiotic resistance genes and is becoming a serious public health threat. Here, we report the genome sequences of two representative strains of K. pneumoniae from the emerging K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) outbreak in northeast Ohio belonging to sequence type 258 (ST258) (isolates Kb140 and Kb677, which were isolated from blood and urine, respectively). Both isolates harbor a blaKPC gene, and strain Kb140 carries blaKPC-2, while Kb677 carries blaKPC-3.

TI  - Chemical constituents and antimicrobial properties of the essential oil and ethanol extract from the stem of Aglaia odorata Lour.
AB  - The stem-derived essential oil of Aglaia odorata Lour. was obtained by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type system. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of the oil revealed the identification of 39 compounds, representing 76.4% of the oil; germacrene D (20.3%), alpha-humulene (17.1%), alpha-himachalene (12.7%) and beta-caryophyllene (10.2%) were the major components. Ar-turmerone (1) and eichlerialactone (2) were isolated from the stem oil and ethanolic stem extract of this plant species, respectively. Antimicrobial activities of the oil and ethanol extract were tested against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial strains including Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, as well as three rice fungal pathogens Bipolaris oryzae, Pyricularia oryzae and Rhizoctonia solani using broth microdilution method. The oil and 1 exhibited significant antifungal activity against the three rice pathogens tested, whereas 2 exhibited good antibacterial activity against both the Gram-positive pathogens tested.
TI  - Bacteriology and antimicrobial susceptibility of ENT infections in a tropical hospital.
AB  - We conducted a retrospective observational study to determine the spectrum and antibiotic sensitivity pattern of organisms isolated in otorhinolaryngologic (ORL) infections. We reviewed the laboratory culture and sensitivity records of 4,909 patients-2,773 males (56.5%) and 2,136 females (43.5%), aged 2 to 90 years (mean: 45.3 +/- 12.6)-who had been seen at two government hospitals in Malaysia. Of this group, 4,332 patients had a respiratory tract infection (88.2%), 206 had an ear infection (4.2%), 188 had a deep neck infection (3.8%), and 183 had an oropharyngeal infection (3.7%). The most common isolated organisms were Klebsiella spp, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible S aureus, coagulase-negative S aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii. We also identified the antimicrobial susceptibility of these organisms. We conclude that since the spectrum of causative pathogens in some infections differs between tropical and nontropical areas of the world, tropical hospitals should not completely adopt the antibiotic guidelines for ORL infections that have been recommended for hospitals in nontropical regions. We hope that our review and analysis of local data will help practitioners in Malaysia develop an appropriate prescribing policy with respect to ORL pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility. The goal is to reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with these infections.
TI  - Rapid efficient synthesis and characterization of silver, gold, and bimetallic nanoparticles from the medicinal plant Plumbago zeylanica and their application in biofilm control.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nanoparticles (NPs) have gained significance in medical fields due to their high surface-area-to-volume ratio. In this study, we synthesized NPs from a medicinally important plant - Plumbago zeylanica. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous root extract of P. zeylanica (PZRE) was analyzed for the presence of flavonoids, sugars, and organic acids using high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC), gas chromatography-time of flight-mass spectrometry (GC-TOF-MS), and biochemical methods. The silver NPs (AgNPs), gold NPs (AuNPs), and bimetallic NPs (AgAuNPs) were synthesized from root extract and characterized using ultraviolet-visible spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive spectrometry (EDS), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The effects of these NPs on Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli biofilms were studied using quantitative biofilm inhibition and disruption assays, as well as using fluorescence, scanning electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. RESULTS: PZRE showed the presence of phenolics, such as plumbagin, and flavonoids, in addition to citric acid, sucrose, glucose, fructose, and starch, using HPTLC, GC-TOF-MS, and quantitative analysis. Bioreduction of silver nitrate (AgNO(3)) and chloroauric acid (HAuCl(4)) were confirmed at absorbances of 440 nm (AgNPs), 570 nm (AuNPs), and 540 nm (AgAuNPs), respectively. The maximum rate of synthesis at 50 degrees C was achieved with 5 mM AgNO(3) within 4.5 hours for AgNPs; and with 0.7 mM HAuCl4 within 5 hours for AuNPs. The synthesis of AgAuNPs, which completed within 90 minutes with 0.7 mM AgNO(3) and HAuCl(4), was found to be the fastest. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy confirmed bioreduction, while EDS and XRD patterns confirmed purity and the crystalline nature of the NPs, respectively. TEM micrographs and DLS showed about 60 nm monodispersed Ag nanospheres, 20-30 nm Au nanospheres adhering to form Au nanotriangles, and about 90 nm hexagonal blunt-ended AgAuNPs. These NPs also showed antimicrobial and antibiofilm activity against E. coli, A. baumannii, S. aureus, and a mixed culture of A. baumannii and S. aureus. AgNPs inhibited biofilm in the range of 96%-99% and AgAuNPs from 93% to 98% in single-culture biofilms. AuNPs also showed biofilm inhibition, with the highest of 98% in S. aureus. AgNPs also showed good biofilm disruption, with the highest of 88% in A. baumannii. CONCLUSION: This is the first report on rapid and efficient synthesis of AgNPs, AuNPs and AgAuNPs from P. zeylanica and their effect on quantitative inhibition and disruption of bacterial biofilms.
TI  - Polyethyleneimine and polyethyleneimine-based nanoparticles: novel bacterial and  yeast biofilm inhibitors.
AB  - Biofilms are commonly involved in medical device-related infections. The purpose  of this study was to determine the antimicrobial and anti-biofilm activity of polyethyleneimine (PEI) and PEI-based nanoparticles (nanoPEI) against Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans (clinical and ATCC strains), and to evaluate their effect upon biofilm formation on polyurethane (PUR)-like catheters. MICs and minimal lethal concentrations of PEI and nanoPEI were determined according to CLSI microdilution reference protocols. For PEI, the MIC value was 195.31 mg l(-1) for all the bacteria and 48.83 mg l(-1) for the yeast strains. For nanoPEI, the MIC value was 1250 mg l(-1) for all the strains except A. baumannii, for which it was 2500 mg l(-1). Biofilm formation was assessed with PUR-like catheter segments and biofilm metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. Plasma membrane integrity and membrane potential were assessed by flow cytometry after staining microbial cells with a membrane-impermeable dye, propidium iodide, and a membrane-potential marker, DiBAC4(3). PEI inhibited growth of all microbial species; higher concentrations of nanoPEI were needed to inhibit growth of all species. Biofilm formation in the presence of anti-bacterial PEI activity was dose-dependent (except for S. epidermidis) and species-related. NanoPEI at 0.5xMIC and MIC significantly reduced the metabolic activity of biofilms of S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii, whereas 2xMIC was required in order to inhibit biofilm metabolic activity.
TI  - Differential protection from tobramycin by extracellular polymeric substances from Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus biofilms.
AB  - We investigated biofilms of two pathogens, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus, to characterize mechanisms by which the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) found in biofilms can protect bacteria against tobramycin exposure. To do so, it is critical to study EPS-antibiotic interactions in a homogeneous environment without mass transfer limitations. Consequently, we developed a method to grow biofilms, harvest EPS, and then augment planktonic cultures with isolated EPS and tobramycin. We demonstrated that planktonic cultures respond differently to being treated with different types of EPS (A. baumannii versus S. aureus) in the presence of tobramycin. By harvesting EPS from the biofilms, we found that A. baumannii EPS acts as a "universal protector" by inhibiting tobramycin activity against bacterial cells regardless of species; S. aureus EPS did not show any protective ability in cell cultures. Adding Mg(2+) or Ca(2+) reduced the protective effect of A. baumannii EPS. Finally, when we selectively digested the proteins or DNA of the EPS, we found that the protective ability did not change, suggesting that neither has a significant role in protection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates how EPS protects pathogens against antibiotics in a homogeneous system without mass transfer limitations. Our results suggest that EPS protects biofilm communities, in part, by adsorbing antibiotics near the surface. This may limit antibiotic diffusion to the bottom of the biofilms but is not likely to be the only mechanism of protection.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance among clinical isolates recovered from a tertiary care hospital in Al Qassim, Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergences of antimicrobial-resistances have become an important  issue in global healthcares. Limitations in surveying hinder the actual estimates of resistance in many countries. THE AIM: the present study was designed to retrospectically survey antimicrobial susceptibility for resistance profiling of dominant pathogens in a tertiary-care center in Buraidah, Saudi Arabia from January-2011 to December-2011. MATERIALS AND METHODS: the design was cross-sectional and spanned records of a 1000 bacterial non-related isolates. Antibiograms were based on the 2012 Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. RESULTS: showed that Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Escherichia coli, were the most resistant. All isolates of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus, were resistant to penicillin (100%), and oxacillin with 52%, 75%, and 82%, respectively. Interestingly, an increasing trend of resistance-pattern was seen for the three species against gentamicin 26%, 50%, 68% ciprofloxacin 22%, 50%, 68%, tetracycline 30%, 44%, 27%, erythromycin 26%, 64%, 73%, and clindamycin 20%, 47%, 50% suggesting potential between-species transfer of resistances. Acinetobacter baumannii was resistances to all antibiotics tested including ciprofloxacin (90%), ceftazidime (89%), cefepime (67%), Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (66%), amikacin (63%), gentamicin (51%), tetracycline (43%), piperacillin-tazobactam (42%), and imipenem (9%). A similar pattern was seen by P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, a typical pattern of resistance in K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing organisms was observed. CONCLUSION: we have shown staphylococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and enteric bacteria were the most resistant species in this region.
TI  - Polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride shows bactericidal advantages over chlorhexidine digluconate against ESKAPE bacteria.
AB  - More information regarding the bactericidal properties of polyhexamethylene guanidine hydrochloride (PHMG) against clinically important antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) pathogens needs to be provided for its uses in infection control. The bactericidal properties of PHMG and chlorhexidine digluconate (CHG) were compared based on their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs), minimum bactericidal concentrations, and time-course-killing curves against clinically important antibiotic-susceptible and antibiotic-resistant ESKAPE pathogens. Results showed that PHMG exhibited significantly higher bactericidal activities against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, and ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacter spp. than CHG. A slight bactericidal advantage over CHG was obtained against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, ciprofloxacin- and levofloxacin-resistant Acinetobacter spp., and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. In previous reports, PHMG had higher antimicrobial activity against almost all tested Gram-negative bacteria and several Gram-positive bacteria than CHG using MIC test. These studies support the further development of covalently bound PHMG in sterile-surface materials and the incorporation of PHMG in novel disinfectant formulas.
TI  - Prevalence of nosocomial infections and anti-infective therapy in Benin: results  of the first nationwide survey in 2012.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Data on nosocomial infections in hospitals in low-income countries are scarce and often inconsistent. The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of nosocomial infections and antimicrobial drug use in Benin hospitals. METHODS: All hospitals were invited to participate in the first national point prevalence study conducted between 10-26 October 2012 using the protocol developed by the "Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance" (HELICS) project. Infection prevalence rates and the proportion of infected patients and exposure to antimicrobials were assessed. RESULTS: Overall, 87% (39/45) of hospitals participated. Of 3130 inpatients surveyed, 972 nosocomial infections were identified among 597 patients, representing an overall prevalence of infected patients of 19.1%. The most frequent infections were related to the urinary tract (48.2%), vascular catheter use (34.7%), and surgical site (24.7%). 64.6% of patients surveyed were treated with antibiotics, including a significant proportion (30%) of non-infected patients and a high proportion of self-medication (40.8%). Resistance of leading nosocomial pathogens to antimicrobials included methicillin-resistance (52.5%) among Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin resistance among enterococci (67.5%), cefotaxime resistance among Escherichia coli (67.6%), and ceftazidime resistance among Acinetobacter baumannii (100%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (68.2%). CONCLUSIONS: Benin has high nosocomial infection rates and calls for the implementation of new national infection control policies. Patient safety education and training of all individuals involved in healthcare delivery will be critical to highlight awareness of the burden of disease. The high use of antimicrobials needs to be addressed, particularly their indiscriminate use in non-infected patients.
TI  - In vitro design of a novel lytic bacteriophage cocktail with therapeutic potential against organisms causing diabetic foot infections.
AB  - In patients with diabetes mellitus, foot infections pose a significant risk. These are complex infections commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, all of which are potentially susceptible to bacteriophages. Here, we characterized five bacteriophages that we had determined previously to have antimicrobial and wound-healing potential in chronic S. aureus, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii infections. Morphological and genetic features indicated that the bacteriophages were lytic members of the family Myoviridae or Podoviridae and did not harbour any known bacterial virulence genes. Combinations of the bacteriophages had broad host ranges for the different target bacterial species. The activity of the bacteriophages against planktonic cells revealed effective, early killing at 4 h, followed by bacterial regrowth to pre-treatment levels by 24 h. Using metabolic activity as a measure of cell viability within established biofilms, we found significant cell impairment following bacteriophage exposure. Repeated treatment every 4 h caused a further decrease in cell activity. The greatest effects on both planktonic and biofilm cells occurred at a bacteriophage : bacterium input multiplicity of 10. These studies on both planktonic cells and established biofilms allowed us to better evaluate the effects of a high input multiplicity and a multiple-dose treatment protocol, and the findings support further clinical development of bacteriophage therapy.
TI  - Development of an immunochromatographic test with anti-LipL32-coupled gold nanoparticles for Leptospira detection.
AB  - Detection of antibody specific to Leptospira by various immunological techniques  has been used for leptospirosis diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of antibody detection during the first few days after infection is low. Molecular techniques are suggested to provide earlier diagnosis than antibody detection, but a rapid and easy to perform assay for Leptospira antigen detection would provide an additional useful tool for disease diagnosis. In this study, we coupled gold nanoparticles with antibody to LipL32, a protein commonly found in pathogenic Leptospira. This coupled gold reagent was used in the immunochromatographic strip for Leptospira detection. We demonstrated that the sensitivity of Leptospira detection by this strip was 10(3) ml(-1). There was no positive result detected when strips were tested with non-pathogenic Leptospira, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus group B, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Salmonella typhi, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis or Enterococcus faecium. These data suggest that gold nanoparticles coupled with antibody to LipL32 could be used for Leptospira detection by a rapid test based on an immunochromatographic technique.
TI  - Broad-spectrum anti-biofilm peptide that targets a cellular stress response.
AB  - Bacteria form multicellular communities known as biofilms that cause two thirds of all infections and demonstrate a 10 to 1000 fold increase in adaptive resistance to conventional antibiotics. Currently, there are no approved drugs that specifically target bacterial biofilms. Here we identified a potent anti-biofilm peptide 1018 that worked by blocking (p)ppGpp, an important signal in biofilm development. At concentrations that did not affect planktonic growth, peptide treatment completely prevented biofilm formation and led to the eradication of mature biofilms in representative strains of both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Salmonella Typhimurium and Burkholderia cenocepacia. Low levels of the peptide led to biofilm dispersal, while higher doses triggered biofilm cell death. We hypothesized that the peptide acted to inhibit a common stress response in target species, and that the stringent response, mediating (p)ppGpp synthesis through the enzymes RelA and SpoT, was targeted. Consistent with this, increasing (p)ppGpp synthesis by addition of serine hydroxamate or over-expression of relA led to reduced susceptibility to the peptide. Furthermore, relA and spoT mutations blocking production of (p)ppGpp replicated the effects of the peptide, leading to a reduction of biofilm formation in the four tested target species. Also, eliminating (p)ppGpp expression after two days of biofilm growth by removal of arabinose from a strain expressing relA behind an arabinose-inducible promoter, reciprocated the effect of peptide added at the same time, leading to loss of biofilm. NMR and chromatography studies showed that the peptide acted on cells to cause degradation of (p)ppGpp within 30 minutes, and in vitro directly interacted with ppGpp. We thus propose that 1018 targets (p)ppGpp and marks it for degradation in cells. Targeting (p)ppGpp represents a new approach against biofilm-related drug resistance.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of THAM Trisphenylguanide against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - This study investigated the potential antibacterial activity of three series of compounds synthesized from 12 linear and branched polyamines with 2-8 amino groups, which were substituted to produce the corresponding guanides, biguanides, or phenylguanides, against Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibacterial activity was measured for each compound by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration against the bacteria, and the toxicity towards mammalian cells was determined. The most effective compound, THAM trisphenylguanide, was studied in time-to-kill and cytoplasmic leakage assays against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, USA300) in comparison to chlorhexidine. Preliminary toxicity and MRSA challenge studies in mice were also conducted on this compound. THAM trisphenylguanide showed significant antibacterial activity (MIC approximately 1 mg/L) and selectivity against MRSA relative to all the other bacteria examined. In time-to-kill assays it showed increased antimicrobial activity against MRSA versus chlorhexidine. It induced leakage of cytoplasmic content at concentrations that did not reduce cell viability, suggesting the mechanism of action may involve membrane disruption. Using an intraperitoneal mouse model of invasive MRSA disease, THAM trisphenylguanide reduced bacterial burden locally and in deeper tissues. This study has identified a novel guanide compound with selective microbicidal activity against Staphylococcus aureus, including a methicillin-resistant (MRSA) strain.
TI  - Potent antimicrobial activity of bone cement encapsulating silver nanoparticles capped with oleic acid.
AB  - Bone cement is widely used in surgical treatments for the fixation for orthopaedic devices. Subsequently, 2-3% of patients undergoing these procedures develop infections that are both a major health risk for patients and a cost for the health service providers; this is also aggravated by the fact that antibiotics are losing efficacy because of the rising resistance of microorganisms to these substances. In this study, oleic acid capped silver nanoparticles (NP) were encapsulated into Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA)-based bone cement samples at various ratios. Antimicrobial activity against Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus, S. aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii was exhibited at NP concentrations as low as 0.05% (w/w). Furthermore, the mechanical properties and cytotoxicity of the bone cement containing these NP were assessed to guarantee that such material is safe to be used in orthopaedic surgical practice.
TI  - Paenibacterin, a novel broad-spectrum lipopeptide antibiotic, neutralises endotoxins and promotes survival in a murine model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa-induced sepsis.
AB  - Paenibacterin, produced by Paenibacillus thiaminolyticus OSY-SE, is active both against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis. Paenibacterin showed relatively low cytotoxicity against a human kidney cell line (ATCC CRL-2190), with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50)>/=109mug/mL. The cationic paenibacterin molecule binds to the negatively charged Gram-negative endotoxins in vitro, suggesting that paenibacterin can neutralise lipopolysaccharides. In a murine septic shock model, two 500mug doses of paenibacterin significantly increased the survival of mice challenged with a lethal level of P. aeruginosa. Considering that paenibacterin is effective against many strains of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, this study suggests that this antimicrobial agent is a promising candidate as a new drug.
TI  - Eliciting antibiotics active against the ESKAPE pathogens in a collection of actinomycetes isolated from mountain soils.
AB  - The rapid emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens poses a major threat for human health. In recent years, genome sequencing has unveiled many poorly expressed antibiotic clusters in actinomycetes. Here, we report a well-defined ecological collection of >800 actinomycetes obtained from sites in the Himalaya and Qinling mountains, and we used these in a concept study to see how efficiently antibiotics can be elicited against MDR pathogens isolated recently from the clinic. Using 40 different growth conditions, 96 actinomycetes were identified - predominantly Streptomyces - that produced antibiotics with efficacy against the MDR clinical isolates referred to as ESKAPE pathogens: Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and/or Enterobacter cloacae. Antimicrobial activities that fluctuated strongly with growth conditions were correlated with specific compounds, including borrelidin, resistomycin, carbomethoxy-phenazine, and 6,7,8- and 5,6,8-trimethoxy-3-methylisocoumarin, of which the latter was not described previously. Our work provided insights into the potential of actinomycetes as producers of drugs with efficacy against clinical isolates that have emerged recently and also underlined the importance of targeting a specific pathogen.
TI  - Clinical significance of surveillance culture in liver transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Routine microbiologic surveillance is a method of infection control,  but its clinical significance in transplant recipients is not known. We analyzed microbiologic data to evaluate the influence of cultured microorganisms between the point of surveillance and infectious episodes in liver transplant recipients. METHODS: We performed surveillance culture for sputum and peritoneal fluid in liver transplant recipients from January 2009 to December 2011, at the time of transplantation (T1), 5 days (T2), and 10 days (T3) postoperatively. RESULTS: Of the 179 recipients, 32.9% had a positive sputum culture result and 37.4% had a positive peritoneal culture result during surveillance. In the culture surveillance of sputum, 37 organisms were isolated from 35 recipients at T1, and the most common organism was Staphylococcus aureus (n = 13). At T2, 45 organisms were isolated from 39 recipients, including Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 10), S aureus (n = 8), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6). At T3, 18 organisms were isolated from 15 patients, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 5) and K pneumonia (n = 4). In the peritoneal fluid, 11 organisms were isolated from 10 recipients at T1, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2) and Enterococcus species (n = 2). At T2, 39 organisms were isolated from 36 recipients, including coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species (CNS; n = 8) and Enterococcus species (n = 7). At T3, 54 organisms were isolated from 51 recipients, including CNS (n = 17) and Candida species (n = 8). Among the 59 patients with positive culture results for sputum surveillance, 16.9% developed pneumonia caused by the same organisms. Among the 67 patients with positive peritoneal fluid culture, 16.4% developed an intra-abdominal infection caused by the same organisms cultured. The recipients with positive surveillance culture had a higher risk of pneumonia (20.3% [12/59] vs 1.6% [2/120]; P < .001) and intra-abdominal infection (31.3% [21/67] vs 18.7% [21/112]; P = .05). CONCLUSIONS: Periodic microbiologic surveillance may be useful in the prediction of post-transplantation pneumonia and intra-abdominal infection and could offer a potential target for empirical antimicrobial therapy in cases of infection.
TI  - Control of multi-drug-resistant pathogens with non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Non-thermal dielectric-barrier discharge plasma (non-thermal plasma)  is being investigated for use in wound healing. Alginate gel, already in clinical use, is non-toxic but has no meaningful antimicrobial property. This study reports that a non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate wound dressing has strong antimicrobial properties. METHODS: Alginate gel was treated with non-thermal plasma in room air and inoculated with bacterial pathogens. At 15 min after this, bacterial cell viability was determined by colony assay or 2,3-bis-(2-methoxy-4- nitro-5-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT) assay. The anti-biofilm efficacy of the non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel was investigated and the treated gel was tested against vascular endothelial cells for a cytotoxic effect. The proliferation and migration of bacterial cells before and after exposure to the treated gel were investigated with an in vitro wound testing assay. Scanning electron microscopy was used to observe changes in the gel surface associated with exposure to bacterial pathogens. The treated gel was tested against Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Candida albicans, and C. glabrata as representative pathogens (at 10(6)-10(9) colony-forming units [CFU]/mL), and the thickness of a plasma-treated gel dressing and distance between a glass dielectric-barrier discharge plasma probe and the gel surface were kept constant. RESULTS: Non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel exhibited a strong biocidal property and inactivated all of the pathogens included in the study at counts of 10(8) CFU/mL and within 15 sec of treatment. The treated gel inactivated 10(9) CFU/mL of the organisms within 1 min, and 3 min of exposure to the treated gel inactivated pathogens embedded in biofilms. The plasma-treated gel showed no significant cytotoxicity, and endothelial cells exposed to the treated gel proliferated and migrated well across a wound area over a period of time. Dressings made with the treated gel retained their biocidal effects for about a month. Scanning electron microscopy showed no damage to the surfaces of treated gels, but damage to the bacterial pathogens on plasma exposure. CONCLUSION: A non-thermal-plasma-treated alginate gel dressing has the clinical potential to decontaminate wounds, prevent surgical site infection, and promote wound healing.
TI  - Micro-patterned surfaces reduce bacterial colonization and biofilm formation in vitro: Potential for enhancing endotracheal tube designs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a leading hospital acquired  infection in intensive care units despite improved patient care practices and advancements in endotracheal tube (ETT) designs. The ETT provides a conduit for bacterial access to the lower respiratory tract and a substratum for biofilm formation, both of which lead to VAP. A novel microscopic ordered surface topography, the Sharklet micro-pattern, has been shown to decrease surface attachment of numerous microorganisms, and may provide an alternative strategy for VAP prevention if included on the surface of an ETT. To evaluate the feasibility of this micro-pattern for this application, the microbial range of performance was investigated in addition to biofilm studies with and without a mucin-rich medium to simulate the tracheal environment in vitro. METHODS: The top five pathogens associated with ETT-related pneumonia, Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Escherichia coli, were evaluated for attachment to micro-patterned and un-patterned silicone surfaces in a short-term colonization assay. Two key pathogens, MRSA and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, were evaluated for biofilm formation in a nutrient rich broth for four days and minimal media for 24 hours, respectively, on each surface type. P. aeruginosa was further evaluated for biofilm formation on each surface type in a mucin-modified medium mimicking tracheal mucosal secretions. Results are reported as percent reductions and significance is based on t-tests and ANOVA models of log reductions. All experiments were replicated at least three times. RESULTS: Micro-patterned surfaces demonstrated reductions in microbial colonization for a broad range of species, with up to 99.9% (p < 0.05) reduction compared to un-patterned controls. Biofilm formation was also reduced, with 67% (p = 0.12) and 52% (p = 0.05) reductions in MRSA and P. aeruginosa biofilm formation, respectively. Further, a 58% (p < 0.01) reduction was demonstrated on micro-patterned surfaces for P. aeruginosa biofilms under clinically-simulated conditions when compared to un-patterned controls. CONCLUSIONS: This engineered micro-pattern reduces the colonization and biofilm formation of key VAP-associated pathogens in vitro. Future application of this micro-pattern on endotracheal tubes may prevent or prolong the onset of VAP without the need for antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Identification of the most common pathogenic bacteria in patients with suspected  sepsis by multiplex PCR.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus spp., Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumanii have been found to be the most prevalent bacteremia-causing bacteria in patients with septicemia. Early detection of bloodstream infection (BSI) is crucial in the clinical setting. A multiplex PCR method for identification of these agents in clinical samples has been developed in parallel by conventional microbiological methods. METHODOLOGY: The target genes selected for each of the organisms were very specific for designing primers. Design of primers was done using Mega4, Allel ID6, Oligo6, and Oligo analyzer software. The test comprises a universal PCR from the 16S rDNA gene and multiplex PCR from the rpoB, gyrA, sss, and chromosome X (as an internal control). RESULTS: The sensitivity and specificity for universal PCR and multiplex PCR in comparison with BC were 83.87% and 91.58%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. The positive predictive value (PPV) and the negative predictive value (NPV) for these two PCRs were 76.47% and 94.57%, and 74.19% and 91.58%, respectively. PCR failed to identify bacteria which were found conventionally in only 3.96% and 6.34% of the cases by universal and multiplex PCR (mostly bacteria not included in the PCR cassette). In 6.34% of the cases, multiplex PCR afforded identification of bacteria, but BC showed no bacteria in the sample. CONCLUSIONS: The multiplex PCR approach facilitates the detection of bacteremia in blood samples within a few hours. Rapid detection of bacteria by multiplex PCR appears to be a valuable tool, allowing earlier pathogen-adopted antimicrobial therapy in critically ill patients.
TI  - Nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia in a community hospital intensive  care unit: a retrospective review and analysis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are causes of significant morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients. We analyzed a) the incidence and the outcome of pneumonias caused by different pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a medium-sized twenty-four bed community hospital and b) the incidence of complications of such pneumonias requiring surgical intervention such as thoracotomy and decortication. RESULTS: We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients diagnosed with nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia in our ICU. Their bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and sputum cultures, antibiograms, and other clinical characteristics, including complications and need for tracheostomy, thoracotomy and decortication were studied. In a span of one year (2011-12), 43 patients were diagnosed with nosocomial pneumonia in our ICU. The median simplified acute physiology score (SAPS II) was 39. One or more gram negative organisms as the causative agents were present in 85% of microbiologic samples. The three most prevalent gram negatives were Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (34%), Pseudomonas aeurginosa (40%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (32%). Twenty eight percent of bronchoalveolar samples contained Staphylococcus aureus. Eight three percent of patients required mechanical ventilation postoperatively and 37% underwent tracheostony. Thirty five percent underwent thoracotomy and decortication because of further complications such as empyema and non-resolving parapneumonic effusions. A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumonia extended spectrum beta lactam (ESBL) and P. aeurginosa had the highest prevalence of multi drug resistance (MDR). Fifteen patients required surgical intervention. Mortality from pneumonia was 37% and from surgery was 2%. CONCLUSION: Nosocomial pneumonias, in particular the ones that were caused by gram negative drug resistant organisms and their ensuing complications which required thoracotomy and decortication, were the cause of significant morbidity in our intensive care unit. Preventative and more intensive and novel infection control interventions in reducing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonias are strongly emphasized.
TI  - A rapid synthesis of 4-oxazolidinones: total synthesis of synoxazolidinones A and B.
AB  - A five-step total synthesis of the marine natural product synoxazolidinone A was  achieved through a diastereoselective imine acylation/cyclization cascade. Synoxazolidinone B and a series of analogues were also prepared to explore the potential of these 4-oxazolidinone natural products as antimicrobial agents. These studies confirmed the importance of the chlorine substituent for antimicrobial activity and revealed simplified dichloro derivatives that are equally potent against several bacterial strains.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms and risk factors for carriage in long-term care facilities: a nested case-control study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are a potentially important reservoir of multidrug-resistant (MDR) organisms; however, limited data exist. METHODS: A point-prevalence study was conducted in four co-located LTCFs in Australia. Nasal and rectal swabs were cultured for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) and MDR Gram-negative bacilli (GNB). Molecular typing and resistance detection were performed. Risk factors for colonization with an MDR organism were determined using a nested case-control study. RESULTS: Consent was obtained from 115 (85%) of 136 eligible participants. Forty-one (36%) residents carried at least one type of MDR organism. The prevalence was 16% MRSA (n = 18), 6% VRE (n = 7) and 21% MDR GNB [n = 24; including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 12) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 6)]. The majority of ESBL-producing E. coli and A. baumannii were clonal. Current wound management [adjusted OR (AOR) 8.81 (95% CI 2.78-27.94), P < 0.001], medical device in situ [AOR 5.58 (95% CI 1.34-23.32), P = 0.018] and pressure ulcer [AOR 3.69 (95% CI 1.06-12.86), P = 0.04] were independent risk factors for MDR organism colonization. Advanced dementia [AOR 3.54 (95% CI 1.23-10.23), P = 0.02] and prolonged antibiotic use [AOR 2.95 (95% CI 1.01-8.60), P = 0.047] were independently associated with MRSA colonization, whilst current wound management [AOR 15.59 (95% CI 4.85-50.10), P < 0.001] and fluoroquinolone use [AOR 4.27 (95% CI 1.20-15.25), P = 0.025] were risk factors for MDR GNB colonization. CONCLUSIONS: LTCFs are an important reservoir of MDR organisms, with person-to-person transmissions being a potential issue. We have identified several predictors of colonization with MDR organisms, allowing a more targeted management of high-risk residents.
TI  - [Analysis of drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and use of antibiotics in  burn wards during 6 years].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the distribution characteristics of pathogens, the drug resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and the use of antibiotics against Gram negative bacilli (GNB) in burn wards, so as to provide a guide for future treatment. METHODS: A total of 2 758 strains of pathogens were isolated from specimens of wound excretion, venous catheter attachment, blood, stool, urine, and sputum from 7 441 patients hospitalized in our burn wards from January 2007 to December 2012. After being identified by API strips and automatic microorganism identification and drug sensitivity analyzer, drug resistance of all the pathogens to 13 antibiotics commonly used in clinic, including amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, etc., was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The defined daily doses per 1 000 patient-day of 5 antibiotics including amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, ceftazidime, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin each year was set as use intensity. The WHONET 5.6 software was used to analyze the distribution of pathogens and the drug resistance of PA to 13 antibiotics. The SPSS 19.0 software was used to analyze the relation between changes in drug-resistant rates of PA to 13 antibiotics and year, the relation between the proportion of PA in all the pathogens and the use intensity of 5 antibiotics commonly used against GNB, and the relation between the use intensity of ciprofloxacin and the change in drug-resistant rates of PA to amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem with Pearson correlation analysis. RESULTS: (1) In 6 years, Staphylococcus aureus ranked the first with the highest proportion (31%, 865/2 758). The proportion of PA increased to tie in with Acinetobacter baumannii (both accounting for 17%, 458/2 758), both taking the second place. (2) Drug-resistant rates of PA to amikacin, gentamicin, aztreonam, piperacillin, cefoperazone, cefepime, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam, imipenem, and meropenem were significantly increased and positively correlated with year (with r values from 0.844 to 0.988, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while the drug-resistant rate of PA to ciprofloxacin was decreased and negatively correlated with year (r = -0.836, P < 0.05). (3) In 6 years, the use intensity of amikacin (from 8.65 to 91.44), cefoperazone/sulbactam (from 9.62 to 63.56), imipenem (from 7.63 to 157.25), ceftazidime (from 18.39 to 86.11), and ciprofloxacin (from 0 to 19.77) was increased. (4) The proportion of PA in all the pathogens was positively correlated with the use intensity of imipenem and ciprofloxacin (with r values respectively 0.849, 0.933, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01), while it was not significantly correlated with the use intensity of amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, or ceftazidime (with r values respectively 0.672, 0.668, 0.794, P values all above 0.05). (5) The use intensity of ciprofloxacin was positively correlated with the drug-resistant rates of PA to amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem (with r values respectively 0.878, 0.934, 0.928, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our burn wards, drug-resistant PA was prevalent, with positive correlation with the use intensity of antibiotics. The sensitive rate can be increased by a decrease in the use of amikacin, cefoperazone/sulbactam, and imipenem periodically.
TI  - Value of American Thoracic Society guidelines in predicting infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant organisms in critically ill patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The incidence rate of infection by multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) can affect the accuracy of etiological diagnosis when using American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines. We determined the accuracy of the ATS guidelines in predicting infection or colonization by MDROs over 18 months at a single ICU in eastern China. METHODS: This prospective observational study examined consecutive patients who were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in Nanjing, China. MDROs were defined as bacteria that were resistant to at least three antimicrobial classes, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii. Screening for MDROs was performed at ICU admission and discharge. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDROs were recorded, and the accuracy of the ATS guidelines in predicting infection or colonization with MDROs was documented. RESULTS: There were 610 patients, 225 (37%) of whom were colonized or infected with MDROs at ICU admission, and this increased to 311 (51%) at discharge. At admission, the sensitivity (70.0%), specificity (31.6%), positive predictive value (38.2%), and negative predictive value (63.5%), all based on ATS guidelines for infection or colonization with MDROs were low. The negative predictive value was greater in patients from departments with MDRO infection rates of 31-40% than in patients from departments with MDRO infection rates of 30% or less and from departments with MDRO infection rates more than 40%. CONCLUSION: ATS criteria were not reliable in predicting infection or colonization with MDROs in our ICU. The negative predictive value was greater in patients from departments with intermediate rates of MDRO infection than in patients from departments with low or high rates of MDRO infection. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01667991.
TI  - Next science wound gel technology, a novel agent that inhibits biofilm development by gram-positive and gram-negative wound pathogens.
AB  - Loss of the skin barrier facilitates the colonization of underlying tissues with  various bacteria, where they form biofilms that protect them from antibiotics and host responses. Such wounds then become chronically infected. Topical antimicrobials are a major component of chronic wound therapy, yet currently available topical antimicrobials vary in their effectiveness on biofilm-forming pathogens. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of Next Science wound gel technology (NxtSc), a novel topical agent designed to kill planktonic bacteria, penetrate biofilms, and kill the bacteria within. In vitro quantitative analysis, using strains isolated from wounds, showed that NxtSc inhibited biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae by inhibiting bacterial growth. The gel formulation NxtSc-G5, when applied to biofilms preformed by these pathogens, reduced the numbers of bacteria present by 7 to 8 log10 CFU/disc or CFU/g. In vivo, NxtSc-G5 prevented biofilm formation for 72 h when applied at the time of wounding and infection and eliminated biofilm infection when applied 24 h after wounding and infection. Storage of NxtSc-G5 at room temperature for 9 months did not diminish its efficacy. These results establish that NxtSc is efficacious in vitro and in vivo in preventing infection and biofilm development by different wound pathogens when applied immediately and in eliminating biofilm infection already established by these pathogens. This novel antimicrobial agent, which is nontoxic and has a usefully long shelf life, shows promise as an effective agent for the prevention and treatment of biofilm-related infections.
TI  - Inhibition of RND-type efflux pumps confers the FtsZ-directed prodrug TXY436 with activity against Gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Infections caused by Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are often difficult to treat, with the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains further restricting clinical treatment options. As a result, there is an acute need for the development of new therapeutic agents active against Gram-negative bacteria. The bacterial protein FtsZ has recently been demonstrated to be a viable antibacterial target for treating infections caused by the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus in mouse model systems. Here, we investigate whether an FtsZ-directed prodrug (TXY436) that is effective against S. aureus can also target Gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli. We find that the conversion product of TXY436 (PC190723) can bind E. coli FtsZ and inhibit its polymerization/bundling in vitro. However, PC190723 is intrinsically inactive against wild-type E. coli, with this inactivity being derived from the actions of the efflux pump AcrAB. Mutations in E. coli AcrAB render the mutant bacteria susceptible to TXY436. We further show that chemical inhibition of AcrAB in E. coli, as well as its homologs in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii, confers all three Gram-negative pathogens with susceptibility to TXY436. We demonstrate that the activity of TXY436 against E. coli and K. pneumoniae is bactericidal in nature. Evidence for FtsZ-targeting and inhibition of cell division in Gram-negative bacteria by TXY436 is provided by the induction of a characteristic filamentous morphology when the efflux pump has been inhibited as well as by the lack of functional Z-rings upon TXY436 treatment.
TI  - Prevalence and risk factors for antibiotic-resistant community-associated bloodstream infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotic resistance is increasing in many community settings. The purpose of this study was to determine the proportion of antibiotic resistant community-associated bloodstream infections (CA-BSIs) present on hospital admissions to identify risk factors for acquiring resistant versus susceptible CA-BSIs and to describe the incidence of concurrent infections with CA-BSIs. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients discharged from one community, one pediatric, and two tertiary/quaternary care hospitals within an academically affiliated network in the borough of Manhattan in New York, NY, from 2006 to 2008. The CA-BSIs present at hospital admission were defined as BSIs occurring within the first 48h of hospitalization. Infections and patient characteristics were identified using data available from patients' electronic medical records and discharge records. RESULTS: In total, 1677 CA-BSIs were identified. Staphylococcus aureus had the largest proportion of resistance (41.2%), followed by enterococcal species (24.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.2%), Streptococcus pneumoniae (16.6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.0%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.9%). Significant predictors of resistance were prior residence in a skilled nursing facility (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.39-4.70), advanced age (1.01; 1.002-1.02), presence of malignancy (0.58; 0.37-0.91), prior hospitalization (1.62; 1.17-2.23), a weighted Charlson score (1.09; 1.02-1.17) for S. aureus, presence of malignancy (1.82; 1.004-3.30), prior hospitalizations (2.03; 1.12-3.38) for enterococcal species, and younger age for S. pneumoniae (p=0.02). Urinary tract infections were the most common concurrent infection (n=45/87, 51.7%). CONCLUSION: Over 27% of the CA-BSIs present on admission were antibiotic resistant. Understanding the prevalence and risk factors for CA-BSIs may help improve empiric antibiotic therapy and outcomes for patients with community-onset infections.
TI  - Bacteriological study of neonatal sepsis and antibiotic susceptibility pattern of isolates in Kathmandu, Nepal.
AB  - Bloodstream infections in neonates are life-threatening emergencies. Identification of the common bacteria causing such infections and their susceptibility patterns will provide necessary information for timely intervention. This study was done to determine the prevalence of neonatal septicaemia, identify the bacterial isolates and study their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern in neonates admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit of Nepal Medical College Teaching Hospital (NMCTH), Kathmandu, Nepal. This descriptive-analytical study was conducted in NMCTH from July 2011 to January 2012. Blood culture of all neonates who were suspected for neonatal sepsis was performed. Bacterial isolation, identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing were done by standard microbiological method. Out of 120 neonates suspected of having neonatal sepsis, 30.8% (37/120) were blood culture positive (i.e. prevalence = 30.8%). The most common causative agents of neonatal sepsis was Staphylococcus aureus (56.8%; 21/37) followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae (21.7%; 8/37), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.4%; 5/37) and others. Neonatal sepsis was more frequent in male neonates (32.5%) while (26.5%) in female neonates in the ratio of 1.2:1 (p > 0.05). Neonatal sepsis was significantly higher (58.3%) in low birth weight (LBW) (< 2.5kg) neonates compared with good birth weight (GBW) (23.9%) (< 0.05). Prevalence was higher in preterm neonates (57.8%; 11/19) as compared with term-babies (25.7%) (P = 0.05). Generally, all of the isolates were sensitive to most of the antibiotics used as the first line drugs like amikacin, gentamicin, cefotaxime and ampicillin except Acinetobacter baumannii. This organisms was only sensitive towards cotrimoxazole, azithromicin, cefotaxime and ceftazidime.
TI  - Evaluation of the effects of ultraviolet light on bacterial contaminants inoculated into whole milk and colostrum, and on colostrum immunoglobulin G.
AB  - Raw milk and colostrum can harbor dangerous microorganisms that can pose serious  health risks for animals and humans. According to the USDA, more than 58% of calves in the United States are fed unpasteurized milk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of UV light on reduction of bacteria in milk and colostrum, and on colostrum IgG. A pilot-scale UV light continuous (UVC) flow-through unit (45 J/cm(2)) was used to treat milk and colostrum. Colostrum and sterile whole milk were inoculated with Listeria innocua, Mycobacterium smegmatis, Salmonella serovar Typhimurium, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus agalactiae, and Acinetobacter baumannii before being treated with UVC. During UVC treatment, samples were collected at 5 time points and bacteria were enumerated using selective media. The effect of UVC on IgG was evaluated using raw colostrum from a nearby dairy farm without the addition of bacteria. For each colostrum batch, samples were collected at several different time points and IgG was measured using ELISA. The UVC treatment of milk resulted in a significant final count (log cfu/mL) reduction of Listeria monocytogenes (3.2 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Salmonella spp. (3.7 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), Escherichia coli (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), Staph. aureus (3.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Streptococcus spp. (3.4 +/- 0.4 log cfu/mL reduction), and A. baumannii (2.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of milk did not result in a significant final count (log cfu/mL) reduction for M. smegmatis (1.8 +/- 0.5 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of colostrum was significantly associated with a final reduction of bacterial count (log cfu/mL) of Listeria spp. (1.4 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Salmonella spp. (1.0 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), and Acinetobacter spp. (1.1 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), but not of E. coli (0.5 +/- 0.3 log cfu/mL reduction), Strep. agalactiae (0.8 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction), and Staph. aureus (0.4 +/- 0.2 log cfu/mL reduction). The UVC treatment of colostrum significantly decreased the IgG concentration, with an observed final mean IgG reduction of approximately 50%. Development of new methods to reduce bacterial contaminants in colostrum must take into consideration the barriers imposed by its opacity and organic components, and account for the incidental damage to IgG caused by manipulating colostrum.
TI  - Contamination of medical charts: an important source of potential infection in hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This prospective study aims to identify and compare the incidence of bacterial contamination of hospital charts and the distribution of species responsible for chart contamination in different units of a tertiary hospital. METHODS: All beds in medical, surgical, pediatric, and obstetric-gynecologic general wards (556) and those in corresponding special units (125) including medical, surgical, pediatric intensive care units (ICUs), the obstetric tocolytic unit and delivery room were surveyed for possible chart contamination. The outer surfaces of included charts were sampled by one experienced investigator with sterile cotton swabs rinsed with normal saline. RESULTS: For general wards and special units, the overall sampling rates were 81.8% (455/556) and 85.6% (107/125) (p = 0.316); the incidence of chart contamination was 63.5% and 83.2%, respectively (p<0.001). Except for obstetric-gynecologic charts, the incidence was significantly higher in each and in all ICUs than in corresponding wards. Coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common contaminant in general wards (40.0%) and special units (34.6%) (p>0.05). Special units had a significantly higher incidence of bacterial contamination due to Staphylococcus aureus (17.8%), Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (9.3%), Streptococcus viridans (9.4%), Escherichia coli (11.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7.5%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (7.5%). Logistic regression analysis revealed the incidence of chart contamination was 2- to 4-fold higher in special units than in general wards [odds ratios: 1.97-4.00]. CONCLUSIONS: Noting that most hospital charts are contaminated, our study confirms that a hospital chart is not only a medical record but also an important source of potential infection. The plastic cover of the medical chart can harbor potential pathogens, thus acting as a vector of bacteria. Additionally, chart contamination is more common in ICUs. These findings highlight the importance of effective hand-washing before and after handling medical charts. However, managers and clinical staff should pay more attention to the issue and may consider some interventions.
TI  - Drug resistance analysis of bacterial strains isolated from burn patients.
AB  - This study aimed to analyze the spectrum and drug resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients to provide a reference for rational clinical use of antibiotics. Up to 1914 bacterial strain specimens isolated from burn patients admitted to hospital between 2001 and 2010 were subjected to resistance monitoring by using the K-B paper disk method. Retrospective analysis was performed on drug resistance analysis of burn patients. The top eight bacterium strains according to detection rate. A total of 1355 strains of Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria and 559 strains of Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria were detected. The top eight bacterium strains, according to detection rate, were Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Enterococcus. Drug resistance rates were higher than 90% in A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus, which accounted for 52.2, 21.7, 27.8, and 33.3%, respectively, of the entire sample. Those with drug resistance rates lower than 30% accounted for 4.3, 30.4, 16.7, and 16.7%, respectively. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis (MRSE) accounted for 49.2 and 76.4% of the S. epidermis and S. aureus resistance, respectively. Antibacterial drugs that had drug resistance rates to MRSE and MRSA higher than 90% accounted for 38.9 and 72.2%, respectively, whereas those with lower than 30% drug resistance rates accounted for 11.1 and 16.7%, respectively. The burn patients enrolled in the study were mainly infected with G(-) bacteria. These results strongly suggest that clinicians should practice rational use of antibiotics based on drug susceptibility test results.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of various fractions of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour.  Fen Ke) seed extract.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of longan (Dimocarpus longan Lour. Fen ke) seed extracts were investigated using a disc diffusion method and also determining the minimal inhibitory concentration. The DL-P01-SI01 fraction showed that the strongest activity against Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant S. aureus at MIC 64 mug/mL, which was found to be due to the phenolic compounds. The HPLC analysis showed that the major phenolic compounds are gallic acid, corilagin, ethyl gallate and ellagic acid.
TI  - In Vitro antibacterial efficacy of 21 Indian timber-yielding plants against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing urinary tract infection.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To screen methanolic leaf extracts of 21 timber-yielding plants for antibacterial activity against nine species of uropathogenic bacteria isolated from clinical samples of a hospital (Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). METHODS: Bacterial strains were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests by the Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method. The antibacterial potentiality of leaf extracts was monitored by the agar-well diffusion method with multidrug-resistant (MDR) strains of nine uropathogens. RESULTS: Two Gram-positive isolates, E. faecalis and S. aureus, were resistant to 14 of the 18 antibiotics used. Gram-negative isolates A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, E. coli, K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were resistant to 10, 12, 9, 11, 11, 10, and 11 antibiotics, respectively, of the 14 antibiotics used. Methanolic leaf extracts of Anogeissus acuminata had the maximum zone of inhibition size-29 mm against S. aureus and 28 mm against E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa. Cassia tora had 29 mm as the zone of inhibition size for E. faecalis, E. aerogenes, and P. aeruginosa. Based on the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentration values, the most effective 10 plants against uropathogens could be arranged in decreasing order as follows: C. tora > A. acuminata > Schleichera oleosa > Pterocarpus santalinus > Eugenia jambolana > Bridelia retusa > Mimusops elengi > Stereospermum kunthianum > Tectona grandis > Anthocephalus cadamba. The following eight plants had moderate control capacity: Artocarpus heterophyllus, Azadirachta indica, Dalbergia latifolia, Eucalyptus citriodora, Gmelina arborea, Pongamia pinnata, Pterocarpus marsupium, and Shorea robusta. E. coli, followed by A. baumannii, C. freundii, E. aerogenes, P. mirabilis, and P. aeruginosa were controlled by higher amounts/levels of leaf extracts. Phytochemicals of all plants were qualitatively estimated. CONCLUSIONS: A majority of timber-yielding plants studied had in vitro control capacity against MDR uropathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Photodynamic inactivation of multidrug-resistant bacteria in hospital wastewaters: influence of residual antibiotics.
AB  - One environmental concern related to hospital effluents is discharge of them without preliminary treatment. Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) may represent an alternative to the traditional expensive, unsafe and not always effective disinfection methods. The main goal of this work was to assess the efficiency of PDI on clinical multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in hospital wastewaters in order to evaluate its potential use in treating hospital effluents. The efficiency of PDI was assessed using a cationic porphyrin as the photosensitizer (PS), four MDR bacteria either in phosphate buffered saline or in filtrated hospital wastewaters. The synergistic effect of PDI and antibiotics (ampicillin and chloramphenicol) was also evaluated, as well as the effect of the surfactant sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The results show the efficient inactivation of MDR bacteria in PBS (reduction of 6-8 log after 270 min of irradiation at 40 W m(-2) with 5.0 muM of PS). In wastewater, the inactivation of the four MDR bacteria was again efficient and the decrease in bacterial survival starts even sooner. A faster decrease in bacterial survival occurred when PDI was combined with the addition of antibiotics, at sub-inhibitory and inhibitory concentrations, but the SDS did not affect the PDI efficiency. It can be concluded that PDI has potential to be an effective alternative for the inactivation of MDR bacteria in hospital wastewaters and that the presence of antibiotics may enhance its effectiveness.
TI  - Bugs, hosts and ICU environment: countering pan-resistance in nosocomial microbiota and treating bacterial infections in the critical care setting.
AB  - ICUs are areas where resistance problems are the largest, and these constitute a  major problem for the intensivist's clinical practice. Main resistance phenotypes among nosocomial microbiota are (i) vancomycin-resistance/heteroresistance and tolerance in grampositives (MRSA, enterococci) and (ii) efflux pumps/enzymatic resistance mechanisms (ESBLs, AmpC, metallo-betalactamases) in gramnegatives. These phenotypes are found at different rates in pathogens causing respiratory (nosocomial pneumonia/ventilator-associated pneumonia), bloodstream (primary bacteremia/catheter-associated bacteremia), urinary, intraabdominal and surgical wound infections and endocarditis in the ICU. New antibiotics are available to overcome non-susceptibility in grampositives; however, accumulation of resistance traits in gramnegatives has led to multidrug resistance, a worrisome problem nowadays. This article reviews microorganism/infection risk factors for multidrug resistance, suggesting adequate empirical treatments. Drugs, patient and environmental factors all play a role in the decision to prescribe/recommend antibiotic regimens in the specific ICU patient, implying that intensivists should be familiar with available drugs, environmental epidemiology and patient factors.
TI  - Effect of proton pump inhibitors on in vitro activity of tigecycline against several common clinical pathogens.
AB  - In this study, we evaluated the effect of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) on in vitro antimicrobial activity of tigecycline against several species of clinical pathogens. Clinical non-duplicate isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis and three species of Enterobacteriaceae (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia and Enterobacter cloacae) were collected from a tertiary hospital and their MICs of tigecycline alone and in combination with PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole) were determined. With one randomly selected isolate of each bacterial species, an in vitro time-kill study was performed for the confirmation of the effect of PPIs on tigecycline activity. The MIC changes after PPIs addition correlated with the PPIs concentrations in the test media. Compared with tigecycline alone, the addition of 5 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 0 to 2-fold and the addition of 50 mg/L PPIs could increase the MICs of tigecycline by 4 to >128-fold. The time-kill study confirmed that the addition of PPIs could affect the in vitro activity of tigecycline. Even at low concentration (5 mg/L) of omeprazole and pantoprazole, antagonistic effect could be observed in E. cloacae and E. faecalis strains. We conclude that In vitro activity of tigecycline can be influenced by the presence of PPIs in a concentration-dependent manner.
TI  - Biosynthetic enhancement of the detection of bacteria by the polymerase chain reaction.
AB  - Molecular viability testing (MVT) was previously reported to specifically detect  viable bacterial cells in complex samples. In MVT, brief nutritional stimulation induces viable cells, but not non-viable cells, to produce abundant amounts of species-specific ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA). Quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) is used to quantify specific pre-rRNAs in a stimulated aliquot relative to a non-stimulated control. In addition to excluding background signal from non-viable cells and from free DNA, we report here that MVT increases the analytical sensitivity of qPCR when detecting viable cells. Side-by-side limit-of-detection comparisons showed that MVT is 5-fold to >10-fold more sensitive than standard (static) DNA-targeted qPCR when detecting diverse bacterial pathogens (Aeromonas hydrophila, Acinetobacter baumannii, Listeria monocytogenes, Mycobacterium avium, and Staphylococcus aureus) in serum, milk, and tap water. Sensitivity enhancement may come from the elevated copy number of pre-rRNA relative to genomic DNA, and also from the ratiometric measurement which reduces ambiguity associated with weak or borderline signals. We also report that MVT eliminates false positive signals from bacteria that have been inactivated by moderately elevated temperatures (pasteurization), a condition that can confound widely-used cellular integrity tests that utilize membrane-impermeant compounds such as propidium iodide (PI) or propidium monoazide (PMA) to differentiate viable from inactivated bacteria. MVT enables the sensitive and specific detection of very small numbers of viable bacteria in complex matrices.
TI  - Transferrin iron starvation therapy for lethal bacterial and fungal infections.
AB  - New strategies to treat antibiotic-resistant infections are urgently needed. We serendipitously discovered that stem cell conditioned media possessed broad antimicrobial properties. Biochemical, functional, and genetic assays confirmed that the antimicrobial effect was mediated by supra-physiological concentrations of transferrin. Human transferrin inhibited growth of gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus), gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungal (Candida albicans) pathogens by sequestering iron and disrupting membrane potential. Serial passage in subtherapeutic transferrin concentrations resulted in no emergence of resistance. Infected mice treated with intravenous human transferrin had improved survival and reduced microbial burden. Finally, adjunctive transferrin reduced the emergence of rifampin-resistant mutants of S. aureus in infected mice treated with rifampin. Transferrin is a promising, novel antimicrobial agent that merits clinical investigation. These results provide proof of principle that bacterial infections can be treated in vivo by attacking host targets (ie, trace metal availability) rather than microbial targets.
TI  - Antibiofilm and antimicrobial efficacy of DispersinB(R)-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel against chronic wound infection associated bacteria.
AB  - The medical importance of bacterial biofilms has increased with the recognition of biofilms as one of the major contributors to the slow or non-healing chronic wounds such as diabetic foot ulcers, venous leg ulcers, and pressure ulcers. Being a protected community of microorganisms, biofilms are notoriously refractory to antibiotic treatments. As the conventional treatment modalities have proven ineffective, this study provides the in vitro evidence to support the use of a novel combination of DispersinB((R)) antibiofilm enzyme that inhibits biofilm formation and disperses preformed biofilm, and thus making the biofilm bacteria more susceptible to a broad-spectrum KSL-W antimicrobial peptide. The combination of DispersinB((R)) and KSL-W peptide showed synergistic antibiofilm and antimicrobial activity against chronic wound infection associated biofilm-embedded bacteria such as Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CoNS), and Acinetobacter baumannii. In addition, the wound gel formulation comprising DispersinB((R)), KSL-W peptide, and a gelling agent Pluronic F-127 showed a broad-spectrum and enduring antimicrobial activity against test organisms. Furthermore, as compared to commercial wound gel Silver-Sept, DispersinB((R))-KSL-W peptide-based wound gel was significantly more effective in inhibiting the biofilm-embedded MRSA, S. epidermidis, CoNS, Vancomycin-resistant Enterococci, A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P < 0.05). Thus, this study provides promising evidence for the potential application of antibiofilm-antimicrobial DispersinB((R))-KSL-W wound gel in chronic wound management.
TI  - Infection prevention control bundle of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus: which one is more important?
AB  
TI  - Cold air plasma to decontaminate inanimate surfaces of the hospital environment.
AB  - The hospital environment harbors bacteria that may cause health care-associated infections. Microorganisms, such as multiresistant bacteria, can spread around the patient's inanimate environment. Some recently introduced biodecontamination approaches in hospitals have significant limitations due to the toxic nature of the gases and the length of time required for aeration. This study evaluated the in vitro use of cold air plasma as an efficient alternative to traditional methods of biodecontamination of hospital surfaces. Cultures of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii were applied to different materials similar to those found in the hospital environment. Artificially contaminated sections of marmoleum, mattress, polypropylene, powder-coated mild steel, and stainless steel were then exposed to a cold air pressure plasma single jet for 30 s, 60 s, and 90 s, operating at approximately 25 W and 12 liters/min flow rate. Direct plasma exposure successfully reduced the bacterial load by log 3 for MRSA, log 2.7 for VRE, log 2 for ESBL-producing E. coli, and log 1.7 for A. baumannii. The present report confirms the efficient antibacterial activity of a cold air plasma single-jet plume on nosocomial bacterially contaminated surfaces over a short period of time and highlights its potential for routine biodecontamination in the clinical environment.
TI  - Host-defense peptides with therapeutic potential from skin secretions of frogs from the family pipidae.
AB  - Skin secretions from frogs belonging to the genera Xenopus, Silurana, Hymenochirus, and Pseudhymenochirus in the family Pipidae are a rich source of host-defense peptides with varying degrees of antimicrobial activities and cytotoxicities to mammalian cells. Magainin, peptide glycine-leucine-amide (PGLa), caerulein-precursor fragment (CPF), and xenopsin-precursor fragment (XPF) peptides have been isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions from several species of Xenopus and Silurana. Hymenochirins and pseudhymenochirins have been isolated from Hymenochirus boettgeri and Pseudhymenochirus merlini. A major obstacle to the development of these peptides as anti-infective agents is their hemolytic activities against human erythrocytes. Analogs of the magainins, CPF peptides and hymenochirin-1B with increased antimicrobial potencies and low cytotoxicities have been developed that are active (MIC < 5 muM) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Despite this, the therapeutic potential of frog skin peptides as anti-infective agents has not been realized so that alternative clinical applications as anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-diabetic, or immunomodulatory drugs are being explored.
TI  - Human platelet gel supernatant inactivates opportunistic wound pathogens on skin.
AB  - Activation of human platelets produces a gel-like substance referred to as platelet rich plasma or platelet gel. Platelet gel is used clinically to promote wound healing; it also exhibits antimicrobial properties that may aid in the healing of infected wounds. The purpose of this study was to quantify the efficacy of human platelet gel against the opportunistic bacterial wound pathogens Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus on skin. These opportunistic pathogens may exhibit extensive antibiotic resistance, necessitating the development of alternative treatment options. The antimicrobial efficacy of platelet gel supernatants was quantified using an in vitro broth dilution assay, an ex vivo inoculated skin assay, and in an in vivo skin decontamination assay. Human platelet gel supernatants were highly bactericidal against A. baumannii and moderately but significantly bactericidal against S. aureus in vitro and in the ex vivo skin model. P. aeruginosa was not inactivated in vitro; a low but significant inactivation level was observed ex vivo. These supernatants were quite effective at inactivating a model organism on skin in vivo. These results suggest application of platelet gel has potential clinical applicability, not only in the acceleration of wound healing, but also against relevant bacteria causing wound infections.
TI  - Epidemiology and clinical features of post-transplant bloodstream infection: an analysis of 222 consecutive liver transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infection (BSI) is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in liver transplant (LT) recipients. This study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and clinical features of post-transplant BSI in LT recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The microbiology, frequency, and outcome of post-transplant BSI in the first year after LT were retrospectively analyzed in 222 consecutive patients who had received liver transplants at a single center between 2005 and 2011. The risk factors for post-transplant BSI and death were evaluated. RESULTS: During a 1-year period after LT, 112 episodes of BSI occurred in 64 of the 222 patients (28.8%). A total of 135 microorganisms were isolated from 112 BSI episodes including 18 polymicrobial episodes. The median time to BSI onset ranged from 8 days for Klebsiella pneumoniae to 101 days for enterococci, and the overall median for all microorganisms was 28 days. The most frequent pathogens were Enterobacteriaceae members (32.5%), enterococci (17.8%), yeasts (14.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.3%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (10.3%); most of them showed resistance to major antibiotics. The major sources of BSI were biliary tract (36.2%), abdominal and/or wound (28.1%), and intravascular catheter (18.5%) infections. The independent risk factors for post-transplant BSI were biliary complications (odds ratio [OR]: 2.91, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.29 to 6.59, P = 0.010) and longer hospitalization in the intensive care unit (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.08, P < 0.001) after LT. BSI was an independent risk factor for death (hazard ratio [HR]: 3.92, 95% CI: 2.22 to 6.91, P < 0.001), with a poorer survival rate observed in patients with BSI than in those without BSI (1-year survival rate: 60.0% versus 89.5%, respectively, P < 0.001) after LT. The strongest predictors for death in patients with BSI were hepatocellular carcinoma (HR: 3.82, 95% CI: 1.57 to 9.32, P = 0.003), candidemia (HR: 3.71, 95% CI: 1.58 to 8.71, P = 0.003), polymicrobial bacteremia (HR: 3.18, 95% CI: 1.39 to 7.28, P = 0.006), and post-transplant hemodialysis (HR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.02 to 5.84, P = 0.044). CONCLUSIONS: BSI was a frequent post-transplant complication, and most of the causative pathogens were multi-drug resistant. Biliary complications and BSIs resulting from biliary infection are major problems for LT recipients. The prevention of BSI and biliary complications is critical in improving prognosis in liver transplant recipients.
TI  - Could chloramphenicol be used against ESKAPE pathogens? A review of in vitro data in the literature from the 21st century.
AB  - The widespread use of antibiotics has been associated with the emergence of antimicrobial resistance among bacteria. 'ESKAPE' (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acintobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) pathogens play a major role in the rapidly changing scenario of antimicrobial resistance in the 21st century. Chloramphenicol is a broad spectrum antibiotic that was abandoned in developed countries due to its association with fatal aplastic anemia. However, it is still widely used in the developing world. In light of the emerging problem of multi-drug resistant pathogens, its role should be reassessed. Our paper reviews in vitro data on the activity of chloramphenicol against ESKAPE pathogens. Susceptibility patterns for Gram-positives were good, although less favorable for Gram-negatives. However, in combination with colistin, chloramphenicol was found to have synergistic activity. The risk-benefit related to chloramphenicol toxicity has not been analyzed. Therefore, extra precautions should be taken when prescribing this agent.
TI  - Evaluation of factors affecting mortality in Fournier's Gangrene: Retrospective clinical study of sixteen cases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fournier's gangrene is a progressive, necrotizing fasciitis due to synergistic infection of the perineum and external genitalia that is associated with high mortality and morbidity. The purpose of this study is to review the diagnostic and treatment methods that effect mortality in Fournier's gangrene. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixteen patients who were diagnosed and treated at our clinic between 2011 and 2013 due to Fournier's gangrene were retrospectively analyzed. The surviving and non-surviving patient groups were compared in terms of age, sex, onset time of symptoms, isolated microorganisms, concomitant diseases, Fournier's gangrene severity index (FGSI), and length of hospital stay. RESULTS: Ten of our cases (62.5%) were male and six (37.5%) were female, with a mean age of 61.2+/-12.3 (42-73) years. The mortality rate was 18.8% (3 cases). The mean duration of symptoms before admission was 4.31+/-1.81 (2-8) days. This period was 6.67+/-1.52 days in patients who succumbed to death, and 3.77+/-1.42 days in patients who survived (p=0.007). Ten cases (62.5%) had concomitant diabetes mellitus. The most common organism isolated in wound cultures was Escherichia coli (68.7%), and Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus spp. in the remaining patients. The mean FGSI of surviving patients was 3.84+/-1.77, and 7.66+/-0.57 in fatal cases (p=0.003). The mean length of hospital stay was 25.5 days (2-57) and duration of hospitalization was significantly longer in survivors (p<0.05). CONCLUSION: The delay in diagnosis and higher FGSI may be responsible for worsening of prognosis and mortality in Fournier's gangrene. Early diagnosis and determination of the severity of the disease, aggressive surgical debridement and appropriate antimicrobial therapy may improve prognosis.
TI  - Health care workers' hand contamination levels and antibacterial efficacy of different hand hygiene methods used in a Vietnamese hospital.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Handwashing with soap or another antisepsis disinfectant solution is  a common practice in Vietnam, but the availability and quality of tap water is unpredictable. We assessed the risk for hand contamination and compared the efficacy of 5 hand hygiene methods in a tertiary Vietnamese hospital. METHODS: Five fingertip imprints of the dominant hand of 134 health care workers (HCWs) were sampled to establish the average bacterial count before and after hand hygiene action using (1) alcohol-based handrub (ABHR), (2) plain soap and water handwashing with filtered and unfiltered water, or (3) 4% chlorhexidine gluconate hand antisepsis with filtered and unfiltered water. RESULTS: Average bacterial contamination of hands before hand hygiene was 1.65 log(10). Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus were the most commonly isolated bacterial pathogens. The highest average count before hand hygiene was recovered from HCWs without direct patient contact (2.10 +/- 0.11 log(10)). Bacterial counts were markedly reduced after hand hygiene with ABHR (1.4 log(10); P < .0001) and 4% chlorhexidine gluconate with filtered water (0.8 log(10); P < .0001). Use of unfiltered water was associated with minimal nonsignificant bacterial reduction. CONCLUSIONS: HCWs carry high levels of bacteria on their dominant hand, even without direct patient contact. ABHR as an additional step may overcome the effect of high bacterial counts in unfiltered water when soap and water handwashing is indicated.
TI  - Analysis of some common pathogens and their drug resistance to antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the common bacterial resistance of clinical isolates in our hospital in the second half of 2011. METHODOLOGY: Pathogens isolated from clinical samples in the second half of 2011 were analyzed and categorized to perform susceptibility tests. RESULTS: In the gram-negative bacteria, Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli accounted for 55.89% and 34.51%. In the gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, Coagulase-negative staphylococci, Enterococcus, Strptococcus pneumonia accounted for 32.85%, 40.39%, 12.41% and 10.22%, respectively. Other species accounted for 4.14%. Klebsiella pneumonia and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to cepoperazon, cefepime and imipenem. However,Acinetobacter baumannii was more sensitive to carbapenems antibiotics, which was followed by fourth generation cephalosporins. Klebsiella pneumoniae was extremely sensitive to amikacin, cefepime and imipenem, but was resistant to ampicillin. The detection rates of the broad-spectrum Escherichia coli, Pseudomonasaeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 54.51%, 52.08% and 38.65%. The gram negative bacilli were the prevalent clinical pathogens in our hospital in the second half of 2011. CONCLUSION: The drug resistance of pathogenic bacteria has increased significantly recently, thus the surveillance of antibacterial agents is necessary, and rational use of antibiotic will be urgently needed to reduce the production and dissemination of drug resistant strains.
TI  - Validation of a novel murine wound model of Acinetobacter baumannii infection.
AB  - Patients recovering from traumatic injuries or surgery often require weeks to months of hospitalization, increasing the risk for wound and surgical site infections caused by ESKAPE pathogens, which include A. baumannii (the ESKAPE pathogens are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). As new therapies are being developed to counter A. baumannii infections, animal models are also needed to evaluate potential treatments. Here, we present an excisional, murine wound model in which a diminutive inoculum of a clinically relevant, multidrug-resistant A. baumannii isolate can proliferate, form biofilms, and be effectively treated with antibiotics. The model requires a temporary, cyclophosphamide-induced neutropenia to establish an infection that can persist. A 6-mm-diameter, full-thickness wound was created in the skin overlying the thoracic spine, and after the wound bed was inoculated, it was covered with a dressing for 7 days. Uninoculated control wounds healed within 13 days, whereas infected, placebo-treated wounds remained unclosed beyond 21 days. Treated and untreated wounds were assessed with multiple quantitative and qualitative techniques that included gross pathology, weight loss and recovery, wound closure, bacterial burden, 16S rRNA community profiling, histopathology, peptide nucleic acid-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and scanning electron microscopy assessment of biofilms. The range of differences that we are able to identify with these measures in antibiotic- versus placebo-treated animals provides a clear window within which novel antimicrobial therapies can be assessed. The model can be used to evaluate antimicrobials for their ability to reduce specific pathogen loads in wounded tissues and clear biofilms. Ultimately, the mouse model approach allows for highly powered studies and serves as an initial multifaceted in vivo assessment prior to testing in larger animals.
TI  - Bioactive glass BAG-S53P4 for the adjunctive treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones: an in vitro and prospective clinical study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to explore the in vitro antibacterial activity of the bioglass BAG S53P4 against multi-resistant microorganisms commonly involved in osteomyelitis and to evaluate its use in surgical adjunctive treatment of osteomyelitis. METHODS: In vitro antibacterial activity of BAG-S53P4 against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates was evaluated by means of time kill curves, with colony counts performed after 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation. In vivo evaluation was performed by prospectively studying a cohort of 27 patients with a clinically and radiologically diagnosed osteomyelitis of the long bones in an observational study. Endpoints were the absence of infection recurrence/persistence at follow-up, no need for further surgery whenever during follow-up and absence of local or systemic side effects connected with the BAG use. RESULTS: In vitro tests regarding the antibacterial activity of BAG S53P4 showed a marked bactericidal activity after 24 hrs against all the tested species. This activity continued in the subsequent 24 hrs and no growth was observed for all strains after 72 hrs. Results of the clinical study evidenced no signs of infection in 24 patients (88.9%) at the follow-up, while 2 subjects showed infection recurrence at 6 months from index operation and one more needed further surgical procedures. BAG-S53P4 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: The in vitro and in vivo findings reinforce previous observations on the efficacy of BAG-S53P4 for the treatment of chronic osteomyelitis of the long bones, also in the presence of multi-resistant strains and in immunocompromised hosts, without relevant side effects and without the need for locally adding antibiotics.

TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparators against Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates collected from the Middle East and Africa between 2004 and 2011.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) was established in 2004 to monitor longitudinal changes in bacterial susceptibility to numerous antimicrobial agents, specifically tigecycline. In this study, susceptibility among Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates between 2004 and 2011 from the Middle East and Africa was examined. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) interpretive criteria, and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by broth microdilution methods. US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved breakpoints were used for tigecycline. In total, 2967 Gram-positive and 6322 Gram-negative isolates were examined from 33 participating centres. All Staphylococcus aureus isolates, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus, were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin. Vancomycin, linezolid, tigecycline and levofloxacin were highly active (>97.6% susceptibility) against Streptococcus pneumoniae, including penicillin-non-susceptible strains. All Enterococcus faecium isolates were susceptible to tigecycline and linezolid, including 32 vancomycin-resistant isolates. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were produced by 16.6% of Escherichia coli and 32.9% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. More than 95% of E. coli and Enterobacter spp. were susceptible to amikacin, tigecycline, imipenem and meropenem. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were amikacin (88.0% susceptible) and minocycline (64.2% susceptible), respectively; the MIC90 (MIC required to inhibit 90% of the isolates) of tigecycline against A. baumannii was low at 2mg/L. Tigecycline and carbapenem agents were highly active against most Gram-negative pathogens. Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin showed good activity against most Gram-positive pathogens from the Middle East and Africa.
TI  - Nosocomial infection characteristics in a burn intensive care unit: analysis of an eleven-year active surveillance.
AB  - AIMS: The objective of this study was to describe nosocomial infection (NI) rates, risk factors, etiologic agents, antibiotic susceptibility, invasive device utilization and invasive device associated infection rates in a burn intensive care unit (ICU) in Turkey. METHODS: Prospective surveillance of nosocomial infections was performed according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN) criteria between 2001 and 2012. The data was analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: During the study period 658 burn patients were admitted to our burn ICU. 469 cases acquired 602 NI for an overall NI rate of 23.1 per 1000 patient days. 109 of all the cases (16.5%) died. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (241), Acinetobacter baumannii (186) and Staphylococcus aureus (69) were the most common identified bacteria in 547 strains. CONCLUSION: Total burn surface area, full thickness burn, older age, presence of inhalation injury were determined to be the significant risk factors for acquisition of NI. Determining the NI profile at a certain burn ICU can lead the medical staff apply the appropriate treatment regimen and limit the drug resistance. Eleven years surveillance report presented here provides a recent data about the risk factors of NI in a Turkish burn ICU.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fibrin sealants containing antimicrobial agents.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial prophylaxis is required to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs). However, it is difficult to maintain prolonged antimicrobial activity in the surgical incision. Fibrin sealants are used primarily for hemostasis, suture support, or the adhesion of tissues. The aim of this study was to develop fibrin sealants that exhibit antimicrobial activity due to the addition of an antimicrobial agent. METHODS: We determined the potencies and activities of cefazolin, ampicillin-sulbactam, vancomycin, teicoplanin, and arbekacin eluted from fibrin sealants. The antimicrobial activity was evaluated using methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multi-drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP), and multi-drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), which are the major pathogens responsible for hospital-acquired infections. RESULTS: Each antimicrobial agent eluted continuously from the fibrin clots for approximately two weeks. All eluates from fibrin clots containing antimicrobial agents maintained antimicrobial activity against MRSA for at least 7 d. The eluates from fibrin clots containing ampicillin-sulbactam inhibited the growth of both MDRP and MDRAB for at least 5 d. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the addition of an antimicrobial agent to fibrin sealants is a useful method to prevent SSIs caused by bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant strains.
TI  - Blood stream infections in patients in the burn intensive care unit.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The study on bacteremia helps empirically select the proper antibiotics before the results of culture test about causative pathogen. The purpose of this study is to investigate causative pathogen in bloodstream infection, changing aspects based on elapsed time after burn, relationship with other sites and resistance of important causative pathogen against antibiotics through analysis on bacteria isolated from blood culture of patients hospitalized in burn intensive care unit (BICU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted targeting patients hospitalized in BICU from January 2007 to June 2011. Changes of causative pathogen in bloodstream infection based on elapsed time after injury were analyzed. We would like to examine the relationship between bloodstream infection and infection on other body parts by comparing results of cultures in burn wound site, sputum, urine and catheter tip. Antibiotics resistance patterns of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, and Klebsiella pneumoniae were studied. RESULTS: A total of 2,337 burn patients were hospitalized in BICU for 54 months. Causative pathogen was cultured in blood cultures from 397 patients (17.0%). P. aeruginosa (169, 30.1%) was the most cultured and A. baumannii (107, 19.0%) and S. aureus (81, 14.4%) were followed. It was confirmed that the relative frequency of A. baumannii tended to get lower as the period got longer after injury, but the relative frequency of K. pneumoniae got higher as the period got longer after injury. With comparison without bacteremia, P. aeruginosa bacteremia showed high probability in which the same bacteria were cultured in wound site, sputum and cathether tip, and A. baumannii bacteremia and candida bacteremia had high probability in sputum, and urine and catheter tip, respectively. 95.9% of P. aeruginosa and 95.3% of A. baumannii showed the resistance against carbapenem. 96.3% of S. aureus was methicillin resistant and 36.2% of Enterococcus species were vancomycin resistant. 75.0% of K. pneumonia were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Since the highly antibiotic resistant microorganisms were isolated from the patients hospitalized in BICU during early phase, the empirical selection of antibiotics targeting these pathogens should be considered before the results of microbiologic culture test. In addition, use of empirical antifungal agent after 1 week of injury can be considered for patients who have risk factor of fungal infection.
TI  - [Surveillance of bacterial distribution and drug resistance in inpatients with surgical infections: a single center study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the bacterial distribution and drug resistance in patients with surgical infections, and provide the basis for the standardization treatment of the surgical infection. METHODS: Retrospectively analyzed from January 2008 to December 2011 surgical infection in our samples bacteria identification and drug sensitivity test results. RESULTS: A total of 3829 nonduplicate isolates from 3257 samples, Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 62.4% (the main microbes were P.aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E.coli etc) and Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 37.6% (the main microbes were Enterococcus, Staphylococcus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus). Incidence of Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus faecalis were on an obvious increase. For the performance of the high level of sensitive to Imipenem, Amikacin, Piperacillin and Tazobactam by E. coli and K. pneumonia. The Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii to cephalosporins, Carbapenems and Fluoroqinolones were higher resistant with Multidrug resistance. No vancomycin and teicoplanin resistant Enterococcus faecium were found. The prevalence of ESBL E.coli was 45.6%-61.5% and ESBL K.pneumoniae isolates were fluctuated. The methicillin-resistant S.aureus (MRSA) isolates were relatively high (21.1%-55.8%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than the other Gram-positive cocci. Vancomycin for Staphylococcus performance was highly sensitive. CONCLUSIONS: The main composition of surgical clinical infection pathogens are Gram-negative bacillus, and the emergency of resistance of bacteria to antibacterial drugs is a common phenomenon. The resistant rate shows ascendant trend; Drug resistance is significantly higher in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and challenging issue.
TI  - Prospects for new antibacterials: can we do better?
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibacterial drugs has been increasing relentlessly over the past two decades. This includes common residents of the human body: Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin resistant or MRSA) Enteroccus faecalis and E. faecium (vancomycin resistant or VRE): Enterobacteriaceae (multiresistant, carbapenems included or CRE). It also includes environmental, opportunistic, but intrinsically multiresistant species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Financial considerations have curtailed R&D activity in the antibacterial field in all, but a couple of large pharmaceutical companies and small biotech companies have largely been unable to fill the drug discovery gap. Antibacterials currently under development have targeted, almost exclusively, Gram-positive bacteria; hence, greater effort must be directed against Gram-negative bacteria, particularly enterobacteria. There also has to be more transparency and care in clinical development. To get ahead of the problem of resistance, we must look for first-in-class antibacterials and new targets. The need to innovate is best addressed through partnerships between drug-makers and public institutions. Such partnerships would provide a long-term view and stability to projects, but also balance the interests of corporate and public stakeholders.
TI  - Membrane interactions and biological activity of antimicrobial peptides from Australian scorpion.
AB  - UyCT peptides are antimicrobial peptides isolated from the venom of the Australian scorpion. The activity of the UyCT peptides against Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria and red blood cells was determined. The membrane interactions of these peptides were evaluated by dye release (DR) of the fluorophore calcein from liposomes and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC); and their secondary structure was determined by circular dichroism (CD). Three different lipid systems were used to mimic red blood cells, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus membranes. UyCT peptides exhibited broad spectrum antimicrobial activity with low MIC for S. aureus and multi-drug resistant Gram negative strains. Peptide combinations showed some synergy enhancing their potency but not hemolytic activity. The UyCT peptides adopted a helical structure in lipid environments and DR results confirmed that the mechanism of action is by disrupting the membrane. ITC data indicated that UyCT peptides preferred prokaryotic rather than eukaryotic membranes. The overall results suggest that UyCT peptides could be pharmaceutical leads for the treatment of Gram negative multiresistant bacterial infections, especially against Acinetobacter baumanni, and candidates for peptidomimetics to enhance their potency and minimize hemolysis. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled: Interfacially Active Peptides and Proteins. Guest Editors: William C. Wimley and Kalina Hristova.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy and wound-healing property of a topical ointment containing nitric-oxide-loaded zeolites.
AB  - Topical delivery of nitric oxide (NO) through a wound dressing has the potential  to reduce wound infections and improve healing of acute and chronic wounds. This study characterized the antibacterial efficacy of an ointment containing NO-loaded, zinc-exchanged zeolite A that releases NO upon contact with water. The release rate of NO from the ointment was measured using a chemiluminescence detection system. Minimum bactericidal concentration assays were performed using five common wound pathogens, including Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii), Gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus epidermidis and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) and a fungus (Candida albicans). The time dependence of antimicrobial activity was characterized by performing log-reduction assays at four time points after 1-8 h ointment exposure. The cytotoxicity of the ointment after 24 h was assessed using cultured 3T3 fibroblast cells. Minimum microbicidal concentrations (MMCs) for bacterial organisms (5x10(7) c.f.u.) ranged from 50 to 100 mg ointment (ml media)(-1); the MMC for C. albicans (5x10(4) c.f.u.) was 50 mg ointment (ml media)(-1). Five to eight log reductions in bacterial viability and three log reductions in fungal viability were observed after 8 h exposure to NO-zeolite ointment compared with untreated organisms. Fibroblasts remained viable after 24 h exposure to the same concentration of NO-zeolite ointment as was used in antimicrobial tests. In parallel studies, full-thickness cutaneous wounds on Zucker obese rats healed faster than wounds treated with a control ointment. These data indicate that ointment containing NO-loaded zeolites could potentially be used as a broad-spectrum antimicrobial wound-healing dressing.
TI  - An analog of the host-defense peptide hymenochirin-1B with potent broad-spectrum  activity against multidrug-resistant bacteria and immunomodulatory properties.
AB  - Hymenochirin-1B (IKLSPETKDN(10)LKKVLKGAIK(20)GAIAVAKMV.NH2) is a cationic, amphipathic, alpha-helical, host-defense peptide, first isolated from skin secretions of the Congo clawed frog Hymenochirus boettgeri (Pipidae). Structure-activity relationships were investigated by synthesizing analogs in which the Pro(5), Glu(6) and Asp(9) on the hydrophilic face of the alpha-helix are substituted by one or more l-lysine or d-lysine residues. Although replacement with l-lysine generates analogs with increased antimicrobial potency against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria (up to 8-fold), the peptides are more hemolytic. Increasing the cationicity of hymenochirin-1B while reducing the helicity by substitutions with d-lysine generates analogs that are between 2 and 8 fold more potent than the native peptide and are equally or less hemolytic. [E6k,D9k]hymenochirin-1B represents a candidate for drug development as it shows high potency against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and a range of Gram-negative bacteria, including multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (MIC in the range 0.8-3.1 muM) and NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii (MIC in the range 3.1-6.25 muM), and low hemolytic activity (LC50=302 muM). [E6k,D9k]hymenochirin-1B, at a concentration of 2.5 muM, significantly (P<0.05) stimulates the production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 by human peripheral blood mononuclear cells but is without significant effect on production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-17.
TI  - Epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens in cancer patients.
AB  - PURPOSE: Infection due to the six ESKAPE pathogens has recently been identified as a serious emerging problem. However, there is still a lack of information on bacteremia caused by these organisms in cancer patients. We aimed to assess the epidemiology, antibiotic therapy and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens (rESKAPE) in patients with cancer. METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized adults with cancer from 2006 to 2011 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 1,148 episodes of bacteremia, 392 (34 %) were caused by ESKAPE pathogens. Fifty-four episodes (4.7 %) were due to rESKAPE strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium 0, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 13, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESLB)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae 7, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 4, carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa 18 and derepression chromosomic ss-lactam and ESBL-producing Enterobacter species 12. Risk factors independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were comorbidities, prior antibiotic therapy, urinary catheter and urinary tract source. Inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy was more frequent in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia than in the other cases (55.6 % vs. 21.5 %, p < 0.001). Persistence of bacteremia (25 % vs. 9.7 %), septic metastasis (8 % vs. 4 %) and early case-fatality rate (23 % vs. 11 %) were more frequent in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia than in patients with other etiologies (p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia due to rESKAPE pathogens in cancer patients occurs mainly among those with comorbidities who have received prior antibiotic therapy and have a urinary tract source. These patients often receive inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy and have a poor outcome.
TI  - Short antibacterial peptides with significantly reduced hemolytic activity can be identified by a systematic L-to-D exchange scan of their amino acid residues.
AB  - High systemic toxicity of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) limits their clinical application to the treatment of topical infections; in parenteral systemic application of AMPs the problem of hemolysis is one of the first to be tackled. We now show that the selectivity of lipidated short synthetic AMPs can be optimized substantially by reducing their hemolytic activity without affecting their activity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In order to identify the optimized peptides, two sets of 32 diastereomeric H-(D)Arg-WRWRW-(L)Lys(C(O)CnH2n+1)-NH2 (n = 7 or 9) peptides were prepared using a split-split procedure to perform a systematic L-to-D exchange scan on the central WRWRW-fragment. Compared to the all-L C8-lipidated lead sequence, diastereomeric peptides had very similar antibacterial properties, but were over 30 times less hemolytic. We show that the observed hemolysis and antibacterial activity is affected by both differences in lipophilicity of the different peptides and specific combinations of L- and D-amino acid residues. This study identified several peptides that can be used as tools to precisely unravel the origin of hemolysis and thus help to design even further optimized nontoxic very active short antibacterial peptides.
TI  - ARG-ANNOT, a new bioinformatic tool to discover antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial genomes.
AB  - ARG-ANNOT (Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation) is a new bioinformatic tool that was created to detect existing and putative new antibiotic resistance (AR) genes in bacterial genomes. ARG-ANNOT uses a local BLAST program in Bio-Edit software that allows the user to analyze sequences without a Web interface. All AR genetic determinants were collected from published works and online resources; nucleotide and protein sequences were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank database. After building a database that includes 1,689 antibiotic resistance genes, the software was tested in a blind manner using 100 random sequences selected from the database to verify that the sensitivity and specificity were at 100% even when partial sequences were queried. Notably, BLAST analysis results obtained using the rmtF gene sequence (a new aminoglycoside-modifying enzyme gene sequence that is not included in the database) as a query revealed that the tool was able to link this sequence to short sequences (17 to 40 bp) found in other genes of the rmt family with significant E values. Finally, the analysis of 178 Acinetobacter baumannii and 20 Staphylococcus aureus genomes allowed the detection of a significantly higher number of AR genes than the Resfinder gene analyzer and 11 point mutations in target genes known to be associated with AR. The average time for the analysis of a genome was 3.35 +/- 0.13 min. We have created a concise database for BLAST using a Bio-Edit interface that can detect AR genetic determinants in bacterial genomes and can rapidly and easily discover putative new AR genetic determinants.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity and SAR study of new gemini imidazolium-based chlorides.
AB  - A series of 70 new 3,3'(alpha,omega-dioxaalkyl)bis(1-alkylimidazolium) chlorides  were synthesized. They were characterized with respect to surface active properties and antimicrobial activity against the following pathogens: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida krusei, and Candida albicans. In this article, besides description of the synthesis, we characterize a set of features of these compounds, concerning their structure (described by the length of the dioxaalkan spacer and the length of the alkyl substituent in the aromatic ring) and surface active properties (critical micelle concentration, value of surface tension at critical micelle concentration, value of surface excess, molecular area of a single particle, and free energy of adsorption of molecule). Then, we present a SAR study for Staphylococcus aureus, as one of the most widespread pathogenic strains, conducted with the help of the Dominance-based Rough Set Approach (DRSA), that involves identification of relevant features and relevant combinations of features being in strong relationship with a high antimicrobial activity of the compounds. The SAR study shows, moreover, that the antimicrobial activity is dependent on the type of substituents and their position at the chloride moiety, as well as on the surface active properties of the compounds.
TI  - [Analysis of resistance tendency of bloodstream-infecting pathogens in China].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the resistance profiles and the trend of bloodstream-infecting pathogens isolated from hospitalized patients during 2004-2010. METHODS: The bloodstream isolates were collected from 18 hospitals in 17 cities. Minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) were determined using the agar dilution method recommended by CLSI (Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute), and susceptibility results were analyzed according to the 2011 CLSI guideline. RESULTS: Among the 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010 periods, the proportions of clinical isolates were similar; 43.1% (149 isolates), 34.0% (151 isolates) and 47.5% (776 isolates) for Gram positive strains, 56.9% (197 isolates), 66.0% (293 isolates) and 52.5% (858 isolates) for Gram negative strains, respectively. The isolating rate of MRSA was 54.1% (20/37) in 2007-2008, which was the highest among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010, while it decreased in 2009-2010 (36.5%, 62/170). The MRCNS proportions were similar across the 3 periods. One (1.8%) vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and 1 linezolid-resistant Enterococcus faecalis were found. Although the isolating rates of penicillin non-sensitive strains (oral) were similar between 2009-2010 and 2007-2008 [54.5% (6/11) and 53.9% (7/13), respectively], the resistant rates increased from 0% in 2007-2008 to 30.8% (4/13) in 2009-2010. The results were similar according to the non-meningitis criterion (IV), and the susceptibility rates decreased from 100.0% (11 isolates) in 2007-2008 to 84.6% (11/13) in 2009-2010. ESBL-harboring strains in E. coli were similar among the 3 periods during 2004 to 2010 [66.7% (30/45), 73.2% (71/97) and 67.9% (233/343), respectively]. ESBL-producing strains in Klebsilla pnuemoniae decreased year after year, 72.4% (21/29), 50.0% (18/36) and 41.1% (65/158) in 2004-2005, 2007-2008 and 2009-2010, respectively. Except that the sensitive rate of Enterobacter cloacae to ertapenem was 80% (32/40), the sensitive rates of other strains to carbapenems were still above 90% and the resistance rates were less than 5%. Acinetobacter baumannii had the highest multi-drug resistance rate (81.8%, 81/99). One strain (1.0%, 1/99) of Acinetobacter baumannii isolated in 2009-2010 was reported to be pan-resistant. CONCLUSIONS: We are facing a more serious situation of bacterial resistance. Acinetobacter baumannii resistance was most serious, usually with the characteristics of multiple drug resistance, and even pan-resistance. Carbapenems remain to be the most effective against enterobacteriaceae. Strains resistant to novel antibiotics (linezolid and tigecycline) have emerged.
TI  - A novel alkaloid from marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces xinghaiensis with  broad-spectrum antibacterial and cytotoxic activities.
AB  - Due to the increasing emergence of drug-resistant bacteria and tumor cell lines,  novel antibiotics with antibacterial and cytotoxic activities are urgently needed. Marine actinobacteria are rich sources of novel antibiotics, and here we report the discovery of a novel alkaloid, xinghaiamine A, from a marine-derived actinomycete Streptomyces xinghaiensis NRRL B24674(T). Xinghaiamine A was purified from the fermentation broth, and its structure was elucidated based on extensive spectroscopic analysis, including 1D and 2D NMR spectrum as well as mass spectrometry. Xinghaiamine A was identified to be a novel alkaloid with highly symmetric structure on the basis of sulfoxide functional group, and sulfoxide containing compound has so far never been reported in microorganisms. Biological assays revealed that xinghaiamine A exhibited broad-spectrum antibacterial activities to both Gram-negative persistent hospital pathogens (e.g. Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Escherichia coli) and Gram-positive ones, which include Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis. In addition, xinghaiamine A also exhibited potent cytotoxic activity to human cancer cell lines of MCF-7 and U-937 with the IC50 of 0.6 and 0.5 microM, respectively.
TI  - Rapid systemic and local treatments with the antibacterial peptide dimer A3-APO and its monomeric metabolite eliminate bacteria and reduce inflammation in intradermal lesions infected with Propionibacterium acnes and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - When administered intramuscularly, the designer antibacterial peptide dimer A3-APO is highly efficacious in mouse models of Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus burn infections. Here we compared the efficacy of A3-APO and its monomeric metabolite in mouse models of S. aureus and Propionibacterium acnes intradermal infections following administration as intramuscular (i.m.) or topical treatments. In the animal models, either (i) the ears of CD-1 mice were infected with P. acnes or (ii) S. aureus was injected into burn wounds inflicted to the back. A3-APO or the monomer were injected intramuscularly at 5 mg/kg one to three times or were applied three times as 1% local treatment in phosphate-buffered saline or Vaseline((R)). Despite being inactive against the strains in vitro, in vivo the skin conditions of the mice were dramatically improved upon peptide treatment regardless of dosing frequency, administration mode or drug valency. In the P. acnes study, A3-APO statistically significantly reduced ear thickness and ear bacterial counts. The amount of ear connective tissue and epithelial macrophages correlated with therapeutic success. Bacterial load in the lesions was more representative of physical improvement than ear dimensions. In the S. aureus model, both peptides eliminated wound bacteria from >10(7) CFU/mg to almost background levels, with monomer treatment being somewhat more successful. In conclusion, A3-APO and its monomeric metabolite very efficiently ameliorate resistant aerobic and anaerobic intradermal infections, but the protection is apparently not due to direct bacterial killing. Immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory actions are likely involved. Nevertheless, topical and i.m. administrations are equally effective.

TI  - [Health care associated multidrug-resistant bacteria in a pediatric hospital: five year experience].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In recent years there has been an increase of infections caused by  multidrug-resistant bacteria. Paediatric data are scarce, particularly at national level. AIMS: To analyse trends of health-care associated multidrug-resistant bacteria infections in a paediatric hospital. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective incidence study was conducted in medical, surgical and intensive care wards in a level III paediatric hospital, from January 2005 to December 2009. The studied multidrug-resistant bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), ESBL-producing bacilli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-MDR) and Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to carbapenems. Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, treatment and presence of risk factors for these infections were analysed. RESULTS: During the study period 106 multidrug-resistant bacteria were identified, related to 72 children, predominantly male (65.3%). The most frequently identified multidrug-resistant bacteria were MRSA (35.8%), PA-MDR (29.2%) and ESBL-producing bacilli (17.9%). Of the 106 multidrug-resistant bacteria, 45 (42.5%) were causing infection. During the study period the annual proportion of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria went up from 32.0% in 2006 to 55.6% in 2009 (p = 0.376). The overall incidence rate of infection was 0.400 per 1 000 hospitalization-days, corresponding to 0.274 infections per 100 admissions, remaining stable over the five years. The most frequent infections were bloodstream (31.1%), intra-abdominal (20.0%), catheter-related (17.8%) and skin and soft tissue (11.1%). All children had risk factors and the most frequently identified were previous antibiotic therapy and underlying chronic disease (> 90%). Six children (13.3%) died during hospitalisation. CONCLUSIONS: During the study period, there was an increase in the proportion of multidrug-resistant bacteria but with no statistical significance. The overall incidence rate of multidrug-resistant bacteria infection remained stable. MRSA were the most frequently identified bacteria, followed by PA-MDR and ESBL-producing bacilli. Bloodstream infections were the most frequent infections, followed by intra-abdominal and catheter-related. All children had risk factors, mainly previous antibiotic therapy and chronic disease.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of novel nanostructured Cu-SiO2 coatings prepared by chemical vapour deposition against hospital related pathogens.
AB  - There is increasing recognition that the healthcare environment acts as an important reservoir for transmission of healthcare acquired infections (HCAI). One method of reducing environmental contamination would be use of antimicrobial materials. The antimicrobial activity of thin silica-copper films prepared by chemical vapour deposition was evaluated against standard strains of bacteria used for disinfectant testing and bacteria of current interest in HCAI. The structure of the coatings was determined using Scanning Electron Microscopy and their hardness and adhesion to the substrate determined. Antimicrobial activity was tested using a method based on BS ISO 22196:2007. The coatings had a pale green-brown colour and had a similar hardness to steel. SEM showed nano-structured aggregates of Cu within a silica matrix. A log10 reduction in viability of >5 could be obtained within 4 h for the disinfectant test strains and within 6 h for producing Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Activity against the other hospital isolates was slower but still gave log10 reduction factors of >5 for extended spectrum beta-lactamase producing Escherichia coli and >3 for vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa within 24 h. The results demonstrate the importance of testing antimicrobial materials destined for healthcare use against isolates of current interest in hospitals as well as standard test strains. The coatings used here can also be applied to substrates such as metals and ceramics and have potential applications where reduction of microbial environmental contamination is desirable.
TI  - Lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanocluster-based affinity mass spectrometry for pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - RATIONALE: Bacterial infections can be difficult to treat and can lead to irreversible damage to patients if proper treatment is not provided in time. Additionally, the emerging threat from antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains makes medical treatment even more difficult. Thus, rapid identification of infected bacterial strains is essential to assist diagnostics and medical treatment. METHODS: Lysozymes are glycoside hydrolases that can bind with peptidoglycans on bacterial cell walls. In this work, we demonstrated that lysozyme-encapsulated gold nanoclusters (lysozyme-AuNCs) with red photoluminescence can be used as affinity probes to concentrate pathogenic bacteria. After bacteria had been probed by the lysozyme-AuNCs in a sample solution, the lysozyme-AuNC-bacteria conjugates were readily spun down at a low centrifugation speed. The red emission from the AuNCs on the conjugates could be visualized with the naked eye under illumination of ultraviolet light. The bacteria in the conjugates can be identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS) combined with principal component analysis (PCA). RESULTS: We demonstrated that pathogenic bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE) can be readily concentrated by the lysozyme-AuNCs and distinguished by the results combining MALDI-MS and PCA. Additionally, the possibility of using the current approach to differentiate E. faecalis from VRE was also demonstrated. The lowest detection concentration for E. coli using the current approach is ~10(6) cells/mL. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that the lysozyme-AuNCs are effective affinity probes for Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. By combining the results from MALDI-MS and PCA, different bacteria can be easily distinguished. The current approach can be potentially used to assist the identification of bacteria from biological fluids.
TI  - Comparison of pathogens and antibiotic resistance of burn patients in the burn ICU or in the common burn ward.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aims to compare pathogens and their antibiotic resistances of burn patients from burn intensive care unit (ICU) or common burn ward. Of 2395 clinical samples from 63 patients in burn ICU, pathogens were detected in 1621 samples, in which 1203 strains (74.2%) were Gram negative bacteria, 248 strains (15.3%) were Gram positive bacteria, 170 strains (10.5%) were fungi. Top-4 microorganisms isolated from patients in burn ICU were Bauman's Acinetobacter (557, 34.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (287.17.7%), Staphylococcus aureus (199, 12.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (171, 10.5%). Of 512 clinical samples from 235 patients in common burn units, pathogens were detected in 373 samples, in which 189 (50.6%) strains were Gram negative bacteria, 150 strains (40.2%) were Gram positive bacteria, 34 strains (9.2%) were fungi. Top-4 microorganisms isolated from patients in common burn units were S. aureus (103, 27.6%), P. aeruginosa (46, 12.3%), K. pneumoniae (38, 10.2%) and Escherichia coli (32, 8.6%). Antibiotic resistance rates of pathogens isolated from clinical samples of burn patients from ICU was significantly higher than those from common units. CONCLUSIONS: Pathogens and their antibiotic resistances are significantly different between burn ICU and common burn units. This finding has great implication for infection control in burn patients.
TI  - Bloodstream infection in patients with end-stage renal disease in a teaching hospital in central-western Brazil.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Vascular access in patients undergoing hemodialysis is considered a critical determinant of bloodstream infection (BSI) and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The purpose of this study was to investigate the occurrence of BSI in patients with end-stage renal disease using central venous catheters for hemodialysis. METHODS: A cohort study was conducted in a public teaching hospital in central-western Brazil from April 2010 to December 2011. For every patient, we noted the presence of hyperemia/exudation upon catheter insertion, as well as fever, shivering, and chills during hemodialysis. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were evaluated. Thirty-fi ve (59.3%) patients started dialysis due to urgency, 37 (62.7%) had BSI, and 12 (20%) died. Hyperemia at the catheter insertion site (64.9%) was a significant clinical manifestation in patients with BSI. Statistical analysis revealed 1.7 times more cases of BSI in patients with hypoalbuminemia compared with patients with normal albumin levels. The principal infective agents identified in blood cultures and catheter-tip cultures were Staphylococcus species (24 cases), non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli (7 cases of Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and 5 cases of Chryseobacterium indologenes), and Candida species (6). Among the Staphylococci identified, 77.7% were methicillin-resistant, coagulase-negative Staphylococci. Of the bacteria isolated, the most resistant were Chryseobacterium indologenes and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSIONS: Blood culture was demonstrated to be an important diagnostic test and identified over 50% of positive BSI cases. The high frequency of BSI and the isolation of multiresistant bacteria were disturbing findings. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated microorganism, although Gram-negative bacteria predominated overall. These results highlight the importance of infection prevention and control measures in dialysis units.
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of amazonian medicinal plants.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aqueous extracts of currently utilized Amazonian medicinal plants were assayed in vitro searching for antimicrobial activity against human and animal pathogenic microorganisms. METHODS: Medium resuspended lyophilized aqueous extracts of different organs of Amazonian medicinal plants were assayed by in vitro screening for antimicrobial activity. ATCC and standardized microorganisms obtained from Oswaldo Cruz Foundation/Brazil were individually and homogeneously grown in agar plate, and holes previously perforated in the gel were filled with diluted plant aqueous extracts. Inhibition halos were evaluated and controlled by the use of the fluoroquinolone ciprofloxacin. RESULTS: The Amazonian medicinal plants, Hymenelobium petraeum showed inhibitory activity over Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Salmonella enterica serovar Typhi, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans, while Vatairea guianensis and Symphonia globulifera presented inhibitory activity exclusively for Staphylococcus aureus. Also, Ptychopetalum olacoides and Pentaclethra macroloba inhibited the growth of Klebsiella ozaenae and Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The aqueous botanic extracts that showed activity against microroganisms of ATTC and Osvaldo Cruz strains had at least 40% of antimicrobial activity when compared to halo inhibition produced by the commercial antibiotic ciprofloxacin utilized as a control. Of all plants extracts assayed, the Hymenelobium petraeum had the best performance, sometimes exhibiting higher activity than ciprofloxacin. It is not well-defined by the physicians the exact indication of the majority of medicinal plants in the Amazon area in Brazil. Natives utilize the plants according to their symptoms, based on the traditional knowledge transmitted orally from generation to generation, among Amerindians, Afrodescendents and ethnic mixed populations. A significant number of Amazonian medicinal plants are totally unknown related to their medicinal properties including mechanism of action and therapeutic effects, as very few information is reported in the scientific literature. A tiny amount of data is presented, as the preliminary antimicrobial properties of the medicinal plants here accessed, under the urgent necessity of new antibiotics in the market and in face of the increased resistance of infectious microorganisms to antimicrobials.
TI  - Chlorhexidine activity against bacterial biofilms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: A biofilm is a complex microbiological ecosystem deposited on surfaces. Microorganisms in form of biofilms are of particular clinical concern because of the poor response to antimicrobial treatments. This study aimed to determine whether bacterial and fungal biofilms are able to resist the antimicrobial activity of chlorhexidine, a powerful antiseptic widely used in the hospital environment. METHODS: Disk diffusion and susceptibility tests were conducted in accordance with Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute standards for the determination of biofilm inhibitory concentration. Chlorhexidine was tested first at a minimum inhibitory concentration and then at higher concentrations when it was not able to destroy the biofilm. The plates were developed with a solution of 0.1% crystal violet, and readings were made at an optical density of 570 nm. RESULTS: Chlorhexidine demonstrated excellent antimicrobial activity for most microorganisms tested in their free form, but was less effective against biofilms of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. CONCLUSION: This study confirms that microorganisms in biofilms have greater resistance to chlorhexidine, likely owing to the mechanisms of resistance conferred to the structure of biofilms.
TI  - [Adherence to copper and stainless steel metal coupons of common nosocomial bacterial strains].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Copper has a bactericidal activity against a series of bacterial strains. AIM: To measure resistance to bacterial adherence of copper (Cu) and stainless steel (SS) metal coupons. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bacterial strains causing nosocomial infections in Chile were analyzed. Bacterial adherence was studied using a previously described method based on a system of metal coupons that are immersed in culture media containing the bacteria of interest at room temperature. RESULTS: Adherence to Cu and SS coupons was different for Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii strains. For these strains, no adherence to Cu coupons occurred during the 48 h observation period compared to a rapidly increasing adherence to SS coupons, with a final colony count of 1.00 E + 07 cfu/mL. For two different Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical strains, inhibition of adherence was not observed on Cu coupons, and colony counts were similar for Cu and SS using the standard inoculum (2-3 x lO7 cfu).A partial decrease in adherence was observed for Cu but not for SS coupons, when a lower inoculum was used. CONCLUSIONS: Copper surfaces represent an interesting option to reduce bacterial contamination in the hospital environment due to its resistance to bacterial adhesion of most of the common nosocomial bacterial strains.
TI  - Nanotechnology as a therapeutic tool to combat microbial resistance.
AB  - Use of nanoparticles is among the most promising strategies to overcome microbial drug resistance. This review article consists of three parts. The first part discusses the epidemiology of microbial drug resistance. The second part describes mechanisms of drug resistance used by microbes. The third part explains how nanoparticles can overcome this resistance, including the following: Nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticles (NO NPs), chitosan-containing nanoparticles (chitosan NPs), and metal-containing nanoparticles all use multiple mechanisms simultaneously to combat microbes, thereby making development of resistance to these nanoparticles unlikely. Packaging multiple antimicrobial agents within the same nanoparticle also makes development of resistance unlikely. Nanoparticles can overcome existing drug resistance mechanisms, including decreased uptake and increased efflux of drug from the microbial cell, biofilm formation, and intracellular bacteria. Finally, nanoparticles can target antimicrobial agents to the site of infection, so that higher doses of drug are given at the infected site, thereby overcoming resistance.
TI  - Risk factors and outcomes of bacteremia caused by drug-resistant ESKAPE pathogens in solid-organ transplant recipients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although infections due to the six ESKAPE pathogens have recently been identified as a serious emerging problem, information regarding bacteremia caused by these organisms in solid-organ transplant (SOT) recipients is lacking. We sought to determine the frequency, risk factors, and outcomes of bacteremia due to drug-resistant ESKAPE (rESKAPE) organisms in liver, kidney, and heart adult transplant recipients. METHODS: All episodes of bacteremia prospectively documented in hospitalized SOT recipients from 2007 to 2012 were analyzed. RESULTS: Of 276 episodes of bacteremia, 54 (19.6%) were due to rESKAPE strains (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium [0], methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [5], extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae [10], carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii [8], carbapenem- and quinolone-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa [26], and derepressed chromosomal beta-lactam and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacter species [5]). Factors independently associated with rESKAPE bacteremia were prior transplantation, septic shock, and prior antibiotic therapy. Patients with rESKAPE bacteremia more often received inappropriate empirical antibiotic therapy than the others (41% vs. 21.6%; P=0.01). Overall case-fatality rate (30 days) was higher in patients with rESKAPE bacteremia (35.2% vs. 14.4%; P=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bacteremia due to rESKAPE pathogens is frequent in SOT recipients and causes significant morbidity and mortality. rESKAPE organisms should be considered when selecting empirical antibiotic therapy for hospitalized SOT recipients presenting with septic shock, particularly those with prior transplantation and antibiotic use.
TI  - Risk factors for drug-resistant bacterial pneumonia in older patients hospitalized with pneumonia in a Chinese population.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The relationship between healthcare-associated pneumonia (HCAP) and resistant bacteria is unclear. The aim of this study was to identify the risk factors for pneumonia caused by drug-resistant bacteria (DRB). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted at a tertiary teaching hospital in Hong Kong. Consecutive older patients (aged >/=65 years) were hospitalized with pneumonia from January 2004 to June 2005. DRB comprised methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: The entire cohort consisted of 1176 older patients. Of 472 (40.1%) patients with etiological diagnosis established, bacterial pneumonia was found in 354 (30.1%) cases. DRB were isolated in 48 patients: P. aeruginosa (41), MRSA (5) and ESBL producing enteric bacilli (3). Co-infection with P. aeruginosa and MRSA was found in one patient. The prevalence of DRB in culture-positive pneumonia was 20.1% (48/239). Patients with DRB were more likely to have limitation in activities of daily living, bronchiectasis, dementia, severe pneumonia, recent hospitalization and recent antibiotic use. Logistic regression revealed that bronchiectasis [relative risk (RR) 14.12, P = 0.002], recent hospitalization (RR 4.89, P < 0.001) and severe pneumonia (RR 2.42, P = 0.010) were independent predictors of drug-resistant bacterial pneumonia. CONCLUSION: Recent hospitalization is the only risk factor for HCAP which is shown to be associated with DRB. Nursing home residence is not a risk factor. The concept of HCAP may not be totally applicable in Hong Kong where the prevalence of drug-resistant pathogens in pneumonia is low.

AB  
TI  - Evaluation of anti-resistant activity of Auklandia (Saussurea lappa) root against some human pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract of the Auklandia (Saussurea lappa)root plant was investigated to verify its medicinal use in the treatment of microbial infections. METHODS: The antimicrobial activity of the ethanol extract was tested against clinical isolates of some multidrug-resistant bacteria using the agar well diffusion method. Commercial antibiotics were used as positive reference standards to determine the sensitivity of the clinical isolates. RESULTS: The extracts showed significant inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactemase, Acinetobacter baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentration values obtained using the agar dilution test ranged from 2.0 microg/microL-12.0 microg/microL. In the contrary the water extract showed no activity at all against the tested isolates. Furthermore, the results obtained by examining anti-resistant activity of the plant ethanolic extract showed that at higher concentration of the plant extract (12 microg) all tested bacteria isolates were inhibited with variable inhibition zones similar to those obtained when we applied lower extract concentration using the well diffusion assay. CONCLUSION: The results demonstrated that the crude ethanolic extract of the Auklandia (Saussurea lappa) root plant has a wide spectrum of activity suggesting that it may be useful in the treatment of infections caused by the above clinical isolates (human pathogens).
TI  - Anti-fungal and anti-bacterial activities of ethanol extracts of selected traditional Chinese medicinal herbs.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vitro antimicrobial activities of selected 58 ethno-medicinal plant extracts with a view to assess their therapeutic potential. METHODS: A total of 58 traditional Chinese medicinal plants were carefully selected based on the literature review and their traditional use. The antimicrobial activities of ethanol extracts of these medicinal plants were tested against fungi (Aspergillus fumigatus), yeast (Candida albicans), gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) and gram-positive bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus). The activities were tested at three different concentrations of 1.00, 0.10 and 0.01 mg/mL. The data was analysed using Gene data Screener program. RESULTS: The measured antimicrobial activities indicated that out of the 58 plant extracts, 15 extracts showed anti-fungal activity and 23 extracts exhibited anti-bacterial activity. Eight plant extracts have exhibited both anti-bacterial and anti-fungal activities. For instance, Eucommia ulmoides, Polygonum cuspidatum, Poria cocos and Uncaria rhyncophylla showed activity against both bacterial and fungal strains, indicating their broad spectrum of activity. CONCLUSIONS: The results revealed that the ethanol extracts of 30 plants out of the selected 58 possess significant antimicrobial activities. It is interesting to note that the findings from the current study are consistent with the traditional use. A clear correlation has also been found between the antimicrobial activity and the flavonoid content of the plant extracts which is in agreement with the literature. Hence, the results presented here can be used to guide the selection of potential plant species for the isolation and structure elucidation of novel antimicrobial compounds in order to establish the structure-activity relationship. This in turn is expected to lead the way to the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents for therapeutic use.
TI  - Impact of chlorine dioxide gas sterilization on nosocomial organism viability in  a hospital room.
AB  - To evaluate the ability of ClO2 to decontaminate pathogens known to cause healthcare-associated infections in a hospital room strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Staphylococcus aureus were spot placed in duplicate pairs at 10 sites throughout a hospital room and then exposed to ClO2 gas. Organisms were collected and evaluated for reduction in colony forming units following gas exposure. Six sterilization cycles with varied gas concentrations, exposure limits, and relative humidity levels were conducted. Reductions in viable organisms achieved ranged from 7 to 10-log reductions. Two sterilization cycles failed to produce complete inactivation of organisms placed in a bathroom with the door closed. Reductions of organisms in the bathroom ranged from 6-log to 10-log reductions. Gas leakage between hospital floors did not occur; however, some minor gas leakage from the door of hospital room was measured which was subsequently sealed to prevent further leakage. Novel technologies for disinfection of hospital rooms require validation and safety testing in clinical environments. Gaseous ClO2 is effective for sterilizing environmental contamination in a hospital room. Concentrations of ClO2 up to 385 ppm were safely maintained in a hospital room with enhanced environmental controls.
TI  - Antimicrobial efficacy of a novel silver hydrogel dressing compared to two common silver burn wound dressings: Acticoat and PolyMem Silver((R)).
AB  - A novel burn wound hydrogel dressing has been previously developed which is composed of 2-acrylamido-2-methylpropane sulfonic acid sodium salt with silver nanoparticles. This study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of this novel dressing to two commercially available silver dressings; Acticoat and PolyMem Silver((R)). Three different antimicrobial tests were used: disc diffusion, broth culture, and the Live/Dead((R)) Baclight bacterial viability assay. Burn wound pathogens (P. aeruginosa, MSSA, A. baumannii and C. albicans) and antibiotic resistant strains (MRSA and VRE) were tested. All three antimicrobial tests indicated that Acticoat was the most effective antimicrobial agent, with inhibition zone lengths of 13.9-18.4mm. It reduced the microbial inocula below the limit of detection (10(2)CFU/ml) and reduced viability by 99% within 4h. PolyMem Silver((R)) had no zone of inhibition for most tested micro-organisms, and it also showed poor antimicrobial activity in the broth culture and Live/Dead((R)) Baclight assays. Alarmingly, it appeared to promote the growth of VRE. The silver hydrogel reduced most of the tested microbial inocula below the detection limit and decreased bacterial viability by 94-99% after 24h exposure. These results support the possibility of using this novel silver hydrogel as a burn wound dressing in the future.
TI  - Identification of a novel antimicrobial peptide from human hepatitis B virus core protein arginine-rich domain (ARD).
AB  - The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens causes an increasing challenge to public health. Antimicrobial peptides are considered a possible solution to this problem. HBV core protein (HBc) contains an arginine-rich domain (ARD) at its C-terminus, which consists of 16 arginine residues separated into four clusters (ARD I to IV). In this study, we demonstrated that the peptide containing the full-length ARD I-IV (HBc147-183) has a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity at micro-molar concentrations, including some MDR and colistin (polymyxin E)-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, confocal fluorescence microscopy and SYTOX Green uptake assay indicated that this peptide killed Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria by membrane permeabilization or DNA binding. In addition, peptide ARD II-IV (HBc153-176) and ARD I-III (HBc147-167) were found to be necessary and sufficient for the activity against P. aeruginosa and K. peumoniae. The antimicrobial activity of HBc ARD peptides can be attenuated by the addition of LPS. HBc ARD peptide was shown to be capable of direct binding to the Lipid A of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in several in vitro binding assays. Peptide ARD I-IV (HBc147-183) had no detectable cytotoxicity in various tissue culture systems and a mouse animal model. In the mouse model by intraperitoneal (i.p.) inoculation with Staphylococcus aureus, timely treatment by i.p. injection with ARD peptide resulted in 100-fold reduction of bacteria load in blood, liver and spleen, as well as 100% protection of inoculated animals from death. If peptide was injected when bacterial load in the blood reached its peak, the protection rate dropped to 40%. Similar results were observed in K. peumoniae using an IVIS imaging system. The finding of anti-microbial HBc ARD is discussed in the context of commensal gut microbiota, development of intrahepatic anti-viral immunity and establishment of chronic infection with HBV. Our current results suggested that HBc ARD could be a new promising antimicrobial peptide.
TI  - Design and construction of a single tube, quantitative endpoint, LATE-PCR multiplex assay for ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to develop a molecular diagnostic multiplex assay for the quantitative detection of microbial pathogens commonly responsible for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and their antibiotic resistance using linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR). METHOD AND RESULTS: This multiplex assay was designed for the quantitative detection and identification of pathogen genomic DNA of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, plus a control target from Lactococcus lactis. After amplification, the single-stranded amplicons were detected simultaneously in the same closed tube by hybridization to low-temperature molecular beacon probes labelled with four differently coloured fluorophores. The resulting hybrids were then analysed by determining the fluorescence intensity of each of the four fluorophores as a function of temperature. CONCLUSIONS: This LATE-PCR single tube multiplex assay generated endpoint fluorescent contours that allowed identification of all microbial pathogens commonly responsible for VAP, including MRSA. The assay was quantitative, identifying the pathogens present in the sample, no matter whether there were as few as 10 or as many 100 000 target genomes. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This assay is rapid, reliable and sensitive and is ready for preclinical testing using samples recovered from patients suffering from ventilator-associated pneumonia.
TI  - A rabbit osteomyelitis model to simulate multibacterial war wound infections.
AB  - A challenge facing military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant infection in extremity wounds. Most frequently identified resistant strains are methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and Acinetobacter baumannii (AB). We adapted an existing osteomyelitis model to simulate an infected extremity wound for antibiotic testing. New Zealand White Rabbits (n = 95) were divided into 6 inoculation groups for infection with MRSA, KP, PA, and AB alone, and in multibacteria infections. Sodium morrhuate was injected into the left tibia to simulate blast wound trauma, then the respective bacteria or combination of pathogens, and finally sterile saline were injected. Colony-forming units for the mono-organism groups showed that AB, KP, or PA alone at 10(7) colony-forming units per mL (CFUs/mL) was effective for rabbit osteomyelitis induction. Colony-forming units for the multiorganism groups showed that the combination of AB (10(7) CFUs/mL)/KP (10(7) CFUs/mL)/PA (10(7) CFUs/mL)/MRSA (10(5) CFUs/mL) yielded a 100% osteomyelitis induction rate. At 8 weeks, however, only one mono-bacterial group and one multibacterial group showed significant radiographic improvement (p < 0.05). The rabbit model of osteomyelitis can be adapted to study infected blast wounds typical of those seen in veterans. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the model simulating multibacterial infections with multidrug-resistant organisms.
TI  - Wound healing potential of topical bacteriophage therapy on diabetic cutaneous wounds.
AB  - Chronic wounds that fail to heal are a common complication of diabetes mellitus and the most common precipitating reason for nontraumatic lower limb amputation. Unfortunately, the bacterial species that cause these infections are becoming more resistant to antibiotics, making them increasingly difficult to treat. We assessed the feasibility of combating chronic bacterial infections with a topically delivered bacteriophage cocktail in two animal models of diabetes mellitus. Microbiological, planimetric, and histological parameters were compared in debrided infected wounds with or without topical bacteriophage treatment. We determined that bacteriophage treatment effectively decreased bacterial colony counts and improved wound healing, as indicated by smaller epithelial and dermal gaps, in Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections but was not as effective against Acinetobacter baumannii. Although the improvements were more significant in the rodent model than in the porcine model, our results suggest that topically administered bacteriophage treatment may be effective in resolving chronic infections, especially when applied in conjunction with wound debridement. These findings have important implications for the feasibility of using topical antimicrobial therapies to safely treat chronic infections in diabetes mellitus patients.
TI  - Impact of electronic surveillance on isolation practices.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the impact of an electronic surveillance system on isolation practices and rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). DESIGN: A pre-post test intervention. SETTING: Inpatient units (except psychiatry and labor and delivery) in 4 New York City hospitals. PATIENTS: All patients for whom isolation precautions were indicated, May 2009-December 2011. METHODS: Trained observers assessed isolation sign postings, availability of isolation carts, and staff use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Infection rates were obtained from the infection control department. Regression analyses were used to examine the association between the surveillance system, infection prevention practices, and MRSA infection rates. RESULTS: A total of 54,159 isolation days and 7,628 staff opportunities for donning PPE were observed over a 31-month period. Odds of having an appropriate sign posted were significantly higher after intervention than before intervention (odds ratio [OR], 1.10 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 1.01-1.20]). Relative to baseline, postintervention sign posting improved significantly for airborne and droplet precautions but not for contact precautions. Sign posting improved for vancomycin-resistant enterococci (OR, 1.51 [95% CI, 1.23-1.86]; [Formula: see text]), Clostridium difficile (OR, 1.59 [95% CI, 1.27-2.02]; [Formula: see text]), and Acinetobacter baumannii (OR, 1.41 [95% CI, 1.21-1.64]; [Formula: see text]) precautions but not for MRSA precautions (OR, 1.11 [95% CI, 0.89-1.39]; [Formula: see text]). Staff and visitor adherence to PPE remained low throughout the study but improved from 29.1% to 37.0% after the intervention (OR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.01-1.29]). MRSA infection rates were not significantly different after the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: An electronic surveillance system resulted in small but statistically significant improvements in isolation practices but no reductions in infection rates over the short term. Such innovations likely require considerable uptake time.
TI  - Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy with decacationic monoadducts and bisadducts of [70]fullerene: in vitro and in vivo studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy uses photosensitizers designed to  bind to microorganisms and generate reactive oxygen species when illuminated with visible light. MATERIALS & METHODS: We synthesized a highly water-soluble [70]fullerene monoadduct, C70[>M(C3N6(+)C3)2]-(I(-))10 (LC17), and bisadduct, C70[>M(C3N6(+)C3)2][>M(C3N6C3)2] (LC18), both with a well-defined decacationic quaternary ammonium iodide moiety with ten positive charges per C70 to give water solubility and bacterial binding. We determined the antimicrobial effects against human pathogens, Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative species (Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii) when activated by UVA or white light. RESULTS: White light was more effective with LC17, while UVA light was more effective with LC18. Both compounds were effective in a mouse model of Gram-negative third-degree burn infections determined by bioluminescence imaging. DISCUSSION & CONCLUSION: We propose that the attachment of an additional deca(tertiary-ethylenylamino)malonate arm to C70 allowed the moiety to act as a potent electron donor and increased the generation yield of hydroxyl radicals under UVA illumination.
TI  - Evaluation of ambulance decontamination using gaseous chlorine dioxide.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We evaluated gaseous chlorine dioxide (ClO2) decontamination of an ambulance using a variety of bacterial biological agents. METHODS: Spores of attenuated Bacillus anthracis and Bacillus atrophaeus as well as vegetative cells of Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Staphylococcus aureus were exposed to ClO2 gas inside an ambulance. Log reduction in viability was assessed following decontamination using organism plate counts. RESULTS: Ambulance decontamination with ClO2 gas concentrations of 362 to 695 ppm maintained to exposures of 756 ppm-hours with 65% relative humidity (RH) achieved inactivation of all the bacterial agents tested. Decreasing exposure (ppm-hours) and RH (<65%) or restricting air flow reduced inactivation but still achieved greater than 6-log reductions in organism viability. CONCLUSION: Up to 10-log reductions were achieved in an ambulance interior following exposure to ClO2, indicating that gas concentrations needed to mitigate biological agent contamination can be achieved and maintained safely in an ambulance. Future studies are ongoing to evaluate gaseous ClO2 in other environments contaminated with biological agents of health care concern.
TI  - Previous antibiotic exposure and evolution of antibiotic resistance in mechanically ventilated patients with nosocomial infections.
AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the impact of previous antibiotic exposure  and the influence of time interval since exposure on the evolution of antibiotic-resistant infections. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed 167 mechanically ventilated patients with nosocomial infections over a 3-year period, with focus on infections in the bloodstream, urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and surgical sites. RESULTS: Of 167 patients, 62% were confirmed as antibiotic resistant. The most common isolated pathogen was extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae (43.9%), followed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (22.8%), and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (17.5%). Multivariate analysis revealed that the association between resistance and the time interval increased within 10 days (odds ratio [OR], 2.45; P=.133) and peaked at 11 to 20 days (OR, 7.17; P=.012). The data were categorized into 2 groups: when the time interval was more than 20 days, there was a 23.9% reduction in resistance rate compared with when the time interval was 20 days or less (OR, 0.36; P=.002). CONCLUSIONS: Although antibiotic exposure increased resistance rate in nosocomial infections, this association decreased as time interval increased. Antibiotic stewardship should consider the significance of time interval while investigating the evolution of subsequent antibiotic-resistant infections.
TI  - Nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in Cuban intensive care units: bacterial species and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial pneumonia associated with use of mechanical ventilators  is one of the greatest challenges confronted by intensivists worldwide. The literature associates several bacteria with this type of infection; most common in intensive care units are Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and some of the Enterobacteriaceae family. OBJECTIVES: To identify the causal agents of nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation in the intensive care units of Havana's Hermanos Ameijeiras Clinical-Surgical Teaching Hospital in 2011, and to characterize their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted using hospital administrative data of quantitative cultures from positive tracheal aspirates for January through December, 2011. Records were analyzed from 77 intensive care unit patients who developed nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. Variables examined were age and sex, and pathogens identified from culture of tracheal aspirate and related antibiotic susceptibility. RESULTS Species most frequently isolated were: Acinetobacter baumannii in 53 patients (68.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 34 patients (44.2%), other species of Pseudomonas in 15 patients (19.5%), and Serratia marcescens, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli in 12 patients each (15.6%). Some patients presented more than one pathogen in concurrent or successive infections. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing found high percentages of resistance to antibiotics in all these pathogens. Least resistance was found to colistin. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of antibiotic resistance in bacteria causing nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia is of concern. Colistin is the drug of choice among the antibiotics reviewed, but sensitivity to other antibiotics should be assessed to search for more appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for treating nosocomial ventilator-associated pneumonia. Our results also suggest the need to strengthen infection control efforts, particularly in intensive care units, and to reassess compliance with quality control procedures. Multidisciplinary research involving microbiologists, epidemiologists, internists and intensivists is needed to fully understand the etiological and resistance patterns observed.
TI  - Frequency of microorganisms isolated in patients with bacteremia in intensive care units in Colombia and their resistance profiles.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe the most frequently found bacterial microorganisms in bloodstream isolates taken from patients in intensive care units in Colombia and their resistance profiles. METHODS: This was a multicentre descriptive observational study that was carried out between January 2001 and June 2008 with laboratory data from 33 participating hospitals in a surveillance network. RESULTS: The most frequently found microorganisms were coagulase-negative Staphylococci 39.6%, Staphylococcus aureus 12.3%, Klebsiella pneumoniae 8.2%, Escherichia coli 5.7%, Acinetobacter baumannii, 4.0% and Pseudomonas aeruginosa 3.8%. Coagulase-negative Staphylococci registered greater than 70% oxacillin resistance rate. S. aureus presented a change in its multiresistance profile during the years of follow-up. There was a trend towards a lower resistance rate among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates during the study period while A. baumannii carbapenem resistance rate exceeded 50%. DISCUSSION: There has been a change in the frequency of species being isolated with a higher frequency of enterobacteriaceae compared to Gram-positive microorganisms, in general with a high resistance rate.
TI  - [Distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria causing bloodstream infections in patients in intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria  causing bloodstream infections in intensive care unit (ICU) patients and to provide a basis for rational clinical use of antibiotics. METHODS: The data of positive specimens, including whole blood, catheter blood and bone marrow samples, were isolated from ICU patients from January 2010 to December 2012. Disc diffusion method, micro-dilution and Etest method were used to test drug sensitivity. Distribution and antibiotic resistance of bacteria were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: A total of 1077 strains were isolated from 903 patients with bloodstream infection during 3 years. Gram-positive (G(+)) bacteria and Gram-negative (G(-)) bacteria accounted for 59.33% (639 isolates) and 40.67% (438 isolates) respectively. The 5 most frequently isolated bacteria were Staphylococcus epidermidis (20.06%, 216 isolates) followed in order by Escherichia coli (13.93%, 150 isolates), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.03%, 108 isolates), Klebsiella pneumonia (7.80%, 84 isolates) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.96%, 75 isolates). There was no significant difference in distribution of bacteria during 3 years. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis was higher than that of Staphylococcus aureus to most of the tested drugs. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis to quinoline/dalfopristin (4.2%) and nitrofurazone (15.3%) was relatively low, while resistance to penicillin (94.4%), linezolid (93.1%), piperacillin/tazobactam (90.3%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (87.5%) and oxacillin (83.3%) was over 80%. The resistance rate of Staphylococcus aureus to penicillin (96.0%), cefoperazone/sulbactam (84.0%), linezolid (76.0%) and oxacillin (76.0%) was over 70%, and resistance to the other common antibacterial drugs was below 70%. The resistance rate of Acinetobacter baumannii to amikacin (38.9%), nitrofurazone (91.7%), cefotetan (88.9%), ceftazidime (88.9%), ampicillin (88.9%), ceftriaxone (86.1%), the cefepime (86.1%), aztreonam (80.6%) and cefazolin (80.6%), and overall above 80%. The resistance rate of Escherichia coli to amikacin (30.0%), cefotetan (24.0%) and imipenem (16.0%) was below 30%, while resistance to ampicillin/sulbactam (94.0%), levofloxacin (84.0%), ampicillin (84.0%) and ceftriaxone (80.0%) was over 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Among the bacteria causing bloodstream infection as isolated from ICU patients, G(+) and G(-) bacteria accounted for 59.33% and 40.67%, respectively. The resistance rate of G(-) was higher than that of G(+), and resistance rate of majority of bacteria was higher than 60% on average. Before obtaining the susceptibility test Results, both G(-) and G(+) should be taken into account on choosing antimicrobial drugs in the treatment of ICU patients.
TI  - Surveillance of multidrug resistant uropathogenic bacteria in hospitalized patients in Indian.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To record surveillance, antibiotic resistance of uropathogens of hospitalized patients over a period of 18 months. METHODS: Urine samples from wards and cabins were used for isolating urinary tract infection (UTI)-causing bacteria that were cultured on suitable selective media and identified by biochemical tests; and their antibiograms were ascertained by Kirby-Bauer's disc diffusion method, in each 6-month interval of the study period, using 18 antibiotics of five different classes. RESULTS: From wards and cabins, 1 245 samples were collected, from which 996 strains of bacteria belonging to 11 species were isolated, during April 2011 to September 2012. Two Gram-positive, Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis), and nine Gram-negative bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter sp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were isolated. Both S. aureus and E. faecalis were vancomycin resistant, and resistant-strains of all pathogens increased in each 6-month period of study. Particularly, all Gram-negatives were resistant to nitrofurantoin and co-trimoxazole, the most preferred antibiotics of empiric therapy for UTI. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiograms of 11 UTI-causing bacteria recorded in this study indicated moderately higher numbers of strains resistant to each antibiotic studied, generating the fear of precipitating fervent episodes in public health particularly with bacteria, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and S. aureus. Moreover, vancomycin resistance in strains of S. aureus and E. faecalis is a matter of concern.
TI  - Drug resistance patterns of bacteria isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia at Tehran hospitals during 2009-2011.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Nosocomial pneumonia remains an important cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Surveillance programs play an important role in the identification of common etiologic agents and local patterns of antimicrobial resistance. METHODOLOGY: In this study we determined the frequency and antimicrobial susceptibility of pathogens isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia during 2009 to 2011. RESULTS: A total of 642 bacteria were isolated from 516 suspected samples. Acinetobacter baumannii (21.1%, n = 136), was the commonest isolated pathogen followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.4%, n = 112), Staphylococcus aureus (15.8%, n = 102) and enterococci (8.4% n = 54). The most effective therapeutic agents against A. baumannii were polymyxin B (95.5% susceptible), ceftriaxone/tazobactam (72% susceptible) and levofloxacin (52.9% susceptible). Polymixin B (89.2% susceptible), ceftriaxone/tazobactam (89.2% susceptible) and piperacillin-tazobactam (80.3% susceptible) were found to be the most active agents against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases were detected among isolates of K. pneumoniae (45.4%) and E. coli (20.3%). Overall, the prevalence of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and vancomycin resistant enterococci were 80.4% and 40.7% respectively. Linezolid was found to be the most active antibiotic against these pathogens. The etiology of 50% of the nosocomial infection cases was polymicrobial. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of ceftriaxone/tazobactam seems to be beneficial agent against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli isolated form respiratory tract infections. The results of our study can be used for guiding appropriate empiric therapy in this geographic region.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria collected from countries in Eastern Europe: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) 2004-2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) commenced in 2004 to longitudinally monitor global changes in bacterial susceptibility to a suite of antimicrobial agents. The current study examined the activity of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected across Eastern Europe between 2004 and 2010. Minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodologies. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using CLSI interpretive criteria, and tigecycline susceptibility was established using European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints. This study included 10 295 Gram-negative and 4611 Gram-positive isolates from 42 centres. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were reported among 15.3% of Escherichia coli and 39.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates; the highest rates were observed in Turkey (30.9%) and Bulgaria (53.8%), respectively. Imipenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae were identified only in Turkey. ESBL-positive E. coli were highly susceptible to imipenem (95.1%), meropenem (98.0%) and tigecycline (98.5%). Most antimicrobials showed poor activity against Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Vancomycin resistance was noted among 0.9% of Enterococcus faecalis and 11.7% of Enterococcus faecium isolates. High rates of susceptibility were reported for linezolid (99.7%) and tigecycline (100%) against E. faecium. One-quarter of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), with the highest rate in Romania (51.5%); all MRSA were susceptible to linezolid, tigecycline and vancomycin. Antimicrobial resistance is high in much of Eastern Europe, with considerable variation seen among countries. Tigecycline and the carbapenems retain excellent activity against many pathogens from Eastern Europe; linezolid and vancomycin are active against most Gram-positive pathogens.
TI  - The type, level, and distribution of microorganisms within the ward environment:  a zonal analysis of an intensive care unit and a gastrointestinal surgical ward.
AB  - OBJECTIVE. To investigate the distribution of hospital pathogens within general and critical care ward environments and to determine the most significant bacterial reservoirs within each ward type. DESIGN. Prospective 4-month microbiological survey. SETTING. The intensive care unit (ICU) and gastrointestinal (GI) surgical ward of a London teaching hospital. PATIENTS. Sampling was conducted in and around the bed space of 166 different patients (99 in the ICU and 67 in the GI ward). METHODS. Conventional agar contact methodology was used to sample 123 predetermined sites twice a week for 17 weeks. Sixty-one surfaces were located within the ICU, and 62 were located within the GI ward. Each surface was located within a theoretical zone of increasing distance from the patient. Aerobic colony counts were determined, and confirmatory testing was conducted on all presumptive pathogens. RESULTS. Regardless of ward type, surfaces located closest to the patient, specifically those associated with the bed (side rails, bed control, and call button), were the most heavily contaminated. Elsewhere, the type of surfaces contaminated differed with ward type. In the ICU, bacteria were most likely to be on surfaces that were regularly touched by healthcare workers (e.g., telephones and computer keyboards). In the GI ward, where the patients were mobile, the highest numbers of bacteria (including potential nosocomial pathogens) were on surfaces that were mainly touched by patients, particularly their toilet and shower facilities. CONCLUSIONS. In terms of cleaning, a hospital should not be considered a single entity. Different ward types should be treated as separate environments, and cleaning protocols should be adjusted accordingly.
TI  - A randomized controlled trial of enhanced cleaning to reduce contamination of healthcare worker gowns and gloves with multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE. To determine whether enhanced daily cleaning would reduce contamination of healthcare worker (HCW) gowns and gloves with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB). DESIGN. A cluster-randomized controlled trial. SETTING. Four intensive care units (ICUs) in an urban tertiary care hospital. PARTICIPANTs. ICU rooms occupied by patients colonized with MRSA or MDRAB. INTERVENTION. Extra enhanced daily cleaning of ICU room surfaces frequently touched by HCWs. RESULTS. A total of 4,444 cultures were collected from 132 rooms over 10 months. Using fluorescent dot markers at 2,199 surfaces, we found that 26% of surfaces in control rooms were cleaned and that 100% of surfaces in experimental rooms were cleaned (P < .001). The mean proportion of contaminated HCW gowns and gloves following routine care provision and before leaving the rooms of patients with MDRAB was 16% among control rooms and 12% among experimental rooms (relative risk, 0.77 [95% confidence interval, 0.28-2.11]; P = .23). For MRSA, the mean proportions were 22% and 19%, respectively (relative risk, 0.89 [95% confidence interval, 0.50-1.53]; P = .16). DISCUSSION. Intense enhanced daily cleaning of ICU rooms occupied by patients colonized with MRSA or MDRAB was associated with a nonsignificant reduction in contamination of HCW gowns and gloves after routine patient care activities. Further research is needed to determine whether intense environmental cleaning will lead to significant reductions and fewer infections.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance rates in causative agents of infections in diabetic patients: rising concerns.
AB  - The vicious cycle is that hyperglycemia (>/=11.1 mmol/l) or other diabetes-associated factors facilitate or worsen the development of infections and vice versa, the infections deteriorate the glycemic control of the patients. Diabetic patients are prone to some infections, infection recurrences and poor outcomes. Immunocompromised state and frequent antibiotic use are associated with antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis (in some studies), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, bacteria in diabetic foot infections and different opportunistic and rare pathogens or multidrug-resistant strains. Prompt diagnostics and susceptibility testing, early and aggressive surgical and/or antibiotic therapy, and, importantly, good glycemic control are of utmost importance for treatment of antibiotic-resistant infections in diabetic patients.
TI  - Antimicrobial use, incidence, etiology and resistance patterns in bacteria causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in a clinical-surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing threat in hospitalized patients, and inappropriate empirical antimicrobial therapy is known to adversely affect outcomes in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial usage, incidence, etiology, and antimicrobial resistance trends for prominent nosocomial pathogens causing ventilator-associated pneumonia in a clinical-surgical intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Gram-negative bacilli and Staphylococcus aureus causing VAP, as well as their antimicrobial resistance patterns and data on consumption (defined daily dose [DDD] per 1,000 patient days) of glycopeptides, extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenems in the unit were evaluated in two different periods (A and B). RESULTS: Antimicrobial use was high, mainly of broad-spectrum cephalosporins, with a significant increase in the consumption of glycopeptides (p < 0.0001) and carbapenems (p < 0.007) in period B. For Acinetobacter baumannii and members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 5.27- and 3.06-fold increases in VAPs, respectively, were noted, and a significant increase in resistance rates was found for imipenem-resistant A. baumannii (p = 0.003) and third-generation cephalosporins-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (p = 0.01) isolates in this same period. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that there is a link between antibiotics usage at institutional levels and resistant bacteria. The use of carbapenems was related to the high rate of resistance in A. baumannii and therefore a high consumption of imipenem/meropenem could play a major role in selective pressure exerted by antibiotics in A. baumannii strains.
TI  - One-year surveillance of ESKAPE pathogens in an intensive care unit of Monterrey, Mexico.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial species from the ESKAPE group (i.e. Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) are frequently resistant to antibiotics. The purpose of this study was to monitor the incidence of ESKAPE pathogens at the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital in Monterrey, Mexico. METHODS: All clinically relevant organisms isolated from June 2011 to June 2012 were included. Identification and susceptibility testing was performed using panels from Sensititre. Resistance to oxacillin, for S. aureus, and the production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), for K. pneumonia, were determined as defined by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Also, the presence of vanA and vanB genes was determined in E. faecium vancomycin (VAN)-resistant isolates. RESULTS: The majority of pathogens (64.5%) isolated in the ICU unit were from the ESKAPE group. The organisms most frequently isolated were A. baumannii (15.8%) and P. aeruginosa (14.3%). A high resistance to carbapenems was detected for A. baumannii (75.3%) while 62% of S. aureus isolates were confirmed to be methicillin resistant. Of the K. pneumoniae isolates, 36.9% were ESBL producers. We detected three E. faecium VAN-resistant isolates, all of which contained the vanA gene. CONCLUSION: The presence of the ESKAPE group of pathogens is a major problem in the ICU setting. The results of this study support the implementation of special antimicrobial strategies to specifically target these microorganisms.
TI  - [Pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance for hospital aquired pneumonia in respiratory medicine intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance of pathogens isolated from in-patients with hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the Department of Respiratory Medicine Intensive Care Unit (RICU) of Xiangya Hospital in 2005 and in 2011, and to provide reasonable anti-infectious strategy. METHODS: The positive susceptibility test of sputum (bronchial secretions) culture was done in patients with HAP in RICU of Xiangya Hospital in 2005 and in 2011, and the distribution feature and antibiotic resistance were compared. RESULTS: 1) In the two years, the main pathogen in HAP patients was Gram negative bacteria (infection rate was 68.07% and 65.21% in 2005 and in2011 respectively). The primary pathogenic bacteria were changed, and Acinetobacter baumanii became the most common Gram negative bacterium which replaced Pseudomonas aeruginosa, with infection rate 6.81% in 2005 to 40.87% in 2011. The infection rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa reduced from 20.42% in 2005 to 15.60% in 2011. Haemophilus influenzae was rare. Staphylococcus aureus became the primary Gram positive bacteria, and its infection rate increased from 1.57% in 2005 to 4.83% in 2011, all of which were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Saccharomyces albicans' positive culture rate increased significantly. 2) Compared with in 2005, the antibiotic resistance of pathogen isolated from the HAP pationts changed a lot in 2011: increased antibiotic resistance rate and decreased sensitivity to many antibiotics. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was only relatively susceptible to meropenem, cefoperazone sulbactam, ceftazidime, cefpodoxime, and andamicaxin in 2011. The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to levofloxacin, cyclopropane, amicacin, gentamicin, meropenem, cematrixone, and piperacilintazobactam increased obviously (P<0.05). Compared with 2005, Acinetobacter baumanii was totally susceptible to polymyxin and relatively susceptible to sulbactam, but it was almost completely resistant to Aminoglycoside antibiotics in 2011, with significant difference (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: The main pathogen of HAP patients in RICU was Gram negative bacteria, with increased infection rate of Staphylococcus aureus and fungus. There is change pathogen distribution and antibiotic resistance, and the clinical initial experimental antibiotic therapy may be influenced. It is important to use antibiotics more rationally to delay the antibiotic resistance.
TI  - Sponge-derived Kocuria and Micrococcus spp. as sources of the new thiazolyl peptide antibiotic kocurin.
AB  - Forty four marine actinomycetes of the family Microccocaceae isolated from sponges collected primarily in Florida Keys (USA) were selected from our strain collection to be studied as new sources for the production of bioactive natural products. A 16S rRNA gene based phylogenetic analysis showed that the strains are members of the genera Kocuria and Micrococcus. To assess their biosynthetic potential, the strains were PCR screened for the presence of secondary metabolite genes encoding nonribosomal synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthases (PKS). A small extract collection of 528 crude extracts generated from nutritional microfermentation arrays was tested for the production of bioactive secondary metabolites against clinically relevant strains (Bacillus subtilis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans). Three independent isolates were shown to produce a new anti-MRSA bioactive compound that was identified as kocurin, a new member of the thiazolyl peptide family of antibiotics emphasizing the role of this family as a prolific resource for novel drugs.
TI  - [Comparative study of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from burned patients during two periods (2005-2008, 2008-2011) and in two hospitals (Hospital Aziza Othmana, Trauma and Burn Center)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring of the bacterial flora and antibiotic resistance of the main bacteria involved in nosocomial infections helps improve treatment and prevention strategies. AIM: To compare the bacteriological profile and antibiotic susceptibility of the main bacterial isolates within the burned patients over two periods of 3 years and in two hospitals. METHODS: During two three-year periods: period 1 (P1): 1/7/2005-30/6/2008 and period 2 (P2): 1/7/2008-30/6/2011) and in two hospitals: Hospital Aziza Othmana (HAO) and the traumatology and burn center (CTGB), 2153 and 3719 non-repetitive strains were isolated from burn patients from different samples. The transfer of the intensive care unit was made on 01/07/2008 from the Hospital Aziza Othmana to CTGB. The study of antibiotic sensitivity was performed according to CA-SFM. RESULTS: During the period P1, Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the main bacteria isolated (18%) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (14%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (12%). After the transfer of intensive care burn unit to the traumatology center, ecology bacterial varied with S. aureus (20%) in the first place followed by P. aeruginosa (15%) and Proteus mirabilis (11%). The study of the evolution of antibiotic susceptibility showed an overall downward trend of resistance in the second half of 2008, immediately after the transfer of service in the new hospital structure. The rate of ceftazidim resistant Klebsilella pneumoniae decreased from 80.4% to 50%, Similarly the resistance of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem decreased respectively from 61% to 39.4% and from 63.3% to 37.1%. Nevertheless, the reduction of resistance was followed by a rapid increasing during the year 2009 to reach overall rates of resistance previously observed in the hospital Aziza Othmana. Concerning S. aureus, the rate of MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus) showed no significant variation throughout the study period: 60% versus 56.3% at HAO and CTGB. A. baumannii brings up the problem of mutiresistance: 92.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime and 63.9% to imipenem during P1 with an emphasis on resistance to imipenem during P2 increased to 89.3%. CONCLUSION: Resistance is a problem in the intensive care burn unit. Preventive measures have to be taken.
TI  - Response to "assessment of infection risk from environmental contamination using  rapid ATP surface measurements".
AB  
TI  - Acinetobacter is the most common pathogen associated with late-onset and recurrent ventilator-associated pneumonia in an adult intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The guidelines for initial empiric antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are highly dependent on the type of causative pathogen and the time of diagnosis. The objective of this study was to examine the microbial causes of VAP and describe any variability by the timing of VAP onset and over time. METHODS: A prospective surveillance study was conducted in the adult general intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Microbial isolates obtained from blood and different respiratory specimens of patients diagnosed with VAP (using the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention definition) between August 2003 and June 2009 were included. RESULTS: A total of 457 pathogens were identified during the study; 380 (83.2%) were associated with primary VAP and 77 (16.8%) were associated with recurrent VAP. Of primary VAP pathogens, 159 (41.8%) were associated with early-onset (<5 days) and 221 (58.2%) were associated with late-onset (>/=5 days) VAP. The most common pathogen identified was Acinetobacter spp (26.5%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21.7%), Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (15.3%), Klebsiella spp (6.8%), Haemophilus spp (6.1%), and Enterobacter spp (5.0%). Acinetobacter spp and MRSA were significantly associated with late-onset VAP while Haemophilus spp and Streptococcus pneumoniae were significantly associated with early-onset VAP. Acinetobacter spp was the only pathogen associated with recurrent VAP and its incidence showed a significant increasing trend during the study period. Acinetobacter spp was significantly associated with prolonged ventilation, sedation, and nasogastric intubation. CONCLUSIONS: Acinetobacter baumannii is the most common and increasingly important pathogen associated with VAP in our patients, especially late-onset and recurrent VAP.

TI  - Emerging threat of multidrug resistant bugs--Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by bacteria such as multidrug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) constitute a worldwide pandemic. Without gathering information about these strains, we cannot reduce the morbidity and mortality due to infections caused by these notorious bugs. METHODS: This study was conducted to identify the status of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA in a tertiary care centre of Nepal. Sputum, endotracheal aspirate and bronchial washing specimens were collected and processed from patients suspected of lower respiratory tract infection following standard microbiological methods recommended by the American Society for Microbiology (ASM). Double disk synergy test method was employed for the detection of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) in Acinetobacter isolates. Methicillin resistance in S. aureus was confirmed by using cefoxitin and oxacillin disks. RESULTS: Different genomespecies of Acinetobacter were isolated; these consisted of Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii complex and A. lwoffii. Around 95% of Acinetobacter isolates were MDR, while 12.9% were ESBL-producer. Of the total 33 isolates of S. aureus, 26 (78.8%) were MDR and 14 (42.4%) were methicillin resistant. CONCLUSIONS: A large number of MDR Acinetobacter spp. and MRSA has been noted in this study. The condition is worsened by the emergence of ESBL producing Acinetobacter spp. Hence, judicious use of antimicrobials is mandatory in clinical settings. Moreover, there should be vigilant surveillance of resistant clones in laboratories.
TI  - Late respiratory infection after lung transplantation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Aiming to improve outcome of lung transplantation (LTx) patients, we  reviewed risk factors and treatment practices for the LTx recipients who experienced respiratory infection in the late post-LTx period (>1 month after LTx). METHODS: We analyzed the clinical data of 48 recipients and donors from 61 LTx, who experienced late respiratory infections. Late respiratory infections were classified according to the etiology, time of occurrence, and frequency of donor-to-host transmission or colonization of the recipient prior to transplantation. RESULTS: During the period of observation, 42 episodes of respiratory infections occurred. The organisms most frequently involved were gram (-) bacteria: Acinetobacter baumannii (n=13, 31.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=7, 16.7%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=4, 10.0%). Among the 42 episodes recorded, 14 occurred in the late post-LTx period. These were bacterial (n=6, 42.9%), fungal (n=2, 14.3%), viral (n=4, 28.5%), and mycobacterial (n=2, 14.3%) infections. Of 6 bacterial infections, 2 were from multidrug-resistant (MDR) A. baumannii and one from each of MDR P. aeruginosa, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (+) K. pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Infection-related death occurred in 6 of the 14 episodes (43%). CONCLUSION: Although the frequency of respiratory infection decreased sharply in the late post-LTx period, respiratory infection was still a major cause of mortality. Gram (-) MDR bacteria were the agents most commonly identified in these infections.
TI  - Emerging resistance problems and future perspectives in pharmacotherapy for complicated urinary tract infections.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are among the most common infectious diseases and contribute to high financial burden worldwide. Administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy is the key to achieving good therapeutic outcomes. The authors review the current status of global or regional epidemiology, especially on the antimicrobial resistance and several potential agents against complicated UTIs by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens. AREAS COVERED: The authors summarized the susceptibility status on several major surveillance programs on uropathogens, focusing on Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Besides, the current perspectives of several potential antimicrobials against MDR uropathogens available for UTIs were also reviewed. EXPERT OPINION: High resistance to broad-spectrum antibiotics, especially to extended-spectrum beta-lactams, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones among uropathogens emerges as a critical problem in many countries. Appropriate antimicrobial stewardship and continuous surveillance are necessary to monitor the trends of susceptibility for main pathogens. For these MDR uropathogens, polymyxin, fosfomycin, tigecycline, nitrofurantoin, linezolid, and daptomycin might be potential treatments for patients with uncomplicated and complicated UTIs in some countries, although they might not be approved by their regulation. However, more clinical evidence and more extensive meta-analyses are needed to evaluate and confirm the effectiveness of their usage in countries with a high prevalence of multidrug resistance.
TI  - Impact of antimicrobial multidrug resistance on inpatient care cost: an evaluation of the evidence.
AB  - This article evaluates the in-hospital costs attributable to antimicrobial multidrug resistance, defined as the difference in averaged costs of the patients infected with a multidrug-resistant (MDR) versus a non-MDR organism. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Twenty four studies were included: four on carbapenem-resistant or MDR Gram negative nonfermenters, eight on extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae and 12 on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. In two studies on carbapenem-resistant nonfermenters, the attributable mean hospital charges were US$58,457 and 85,299, respectively. The attributable mean total costs were US$4484 in a study referring to MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, while that varied from US$1584 to 30,093 among studies on extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. With respect to methicillin-resistant S. aureus, the attributable mean total costs varied from US$1014 to 40,090. The in-hospital costs attributable to multidrug resistance are alarmingly high, justifying the application of strict infection control measures in medical institutions with increased rate of MDR infections.
TI  - Clinical relevance of the ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - In recent years, the Infectious Diseases Society of America has highlighted a faction of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp.) - acronymically dubbed 'the ESKAPE pathogens' - capable of 'escaping' the biocidal action of antibiotics and mutually representing new paradigms in pathogenesis, transmission and resistance. This review aims to consolidate clinically relevant background information on the ESKAPE pathogens and provide a contemporary summary of bacterial resistance, alongside pertinent microbiological considerations necessary to face the mounting threat of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Staphylococcus aureus- the predominant pathogen in the neonatal ICU of a tertiary care hospital in amritsar, India.
AB  - BACKGROUND: An early treatment and the appropriate and the rational use of antibiotics would minimize the risk of severe morbidity and mortality in neonatal sepsis, and reduce the emergence of multi-drug resistant organisms in intensive care units. For the success of an early empiric treatment, a periodic review of the cases to assess any changing trends in the infecting organisms and their antimicrobial susceptibility is important. AIM: To study the most commonly encountered bacterial pathogens which caused neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity patterns, so that guidelines could be prepared for a rational antibiotic therapy. SETTING AND DESIGN: This was a retrospective study which was conducted in the Department of Microbiology and the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at SGRDIMSAR, Amritsar, during June 2011 to June 2012. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 311 newborns who were admitted in an NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by doing standard biochemical tests. The antibiotic resistance patterns of the isolates were studied by the Kirby Bauer disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 131 organisms were isolated from the 311 blood cultures. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n=68), Coagulase Negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) (n=30), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=10), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=9), Escherichia coli (n=05), Enterobacter cloacae (n=04), Citrobacter diversus (n=02), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=02) and Candida (n=01). Staphylococcus aureus was the main pathogen in both early and late-onset sepsis. On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 57.35% of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to amikacin. The resistance to the third generation cephalosporins varied between 50-55%. The resistance to ciprofloxacin was quite high; however, most of the isolates were susceptible to levofloxacin. A majority of the isolates were susceptible to piperacillin- tazobactum and imipenem. CONCLUSION: The present study emphasized the importance of periodic surveys on the microbial flora which was encountered in particular neonatal settings to recognize the trend.
TI  - Anti-inflammatory and anti-superbacterial activity of polyphenols isolated from black raspberry.
AB  - The fruit of the black raspberry (Rubus coreanus Miquel) has been employed in traditional medicine, and recent studies have demonstrated its measureable biological activities. However, the root of the black raspberry has not been studied. Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties of the root and unripe fruit polyphenols of the black raspberry. Both polyphenols proved to have anti-inflammatory activity as evidenced by the decreased nitric oxide (NO), cytokines (IL-1beta , IL-6, and IL-10) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE(2)) levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 murine macrophages. However, root polyphenols showed stronger anti-inflammatory activity than fruit polyphenols. LPS-induced mRNA and protein expressions of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 levels were also decreased, confirming the anti-inflammatory activity. Root polyphenols showed lethal activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Bacillus anthracis. In contrast, the black raspberry fruit did not demonstrate these properties. These data provide the first demonstration that black raspberry root has potential anti-inflammatory and anti-superbacterial properties that can be exploited as alternatives for use in the food and cosmetic industries and/or as pharmaceuticals.
TI  - Infectious risk assessment of unsafe handling practices and management of clinical solid waste.
AB  - The present study was undertaken to determine the bacterial agents present in various clinical solid wastes, general waste and clinical sharp waste. The waste was collected from different wards/units in a healthcare facility in Penang Island, Malaysia. The presence of bacterial agents in clinical and general waste was determined using the conventional bacteria identification methods. Several pathogenic bacteria including opportunistic bacterial agent such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pyogenes were detected in clinical solid wastes. The presence of specific pathogenic bacterial strains in clinical sharp waste was determined using 16s rDNA analysis. In this study, several nosocomial pathogenic bacteria strains of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Lysinibacillus sphaericus, Serratia marcescens, and Staphylococcus aureus were detected in clinical sharp waste. The present study suggests that waste generated from healthcare facilities should be sterilized at the point of generation in order to eliminate nosocomial infections from the general waste or either of the clinical wastes.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant organisms in a routine ward environment: differential propensity for environmental dissemination and implications for infection control.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) pose significant infection-control challenges in settings with high prevalence and limited isolation facilities. This observational study in an 800-bed hospital determined the prevalence, bacterial density and genetic relatedness of MDROs isolated from ward surfaces, medical devices and the hands of healthcare professionals. The targeted MDROs were meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, and carbapenem-resistant (CR) Acinetobacter baumannii. During a 2-month period, microbiological sampling and molecular typing were performed on environment isolates, clinical isolates and isolates recovered from the hands of healthcare professionals. The target MDROs were recovered from 79% of sampled surfaces, predominantly MRSA (74% of all tested surfaces) and CR A. baumannii (29%) but also VRE (2%) and K. pneumoniae (1%). MRSA was recovered from most tested surfaces throughout the ward, whilst CR A. baumannii was significantly more likely to be recovered from near-patient surfaces. Hand sampling demonstrated infrequent recovery of MRSA (5%), CR A. baumannii (1%) and VRE (1%). Molecular typing of the study isolates identified seven MRSA and five Acinetobacter clonal clusters, respectively, and typing identified similar strains from the environment, patients and hands. Thus, in a healthcare setting with endemic circulation of MDROs, MRSA and CR A. baumannii were the predominant organisms recovered from ward surfaces, with MRSA in particular demonstrating widespread environmental dissemination. Molecular typing demonstrated the presence of related strains in patients, in the environment and on the hands of healthcare workers.
TI  - Effectiveness of flexible gastrointestinal endoscope reprocessing.
AB  - The practice of reprocessing endoscopes and its effectiveness was evaluated in 37 services. Contamination of at least 1 endoscope could be identified in 34 (91.6%) of 37 services. Bacteria, fungi, and/or mycobacteria were isolated from 84.6% (33/39) of the colonoscopes (110-32,000 colony-forming units [CFUs]/mL) and from 80.6% (50/62) of the gastroscopes (100-33,000 CFUs/mL). Not all services followed recommended guidelines. Therefore, patients who underwent gastrointestinal endoscopies were exposed to diverse pathogens.
TI  - Molecular viability testing of bacterial pathogens from a complex human sample matrix.
AB  - Assays for bacterial ribosomal RNA precursors (pre-rRNA) have been shown to distinguish viable from inactivated bacterial cells in drinking water samples. Because the synthesis of pre-rRNA is rapidly induced by nutritional stimulation, viable bacteria can be distinguished from inactivated cells and free nucleic acids by measuring the production of species-specific pre-rRNA in samples that have been briefly stimulated with nutrients. Here, pre-rRNA analysis was applied to bacteria from serum, a human sample matrix. In contrast to drinking water, serum is rich in nutrients that might be expected to mask the effects of nutritional stimulation. Reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) assays were used to detect pre-rRNA of four bacterial species: Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. These species were chosen for their clinical significance and phylogenetic diversity (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria). To maximize resolving power, pre-rRNA was normalized to genomic DNA of each pathogen. When viable cells were shifted from serum to bacteriological culture medium, rapid replenishment of pre-rRNA was always observed. Cells of P. aeruginosa that were inactivated in the presence of serum exhibited no pre-rRNA response to nutritional stimulation, despite strong genomic DNA signals in these samples. When semi-automated methods were used, pre-rRNA analysis detected viable A. baumannii cells in serum at densities of </=100 CFU/mL in <5.5 hours. Originally developed for rapid microbiological analysis of drinking water, ratiometric pre-rRNA analysis can also assess the viability of bacterial cells derived from human specimens, without requiring bacteriological culture.
TI  - [Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of clinical isolates about hospital infection from patients with hematological diseases].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology and antibiotic resistance of isolates  from hospitalized patients with hematological disease from 2005 to 2011. METHODS: A total of 1453 bacterial strains were isolated from patients with hematological disease from January 2005 to December 2011. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by micro-dilution method. RESULTS: (1) The majority of the bacterial strains were respiratory passage examples (57.5%). The portage of blood examples in our division (13.60%) was higher than of whole hospital (6.26%), with lower positive rate of bacterial culture (52.37%) than of whole hospital (60.24%). Chemotherapy-induced agranulocytosis was the main reason for hospital infection. 578 (39.8%) bacterial strains were gram positive, and 875 (60.2%) gram negative bacillus. Staphylococcus epidermidis strains and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. (2) Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) accounted for 72.8% antibiotic resistance. Detection rates of ESBLs in Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were 18.9% and 10.4%, respectively. (3) No obvious changes of antimicrobial resistances of Staphylococcus and Enterococcus were observed during these years. The Enterobacteriaceae strains showed lowest resistance rates to Carbapenems, next to Cefoperazone/sulbactam and Piperacillin/tazobactam. But the resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime were gradually increasing during the past years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii of glucose nonfermenters showed lowest resistance rates to Cefoperazone/sulbactam, but the resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems increased. CONCLUSIONS: Escherichia coli was the highest in quantity of gram negative bacillus and glucose nonfermenters had a tendency of ascensus. The resistance rates of Escherichia coli to Cefepime and Ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Carbapenems were gradually increasing in the past years.
TI  - Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance among commonly encountered bacteria associated with infections and colonization in intensive care units in a university-affiliated hospital in Shanghai.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to classify intensive care unit (ICU) bacterial strains as either ICU-acquired or ICU-on-admission and to compare their epidemiological and antibiogram characteristics. METHODS: The study was performed in a 1300-bed university-affiliated hospital from January 1, 2006 to December 31, 2010. Based on the time of ICU admission, ICU isolates were classified as ICU-acquired strains (appearing more than 48 hours after admission) or ICU-on-admission strains (appearing 48 hours or less from admission). The microbiological data before ICU admission, the microbiological data, and susceptibility testing were compared between the ICU-acquired and ICU-on-admission bacterial isolates. RESULTS: The most common ICU-acquired strains were Acinetobacter baumannii (19.5%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.6%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (11.5%), Staphylococcus aureus (10.7%), Enterococcus spp. (10.6%), and Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.7%). There were significant differences between ICU-acquired and ICU-on-admission isolates in the susceptibility rates of Gram-negative bacteria to antibiotics, especially the susceptibility of A. baumannii to imipenem [23.8% (ICU-acquired) vs. 44.4% (ICU-on-admission), p < 0.001] and meropenem (24.1% vs. 37.8%, p < 0.001), and the susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to imipenem (39.3% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.001) and meropenem (58.5% vs. 76.1%, p < 0.05). Furthermore, decreased susceptibility rates of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa to carbapenems were correlated with an extended ICU stay (p < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Because of decreasing susceptibility rates of pathogens (especially ICU-acquired strains) and a significant correlation with the length of ICU stay, intensivists should consider a patient's time of ICU admission and previous microbiological data and should distinguish ICU-acquired strains from non-ICU-acquired strains so as to initiate optimized empirical antibiotic therapy against ICU-acquired infections.
TI  - Tigecycline: an update.
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic with activity against difficult-to-treat pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, and Gram-negative bacterial strains that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases. Minimal organ toxicity and lack of dosage adjustment in most patients are important considerations for tigecycline use. Tigecycline has been shown to be as effective and safe as standard antimicrobial therapy for treatment of adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections, complicated skin and skin structure infections, and community-acquired bacterial pneumonia. The clearest applications of tigecycline are for on-label indications. Whether tigecycline should be utilized as therapy for other infections including hospital-acquired infections with a high likelihood of multidrug-resistant pathogens is a complex issue that requires ongoing assessment. This article offers an updated overview of tigecycline clinical studies, current microbial resistance patterns, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic investigations, and safety analyses.
TI  - Biofilm formation by clinical isolates and the implications in chronic infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilm formation is a major virulence factor contributing to the chronicity of infections. To date few studies have evaluated biofilm formation in infecting isolates of patients including both Gram-positive and Gram-negative multidrug-resistant (MDR) species in the context of numerous types of infectious syndromes. Herein, we investigated the biofilm forming capacity in a large collection of single patient infecting isolates and compared the relationship between biofilm formation to various strain characteristics. METHODS: The biofilm-forming capacity of 205 randomly sampled clinical isolates from patients, collected from various anatomical sites, admitted for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) from 2004-2011, including methicillin-resistant/methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA/MSSA) (n=23), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=53), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=36), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n=54), and Escherichia coli (n=39), were evaluated for biofilm formation using the high-throughput microtiter plate assay and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Relationships between biofilm formation to clonal type, site of isolate collection, and MDR phenotype were evaluated. Furthermore, in patients with relapsing infections, serial strains were assessed for their ability to form biofilms in vitro. RESULTS: Of the 205 clinical isolates tested, 126 strains (61.4%) were observed to form biofilms in vitro at levels greater than or equal to the Staphylococcus epidermidis, positive biofilm producing strain, with P. aeruginosa and S. aureus having the greatest number of biofilm producing strains. Biofilm formation was significantly associated with specific clonal types, the site of isolate collection, and strains positive for biofilm formation were more frequently observed to be MDR. In patients with relapsing infections, the majority of serial isolates recovered from these individuals were observed to be strong biofilm producers in vitro. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to evaluate biofilm formation in a large collection of infecting clinical isolates representing diverse types of infections. Our results demonstrate: (1) biofilm formation is a heterogeneous property amongst clinical strains which is associated with certain clonal types, (2) biofilm forming strains are more frequently isolated from non-fluid tissues, in particular bone and soft tissues, (3) MDR pathogens are more often biofilm formers, and (4) strains from patients with persistent infections are positive for biofilm formation.
TI  - Recent trends in resistance to cell envelope-active antibacterial agents among key bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Cell envelope-active agents, particularly beta-lactams, play a pivotal role in the treatment of bacterial infections and the extent to which their activity is affected by the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms is of concern. We analyzed the Surveillance Network (TSN) database to evaluate resistant trends for key cell envelope-active drugs among ESKAPE pathogens. Analysis demonstrated that the activity of these drugs has been notably influenced by the emergence of multidrug resistance; this was especially evident for the beta-lactam drugs. For example, Acinetobacter baumannii resistance to imipenem increased from 23.9% to 34.3%, and resistance to piperacillin-tazobactam increased from 37.0% to 49.7% between 2007 and 2011. During the same time period Klebsiella pneumoniae resistance to imipenem increased from 0.8% to 3.8%. As beta-lactams are a cornerstone of anti-infective therapy, it is important to closely monitor the activity of the agents being used today and to aggressively pursue new strategies that can augment current drugs and thwart ever-emerging beta-lactam resistance mechanisms that are continuously encountered.
TI  - Suppuration-associated bacteria in patients with chronic and aggressive periodontitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Suppuration (SUP) on probing may be an indication of active periodontal breakdown. The aim of the present study is to analyze which subgingival species are associated with SUP in patients with chronic (CP) and aggressive (AgP) periodontitis. METHODS: A total of 156 patients with CP and 66 with AgP were submitted to full-mouth periodontal examination and subgingival biofilm sampling (14 sites/patient). The counts of 44 bacterial species were determined by checkerboard. Comparisons between groups and sites were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests, respectively. Associations between frequency of SUP and bacterial species were analyzed by the Spearman correlation coefficient. RESULTS: The prevalence of SUP in patients with CP was 24.4%, and in patients with AgP it was 30.3%, and the percentage of SUP sites in the groups was 5.72% +/- 1.06% and 6.96% +/- 1.70%, respectively (P >0.05). SUP sites from patients with CP had significantly higher counts of Veillonella parvula, Dialister pneumosintes, Tannerella forsythia, and Prevotella nigrescens than SUP sites from patients with AgP (P <0.005). Significant positive correlations between high frequency of SUP and high levels of Actinomyces spp, Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were observed in patients with CP (P <0.05). In patients with AgP, Actinomyces oris, Propionibacterium acnes, P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Streptococcus sanguinis were positively associated with SUP, whereas Prevotella intermedia presented a negative association with SUP (P <0.05). CONCLUSIONS: SUP sites from patients with CP harbored significantly higher counts of several periodontal species than SUP sites from patients with AgP. Actinomyces spp., Streptococcus spp., members of the orange complex, T. forsythia, and certain non-oral pathogens were associated with a high number of sites with SUP.
TI  - Comparison of the bacterial etiology of early-onset and late-onset ventilator-associated pneumonia in subjects enrolled in 2 large clinical studies.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is classified as early-onset or late-onset, in part, to identify subjects at risk for infection with resistant pathogens. We assessed differences in the bacterial etiology of early-onset versus late-onset VAP. METHODS: Subjects enrolled in 2004-2006 in 2 clinical studies of doripenem versus imipenem or piperacillin/tazobactam, with a diagnosis of VAP (n = 500) were included in the analysis. Subjects were classified by ventilator status: early-onset VAP (< 5 d of ventilation) or late-onset VAP (>/= 5 d of ventilation). Baseline demographics and bacterial etiology were analyzed by VAP status. RESULTS: Late-onset VAP subjects had higher Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores (mean 16.6 versus 15.5, P = .008). There were no significant differences in Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score, sex, age, or presence of bacteremia between the groups. A total of 496 subjects had a baseline pathogen, and 50% of subjects in each group had >/= 2 pathogens. With the exception of Staphylococcus aureus, which was common in early-onset VAP, the pathogens (including potentially multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens) isolated from early-onset versus late-onset VAP were not significantly different between groups. Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa with decreased susceptibility to any study drug was observed in early-onset and late-onset VAP subjects. CONCLUSIONS: There were no significant differences in the prevalence of potential MDR pathogens associated with early-onset or late-onset VAP, even in subjects with prior antibiotics. Empiric therapy for early-onset VAP should also include agents likely to be effective for potential MDR pathogens. Further prospective studies should evaluate microbiology trends in subjects with VAP.
TI  - [Clinical analysis of 105 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia after heart surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the related factors and pathogens of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after heart surgery. METHODS: VAP was diagnosed in 105 patients out of 1688 cases (6.2%) who underwent heart surgery in our department between January 2004 and January 2011. Clinical data, pathogens and treatments were analyzed. RESULTS: Incidence of VAP was 6.2% (105/1688), and 53.0% (105/198) in patients who required more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. One hundred and ninety-eight pathogen strains were isolated by bacterial culture, in which Gram negative bacteria accounted for 69.2% (137/198), Gram positive bacteria 27.8% (55/198), and fungi for 3.0% (6/198). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus were the main pathogens of VAP. The independent risk factors for VAP were: age > 70 years, emergent surgery, perioperative transfusions, reintubation and days of mechanical ventilation (all P < 0.01). Median length of stay in the ICU for patients who developed VAP or not was (24.7 +/- 4.5) days versus (3.2 +/- 1.5) days, respectively (P < 0.05) and in-hospital mortality was 25.7% (27/105) versus 2.9% (46/1583) respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing heart surgery have a high frequency of developing VAP, especially in patients that require more than 48 hours of mechanical ventilation. VAP is associated with high in-hospital mortality. Age > 70 years, emergent surgery, perioperative transfusions, reintubation and prolonged mechanical ventilation use are independent risk factors for VAP in patients following cardiac surgery. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus are the main pathogens of VAP.
TI  - [Adult hospital acquired pneumonia: a multicenter study on microbiology and clinical characteristics of patients from 9 Chinese cities].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the etiology and clinical characteristics of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in China and to provide evidence for appropriate therapy. METHODS: We performed a prospective multicenter study in 13 Chinese urban tertiary hospitals. All HAP cases diagnosed at respiratory general ward and respiratory intensive care unit (RICU) from August 2008 to December 2010 were studied. Epidemiological data, etiology and clinical characteristics of enrolled patients were collected. Sputum or tracheal aspirate and blood cultures, Legionella antibodies and Streptococcus pneumoniae urinary antigen tests were performed. Bacteria to antimicrobial susceptibility test was performed. RESULTS: A total of 610 cases of HAP were diagnosed during the study, with an overall incidence of 1.4% among 42 877 hospitalized patients, while the incidence was 0.9% (362/41 261) in respiratory general ward and 15.4% (248/1616) in RICU. 93.9% (573 cases) of patients had at least one underlying disease, and 91.0% (555 cases) had exposure to at least one antimicrobial agent within 90 days prior to HAP diagnosis. Pathogens were identified in 487 patients, with Acinetobacter baumannii [30.0% (183/610)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [22.0% (134/610)], Staphylococcus aureus [13.4% (82/610)] and Klebsiella pneumonia [9.7% (59/610)] being the most common pathogens. Eighteen patients (3.0%) had infection with fastidious bacteria. A. baumannii and S. aureus were the more frequent pathogens in the ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) cases [50.5% (97/192) and 21.4% (41/192)] as compared to non-VAP cases [20.6% (86/418) and 9.8% (41/418), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii and S. aureus were also frequent pathogens in cases with a score of more than 20 by the acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHEII) scoring [45.7% (69/151) and 20.5% (31/151)], as compared to cases with a score of less than 20 of APACHE II [24.8% (114/459) and 11.1% (51/459), P < 0.01]. A. baumannii showed high resistance rates to carbapenems [more than 70% (109/142)], and the susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam, polymyxin B and tigecycline were 40.8% (58/142), 99.3% (141/142) and 95.8% (136/142) respectively. Resistance rates of P. aeruginosa to meropenem and imipenem were 48.8% (40/82) and 70.7% (58/82) respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) accounted for 87.8% (43/49) in all strains of S. aureus. Mortality rate of VAP cases was 34.5% (61/177), significantly more than that of HAP patients [22.3% (135/605), P < 0.05]. The average hospital stay of patients with HAP was (23.8 +/- 20.5) days, significantly more than that of the average for inpatients [(13.2 +/- 13.6) days, P < 0.01] during the study period. Mean costs of HAP were (108 950 +/- 116 608) yuan, significantly higher than the average hospital costs of respiratory inpatients (17 999 +/- 33 364) yuan. CONCLUSIONS: Among Chinese patients hospitalized in urban tertiary medical centers, HAP incidence and mortality rate were high, which increased the patients' hospital stay and the medical costs. Common pathogens were A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and K. pneumonia. The common bacteria of HAP in China showed high resistance rates to antibiotics.
TI  - Three-year review of bacteriological profile and antibiogram of burn wound isolates in Van, Turkey.
AB  - The risk of infection in burns is well-known. In recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. For this reason, a retrospective study was conducted at Van Training and Research Hospital to analyze the bacterial isolates from the wounds of patients admitted to the Burn Unit and to determine the susceptibility patterns of the commonly cultured organisms over a 3-year period, January 2009 to December 2011.A total of 250 microorganisms were isolated from burn wounds of 179 patients. Our results revealed that the most frequent isolate was Acinetobacter baumannii (23.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.2%), Escherichia coli (10%) respectively. Multidrug-resistance has emerged as an important concern in our burn unit. Tigecycline, and colistin were found to be the most active drugs against Acinetobacter baumannii. Carbapenems and amikacin, were found to be the most active drugs against other gram negative bacteria. Vancomycin and linezolid were active against gram positive bacteria.Aggressive infection control measures should be applied to limit the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Cloning and characterization of an antibacterial L-amino acid oxidase from Crotalus durissus cumanensis venom.
AB  - An L-amino acid oxidase (LAAO) from Crotalus durissus cumanensis venom (CdcLAAO)  was purified to homogeneity using a combination of size-exclusion and ion exchange chromatographies. CdcLAAO is a monomeric protein exhibiting an apparent molecular mass of 55 kDa and a calculated pI of 8. Its complete 498-amino-acid sequence was deduced through cDNA and protein sequencing. The enzyme oxidized L-Leu with K(m) and a V(Max) of 9.23 muM and 0.46 muM/min respectively, and exhibited Kcat and a Kcat/K(m) of 1.8 s(-1) and 195 mM(-1)s(-1). CdcLAAO inhibited in a dose-dependent manner the growth of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. The inhibitory effect was more significant on S. aureus, with a Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of 8 mug/mL and Minimal Bactericidal Concentration (MBC) of 16 mug/mL, than against A. baumannii, with a MIC of 16 mug/mL and MBC of 32 mug/mL. However, against Escherichia coli CdcLAAO did not show inhibitory capacity at the concentrations tested (2-128 mug/mL). CdcLAAO did not exhibit cytotoxic activity on the mouse myoblast cell line C(2)C(12) and on peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC).
TI  - Additional risk factors for infection by multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare-associated infection: a large cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of consensus regarding the definition of risk factors for healthcare-associated infection (HCAI). The purpose of this study was to identify additional risk factors for HCAI, which are not included in the current definition of HCAI, associated with infection by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, in all hospitalized infected patients from the community. METHODS: This 1-year prospective cohort study included all patients with infection admitted to a large, tertiary care, university hospital. Risk factors not included in the HCAI definition, and independently associated with MDR pathogen infection, namely MDR Gram-negative (MDR-GN) and ESKAPE microorganisms (vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species, carbapenem-hydrolyzing Klebsiella pneumonia and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species), were identified by logistic regression among patients admitted from the community (either with community-acquired or HCAI). RESULTS: There were 1035 patients with infection, 718 from the community. Of these, 439 (61%) had microbiologic documentation; 123 were MDR (28%). Among MDR: 104 (85%) had MDR-GN and 41 (33%) had an ESKAPE infection. Independent risk factors associated with MDR and MDR-GN infection were: age (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.7 and 1.5, p = 0.001 and p = 0.009, respectively), and hospitalization in the previous year (between 4 and 12 months previously) (adjusted OR = 2.0 and 1,7, p = 0.008 and p = 0.048, respectively). Infection by pathogens from the ESKAPE group was independently associated with previous antibiotic therapy (adjusted OR = 7.2, p < 0.001) and a Karnofsky index <70 (adjusted OR = 3.7, p = 0.003). Patients with infection by MDR, MDR-GN and pathogens from the ESKAPE group had significantly higher rates of inadequate antibiotic therapy than those without (46% vs 7%, 44% vs 10%, 61% vs 15%, respectively, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that the inclusion of additional risk factors in the current definition of HCAI for MDR pathogen infection, namely age >60 years, Karnofsky index <70, hospitalization in the previous year, and previous antibiotic therapy, may be clinically beneficial for early diagnosis, which may decrease the rate of inadequate antibiotic therapy among these patients.
TI  - Comparing the transmission potential of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii among inpatients using target environmental monitoring.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing isolation rate of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB) in China hospitals, more researches focused on its antimicrobial resistance, but few studies reported its nosocomial transmission. In this study, we aim to investigate the transmission features of MDR-AB among inpatients using target environmental monitoring. METHODS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and MDR-AB active screening and target environmental screening were performed from March 2010 to October 2011 in respiratory intensive care unit (RICU). We compared bed linen contamination rate and acquisition rate of MDR-AB with those of MRSA and analyzed the correlation between weekly colonization pressure adjusted by degree of bed linen contamination (WCPe) and weekly acquisition rate (WAR) of MDR-AB. RESULTS: We found that both the bed linen contamination rate and the acquisition rate of MDR-AB were higher than those of MRSA (chi(2) = 98.081, P < .01; chi(2) = 49.844, P < .01, respectively). The correlation analysis showed positive correlation between MDR-AB WCPe and WAR (rs = 0.560, P < .01). The WCPe and WAR of MDR-AB were higher than those of MRSA (Z = -5.439, P < .01; Z = -3.258, P < .01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared with MRSA, MDR-AB carriers showed stronger ability to contaminate their immediate environment, and MDR-AB was easier to transmit among inpatients. Therefore, it was likely more important to perform active environmental monitoring as a method of transmission evaluation and a measure of routine infection control to prevent and control MDR-AB nosocomial transmission more effectively.
TI  - Effect of low-dose gaseous ozone on pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of chronically infected wounds is a challenge, and bacterial environmental contamination is a growing issue in infection control. Ozone may have a role in these situations. The objective of this study was to determine whether a low dose of gaseous ozone/oxygen mixture eliminates pathogenic bacteria cultivated in Petri dishes. METHODS: A pilot study with 6 bacterial strains was made using different concentrations of ozone in an ozone-oxygen mixture to determine a minimally effective dose that completely eliminated bacterial growth. The small and apparently bactericidal gaseous dose of 20 mug/mL ozone/oxygen (1:99) mixture, applied for 5 min under atmospheric pressure was selected. In the 2nd phase, eight bacterial strains with well characterized resistance patterns were evaluated in vitro using agar-blood in adapted Petri dishes (105 bacteria/dish). The cultures were divided into 3 groups: 1--ozone-oxygen gaseous mixture containing 20 mug of O(3)/mL for 5 min; 2--100% oxygen for 5 min; 3--baseline: no gas was used. RESULTS: The selected ozone dose was applied to the following eight strains: Escherichia coli, oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter baumannii susceptible only to carbapenems, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. All isolates were completely inhibited by the ozone-oxygen mixture while growth occurred in the other 2 groups. CONCLUSION: A single topical application by nebulization of a low ozone dose completely inhibited the growth of all potentially pathogenic bacterial strains with known resistance to antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Photoinactivation of Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria with the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) conjugated to the hydrophilic photosensitizer eosin Y.
AB  - We test the hypothesis that the antimicrobial peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) enhances the photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer eosin Y upon conjugation. The conjugate eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) was obtained by solid-phase peptide synthesis. Photoinactivation assays were performed against the Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , and multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii AYE, as well as the Gram-positive bacteria Staphylococcus aureus , and Staphylococcus epidermidis . Partitioning assays were performed with E. coli and S. aureus . Photohemolysis and photokilling assays were also performed to assess the photodynamic activity of the conjugate toward mammalian cells. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) photoinactivates 99.999% of 10(8) CFU/mL of most bacteria tested at a concentration of 1 muM or below. In contrast, neither eosin Y nor (KLAKLAK)(2) cause any significant photoinactivation under similar conditions. The increase in photodynamic activity of the photosensitizer conferred by the antimicrobial peptide is in part due to the fact that (KLAKLAK)(2) promotes the association of eosin Y to bacteria. Eosin-(KLAKLAK)(2) does not significantly associate with red blood cells or the cultured mammalian cell lines HaCaT, COS-7, and COLO 316. Consequently, little photodamage or photokilling is observed with these cells under conditions for which bacterial photoinactivation is achieved. The peptide (KLAKLAK)(2) therefore significantly enhances the photodynamic activity of eosin Y toward both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria while interacting minimally with human cells. Overall, our results suggest that antimicrobial peptides such as (KLAKLAK)(2) might serve as attractive agents that can target photosensitizers to bacteria specifically.
TI  - Bloodstream infections in immunocompromised hosts.
AB  - Immunocompromised hosts are at high risk for bloodstream infections (BSIs); the outcome is unpredictable (even with adequate therapy), frequently severe (mortality 27%). A 26 months survey in a haematology/oncology hospital was set-up; it comprised 158 patients and detected 171 positive blood cultures. The origin of the infections was primitive in 27.22% and secondary in 72.78% of the cases; the most frequent cause was the presence of a vascular catheter (23.41%). The second most important cause were the respiratory infections (19.62%), followed by the urinary tract infections (UTIs) (11.39%). Gram negative bacilli represented 59.4%, the enterobacteriaceae were predominant (35.59%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10.73%) and species like Serratia marcescens and Acinetobacter baumannii. Although isolated at low level, they worry by an increasing frequency. Among Gram positive cocci (43.51%) coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) were the most frequent (25.42%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.08%); Enterococcus faecalis (5.65%) was isolated from polymicrobial (associated) infections. The strains of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were constantly susceptible to carbapenems, demonstrating otherwise various susceptibility patterns, generally elevated to the antibiotics we tested. The production of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL) was 22.58%. The methicillin resistance was 54.4% in S. aureus strains; the susceptibility was variable among 7 other antibiotics tested. One Staphylococcus strain had reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. A multidisciplinary survey is necessary for the control of the multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO).
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acid exhibit potent bactericidal activity against ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - A series of 36 synthetic antimicrobial peptides containing unnatural amino acids  were screened to determine their effectiveness to treat Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pnemoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens, which are known to commonly infect chronic wounds. The primary amino acid sequences of these peptides incorporate either three or six dipeptide units consisting of the unnatural amino acids Tetrahydroisoquinolinecarboxylic acid (Tic) and Octahydroindolecarboxylic acid (Oic). The Tic-Oic dipeptide units are separated by SPACER amino acids with specific physicochemical properties that control how these peptides interact with bacterial cell membranes of different chemical compositions. These peptides exhibited minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) against these pathogens in the range from >100 to 6.25 mug/mL. The observed diversity of MIC values for these peptides against the various bacterial strains are consistent with our hypothesis that the complementarity of the physicochemical properties of the peptide and the lipid of the bacteria's cell membrane determines the resulting antibacterial activity of the peptide.
TI  - Comparative efficacy evaluation of disinfectants routinely used in hospital practice: India.
AB  - AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare practically achieved disinfection efficacy of some locally available disinfectants on surfaces and infectious microbiological hospital waste. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven disinfectants were tested at concentrations recommended by manufacturers on rough and smooth surfaces that were contaminated experimentally by locally circulating isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter aerogenes, Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, standard isolate of Salmonella typhi and Candida albicans. Reduction in microbial counts before and after surface disinfection was expressed as log reduction. A very heavy microbial waste load was simulated by immersing culture plates with heavy microbial growth in disinfectants. Daily, a sample of disinfectant was taken and subjected to in-use test. RESULTS: The highest average log reduction of test microbes on the rough surface was given by DesNet (5.05) and Bacillocid special (5.02). A comparable average log reduction of test microbes on a smooth steel surface was noted (5.68, 5.67, 5.50) for Lysol, Bacillocid sp. and DesNet, respectively. In the discard jars, Bacillocid special worked satisfactorily for 4 days, DesNet for 3 days and Hi-giene Germitol for 1 day. The remainder of the disinfectants failed in the in-use test on Day 1. Phenolics, although widely used in our settings, may not be as good surface disinfectants as newer formulations like DesNet and Bacillocid special. CONCLUSIONS: Newer quaternary ammonium compounds and aldehyde formulations were found to be the best disinfectants for disinfection of heavy contamination.
TI  - [In vitro susceptibilities to levofloxacin and various antibacterial agents of 12,866 clinical isolates obtained from 72 centers in 2010].
AB  - Postmarketing surveillance of levofloxacin (LVFX) has been conducted continuously since 1992. The present survey was performed to investigate in vitro susceptibility of recent clinical isolates in Japan to 30 selected antibacterial agents, focusing on fluoroquinolones (FQs). The common respiratory pathogens Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae continue to show a high susceptibility to FQs. In contrast, widely-prevailing resistance to macrolides was markedly noted among S pneumoniae and S. pyogenes. Regarding H. influenzae, the prevalence of beta-lactamase-negative ampicillin-resistant isolates has been increasing year by year (25.8% in 2002, 40.0% in 2004, 50.1% in 2007, and 57.9% in 2010). Enterobacteriaceae showed high susceptibility to FQs, however, prevalence of LVFX-resistant Escherichia coli, including intermediate resistance, was 29.3%, showing an increase over time. Nevertheless, the increase in the prevalence of LVFX-resistant E. coli isolates has slowed since 2007 (8.2% in 2000, 11.8% in 2002, 18.8% in 2004, 26.2% in 2007, and 29.3% in 2010), suggesting the influence of LVFX 500 mg tablets since its approval in 2009. Another Enterobacteriaceae member, Klebsiella pneumoniae, showed low resistance to FQs, in contrast with E. coli. In methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), the percentage of FQ-susceptible isolates was low, at 51.6% for susceptibility to sitafloxacin, and at only around 10% for susceptibility to other FQs. However, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) isolates were highly susceptible to FQs, with the percentage ranging from 88.5% to 99.1%. The prevalence of FQs-resistant isolates in methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci was higher than that in methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci, although it was lower than the prevalence of FQ-resistance in MRSA. The prevalence of FQs-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates derived from urinary tract infections (UTIs) was 15.4-21.3%, higher than the prevalence of 6.1-12.3% in P. aeruginosa isolates from respiratory tract infections (RTIs). While this trend was consistent with the results of previous surveillance, gradual decreases were noted in the prevalence of FQ-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates derived from UTIs. The prevalence of multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa was 2.3% among isolates derived from UTIs and 0.3% among isolates from RTIs, a decrease from the results of 2007. Acinetobacter spp. showed high susceptibility to FQs. Imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, which is currently an emerging issue, was detected at a prevalence of 2.4% (13 isolates). Neisseria gonorrhoeae showed a high resistance of 81.3-82.5%, to FQs. Ceftriaxone (CTRX) continued to show 100% susceptibility until 2007, but the present survey revealed the advent of resistance to CTRX in some clinical isolates. The result of the present survey indicated that although methicillin-resistant staphylococci, Enterococcus faecium, P. aeruginosa from UTIs, N. gonorrhoeae, and E. coli showed resistance of about 20% or more (19.5-89.2%) against the FQs which have been used clinically for over 17 years, the trends observed were similar to the results of previous surveillance. While FQ resistance has been prevailing in E. coli, E. coli still shows more than 70% susceptibility to FQs. The other bacterial species maintained high susceptibility rates of greater than 80%, against FQs.
TI  - Esculentin-2CHa: a host-defense peptide with differential cytotoxicity against bacteria, erythrocytes and tumor cells.
AB  - The host-defense peptide, esculentin-2CHa (GFSSIFRGVA(10)KFASKGLGK D(20)LAKLGVDLVA(30) CKISKQC) shows potent (MIC</=6 muM) growth inhibitory activity against clinical isolates of multidrug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and differential cytotoxic activity against human erythrocytes (LC(50)=150 muM) and human non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells (LC(50)=10 muM). Esculentin-2CHa significantly (P<0.01) stimulates the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 by mouse lymphoid cells and elevates its production after stimulation with concanavalin A and significantly (P<0.05) stimulates TNF-alpha production by peritoneal macrophages. Effects on IL-6 and IL-1beta production were not significant. Removal of the hydrophobic N-terminal hexapeptide (GFSSIF) from esculentin-2CHa results in abolition of growth inhibitory activity against S. aureus and cytotoxic activity against erythrocytes and A549 cells as well as a marked (>/=16-fold) reduction in potency against A. baumannii and S. maltophilia. The primary structure of esculentin-2 has been poorly conserved between frog species but evolutionary pressure has acted to maintain the hydrophobic character of this N-terminal hexapeptide sequence. Removal of the cyclic C-terminal domain (CKISKQC) and replacement of the Cys(31) and Cys(37) residues by serine resulted in appreciable decreases in cytotoxicity against all microorganisms and against mammalian cells. The more cationic [D20K, D27K] analog showed a modest increase in potency against all microorganisms (up to 4-fold) but a marked increase in cytotoxicity against erythrocytes (LC(50)=11 muM) and A549 cells (LC(50)=3 muM).
TI  - Biocidal activity of metalloacid-coated surfaces against multidrug-resistant microorganisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The antimicrobial effects of a coating of molybdenum trioxide (MoO3)  has been recently described. The metalloacid material produces oxonium ions (H3O+), which creates an acidic pH that is an effective, non specific antimicrobial. We determined the in vitro antimicrobial activity of molybdenum trioxide metalloacid-coated surfaces. METHODS: Metalloacid-coated and non-coated (control) surfaces were contaminated by exposing them for 15 minutes to microbial suspensions containing 105 cfu/mL. Eleven microorganisms responsible for nosocomial infections were tested: two Staphylococcus aureus strains (the hetero-vancomycin intermediate MRSA Mu50 strain and a ST80-PVL-producing MRSA strain); a vancomycin-resistant vanA Enterococcus faecium strain; three extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae strains; a MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain; a multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strain; a toxin-producing Clostridium difficile strain; and two fungi (Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus). The assay tested the ability of the coated surfaces to kill microorganisms. RESULTS: Against all non-sporulating microorganisms tested, metalloacid-coated surfaces exhibited significant antimicrobial activity relative to that of the control surfaces within two to six hours after contact with the microorganisms (p < 0.001). Microorganism survival on the coated surfaces was greatly impaired, whereas microorganism survival on control surfaces remained substantial. CONCLUSIONS: We suggest that, facing the continuing shedding of microorganisms in the vicinity of colonized or infected patients, the continuous biocidal effect of hydroxonium oxides against multidrug-resistant microorganisms may help limit environmental contamination between consecutive cleaning procedures.
TI  - Burn unit: colonization of burn wounds and local environment.
AB  - BACKGROUND: We present the results of a comparative prospective study of the resistance profile of strains isolated from pathological material of patients hospitalized in the burn unit of the military hospital in Rabat and from their environment over a period of one and a half years (July 2009-February 2011). METHODS: The study concerned 125 pathological products from patients (40 men, 20 women; mean age 38+/-14.8 years; range 2 to 80 years) hospitalized with burns. This allowed the isolation of 86 non-redundant bacterial strains during the first period and 50 during the second. RESULTS: The dominant species were Acinetobacter baumannii (15.6%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.8%) and Staphylococcus aureus (11%). During the second period, we noted the abundance of A. baumannii (15.5%), followed by P. aeruginosa (11.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8.5%). Of the 104 environmental samples of burn patients, 139 microorganisms were isolated. Coagulase-negative staphylococcus was the most abundant strain in the two study periods (69.2% and 64.6%). CONCLUSION: All species showed an almost identical sensitivity to the various antibiotics tested.
TI  - Verification of monoplex and multiplex linear-after-the-exponential PCR gene-specific sepsis assays using clinical isolates.
AB  - AIMS: To verify monoplex and multiplex gene-specific linear-after-the-exponential polymerase chain reaction (LATE-PCR) assays for identifying 17 microbial pathogens (i.e., Klebsiella sp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter sp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, coagulase negative staphylococci, Enterococcus sp., Candida sp.) commonly associated with septicaemia using clinical isolates. METHODS AND RESULTS: Clinical isolates of each target pathogen were collected from the University of California, Davis Medical Center (UCDMC) microbiology laboratory. Five microlitres (mul) of each culture suspension (1 x 10(8) CFU ml(-1) ) were added to 20 mul of monoplex mastermix. DNA extracted from clinical isolates was tested in multiplex. Monoplex assays demonstrated 100% sensitivity at this input level, except Enterobacter cloacae (2.7%), Ac. baumannii (57%) and Ps. aeruginosa (97.8%). All clinical isolates were positive in multiplex, with the exception of two Ac. baumannii, two Klebsiella oxytoca and two Candida parapsilosis isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Sixteen pathogens can be identified by monoplex LATE-PCR assays with sensitivities >/= 97.8%. The multiplex assay demonstrated 91.4% sensitivity when tested with DNA extracted from 70 different target strains. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study demonstrates the potential of LATE-PCR to serve as an adjunct to culture if the reagents are optimized for sensitivity. Results warrant further testing through analytical and clinical validation of the multiplex assay.
TI  - Design of a single-tube, endpoint, linear-after-the-exponential-PCR assay for 17  pathogens associated with sepsis.
AB  - AIMS: The goal of this study was to construct a single-tube multiplex molecular diagnostic assay using linear-after-the-exponential (LATE)-PCR for the detection of 17 microbial pathogens commonly associated with septicaemia. METHODS AND RESULTS: The assay described here detects 17 pathogens associated with sepsis via amplification and analysis of gene-specific sequences. The pathogens and their targeted genes were: Klebsiella spp. (phoE); Acinetobacter baumannii (gyrB); Staphylococcus aureus (spa); Enterobacter spp. (thdF); Pseudomonas aeruginosa (toxA); coagulase-negative staphylococci (tuf), Enterococcus spp. (tuf); Candida spp. (P450). A sequence from an unidentified gene in Lactococcus lactis, served as a positive control for assay function. LATE-PCR was used to generate single-stranded amplicons that were analysed at endpoint over a wide range of temperatures in four fluorescent colours. Each target was detected by its pattern of hybridization to a sequence-specific low-temperature fluorescent probe derived from molecular beacons. CONCLUSIONS: All 17 microbial targets were detected in samples containing low numbers of pathogen genomes in the presence of high levels of human genomic DNA. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This assay used new technology to achieve an advance in the field of molecular diagnostics: a single-tube assay for detection of pathogens commonly responsible for septicaemia.
TI  - Management and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens  is a leading healthcare-associated infection in mechanically ventilated patients. The incidence of VAP due to MDR pathogens has increased significantly in the last decade. Risk factors for VAP due to MDR organisms include advanced age, immunosuppression, broad-spectrum antibiotic exposure, increased severity of illness, previous hospitalization or residence in a chronic care facility and prolonged duration of invasive mechanical ventilation. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and several different species of Gram-negative bacteria can cause MDR VAP. Especially difficult Gram-negative bacteria include Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteraciae and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing bacteria. Proper management includes selecting appropriate antibiotics, optimizing dosing and using timely de-escalation based on antiimicrobial sensitivity data. Evidence-based strategies to prevent VAP that incorporate multidisciplinary staff education and collaboration are essential to reduce the burden of this disease and associated healthcare costs.

TI  - [Analysis on the clinical pulmonary infection score on the detection of multidrug resistance organisms in lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients in intensive care unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characteristics of multidrug resistance (MDR) organisms from the lower respiratory tract in ventilated patients, and the constitution, detection time and mortality of the intensive care unit (ICU) patients with different clinical pulmonary infection scores (CPIS). METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted. The clinical data of 72 cases with lower respiratory tract MDR on ventilation more than 48 hours were collected from April 2010 to December 2011. CPIS were calculated at the same time. Thirty-three patients with CPIS>6 were diagnosed as ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP), while 39 having CPIS </=6 (non-VAP). The characteristics of MDR, the detection time and mortality of the patients were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The first five MDR were Baumannii [49.5%(34/74)], Klebsiella pneumoniae [24.3%(18/74)], Escherichia coli [20.3%(15/74)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [5.4%(4/74)] and Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA, 4.1%(3/74)] in VAP group, while the first five were Escherichia coli [40.2%(37/92)], Pseudomonas aeruginosa [33.7%(31/92)], Klebsiella pneumoniae [13.1%(12/92)], Baumannii [8.7%(8/92)] and MRSA [4.3%(4/92)] in non-VAP group. There was no significant difference in average detection time between VAP group and non-VAP group (10.7+/-1.5 days vs. 9.4+/-1.8 days, P>0.05). The mortality rate in VAP group was significantly higher than that in non-VAP group (39.4% vs. 23.1%, P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Different MDR may be detected in lower respiratory tracts no matter the ventilated patients having VAP or not, which influence the patients prognosis and should be monitored intensively. Antibiotics should be empirically prescribed and adjusted dynamically.
TI  - Design and synthesis of 2-aminothiazole based antimicrobials targeting MRSA.
AB  - Privileged structure-based libraries have been shown to provide high affinity lead compounds for a variety of important biological targets. The present study describes the synthesis and screening of a 2-aminothiazole based compound library to determine their utility as antimicrobials, focusing on MRSA. Several of the compounds in this series demonstrated improved antimicrobial activity as compared to ceftriaxone (CTX), a beta-lactam antibiotic. The most potent compound (21) had MICs in the range of 2-4 mug/ml across a panel of Staphylococcus aureus strains. In addition, trifluoromethoxy substituted aminothiazoles and aminobenzothiazoles were found to be potent antimicrobials with MICs of 2-16 mug/ml.
TI  - Toxicity, antimicrobial and anthelmintic activities of Vernonia guineensis Benth. (Asteraceae) crude extracts.
AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: This study examined the antibacterial, antifungal, and anthelmintic properties of extracts obtained from the plant Vernonia guineensis, a plant commonly used in traditional Cameroonian medicine. MATERIALS AND METHODS: For in vitro studies, 10 g of leaf and tuber powder from V. guineensis was extracted separately using dichloromethane, methanol and distilled water. The extracts were dried in vacuo and used for antimicrobial and anthelmintic activity studies. In the antimicrobial assay, extracts were tested against bacterial and fungal organisms including; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Acinetobacter baumannii, Aspergillus fumigatus, Candida albicans and Trichophyton mentagrophytes. In the anthelmintic assay, larval and adult stages of the hookworm Ancylostoma ceylanicum and the mouse nematode Trichuris muris were used. For the acute toxicity test, male and female rats of 150-200 g body weight were used in the experiment. The aqueous extract of V. guineensis tubers was administered in 4 doses of 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 mg/kg per group (n=6), respectively, and the control group received distilled water. RESULTS: The crude extracts exhibited weak antibacterial and antifungal activity except for the dichloromethane extract, which showed moderate activity against A. fumigatus (MIC=200 mug/ml). In the anthelmintic assay, the organic extracts of the tubers had 100% killing efficacy against T. muris at 2mg/ml in 48 h, while the aqueous extract showed no activity. The organic leaf extracts demonstrated potent activity killing 100% of the adult worms 1mg/ml in 24h. The aqueous leaf extract was active at 2mg/ml in 72 h, killing 100% of the adult worms. In the acute toxicity test, V. guineensis did not produce any toxic signs or death at the maximum concentration of 4000 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: Crude extracts from V. guineensis possess anthelmintic activity against T. muris with only weak antibiotic activity. Acute administration of aqueous extract from V. guineensis tubers did not produce toxic effects in rats. The absence of acute toxicity at the highest concentration tested indicates that the tea decoction from V. guineensis extract is safe at concentrations </= 4000 mg/kg.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant bacteria in travellers hospitalized abroad: prevalence, characteristics, and influence on clinical outcome.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Worldwide, the burden of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MDR) is increasing, especially in the hospital setting. AIM: To explore characteristics and clinical relevance of MDR obtained from travellers transferred from hospitals abroad. METHODS: This retrospective study included patients transferred from hospitals abroad to the University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland, who routinely underwent admission screening for possible colonization with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria (ESBL) and multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MR Gram negative). FINDINGS: Forty-six (17%) of 259 subjects were found to be colonized with MDR and nine (3.5%) patients to be infected. Thirty-three (12%) patients were colonized with one bacterial species, 12 (4.6%) with two, and three (1.2%) were colonized with three different bacterial species. In total, 36 ESBL, 21 MR Gram-negative and three MRSA isolates were detected. Escherichia coli (N = 18, 30%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 14, 23%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (N = 14, 23%) were most frequently isolated. The most common sites of detection were skin (97%) and respiratory tract (41%). Being colonized contributed to an increased length of ICU stay [median (range): 8 (1-35) vs 3.5 (1-78) days; P = 0.011]. In-hospital mortality in patients colonized with MDR (10.9%) was higher than in uncolonized patients (2.3%, P = 0.018). Being colonized with MDR was associated with death (adjusted odds ratio: 5.176; 95% confidence interval: 1.325-20.218). CONCLUSIONS: A substantial proportion of patients transferred from abroad are colonized with MDR, a fact which is associated with poor clinical outcome.
TI  - Practices to prevent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in Thailand: a national survey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) are increasing challenges for health care institutions worldwide, and there are many factors associated with their distribution. OBJECTIVES: We conducted a national survey of Thai hospitals with 1 or more intensive care units and >/=250 hospital beds to evaluate hospital characteristics and current practices to minimize the endemic burden of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). METHODS: Research nurses collected survey data from participating hospitals between January 1 and April 30, 2011. Data collection focused on hospital characteristics and practices to prevent endemic MDR-AB and MRSA; logistic regression analyses were used to assess associations between hospital characteristics and infection prevention control (IPC) interventions. RESULTS: There was an 80% survey response (N = 204) from 256 eligible hospitals. Endemic MDR-AB and MRSA were reported in 184 (90%) and 100 (40%) hospitals, respectively. The most frequently reported IPC interventions were contact isolation, hand hygiene campaigns, and antimicrobial stewardship; active surveillance, chlorhexidine gluconate bathing, and multifaceted interventions were uncommon. By multivariate analysis, having a physician as the lead infection control professional and participation in a collaborative effort to prevent MDR organisms were associated with multifaceted interventions to reduce MDR-AB, and medical school affiliation and participating in a collaborative effort to prevent MDR organisms were associated with multifaceted interventions to reduce MRSA. CONCLUSION: Multifaceted interventions to reduce, if not prevent, MDR-AB and MRSA were infrequently reported from Thai hospitals. Our survey findings provide baseline data for IPC interventions for MDR-AB and MRSA. Future efforts that correlate IPC interventions and MDRO trends will help develop evidence-based practices in these resource-limited settings.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in internal medicine wards.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a global medical problem, affecting most bacterial pathogens. The major challenges are currently posed by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum-beta-lactamases (ESBL) and carbapenemases, and multi-resistant strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Therapeutic options are very limited and, in some cases, virtually unavailable. This article provides an overview of the recent epidemiological trends exhibited by the most important multi-resistant pathogens, and of the treatment options that are currently available for these infections.
TI  - Human serum albumin stabilized gold nanoclusters as selective luminescent probes  for Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
AB  - In this work, human serum albumin (HSA) stabilized gold nanoclusters (HSA-AuNCs)  with reddish photoluminescence were used as sensing probes for pathogenic bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli J96, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (PDRAB), Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (VRE). We discovered that HSA-AuNCs have unique affinity with S. aureus and MRSA. In addition to demonstrating the selective sensing ability of HSA-AuNCs toward S. aureus and MRSA, the binding peptide motifs identified from HSA-AuNCs were characterized by mass spectrometry. The identified binding peptides were further used as the reducing and stabilizing agents for generation of peptide-bound AuNCs (Pep-AuNCs). The generated Pep-AuNCs were demonstrated to have the binding affinities with S. aureus and MRSA.
TI  - [Etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia at the Cardiovascular Surgery Clinic of Iasi].
AB  - AIM: We want to assess the etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and  emergence of resistant phenotypes for greater efficiency of the first-line antimicrobial treatment post-cardiac surgery. The study focuses on patients with VAP post-cardiac surgery at the Institute of Cardiovascular Surgery between April 2nd 2002 and August 27th 2008, divided in two groups, before and after June 14th, 2005. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The tracheal aspirates were examined quantitatively (microscopy, culture). The isolates with clinical significance (> or = 106 CFU/mL) were identified by standard methods and tested by disk difussion or with the breakpoints method for susceptibility to antibiotics. RESULTS: Among the 1527 operated patients, 28 of them were diagnosed with VAP through the clinical pulmonary infection score > or = 6. The 9 most common pathogens in VAP etiology were Pseudomonas aeruginosa 23.81%, Acinetobacter baumannii 19.05%, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 11.91%, Candida albicans 9.53%, while Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Corynebacterium striatum/amycolatum, Pneumocystis jirovecii amounted 4.76% each. Acinetobacter baumannii and S.maltophilia appear starting with June 15th, 2005. From that moment on we isolated with a higher frequency the gram-negative bacilli which produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases 15.62%, with multidrug resistance (MDR) 46.86%. The MDR phenotype was more frequent at A.baumannii (15.62%), S. maltophilia (15.62%) and P. aeruginosa (12.50%) compared to K .pneumoniae (3.12%) or E. coli (0%). Methicillin-resistant S. aureus was isolated with a 6.25% frequency. CONCLUSIONS: The most common etiologic agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia post-cardiac surgery are Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Candida albicans. The large use of antibiotics selects infectious agents with intrinsic resistance and multiresistant
TI  - Efficacy of improved hydrogen peroxide against important healthcare-associated pathogens.
AB  - This study was designed to test in vitro efficacy of 2 improved hydrogen peroxide (HP) products against 3 standard HP products and 1 quaternary ammonium compound. Improved HP is significantly superior to standard HP at the same concentration and can be used for disinfection of environmental surfaces or noncritical patient care items.
TI  - The effect of a wound care solution containing polyhexanide and betaine on bacterial counts: results of an in vitro study .
AB  - Polyhexanide and betaine topical solution is used in the management of infected wounds as a cleaning agent. An in vitro study was conducted to examine the antimicrobial effects of a solution containing 0.1% of the antimicrobial agent polyhexanide and 0.1% of the surfactant betaine. Three batches of each product were tested, and culture results of 13 microorganisms were evaluated after 7, 14, and 28 days using USP <51> methodology. Growth reduction was identical at each day following exposure to the solution in all micro-organisms except Aspergillus brasiliensis. A range of 5.3-log to 5.8-log reduction was seen for the following micro-organisms: Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Serratia marcescens, Candida albicans, S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, methicillin-resistant S. aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, and E. faecalis. For A. brasiliensis, reductions were 2.1-log, 2.3-log and 2.8-log at 7, 14, and 28 days, respectively. The results of this study indicate a 4+ log inhibition of activity in 12 of 13 micro-organisms exposed to the solution. Research to elucidate the potential clinical effects of these observations is needed.
TI  - Adenylate kinase release as a high-throughput-screening-compatible reporter of bacterial lysis for identification of antibacterial agents.
AB  - Adenylate kinase (AK) is a ubiquitous intracellular enzyme that is released into  the extracellular space upon cell lysis. We have shown that AK release serves as a useful reporter of bactericidal agent activity and can be exploited for antimicrobial screening purposes. The AK assay exhibits improved sensitivity over that of growth-based assays and can detect agents that are active against bacteria in clinically relevant growth states that are difficult to screen using conventional approaches, such as small colony variants (SCV) and bacteria within established biofilms. The usefulness of the AK assay was validated by screening a library of off-patent drugs for agents that exhibit antimicrobial properties toward a variety of bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and all members of the "ESKAPE" pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species). The assay detected antibiotics within the library that were expected to be active against the organism screened. Moreover, 38 drugs with no previously reported antibacterial activity elicited AK release. Four of these were acquired, and all were verified to exhibit antimicrobial activity by standard susceptibility testing. Two of these molecules were further characterized. The antihistamine, terfenadine, was active against S. aureus planktonic, SCV population, and biofilm-associated cells. Tamoxifen, an estrogen receptor antagonist, was active toward E. faecium in vitro and also reduced E. faecium pathogenesis in a Galleria mellonella infection model. Our data demonstrate that the AK assay provides an attractive screening approach for identifying new antimicrobial agents. Further, terfenadine and tamoxifen may represent novel antimicrobial drug development scaffolds.
TI  - Validation and comparison of three adenosine triphosphate luminometers for monitoring hospital surface sanitization: a Rosetta Stone for adenosine triphosphate testing.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The application of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) luminometry for monitoring sanitized hospital surfaces is an evolving infection control practice. The goal of this study is to validate and compare 3 commercially available ATP luminometry, swab, rapid-test systems for use in hospital surface sanitization testing. Regulatory agencies may consider this a point-of-care laboratory test; it is therefore imperative that validation criteria are established. METHODS: The ability of instruments to measure long-term stability of ATP dried on surfaces was determined. Dilutions of 3 species of microorganisms and a blood sample were dried onto a surface and tested. The performance characteristics of instruments were compared side-by-side for their ability to recover microorganism-derived ATP from surfaces. RESULTS: Timed studies showed that surface biologic-ATP remained detectable for 10 days. Instrument clinical sensitivity, precision, detection range, limit of detection, and linearity were determined. Swab recovery of microorganisms from surfaces varied by instrument and organism. All 3 systems detected microorganisms in the presence of disinfectants. CONCLUSION: All instruments were validated, but only 1 was verified, because of variations in performance for each system. These studies indicate that careful consideration of the technologic application and instrument performance are important criteria for the selection of an ATP monitoring system.
TI  - Structural studies on 4,5-disubstituted 2-aminoimidazole-based biofilm modulators that suppress bacterial resistance to beta-lactams.
AB  - A library of 4,5-disubstituted 2-aminoimidazole triazole amide (2-AITA) conjugates has been successfully assembled. Upon biological screening, this class of small molecules was discovered as enhanced biofilm regulators through non-microbicidal mechanisms against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), with active concentrations in the low micromolar range. The library was also subjected to synergism and resensitization studies with beta-lactam antibiotics against MRSA. Lead compounds were identified that suppress the antibiotic resistance of MRSA by working synergistically with oxacillin, a beta-lactam antibiotic resistant to penicillinase. A further structure-activity relationship (SAR) study on the parent 2-AITA compound delivered a 2-aminoimidazole diamide (2-AIDA) conjugate with significantly increased synergistic activity with oxacillin against MRSA, decreasing the MIC value of the beta-lactam antibiotic by 64-fold. Increased anti-biofilm activity did not necessarily lead to increased suppression of antibiotic resistance, which indicates that biofilm inhibition and resensitization are most likely occurring via distinct mechanisms.
TI  - Synergistic combination dry powders for inhaled antimicrobial therapy: formulation, characterization and in vitro evaluation.
AB  - In combination antimicrobial therapy, the desired outcome is to broaden the antimicrobial spectrum and to achieve a possible synergistic effect. However, adverse antagonistic species may also emerge from such combinations, leading to treatment failure with serious consequences. It is therefore imperative to screen the drug candidates for compatibility and possible antagonistic interactions. The aim of this work was to develop a novel synergistic dry powder inhaler (DPI) formulation for antimicrobial combination therapy via the pulmonary route. Binary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride and gatifloxacin hydrochloride, SD-CIP/GAT) and ternary (ciprofloxacin hydrochloride, gatifloxacin hydrochloride, and lysozyme, SD-CIP/GAT/LYS) combinations were prepared via spray-drying on a BUCHI(R) Nano Spray Dryer B-90. The powder morphologies were spherical with a slightly corrugated surface and all within the respirable size range. The powders yielded fine particle fractions (of the loaded dose) of over 40% when dispersed using an Aerolizer(R) at 60 L/min. Time-kill studies carried out against the respiratory tract infection-causing bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Acinetobacter baumannii at 1 x the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) over 24h revealed no antagonistic behavior for both the binary and ternary combinations. While the interactions were generally found to be indifferent, a favorable synergistic effect was detected in the dual combination (SD-CIP/GAT) when it was tested against P. aeruginosa bacteria.
TI  - Associations between bacterial contamination of health care workers' hands and contamination of white coats and scrubs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uniforms are potential reservoirs for hospital organisms, potentially reinfecting the hands of health care workers (HCWs). The study aimed to determine the association between the bacterial contamination of HCWs' hands and uniforms (white coats and scrubs). METHODS: HCWs working in 5 intensive care units had cultures obtained from their hands and uniforms (white coats or scrubs). Pathogens were defined as any gram-negative bacilli, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci. RESULTS: Bacterial growth was detected on 103 hands (86%); 13 (11%) grew S aureus, 7 (6%) grew Acinetobacter spp, 2 (2%) grew enterococci, and 83 (70%) grew only skin flora. The presence of pathogens on the hands was associated with a greater likelihood of the presence of pathogens on white coats (kappa = 0.81; P < .001), but not on scrubs (kappa = 0.31; P = .036). Similarly, the presence of Acinetobacter on HCWs' hands was associated with a greater likelihood of Acinetobacter contamination of white coats (kappa = 0.70; P < .001), but not of scrubs (kappa = 0.36; P = .024). CONCLUSIONS: Contamination of provider's hands with pathogens or Acinetobacter baumannii was associated with contamination of white coats. This association was not observed between hands and scrubs, however.
TI  - In vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual agents of catheter-related bloodstream infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs) are common healthcare-associated infections associated with increased morbidity and medical costs. Antiseptic- and antibiotic-coated central venous catheters (CVCs) have been proposed to reduce the incidence of CRBSIs, with variable success. The aim of this study was to determine the in vivo antibiofilm activity of biocompatible and inexpensive compounds, such as cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin, against usual agents of CRBSIs. METHODS: The antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate, chitosan and hamamelitannin was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans in a mouse foreign body infection model, using polyurethane catheter segments. Biofilm formation was assessed with a crystal violet assay to quantify the total biomass, with a tetrazolium reduction assay to quantify the metabolic activity and with scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At subinhibitory concentrations, cerium nitrate significantly reduced biofilm formation by C. albicans, chitosan significantly decreased biofilm formation by S. epidermidis and C. albicans, and hamamelitannin significantly inhibited all bacterial biofilms. DISCUSSION: The in vivo antibiofilm effect of cerium nitrate against C. albicans and of chitosan against C. albicans and S. epidermidis, at subinhibitory concentrations, makes them promising alternatives to coat CVCs. Moreover, the microbicidal effect on a wider range of CVC colonizers was previously reported in vitro for both compounds, at higher concentrations. For all bacterial strains, the highest in vivo antibiofilm efficacy was achieved with hamamelitannin. For A. baumannii, this is the first report of in vivo inhibition.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance of the most frequently isolated microorganisms in the Hospital General La Mancha Centro between June 2009 and May 2010].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: During the last two decades an increased incidence of infections caused by multiresistant bacteria has been observed. The spread of these microorganisms in the hospital is a major therapeutic and epidemiological problem. The aim of this study was to determine local resistance patterns of microorganisms causative of multirresistant infections in patients admitted to our hospital. METHODS: A retrospective study was designed, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from clinical and surveillance samples of patients admitted to the Hospital General La Mancha Centro, between June 2009 and May 2010. RESULTS: The rate of S. aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin was 50%, with 0% resistance to vancomycin. The percentage of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins in E. coli and K. pneumoniae was 17 and 19%, respectively; the ESBL-production in enterobacterial strains was 15 and 19%, respectively, and the quinolone resistance was 41 and 28%, respectively. The resistance of P. aeruginosa to ceftazidime and imipenem was 30 and 40%, respectively. Most strains of A. baumannii studied came from a single multidrug-resistant clone, endemic in the ICU of our hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Of particular concern is the high rate of MRSA, E. coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL producers and resistant to fluoroquinolones as well as P. aeruginosa multiresistant. A. baumannii isolates belong mainly to endemic multidrug-resistant clone from the ICU.
TI  - The effect of d-amino acid substitution on the selectivity of temporin L towards  target cells: identification of a potent anti-Candida peptide.
AB  - The frog skin peptide temporin L (TL, 13-residues long) has a wide and potent spectrum of antimicrobial activity, but it is also toxic on mammalian cells at its microbicidal concentrations. Previous studies have indicated that its analogue [Pro(3)]TL has a slightly reduced hemolytic activity and a stable helical conformation along residues 6-13. Here, to expand our knowledge on the relationship between the extent/position of alpha-helix in TL and its biological activities, we systematically replaced single amino acids within the alpha-helical domain of [Pro(3)]TL with the corresponding d isomers, known as helix breakers. Structure-activity relationship studies of these analogues, by means of CD and NMR spectroscopy analyses as well as antimicrobial and hemolytic assays were performed. Besides increasing our understanding on the structural elements that are responsible for cell selectivity of TL, this study revealed that a single l to d amino acid substitution can preserve strong anti-Candida activity of [Pro(3)]TL, without giving a toxic effect towards human cells.
TI  - Surveillance on secular trends of incidence and mortality for device-associated infection in the intensive care unit setting at a tertiary medical center in Taiwan, 2000-2008: a retrospective observational study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Device-associated infection (DAI) plays an important part in nosocomial infection. Active surveillance and infection control are needed to disclose the specific situation in each hospital and to cope with this problem effectively. We examined the rates of DAI by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, and 30-day and in-hospital mortality in the intensive care unit (ICU). METHODS: Prospective surveillance was conducted in a mixed medical and surgical ICU at a major teaching hospital from 2000 through 2008. Trend analysis was performed and logistic regression was used to assess prognostic factors of mortality. RESULTS: The overall rate of DAIs was 3.03 episodes per 1000 device-days. The most common DAI type was catheter-associated urinary tract infection (3.76 per 1000 urinary catheter-days). There was a decrease in DAI rates in 2005 and rates of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP, 3.18 per 1000 ventilator-days) have remained low since then (p < 0.001). The crude rates of 30-day (33.6%) and in-hospital (52.3%) mortality, as well as infection by antibiotic-resistant VAP pathogens also decreased. The most common antimicrobial-resistant pathogens were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (94.9%) and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (p < 0.001), which also increased at the most rapid rate. The rate of antimicrobial resistance among Enterobacteriaceae also increased significantly (p < 0.05). After controlling for potentially confounding factors, the DAI was an independent prognostic factor for both 30-day mortality (OR 2.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.99-3.17, p = 0.001) and in-hospital mortality (OR 3.61, 95% CI 2.10-3.25, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The decrease in the rate of DAI and infection by resistant bacteria on the impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome can be attributed to active infection control and improved adherence after 2003.
TI  - National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease (NIAID) Funding for Studies  of Hospital-Associated Bacterial Pathogens: Are Funds Proportionate to Burden of Disease?
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-associated infections (HAIs) are associated with a considerable burden of disease and direct costs greater than $17 billion. The pathogens that cause the majority of serious HAIs are Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species, referred as ESCKAPE. We aimed to determine the amount of funding the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) allocates to research on antimicrobial resistant pathogens, particularly ESCKAPE pathogens. METHODS: The NIH Research Portfolio Online Reporting Tools (RePORT) database was used to identify NIAID antimicrobial resistance research grants funded in 2007-2009 using the terms "antibiotic resistance," "antimicrobial resistance," and "hospital-associated infection." RESULTS: Funding for antimicrobial resistance grants has increased from 2007-2009. Antimicrobial resistance funding for bacterial pathogens has seen a smaller increase than non-bacterial pathogens. The total funding for all ESKCAPE pathogens was $ 22,005,943 in 2007, $ 30,810,153 in 2008 and $ 49,801,227 in 2009. S. aureus grants received $ 29,193,264 in FY2009, the highest funding amount of all the ESCKAPE pathogens. Based on 2009 funding data, approximately $1,565 of research money was spent per S. aureus related death and $750 of was spent per C. difficile related death. CONCLUSIONS: Although the funding for ESCKAPE pathogens has increased from 2007 to 2009, funding levels for antimicrobial resistant bacteria-related grants is still lower than funding for antimicrobial resistant non-bacterial pathogens. Efforts may be needed to improve research funding for resistant-bacterial pathogens, particularly as their clinical burden increases.
TI  - Prevention and treatment of virulent bacterial biofilms with an enzymatic nitric  oxide-releasing dressing.
AB  - The use of percutaneous medical devices often results in nosocomial infections. Attachment of microorganisms to the surfaces of these medical devices triggers biofilm formation, which presents significant complications to the health of a patient and may lead to septicemia, thromboembolism, or endocarditis if not correctly treated. Although several antimicrobials are commonly used for prevention of biofilm formation, they have limited efficacy against formed biofilms. In this study, we report the use of an enzymatic, gaseous nitric oxide (gNO)-releasing dressing for the prevention and treatment of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. Results show that the bactericidal activity against biofilms of the test strains was dependent on time and rate of gNO release from the dressing. Following 6 h of treatment, gNO-releasing dressings significantly inhibited the growth of test strains relative to vehicle control dressings, demonstrating eradication of bacterial concentrations of up to 10(5) CFU/cm(2). Complete cell death was observed for both prevention of biofilm formation and treatment of 24-h-grown biofilms after 6 h of treatment with the gNO-releasing dressings. Further, gNO-releasing dressings were more efficient against formed biofilms than other antimicrobial agents currently used. These results demonstrate that the gNO-releasing dressing can produce sufficient levels of gNO over a therapeutically relevant duration for maximal bactericidal effects against virulent bacterial strains known to cause nosocomial infections.
TI  - Laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection aetiology in an intensive care unit: eight years study.
AB  - To evaluate laboratory confirmed bloodstream infection (LC-BSI) aetiology we carried out a prospective study in the general 13 bed ICU of the teaching hospital Policlinico Umberto I in Rome. According to CDC case definitions for LC-BSI, all patients admitted >48h between 2000-2007 to ICU were included. Risk factors (i.e. age, sex, SAPS II), invasive procedures (i.e. endotracheal intubation, vascular and urinary catheterisation), microbiological isolates and their antibiotic susceptibility were screened. Overall 1741 patients (64.8% males, 35.2% females) were included, mean age was 58.1 +/- 19.8, SAPS II score 45.1 +/- 17 and ICU stay 14.0 +/- 21.1 days. Finally, 167 (9.6%) patients developed 203 (11.7%) ICU-acquired LC-BSI and sources of infection were CVC (39.8%), unknown (39.3%), respiratory tract (12.4%), surgical wound (6.5%) and urinary tract (2.0%). Between 2000 and 2007 the incidence of LC-BSI/1000 patient days (14.8 per thousands vs. 7.8 per thousands: p<0.05) and LC-BSI/1000 CVC days (20.7 per thousands vs. 11.4 per thousands; p<0.05) decreased. The onset of infection followed ICU admission by 19.5 +/- 17.7 (mean) and 13 days (median). Crude mortality was 34.8%, and mortality associated with LC-BSI showed a RR 1.61; 95%CI 1.37 - 1.89; p<0.01. The most common pathogens were coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (26.2%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (14.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13.5%), enterococci (9.3%) and Acinetobacter bawnumannii (7.5%). Onset time (days) between ICU admission and LC-BSI was higher (p<0.01) among Gram-negative (22.9 +/- 18.4) compared to Gram-positive (16.6 +/- 15.9), fungi (23.8 +/- 25.3). High early death (<7 days after BSI diagnosis) was associated to A. baumannii (37.5%), Candida spp. (30.0%) and S. aureus (29.7%). Staphylococci presented a very high methicillin resistance (>85%). P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii showed respectively 25% and 68.7% multidrug-resistance. Over 1/3 of Eneterobacteriaceae isolates were extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), but non resulted resistant to carbapenems. Surveillance showed a high incidence of LC-BSI associated to invasive procedures and the presence of multiresistant bacteria.
TI  - Microbiologic characteristics of pathogenic bacteria from hospitalized trauma patients who survived Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the microbiological characterization  of pathogenic bacteria isolated from trauma patients after Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. Most infections were identified in the patients over 60 years of age, with an incidence rate of 78.5%, and more infections in wound (43.3%) and respiratory tract (37.1%) sites were identified. A total of 97 non-duplicated clinical pathogens were isolated from 91 trauma patients. Of those pathogens, 62 (63.9%) were Gram-negative bacilli, 23 (23.7%) were Gram-positive cocci, 9 (9.3%) were fungi, and 3 (3.1%) were anaerobes, such as Clostridium perfringens. The distribution spectrum of pathogens isolated from trauma patients after earthquake was different to that from non-earthquake trauma patients in our hospital at the same time. The most prevalent pathogenic isolates were Escherichia coli (15.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii (14.4%), Staphylococcus aureus (12.3%), Burkholderia cepacia (11.3%), and Enterococcus spp. (9.3%). The drug susceptibility results showed that most of the Gram-negative bacilli, except for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Burkholderia cepacia, were susceptible to imipenem, but resistant to the first- and the second-generation cephalosporins. Most of the Gram-positive cocci were susceptible to vancomycin, linezolid, and Synercid/dalfopristin. Characteristics of pathogenic bacterium isolated from trauma patients after earthquake have been demonstrated which play an important role in the appropriate treatment of infections.
TI  - Assessment of the Phoenix automated system and EUCAST breakpoints for antimicrobial susceptibility testing against isolates expressing clinically relevant resistance mechanisms.
AB  - EUCAST breakpoint criteria are being adopted by automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems. The accuracy of the Phoenix Automated System in combination with 2012 EUCAST breakpoints against recent clinical isolates was evaluated. A total of 697 isolates (349 Enterobacteriaceae, 113 Pseudomonas spp., 25 Acinetobacter baumannii, 11 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 95 Staphylococcus aureus, 6 coagulase negative staphylococci, 77 enterococci and 21 Streptococcus pneumoniae) with defined resistance phenotypes and well-characterized resistance mechanisms recovered in Spain (n = 343) and Italy (n = 354) were tested. Comparator antimicrobial susceptibility testing data were obtained following CLSI guidelines. Experimental agreement (EA), defined as MIC agreement +/-1 log(2) dilution, category agreement (CA) and relative discrepancies (minor (mD), major (MD) and very major discrepancies (VMD)) were determined. The overall EA and CA for all organism-antimicrobial agent combinations (n = 6.294) were 97.3% and 95.2%, respectively. mD, MD and VMD were 4.7%, 1.3% and 2.7%, all of them in agreement with the ISO (ISO20776-2:2007) acceptance criteria for assessment of susceptibility testing devices. VMD were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulanate and cefuroxime in Enterobacteriaceae and gentamicin in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, whereas MD were mainly observed in amoxicillin-clavulante in Enterobacteriaceae. mD were mainly observed in Enterobacteriaceae but distributed in different antimicrobials. For S. aureus and enterococci relative discrepancies were low. The Phoenix system showed accuracy assessment in accordance with the ISO standards when using EUCAST breakpoints. Inclusion of EUCAST criteria in automatic antimicrobial susceptibility testing systems will facilitate the implementation of EUCAST breakpoints in clinical microbiology laboratories.
TI  - In vitro evaluation of the potential for resistance development to ceragenin CSA-13.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Though most bacteria remain susceptible to endogenous antimicrobial peptides, specific resistance mechanisms are known. As mimics of antimicrobial peptides, ceragenins were expected to retain antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and -negative bacteria, even after prolonged exposure. Serial passaging of bacteria to a lead ceragenin, CSA-13, was performed with representative pathogenic bacteria. Ciprofloxacin, vancomycin and colistin were used as comparators. The mechanisms of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria were elucidated. METHODS: Susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were serially exposed to CSA-13 and comparators for 30 passages. MIC values were monitored. Alterations in the Gram-negative bacterial membrane composition were characterized via mass spectrometry and the susceptibility of antimicrobial-peptide-resistant mutants to CSA-13 was evaluated. RESULTS: S. aureus became highly resistant to ciprofloxacin after <20 passages. After 30 passages, the MIC values of vancomycin and CSA-13 for S. aureus increased 9- and 3-fold, respectively. The Gram-negative organisms became highly resistant to ciprofloxacin after <20 passages. MIC values of colistin for P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii increased to >/=100 mg/L after 20 passages. MIC values of CSA-13 increased to approximately 20-30 mg/L and plateaued over the course of the experiment. Bacteria resistant to CSA-13 displayed lipid A modifications that are found in organisms resistant to antimicrobial peptides. CONCLUSIONS: CSA-13 retained potent antibacterial activity against S. aureus over the course of 30 serial passages. Resistance generated in Gram-negative bacteria correlates with modifications to the outer membranes of these organisms and was not stable outside of the presence of the antimicrobial.
TI  - Reducing the spread of Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus on a burns unit through the intervention of an infection control bundle.
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii are major nosocomial pathogens in burns units. We investigated the impact of an infection control bundle on the incidence of nosocomial MRSA and A. baumannii in our burns unit, comparing a pre-intervention period (December 2006-August 2008) with an intervention period (September 2008-December 2009). The bundle comprised regular hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) disinfection of the rooms following discharge of patients colonized or infected by multidrug-resistant bacteria, pre-emptive cohort isolation of newly admitted patients before being proven culture negative, cohorting of colonized or infected patients, installation of two air disinfection systems in the corridors of the unit and improvement of material storage. We also investigated the microbiological efficacy of HPV disinfection by sampling the environment before and after HPV treatments. HPV disinfection eliminated pathogens from the environment and significantly reduced total bacterial surface counts, and total fungal air and surface counts, on both a unit and room scale. The incidence of nosocomial MRSA infection or colonization fell by 89.3% from 7.22 to 0.77 cases/1000 patient days (p<0.0001) and A. baumannii fell by 88.8% from 6.92 to 0.77 cases/1000 patient days (p=0.002) in the intervention period with no further outbreaks of these organisms occurring in this period. The infection control bundle resulted in a significant reduction in the incidence of nosocomial MRSA and A. baumannii in our burns unit and prevented further outbreaks of these organisms.
TI  - Antibacterial activities of iron chelators against common nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - The activities of iron chelators (deferoxamine, deferiprone, Apo6619, and VK28) were evaluated against type strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli. Deferiprone, Apo6619, and VK28 each inhibited growth in standard and RPMI tissue culture medium, while deferoxamine had no effect. Additionally, time-kill assays revealed that VK28 had a bacteriostatic effect against S. aureus. Therefore, these newly developed iron chelators might provide a nontraditional approach for treatment of bacterial infections.
TI  - Rapid identification of ESKAPE bacterial strains using an autonomous microfluidic device.
AB  - This article describes Bacteria ID Chips ('BacChips'): an inexpensive, portable,  and autonomous microfluidic platform for identifying pathogenic strains of bacteria. BacChips consist of a set of microchambers and channels molded in the elastomeric polymer, poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS). Each microchamber is preloaded with mono-, di-, or trisaccharides and dried. Pressing the layer of PDMS into contact with a glass coverslip forms the device; the footprint of the device in this article is approximately 6 cm(2). After assembly, BacChips are degased under large negative pressure and are stored in vacuum-sealed plastic bags. To use the device, the bag is opened, a sample containing bacteria is introduced at the inlet of the device, and the degased PDMS draws the sample into the central channel and chambers. After the liquid at the inlet is consumed, air is drawn into the BacChip via the inlet and provides a physical barrier that separates the liquid samples in adjacent microchambers. A pH indicator is admixed with the samples prior to their loading, enabling the metabolism of the dissolved saccharides in the microchambers to be visualized. Importantly, BacChips operate without external equipment or instruments. By visually detecting the growth of bacteria using ambient light after approximately 4 h, we demonstrate that BacChips with ten microchambers containing different saccharides can reproducibly detect the ESKAPE panel of pathogens, including strains of: Enterococcus faecalis, Enteroccocus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter aerogenes, and Enterobacter cloacae. This article describes a BacChip for point-of-care detection of ESKAPE pathogens and a starting point for designing multiplexed assays that identify bacterial strains from clinical samples and simultaneously determine their susceptibility to antibiotics.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals.
AB  - The drug resistance of microorganisms isolated from laboratory animals never treated with antibiotics is being reported consistently, while the number of laboratory animals used in medicine, pharmacy, veterinary medicine, agriculture, nutrition, and environmental and health science has increased rapidly in Korea. Therefore, this study examined the development of antimicrobial resistance in bacteria isolated from laboratory animals bred in Korea. A total of 443 isolates (7 species) containing 5 Sphingomonas paucimobilis, 206 Escherichia coli, 60 Staphylococcus aureus, 15 Staphylococcus epidermidis, 77 Enterococcus faecalis, 27 Citrobacter freundii, 35 Acinetobacter baumannii were collected from the nose, intestine, bronchus and reproductive organs of ICR mice and SD rats. Of these species, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus faecalis showed significant antimicrobial resistance according to the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) in E-test. In case of Acinetobacter baumannii, several isolates showed MIC values 16-128 microg/mL for cefazolin and cefoxitin, and higher resistance (128-512 microg/mL) to nitrofurantoin than that of standard type. Resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin was detected in 17.14, 20.00, and 8.57% of the Acinetobacter baumannii isolates, respectively. In addition, 44.1% of the Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected from the laboratory animals were resistant to oxacillin concentration of 16-32 microg/mL range, while MIC value of standard type was below oxacillin concentration of 6 microg/mL. These results suggest that in rodent species of laboratory animals, Acinetobacter baumannii are resistance to cefazolin, cefoxitin and nitrofurantoin, whereas those of Enterococcus faecalis were resistance to oxacillin.
TI  - [Analysis of distribution characteristics and drug resistance of 2748 strains of  pathogens isolated from burn patients].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide epidemiological data of the distribution characteristics and drug resistance of the pathogens isolated from burn patients in recent years for guiding rational use of antibiotics in clinic. METHODS: Totally 2748 strains of pathogens were isolated from 1977 specimens (blood, catheter, wound excretion, etc.) collected from 478 patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital from March 2003 to June 2011. After being identified by API strips, drug resistance of the 2748 isolated pathogens to 55 commonly-used antibiotics including gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin, amikacin, etc. was tested by K-B paper disk diffusion method. The WHONET 5.3 software was used to analyze the following subjects: the distribution of the pathogens with different types and different sources each year, the changes in drug-resistant rates of Gram negative bacilli, Gram positive cocci, and fungi to several antibiotics, and the changes in sensitive rates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Candida albicans (CA) to several antibiotics. RESULTS: Among 2748 strains of pathogens, 1879 strains of Gram negative bacilli accounted for 68.38%, 628 strains of Gram positive cocci accounted for 22.85%, and 241 strains of fungi accounted for 8.77%. The isolation rate of strains from wound excretion ranked the first (1022 strains accounted for 37.19%), followed by those from respiratory tract (995 strains accounted for 36.21%) and blood (421 strains accounted for 15.32%). Strains isolated from other types of specimens were rare. Isolation rate of PA ranked the first (996 strains accounted for 36.24%), followed by SA (495 strains accounted for 18.01%) and AB (395 strains accounted for 14.37%). Isolation rate of AB showed a trend of increase year by year, but that of SA presented the opposite trend. Isolation rate of PA was quite stable. There were 484 strains of methicillin resistant SA among Staphylococci, accounting for 17.61%. Resistant rates of PA and AB to polymyxin B and polymyxin E were below 30.00%, and those of PA and AB to other antibiotics, such as the third generation cephalosporins, beta-lactams, aminoglycosides, and quinolones, were from 57.91% to 100.00%. Resistant rate of AB to minocycline was 39.68%. From 2004 to 2011, sensitive rate of PA to quinolone antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year, but that of AB to minocycline, netilmicin, imipenem, meropenem, tobramycin, and cefoperazone/sulbactam presented the opposite trend. Resistant rates of Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and SA to teicoplanin and linezolid were less than 10.00%. Resistant rate of SA, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Enterococcus faecium to vancomycin was 0. Resistant rates of SA to quinupristin/dalfopristin, minocycline, fusidic acid, and compound sulfamethoxazole were low, respectively 0.82%, 9.35%, 2.21%, and 31.85%. Sensitive rates of SA to erythromycin, clindamycin, compound sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, and minocycline showed an increasing trend year by year. Both infection rate and resistant rate of fungi were low. The resistant rates of CA to 5 kinds of antibiotics were less than 15.00%. The sensitive rate of CA to 5-flucytosine declined slightly, and those of CA to the other 4 antibiotics showed an increasing trend year by year. CONCLUSIONS: The three dominant pathogens that cause infection in burn patients hospitalized in Institute of Burn Research of Southwest Hospital in recent years are PA, SA, and AB in order. PA and AB are outstandingly multidrug-resistant among the isolated strains. AB might replace PA as the main pathogenic bacterium that cause the death of burn patients with infection.
TI  - [The multiplex polymerase chain reaction for detection of ventilator-associated trachea-bronchitis and pneumonia in patients with common pathogens].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the clinical utility of multiple polymerase chain reaction  (M-PCR) in the rapid detection of the common pathogens in ventilator-associated trachea - bronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Sputum samples of 75 patients complicated VAT or VAP in surgical intensive care unit (SICU), were examined by bacterial culture, ordinary PCR, the M-PCR detection. The pathogen detection rates among three methods were compared. RESULTS: The Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae of the positive detection rates were 50.7%, 45.3%, 30.7%, 41.3% and 58.7% by bacterial culture. By ordinary PCR, the positive detection rates were respectively 88.0%, 89.3%, 78.7%, 85.3% and 93.3%, and by M-PCR, the positive detection rates were respectively 92.1%, 90.7%, 82.7%, 89.3% and 96.0%. The positive rates of five common pathogens of ordinary PCR and M-PCR were higher than those of bacterial culture (all P < 0.05). The M-PCR had merit for rapid detection compared with ordinary PCR. CONCLUSION: Compared with bacterial culture, ordinary PCR and M-PCR yield higher positive rates in identifying five common pathogens of VAT and VAP, meanwhile, it also demonstrated the tendency that M-PCR may save cost and labor power.
TI  - A case report of a multi-drug resistant bacterial infection in a diabetic patient treated in northeast Brazil.
AB  - Diabetes mellitus is one of the most critical health conditions around the world, not only in terms of the number of affected people, disability, and premature mortality, but also in regards to the health care costs involved in controlling and treating its complications. Among the most constant ailments the diabetic patient suffers is the diabetic foot, defined as any infection, ulceration, and/or necrosis of deep tissues associated with neurological abnormalities and various degrees of peripheral vascular disease of the lower limbs. Diabetic foot ulcerations have become a major and increasing public health concern and its associated morbidities, impairment of the patients' quality of life, and the implied costs for management have attracted the attention of numerous health care providers. In this case report, the authors review a unique presentation of a polymicrobial infection of a multi-drug resistant character species formed by oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Acinetobacter lwoffii.
TI  - Patients transferred from Libya to Denmark carried OXA-48-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, NDM-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - URPD: a specific product primer design tool.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plays an important role in molecular  biology. Primer design fundamentally determines its results. Here, we present a currently available software that is not located in analyzing large sequence but used for a rather straight-forward way of visualizing the primer design process for infrequent users. FINDINGS: URPD (yoUR Primer Design), a web-based specific product primer design tool, combines the NCBI Reference Sequences (RefSeq), UCSC In-Silico PCR, memetic algorithm (MA) and genetic algorithm (GA) primer design methods to obtain specific primer sets. A friendly user interface is accomplished by built-in parameter settings. The incorporated smooth pipeline operations effectively guide both occasional and advanced users. URPD contains an automated process, which produces feasible primer pairs that satisfy the specific needs of the experimental design with practical PCR amplifications. Visual virtual gel electrophoresis and in silico PCR provide a simulated PCR environment. The comparison of Practical gel electrophoresis comparison to virtual gel electrophoresis facilitates and verifies the PCR experiment. Wet-laboratory validation proved that the system provides feasible primers. CONCLUSIONS: URPD is a user-friendly tool that provides specific primer design results. The pipeline design path makes it easy to operate for beginners. URPD also provides a high throughput primer design function. Moreover, the advanced parameter settings assist sophisticated researchers in performing experiential PCR. Several novel functions, such as a nucleotide accession number template sequence input, local and global specificity estimation, primer pair redesign, user-interactive sequence scale selection, and virtual and practical PCR gel electrophoresis discrepancies have been developed and integrated into URPD. The URPD program is implemented in JAVA and freely available at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/urpd/.
TI  - Bacterial yield from quantitative cultures of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid in patients with pneumonia on antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: Early diagnosis and appropriate antimicrobial choice are crucial when managing pneumonia patients, and quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid is considered a useful method for identifying pneumonia pathogens. We evaluated the quantitative yield of BAL fluid bacterial cultures in patients being treated with antimicrobials and attempted to identify factors predictive of positive BAL cultures. METHODS: Patients over 18 years old and whose BAL fluid was subjected to quantitative culture to identify the organism causative of pneumonia between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2009, were included. We reviewed the results of BAL fluid bacterial cultures and the clinical records, laboratory tests, and radiographic findings of the patients. RESULTS: BAL was performed on 340 patients with pneumonia. A positive BAL culture, defined as isolation of more than 10(4) colony forming units/mL bacteria, was documented in 18 (5.29%) patients. Of these, 9 bacteria isolated from 10 patients were classified as probable pathogens. The most frequently isolated bacteria were methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No independent predictive factor for positive BAL cultures was identified. CONCLUSIONS: The yield of quantitative BAL fluid bacterial culture in patients already on antimicrobials was low. Clinicians should be cautious when performing a BAL culture in patients with pneumonia who are already on antimicrobials.
TI  - Kirenol production in hairy root culture of Siegesbeckea orientalis and its antimicrobial activity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the excellent anti-inflammatory and anti-rheumatic efficacy associated with kirenol generation, the content of kirenol in Siegesbeckea orientalis is quite low. OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to establish a reliable kirenol production protocol by transformed root cultures of S. orientalis and to investigate the antimicrobial activities of kirenol, hairy root, and S. orientalis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Transformed root cultures of S. orientalis were established by the transformation of Agrobacterium rhizogenes A4. Transgenic status of the roots was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using rolB specific primers. The biomass and kirenol accumulation of hairy root clones were assessed using four different culture media: MS, MS/2, B5, and white. The antimicrobial activities of kirenol, hairy root, and S. orientalis were evaluated by the disc diffusion method. RESULTS: The optimum media for kirenol synthesis was MS. The content of kirenol in transformed hairy roots made up about 80% of that observed in natural leaves of S. orientalis (1.6 mg/g dry weight). All tested samples displayed antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive pathogens including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii, with MIC ranging from 78 to 625 mug/mL. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The high level of kirenol contents was obtained from hairy roots of S. orientalis. Kirenol was effective against gram-positive bacteria. Interestingly, the extract from hairy roots showed a diverse antimicrobial effect from that of kirenol and S. orientalis.
TI  - Costs of healthcare- and community-associated infections with antimicrobial-resistant versus antimicrobial-susceptible organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared differences in the hospital charges, length of hospital stay, and mortality between patients with healthcare- and community-associated bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia due to antimicrobial-resistant versus -susceptible bacterial strains. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of an electronic database compiled from laboratory, pharmacy, surgery, financial, and patient location and device utilization sources was undertaken on 5699 inpatients who developed healthcare- or community-associated infections between 2006 and 2008 from 4 hospitals (1 community, 1 pediatric, 2 tertiary/quaternary care) in Manhattan. The main outcome measures were hospital charges, length of stay, and mortality among patients with antimicrobial-resistant and -susceptible infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: Controlling for multiple confounders using linear regression and nearest neighbor matching based on propensity score estimates, resistant healthcare- and community-associated infections, when compared with susceptible strains of the same organism, were associated with significantly higher charges ($15,626; confidence interval [CI], $4339-$26,913 and $25,573; CI, $9331-$41,816, respectively) and longer hospital stays for community-associated infections (3.3; CI, 1.5-5.4). Patients with resistant healthcare-associated infections also had a significantly higher death rate (0.04; CI, 0.01-0.08). CONCLUSIONS: With careful matching of patients infected with the same organism, antimicrobial resistance was associated with higher charges, length of stay, and death rates. The difference in estimates after accounting for censoring for death highlight divergent social and hospital incentives in reducing patient risk for antimicrobial resistant infections.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant organisms, wounds and topical antimicrobial protection.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are increasingly implicated in both acute and chronic wound infections. The limited therapeutic options are further compromised by the fact that wound bacteria often co-exist within a biofilm community which enhances bacterial tolerance to antibiotics. As a consequence, topical antiseptics may be an important consideration for minimising the opportunity for wound infections involving MDROs. The objective of this research was to investigate the antimicrobial activity of a silver-containing gelling fibre dressing against a variety of MDROs in free-living and biofilm states, using stringent in vitro models designed to simulate a variety of wound conditions. MDROs included Acinetobacter baumannii, community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. Clostridium difficile was also included in the study because it carries many of the characteristics seen in MDROs and evidence of multidrug resistance is emerging. Sustained in vitro antimicrobial activity of the silver-containing dressing was shown against 10 MDROs in a simulated wound fluid over 7 days, and inhibitory and bactericidal effects against both free-living and biofilm phenotypes were also consistently shown in simulated colonised wound surface models. The in vitro data support consideration of the silver-containing gelling fibre dressing as part of a protocol of care in the management of wounds colonised or infected with MDROs.
TI  - Total synthesis and biological evaluation of transvalencin Z.
AB  - The emerging global epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis has created an urgent need to identify novel therapeutic approaches for disease treatment. Transvalencin Z (1) is a natural product from Nocardia transvalensis with relatively potent and selective antimycobacterial activity against Mycobacterium smegmatis, making it an attractive target for structure-activity and mechanism of action studies. The total synthesis of the four possible diastereomers of transvalencin Z was completed (1a-d), and the absolute configurations were defined using chemical synthesis, HPLC retention times, and optical rotation measurements. Surprisingly, none of the transvalencin Z diastereomers exhibited any inhibitory activity against a panel of microbial pathogens, including several species of mycobacteria.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against bacteria isolated from Thai patients with urinary tract infections and lower respiratory tract infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine comparative in vitro activity of sitafloxacin against clinical isolates of bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1,255 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus spp, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolated from different Thai patients with urinary tract infection and those with lower respiratory tract infection in 2010 were included. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of sitafloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, imipenem, amikacin, ampicillin, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, penicillin, piperacillin/tazobactam, vancomycin, azithromycin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were determined by standard agar dilution method. RESULTS: The MIC50 and MIC90 values of sitafloxacin against all tested bacteria were lowest when compared with those of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin. Sitafloxacin was active against 51% of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates. The activity of sitafloxacin against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as, extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumomiae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was comparable to or more than that of some beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, cephalosporins or carbapenems. CONCLUSION: Sitafloxacin is more active than levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin against isolated bacteria from Thai patients with urinary tract and lower respiratory infections including antibiotic resistant bacteria, such as MRSA, ESBL-producing Gram-negatives, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota against common multidrug-resistant bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine inhibitory activity of fermented milk with Lactobacillus  casei strain Shirota (FMLC) against common multi-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria causing hospital-acquired infections. MATERIAL AND METHOD: Time-kill methods of FMLC and cell-free filtered fluid of FMLC (CF-FMLC) against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, ESBL-producing Escherichia coli & Klebsiella pneumoniae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were conducted. The control solutions were Mueller Hinton broth (MHB) and distilled water. The mixtures of FMLC, CF-FMLC, MHB and DW with 10(5) to 10(6) CFU/ml of each bacterium were prepared and incubated at 35 degrees C. Each mixture was quantified for viable bacteria at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr after incubation onto brain heart infusion agar plates. The inoculated agar plates were incubated at 35 degrees C for 24-48 hr. Bacterial colonies on agar plates were counted and compared among the mixtures. RESULTS: Log CFUs of each organism in MHB and distilled water after incubation were increased from 5.1-6.3 at 0 h to 6.4- > 11 at 24 hr. Log CFUs of each organism in FMLC and CF-FMLC after incubation with study bacteria for 0, 1, 3, 6 and 24 hr were decreased to undetectable amounts at 24 hr. CONCLUSION: FMLC and CF-FMLC exerted slow inhibitory activity against MDR bacteria resulting in eradication of all study bacteria at 24 hr. Such inhibitory effects were probably due to the products of the milk fermented by Lactobacillus casei strain Shirota. Clinical study is needed to determine if consumption of FMLC can prevent and treat colonization and infection with MDR bacteria in hospitalized patients.
TI  - [Changes of etiology of chronic sinusitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore etiology distribution changes of chronic naso sinusitis. METHOD: The purulent discharges taken from the maxillary sinus and posterior ethmoid sinus of 111 patients during endoscopic sinus surgery were cultured for both bacteria and fungi as experimental group. In the control group, the discharges of the nasal cavity from 30 healthy adults were also cultured for bacteria. The culture results were compared with data of 2005, and changes in the distribution of pathogenic microorganisms were analyzed. RESULT: Fifteen species, including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Candida albicans, were cultured from the testing group. The total positive rate of bacteria was 81.8%. The detectable rates of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria, and various fungi were 37.8%, 54.4%, 7.8% respectively. Five species including Staphylococcus epidermidis, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Branhamella catarrhalis and Staphylococcus aureus etc were cultured from the control group. There was significant differences between 2005 and 2010 in experimental group (chi2 = 0.009, P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Bacterial infection is a major reason for chronic sinusitis. The bacteria distribution structure changed from the original gram-positive bacteria to gram-negative bacteria. Fungal infections can not be ignored. To bacteria culture and drug sensitivity test should be done before antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of statins: a comparative study of atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Statins have several effects beyond their well-known antihyperlipidemic activity, which include immunomodulatory, antioxidative and anticoagulant effects. In this study, we have tested the possible antimicrobial activity of statins against a range of standard bacterial strains and bacterial clinical isolates. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) values were evaluated and compared among three members of the statins drug (atorvastatin, simvastatin, and rosuvastatin). RESULTS: It was revealed that statins are able to induce variable degrees of antibacterial activity with atorvastatin, and simvastatin being the more potent than rosuvastatin. Methicillin-sensitive staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-susceptible enterococci (VSE), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE), acinetobacter baumannii, staphylococcus epidermidis, and enterobacter aerogenes, were more sensitive to both atorvastatin, and simvastatin compared to rosuvastatin. On the other hand, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and enterobacter cloacae were more sensitive to atorvastatin compared to both simvastatin and rosuvastatin. Furthermore, most clinical isolates were less sensitive to statins compared to their corresponding standard strains. CONCLUSION: Our findings might raise the possibility of a potentially important antibacterial class effect for statins especially, atorvastatin and simvastatin.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of the hospital environment during wound dressing change.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The hospital environment plays a role in the cross-transmission of  multidrug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to evaluate the bacterial contamination of the hospital environment during chronic wound dressing change. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was performed from July 2010 to May 2011. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae were counted in environmental samples (air and surfaces) that were obtained in the rooms of patients with wounds colonized (cases, n=9) or not (controls, n=15) during or not during wound dressing change. Bacterial contamination was compared to that found in the rooms of patients without colonized wounds. RESULTS: The environment was frequently contaminated during wound dressing change (38% of the sampled series were positive). In comparison, the contamination was less frequent in the environment of patients with colonized wounds when the wounds were not being dressed (14.3%) and in controls (3.8%). S. aureus was the most frequent species identified in positive samples. DISCUSSION: These results suggest that previously recommended measures such as hand hygiene after contact with the environment and wearing a mask are justified. Moreover, other measures should be suggested, in particular cleaning the room before and after dressing change of colonized wounds. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III: case control study.
TI  - Rapid, cost-effective, sensitive and quantitative detection of Acinetobacter baumannii from pneumonia patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Pneumonia with Acinetobacter baumannii has a major therapeutic problem in health care settings. Decision to initiate correct antibiotic therapy requires rapid identification and quantification of organism. The aim of this study was to develop a rapid and sensitive method for direct detection of A. baumannii from respiratory specimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A Taqman real time PCR based on the sequence of bla(oxa-51) was designed and used for direct detection of A. baumannii from 361 respiratory specimens of patients with pneumonia. All specimens were checked by conventional bacteriology in parallel. RESULTS: The new real time PCR could detect less than 200 cfu per ml of bacteria in specimens. There was agreement between the results of real time PCR and culture (Kappa value 1.0, p value<0.001). The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of real time PCR were 100%. The prevalence of A. baumannii in pneumonia patients was 10.53 % (n=38). Poly-microbial infections were detected in 65.71% of specimens. CONCLUSION: Acinetobacter baumannii is the third causative agent in nosocomial pneumonia after Pseudomonas aeroginosa (16%) and Staphylococcus aureus (13%) at Tehran hospitals. We recommend that 104 CFU be the threshold for definition of infection with A. baumannii using real time PCR.
TI  - The Design and Construction of K11: A Novel alpha-Helical Antimicrobial Peptide.
AB  - Amphipathic alpha-helical antimicrobial peptides comprise a class of broad-spectrum agents that are used against pathogens. We designed a series of antimicrobial peptides, CP-P (KWKSFIKKLTSKFLHLAKKF) and its derivatives, and determined their minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, their minimum hemolytic concentrations (MHCs) for human erythrocytes, and the Therapeutic Index (MHC/MIC ratio). We selected the derivative peptide K11, which had the highest therapeutic index (320) among the tested peptides, to determine the MICs against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and 22 clinical isolates including Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Klebsiella pneumonia. K11 exhibited low MICs (less than 10 mug/mL) and broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, especially against clinically isolated drug-resistant pathogens. Therefore, these results indicate that K11 is a promising candidate antimicrobial peptide for further studies.
TI  - The risk factors for early infection in adult living donor liver transplantation  recipients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The high rate of early major infections in liver transplantation recipients is due to their compromised immune-system. We examined the risk factors of early major infection in living donor liver transplantation (LDLT). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From January 2004 to December 2010, 242 patients undergoing LDLT were enrolled in the prospective cohort. We prospectively collected their clinical and demographic variables, operative details, and posttransplant complications. RESULT: One hundred thirty-nine patients (57.7%) experienced 252 episodes of early infection posttransplantation: bloodstream septicemia (n = 46, 18.3%), urinary tract (n = 34; 14.1%), pneumonia (n = 64; 25.4%), peritonitis (n = 62; 25.7%), and catheter related (n = 46; 19%). The most frequent Gram-positive bacteria were coagulase-negative staphylococci (n = 52; 16.9%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n = 32; 10.4%). The most common Gram-negative bacteria were Escherichia coli (n = 27; 8.8%); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 29; 9.4%), Pseudomonas aureos (n = 18; 5.8%), and Sternotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 18; 5.8%). Upon multivariate logistic regression analysis, the risk factors for early major infection were a high creatinine level (odds ratio = 1.481), a long anhepatic arterial phase (1.01), a reoperation (6.417), young age (1.040), and non-hepatocellular carcinoma recipient (2.141). CONCLUSION: Early major infection after LDLT was high with Gram-positive bacteria, the most common etiologies. Prolonged anhepatic arterial phase, renal insufficiency, and reoperation were risk factors for an early major infection.
TI  - The impact of the types of microorganisms isolated from blood and wounds on the results of treatment in burn patients with sepsis.
AB  - Despite development of combustiology, infections continue to be the most important cause of death among patients with burns. Sepsis is the most severe clinical presentation of infection in patients after thermal injuries who require immediate treatment. Early diagnosis and proper treatment of sepsis are important in the clinical management that is often hampered for multiple reasons, e.g. impaired patient immunity, problems with microorganisms with multi-antibacterial drug resistance. The aim of the study was to assess effect of type of a microorganism isolated from blood and wound on results of treatment of sepsis in patients with burns. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Effect of type of microorganisms isolated from blood and wound on the result of treatment of sepsis was studied in 338 patients hospitalized immediately after an injury in Centre for Burn Treatment in Siemianowice Slaskie in years 2003 - 2004 (at the age of 18 - 96 years, 66 women and 272 men). Clinical symptoms of generalized infection were found in all study subjects. The study group was divided into two subgroups: cured patients and patients who died of sepsis. The following parameters were assessed in both subgroups: type of microorganism isolated from blood, type of microorganism isolated from wound as well as occurrence of the same and different infections of blood and burn wound. RESULTS: positive blood cultures were found in 165 patients (48.8%), 106 (64.2%) were cured, 59 (35.8%) died. The most commonly isolated microorganisms in cured patients were Gram(+) Staphylococcus epidermidis MRSE (19.81%) and Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (18.87%). Gram(-) intestinal rods were least commonly isolated from this group. The most commonly isolated microorganisms from blood of patients who were to die, included non-fermenting Gram(-) rods Acinetobacter baumannii (35.59%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22.03%). Mixed bacterial flora was found in the blood of 22.03% patients. Among patients who were to die, the same microorganisms were found in the blood and in the wound in 32.2% of patients, while this rate was 17.92 in cured patients. The most commonly found bacteria in the blood and burn wound in the cured patients included Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (31.58%) and Staphylococcus aureus (21.05%). In the group of patients who were to die, the most common bacteria isolated simultaneously from the blood and burn wound included Acinetobacter baumannii (47.37%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36.84%). CONCLUSIONS: 1. The patients with thermal injuries are at higher risk of death in the event of sepsis caused by Gram(-) bacteria versus Gram(+) bacteria. 2. Infection of blood and burn wound caused by the same bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanni increases the risk of death due to sepsis in patients with burns following thermal injuries.
TI  - Persistence of nosocomial pathogens on various fabrics.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Fabrics can become contaminated with high numbers of microorganisms that may be pathogenic to patients in a hospital setting and can play an important role in the chain of infection. The aim of this study was to investigate the survival of several clinical bacterial and fungal isolates on several fabrics commonly used in hospitals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bacterial and fungal survival was tested on the following materials, each of which are commonly used in our hospital: 100% smooth cotton, 60% cotton-40% polyester, 100% wool and 100% silk. One isolate each of Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida krusei, Candida glabrata, Candida parapsilosis, Geotrichum candidum, Aspergillus fumigatus, Cryptococcus neoformans, vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) positive Escherichia coli, inducible beta-lactamase (IBL) positive Pseudomonas aeruginosa, IBL-positive Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were used to contaminate fabrics. The survival of these microorganisms was studied by testing the fabric swatches for microbial growth. RESULTS: The median survival times for all the tested bacteria and fungi were as follows: 26 days on cotton, 26.5 days on cotton-polyester, 28 days on silk, and 30 days on wool. Among the bacterial species tested, E. faecium had the longest survival time on cotton-polyester fabrics. For the fungal isolates, it was observed that C. tropicalis and C. krusei survived for the shortest amount of time on cotton fabrics in the present study. CONCLUSION: This survival data indicate that pathogenic microorganisms can survive from days to months on commonly used hospital fabrics. These findings indicate that current recommendations for the proper disinfection or sterilization of fabrics used in hospitals should be followed to minimize cross-contamination and prevent nosocomial infections.
TI  - Macrophage killing of bacterial and fungal pathogens is not inhibited by intense  intracellular accumulation of the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic oritavancin.
AB  - Intact phagocytic effector function is fundamental to host defense against microbial pathogens. Concern has been raised regarding the potential that accumulation of certain agents, including cationic amphiphilic antibiotics, within macrophages could cause a mixed-lipid storage disorder, resulting in macrophage dysfunction in recipients. The ability of 2 macrophage cell lines (HL-60; RAW 264.7) to kill archetypal Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus), Gram-negative (Acinetobacter baumannii), and fungal (Candida albicans) pathogens was tested following exposure of the macrophages to the lipoglycopeptide antibiotic oritavancin. Oritavancin did not affect killing of C. albicans but markedly enhanced killing of S. aureus by both macrophages. Oritavancin modestly reduced killing of A. baumannii by HL-60 cells but not by RAW 264.7 cells. Thus, macrophage killing of microbes remains intact despite substantial intracellular accumulation with a lipoglycopeptide antibiotic.
TI  - A comparative study of the bactericidal activity and daily disinfection housekeeping surfaces by a new portable pulsed UV radiation device.
AB  - Daily cleaning and disinfecting of non-critical surfaces in the patient-care areas are known to reduce the occurrence of health care-associated infections. However, the conventional means for decontamination of housekeeping surfaces of sites of frequent hand contact such as manual disinfection using ethanol wipes are laborious and time-consuming in daily practice. This study evaluated a newly developed portable pulsed ultraviolet (UV) radiation device for its bactericidal activity in comparison with continuous UV-C, and investigated its effect on the labor burden when implemented in a hospital ward. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Amikacin and Ciprofloxacin-resistant A. baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Methicillin-resistant S. aureus and Bacillus cereus were irradiated with pulsed UV or continuous UV-C. Pulsed UV and continuous UV-C required 5 and 30 s of irradiation, respectively, to attain bactericidal activity with more than 2Log growth inhibition of all the species. The use of pulsed UV in daily disinfection of housekeeping surfaces reduced the working hours by half in comparison to manual disinfection using ethanol wipes. The new portable pulsed UV radiation device was proven to have a bactericidal activity against critical nosocomial bacteria, including antimicrobial-resistant bacteria after short irradiation, and was thus found to be practical as a method for disinfecting housekeeping surfaces and decreasing the labor burden.
TI  - Application of ventilator care bundle and its impact on ventilator associated pneumonia incidence rate in the adult intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To reduce ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) incidence rate, lessen the cost of care, and correlate VAP bundles compliance with VAP incidence rate. METHODS: This study was a prospective longitudinal study conducted on adult intensive care unit (ICU) patients at Hera General Hospital, Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from January to December 2010. The following Institute for Healthcare Improvement VAP prevention bundle was applied: head-of-bed elevation; daily sedation-vacation along with a readiness-to-wean assessment; peptic ulcer disease (PUD) prophylaxis; and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) prophylaxis. RESULTS: Among a total of 2747 patients, the bundle compliance rate in January 2010 was 30%, and reached to 100% in December 2010, while the overall rate was 78.9%. The individual bundle compliance rates were as follows: head-of-bed elevation - 99.9%; daily sedation vacation - 88.9%; PUD prophylaxis - 94.9%; and DVT prophylaxis - 85.7%. At the beginning, VAP rate was 2.5/1000 ventilator days, and reduced to 0.54 in the next month. The overall VAP incidence rate in 2010 was found to be 1.98 with a reduction of 1.41 by comparing with the same data of year 2009 collected retrospectively. The total reduction cost in one year was $154,930. A significant correlation was found between the VAP rate and its bundle compliance (p=0.001). Most frequent pathogens found were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (30.8% of all isolates) followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (27.7%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (15.4%). CONCLUSION: Application of VAP prevention bundle reduced the VAP incidence rate and lowered the cost of care.
TI  - Biofilms on environmental surfaces: evaluation of the disinfection efficacy of a  novel steam vapor system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Environmental surfaces in health care settings are often contaminated by microorganisms, and biofilms can develop on the surfaces in these settings. Steam vapor technology is of potential use for disinfection of biofilms on the environmental surfaces. METHODS: We tested the disinfection efficacy of a thermal-accelerated nanocrystal sanitation (TANCS)-equipped steam vapor technology against biofilms through disinfecting biofilms developed by 4 bacterial strains-Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus-on an identical test surface (ie, polycarbonate) and biofilms developed by E coli on 4 different test surfaces: polycarbonate, rubber, stainless steel, and ceramics. RESULTS: Our data show that a 3-second steam treatment rapidly killed each biofilm tested (>99.95 % killing efficiency). For biofilms developed on different surfaces, 3-second steam treatment achieved 99.95% killing of E coli biofilms developed on different surfaces. Compared with chemical disinfection, steam treatment for <1 second a similar level of biofilm disinfection as provided by incubation with 10-ppm sodium hypochlorite (bleach) for 10-20 minutes of contact time. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that the TANCS-equipped steam vapor disinfection is an emerging and potentially useful technology for disinfecting biofilms on environmental surfaces.
TI  - [Development status of new antibacterials].
AB  - The increase of the infections caused by multi-drug-resistant bacteria is a serious problem worldwide. As for Gram-positive bacteria, the community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin- or linezolid-resistant strains have been increasing. As for Gram-negative bacteria, multi-drug-resistant strains of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii have been increasing due to the carbapenemase production recently. During these 10 years, various types of novel antibacterials targeted for Gram-positive bacteria have been approved in US and EU, but not in Japan. On the other hand, the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for Gram-negative bacteria is still immature. In this review, the status of the discovery of new antibacterials targeted for these multi-drug-resistant bacteria will be reviewed.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE organisms: cause, clinical features, and management.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite important geographical variations, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens constitute more than 80% of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) episodes. Their clinical importance relies on their virulence and ability in developing mechanisms to decrease susceptibility to antimicrobials, increasing inappropriate therapy and affecting negatively on ICU patients' outcome. This review updates information on VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens. RECENT FINDINGS: Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP may be clinically similar to that caused by susceptible strains, it is associated with poorer outcomes despite adequate treatment. Local colonization determines treatment options. The contribution of tracheobronchitis is an important issue. Minimum inhibitory concentration should be considered for nonfermentative Gram-negative bacteria VAP to prescribe extended infusion beta-lactam treatment due to an increase of resistant strains. Strategies promoting antimicrobial diversity may protect against emergence and spread of resistance by ESKAPE pathogens. SUMMARY: VAP due to ESKAPE pathogens represents a global challenge that can be prevented using stewardship programmes promoting diversity.
TI  - Porphyrin-cellulose nanocrystals: a photobactericidal material that exhibits broad spectrum antimicrobial activity.
AB  - Towards our overall objectives of developing potent antimicrobial materials to combat the escalating threat to human health posed by the transmission of surface-adhering pathogenic bacteria, we have investigated the photobactericidal activity of cellulose nanocrystals that have been modified with a porphyrin-derived photosensitizer (PS). The ability of these previously synthesized porphyrin-cellulose-nanocrystals (CNC-Por (1)) to mediate bacterial photodynamic inactivation was investigated as a function of bacterial strain, incubation time and illumination time. Despite forming an insoluble suspension, CNC-Por (1) showed excellent efficacy toward the photodynamic inactivation of Acinetobacter baumannii, multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), with the best results achieving 5-6 log units reduction in colony forming units (CFUs) upon illumination with visible light (400-700 nm; 118 J cm(-2)). CNC-Por (1) mediated the inactivation of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, although at reduced activity (2-3 log units reduction). Confocal laser scanning microscopy of CNC-Por (1) after incubation with A. baumannii or S. aureus suggested a lack of internalization of the PS. Research into alternative materials such as CNC-Por (1) may lead to their application in hospitals and healthcare-related industries wherein novel materials with the capability of reducing the rates of transmission of a wide range of bacteria, particularly antibiotic resistant strains, are desired.
TI  - [Investigation and analysis of nosocomial infection in neonates].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the incidence of nosocomial infections of newborn infants in neonates and to explore the risk factors and strategies of infection control. METHODS: There were 433 confirmed cases of nosocomial infection in the neonatal ward of the authors' hospital from January 2007 to December 2009. Their data of epidemiological and clinical characteristics, results of etiological examinations and antibiotic resistance were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: During the study, the number of hospitalizations were 6437. Nosocomial infection occurred in 433 patients 513 times. The overall nosocomial infection rate was 6.82%. The overall hospitalization days were 73 663 and nosocomial infection patient-day rates were 6.96 per thousand. The VAP infection rate was 28.7 per thousand. The CRBSI rate was 3.5 per thousand. Gestational age (OR = 1.049), mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.810), umbilical vein catheter (OR = 1.106), hospitalization days (OR = 1.081), premature rupture of membrane (OR = 1.433) were the risk factors for the development of nosocomial infection. There were 197 (38.4%) cases of pneumonia, which was the most common nosocomial infection in Neonatal Ward. There were 129 cases of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which accounts for 65.5% of pneumonia and 24.4% of cases treated with ventilator. The next was sepsis, 124 cases (24.2%) and 64 cases of diarrheal disease (12.7%). One hundred and eighty two (54.4%) strains of isolates were Gram-negative bacteria, which accounted for the highest proportion. The predominant pathogens of Gram-negative bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (8.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.2%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.8%) and Escherichia coli (4.8%). The isolation rates of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli with positive extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) were 91.4% and 75%, respectively. Those two bacteria were universally resistant to cephalosporins. The rate of resistance to imipenem of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were 1.5%, 11.1% and 41.7%. The isolation rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococcus were 28.6% and 95.5%. CONCLUSION: It is important to identify the high risk factors for nosocomial infections in newborn infants. To shorten time for mechanical ventilation and hospitalization days, removal of the central venous catheter as early as possible would be conducive to reducing the morbidity of nosocomial infection. The main pathogens were Gram-negative bacteria. The multidrug resistance of Enterobacteriaceae and Non-fermenters is serious.
TI  - Cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin as novel biofilm inhibitors?
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The colonization of indwelling medical devices and subsequent biofilm formation represents a global challenge since it promotes the persistence of infection and contributes to antimicrobial resistance. The aim of this study was to determine the antimicrobial activity of cerium, chitosan and hamamelitannin against usual microbial colonizers and to assess their efficacy regarding biofilm formation on polyurethane (PUR)-like catheters. METHODS: The antimicrobial and anti-biofilm effect of cerium nitrate, low molecular weight chitosan (LMWC) and hamamelitannin was tested against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Candida albicans strains. Biofilm formation was assessed with PUR-like catheter segments and the metabolic activity was quantified by colorimetry with a tetrazolium reduction assay. RESULTS: Cerium nitrate and LMWC inhibited the microbial growth of all microbial strains tested; hamamelitannin showed no inhibition. Regarding biofilm formation on PUR-like catheters, with subinhibitory concentrations: cerium nitrate significantly inhibited the metabolic activity of C. albicans; LMWC reduced the metabolic activity of S. epidermidis and C. albicans; and hamamelitannin decreased the metabolic activity of all tested bacteria, but not of yeasts. CONCLUSIONS: The microbicidal activity of cerium nitrate and LMWC was clearly demonstrated in this study, as was their fungistatic effect at lower concentrations. Hamamelitannin significantly reduced biofilm metabolic activity of all tested bacteria. These microbial inhibitors may play a promising role regarding different biomedical applications.
TI  - New heterocyclic compounds from 1,2,4-triazole and 1,3,4-thiadiazole class bearing diphenylsulfone moieties. Synthesis, characterization and antimicrobial activity evaluation.
AB  - Some new 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-4-(R)-2H-1,2,4-triazol-3(4H)-thiones 4a,b; 5a,b and 5-(4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl)-N-(R)-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-amines 6a,b; 7a,b were obtained by cyclization of new N(1)-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoyl]-N(4)-(R)-thiosemicarbazides 2a,b; 3a,b (X=H, Br). The 1,2,4-triazoles were synthesized by intramolecular cyclization of acylthiosemicarbazides, in basic media. On the other hand, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles were obtained from same acylthiosemicarbazides, in acidic media. These new intermediates from thiosemicarbazide class were afforded by the reaction of 4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)benzoic acids hydrazides (X=H, Br) 1a,b with 4-trifluoromethoxyphenyl or 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl isothiocyanate. The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H NMR, (13)C NMR, MS and elemental analysis. All the new compounds were screened for their antimicrobial activity against some bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923, Bacillus cereus ATCC 13061, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Enterobacter cloacae ATCC 49141, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606 and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853) and yeasts (Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida parapsilosis ATCC 22019).
TI  - Efficacy, efficiency and safety aspects of hydrogen peroxide vapour and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide room disinfection systems.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This was a head-to-head comparison of two hydrogen-peroxide-based room decontamination systems. AIM: To compare the efficacy, efficiency and safety of hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV; Clarus R, Bioquell, Andover, U.K.) and aerosolized hydrogen peroxide (aHP; SR2, Sterinis, now supplied as Glosair, Advanced Sterilization Products (ASP), Johnson & Johnson Medical Ltd, Wokingham, U.K.) room disinfection systems. METHOD: Efficacy was tested using 4- and 6-log Geobacillus stearothermophilus biological indicators (BIs) and in-house prepared test discs containing approximately 10(6) meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile and Acinetobacter baumannii. Safety was assessed by detecting leakage of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held detector. Efficiency was assessed by measuring the level of hydrogen peroxide using a hand-held sensor at three locations inside the room, 2 h after the start of the cycles. FINDINGS: HPV generally achieved a 6-log reduction, whereas aHP generally achieved less than a 4-log reduction on the BIs and in-house prepared test discs. Uneven distribution was evident for the aHP system but not the HPV system. Hydrogen peroxide leakage during aHP cycles with the door unsealed, as per the manufacturer's operating manual, exceeded the short-term exposure limit (2 ppm) for more than 2 h. When the door was sealed with tape, as per the HPV system, hydrogen peroxide leakage was <1 ppm for both systems. The mean concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the room 2 h after the cycle started was 1.3 [standard deviation (SD) 0.4] ppm and 2.8 (SD 0.8) ppm for the four HPV and aHP cycles, respectively. None of the readings were <2 ppm for the aHP cycles. CONCLUSION: The HPV system was safer, faster and more effective for biological inactivation.
TI  - Garlic ointment inhibits biofilm formation by bacterial pathogens from burn wounds.
AB  - When thermal injury damages the skin, the physical barrier protecting underlying  tissues from invading micro-organisms is compromised and the host's immune system becomes supressed, facilitating colonization and infection of burn wounds with micro-organisms. Within the wound, bacteria often develop biofilms, which protect the bacteria from the immune response and enhance their resistance to antibiotics. As the prophylactic use of conventional antibiotics drives selection of drug-resistant strains, the use of novel agents to prevent biofilm formation by wound pathogens is essential. In the present study, we utilized our recently developed in vitro wound biofilm model to examine the antibiofilm activity of garlic (Allium sativum). Wound pathogens were inoculated on sterile cellulose discs, exposed to formulated garlic ointment (GarO) or ointment base, and incubated to allow biofilm development. Biofilms were quantified and visualized microscopically. GarO prevented biofilm development by Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and caused a 2-5 log reduction of the bioburden within Enterococcus faecalis biofilms. Additionally, GarO disrupted partially developed biofilms produced by S. aureus, S. epidermidis and A. baumannii. The antistaphylococcal activity of GarO was stable for over 3 months at room temperature. Thus, GarO could be used as a prophylactic therapy to prevent wound biofilms caused by both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria from forming, and may be a potential therapy for disrupting established staphylococcal biofilms.
TI  - Repeat 2-stage exchange for infected total hip arthroplasty: a viable option?
AB  - We investigated whether performing a repeat 2-stage exchange eradicates infection in patients who previously underwent 2-stage treatment for an infected total hip arthroplasty. We identified 15 patients who had failed a 2-stage total hip arthroplasty and underwent a planned repeat 2-stage between 2000 and 2009. Of the 15 patients, 8 were treated with a complete 2-stage procedure, whereas the remaining 7 patients were treated only with a first-stage resection of the infected implant. Of the 8 patients who underwent complete 2-stage exchange, 1 died because of in-hospital complications, and 1 had a recurrent infection. Repeat infection is highly associated with resistant organisms, obesity, and poor patient health. Of the 7 patients who underwent resection without reimplantation, 3 had a recurrent infection. Our data suggest that if infection can be adequately controlled after repeat resection of the joint prosthesis, reimplantation is a reasonable option.
TI  - Polymicrobial abdominal wall necrotizing fasciitis after cesarean section.
AB  - We report a case of a previously healthy woman after an uneventful caesarean section who developed polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis. She was given a non-steroidal anti-inflamatory drug (NSAID) after her delivery. Her post-delivery course was complicated by septic shock, and required multiple debridements before abdominal reconstruction. This case describes the increased risk of necrotizing fasciitis with NSAID use. Unusual were the organisms causing the polymicrobial necrotizing fasciitis: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter agglomerans, Acinetobacter baumannii, and two strains of Enterobacter cloacae.
TI  - Trends in the susceptibility of clinically important resistant bacteria to tigecycline: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan study, 2006 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, a nationwide, prospective surveillance during 2006 to 2010, collected a total of 7,793 clinical isolates, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n = 1,834), penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP) (n = 423), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) (n = 219), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 1,141), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1,330), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1,645), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 903), from different specimens from 20 different hospitals in Taiwan. MICs of tigecycline were determined following the criteria of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST-2011). Among drug-resistant Gram-positive pathogens, all of the PRSP isolates were susceptible to tigecycline (MIC(90), 0.03 mug/ml), and only one MRSA isolate (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and three VRE isolates (MIC(90), 0.125 mug/ml) were nonsusceptible to tigecycline. Among the Gram-negative bacteria, the tigecycline susceptibility rates were 99.65% for ESBL-producing E. coli (MIC(90), 0.5 mug/ml) and 96.32% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (MIC(90), 2 mug/ml) when interpreted by FDA criteria but were 98.7% and 85.8%, respectively, when interpreted by EUCAST-2011 criteria. The susceptibility rate for A. baumannii (MIC(90), 4 mug/ml) decreased from 80.9% in 2006 to 55.3% in 2009 but increased to 73.4% in 2010. A bimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-susceptible A. baumannii isolates, and a unimodal MIC distribution was found among carbapenem-nonsusceptible A. baumannii isolates. In Taiwan, tigecycline continues to have excellent in vitro activity against several major clinically important drug-resistant bacteria, with the exception of A. baumannii.
TI  - Transfer of multidrug-resistant bacteria to healthcare workers' gloves and gowns  after patient contact increases with environmental contamination.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of environmental contamination in the transmission  of multidrug-resistant bacteria to healthcare workers' clothing. DESIGN: Prospective cohort. SETTING: Six intensive care units at a tertiary care hospital. SUBJECTS: Healthcare workers including registered nurses, patient care technicians, respiratory therapists, occupational/physical therapists, and physicians. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: One hundred twenty of 585 (20.5%) healthcare worker/patient interactions resulted in contamination of healthcare workers' gloves or gowns. Multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii contamination occurred most frequently, 55 of 167 observations (32.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI] 25.8% to 40.0%), followed by multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 15 of 86 (17.4%; 95% CI 9.4% to 25.4%), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, 25 of 180 (13.9%, 95% CI 8.9, 18.9%) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 21 of 152 (13.8%; 95% CI 8.3% to 19.2%). Independent risk factors associated with healthcare worker contamination with multidrug-resistant bacteria were positive environmental cultures (odds ratio [OR] 4.2; 95% CI 2.7-6.5), duration in room for >5 mins (OR 2.0; 95% CI 1.2-3.4), performing physical examinations (OR 1.7; 95% CI 1.1-2.8), and contact with the ventilator (OR 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1-2.8). Pulsed field gel electrophoresis determined that 91% of healthcare worker isolates were related to an environmental or patient isolate. CONCLUSIONS: The contamination of healthcare workers' protective clothing during routine care of patients with multidrug-resistant organisms is most frequent with A. baumannii. Environmental contamination was the major determinant of transmission to healthcare workers' gloves or gowns. Compliance with contact precautions and more aggressive environmental cleaning may decrease transmission.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds.
AB  - The antibiotic-resistant bacteria are a major concern to wound care because of their ability to resist many of the antibiotics used today to treat infections. Consequently, other antimicrobials, in particular ionic silver, are considered ideal topical agents for effectively helping to manage and prevent local infections. Little is known about the antimicrobial efficacy of ionic silver on antibiotic-resistant bacteria at different pH values. Consequently, in this study our aim was to evaluate the effect of pH on the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate (SA) and a silver carboxymethyl cellulose (SCMC) dressing on antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria, including Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MDR Vibrio sp, MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, extended-spectrum ss-lactamase (ESBL) producing Salmonella sp, ESBL producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, ESBL producing Proteus mirabilis, ESBL producing Escherichia coli and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii, routinely isolated from burn wounds were used in the study and evaluated for their susceptibility to two silver containing wound dressings using a standardised antimicrobial efficacy screening assay [corrected zone of inhibition (CZOI)]. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-positive isolates at a pH of 5.5 were very similar for both dressings. A mean CZOI of 5 mm was recorded for the SCMC dressing, which was slightly higher, at 5.4 mm for the SA dressing. At a pH of 7.0 both dressings, in general, showed a similar activity. However, at a pH of 8.5 the mean CZOI of the SCMC dressing was found to be significantly (P < 0.05) higher than the SA dressing for a select number of isolates. The mean overall CZOI for the Gram-negative bacteria followed a similar pattern as observed with the Gram-positive bacteria. Susceptibility to silver ions did vary significantly between genera and species of bacteria. Interestingly, when pH was changed from 8.5 to 5.5 antimicrobial activity for both dressings in general increased significantly (P < 0.05). Overall, all forty-nine antibiotic-resistant bacteria isolated from burn wounds showed susceptibility to the antimicrobial activity of both silver containing wound dressings over all pH ranges. In addition, the study showed that the performance of both dressings apparently increased when pH became more acidic. The findings in this study may help to further enhance our knowledge of the role pH plays in affecting both bacterial susceptibility and antimicrobial activity of silver containing wound dressings.
TI  - Inhibition of bacterial growth and biofilm production by constituents from Hypericum spp.
AB  - Biofilm embedded bacterial pathogens such as Staphylococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are difficult to eradicate and are major sources of bacterial infections. New drugs are needed to combat these pathogens. Hypericum is a plant genus that contains species known to have antimicrobial properties. However, the specific constituents responsible for the antimicrobial properties are not entirely known, nor have most compounds been tested as inhibitors of biofilm development. The investigation presented here tested seven secondary metabolites isolated from the species Hypericum densiflorum, Hypericum ellipticum, Hypericum prolificum, and Hypericum punctatum as inhibitors of bacterial growth and biofilm production. Assays were conducted against Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, clinical methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Five of the seven compounds demonstrated growth inhibition against the Gram-positive bacteria with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) ranging from 1.95 microg/mL to 7.81 microg/mL. Four of the secondary metabolites inhibited biofilm production by certain Gram-positive strains at sub-MIC concentrations.
TI  - Agreement assessment of tigecycline susceptibilities determined by the disk diffusion and broth microdilution methods among commonly encountered resistant bacterial isolates: results from the Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, 2008 to 2010.
AB  - The Tigecycline In Vitro Surveillance in Taiwan (TIST) study, initiated in 2006,  is a nationwide surveillance program designed to longitudinally monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline against commonly encountered drug-resistant bacteria. This study compared the in vitro activity of tigecycline against 3,014 isolates of clinically important drug-resistant bacteria using the standard broth microdilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; n = 759), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VRE; n = 191), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (n = 602), ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 736), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 726) that had been collected from patients treated between 2008 and 2010 at 20 hospitals in Taiwan. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted according to the currently recommended U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) criteria and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. The MIC(90) values of tigecycline against MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii were 0.5, 0.125, 0.5, 2, and 8 mug/ml, respectively. The total error rates between the two methods using the FDA criteria were high: 38.4% for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and 33.8% for A. baumannii. Using the EUCAST criteria, the total error rate was also high (54.6%) for A. baumannii isolates. The total error rates between these two methods were <5% for MRSA, VRE, and ESBL-producing E. coli. For routine susceptibility testing of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii against tigecycline, the broth microdilution method should be used because of the poor correlation of results between these two methods.
TI  - Luminescent-activated transfected killer cells to monitor leukocyte trafficking during systemic bacterial and fungal infection.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Activated transfected killer (ATAK) cells are immortal phagocytes transfected with a luminescence reporter that effectively treat lethal infections in neutropenic mice. Their in vivo trafficking, lifespan, and immunogenicity are unknown. METHODS: Mice were made neutropenic; infected or not with Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida albicans, or Aspergillus fumigatus; and treated intraperitoneally with ATAK cells. Cell trafficking and lifespan were assessed by in vivo imaging and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: In uninfected neutropenic mice, ATAK cells spread from the mesentery into visceral organs on days 1-3. Splenic accumulation of ATAK cells increased at day 1 after infection with S. aureus and A. baumannii, and kidney accumulation increased in mice infected with C. albicans. Lung accumulation was seen at day 3 in mice infected by inhalation with A. fumigatus. By day 8, coincident with increasing anti-ATAK antibodies, luminescence signal was lost and there was no detectable mRNA transcription from ATAK cells. CONCLUSIONS: ATAK cells accumulated in target organs with distinct profiles, depending on the microbial etiology of infection. Finally, generation of an anti-ATAK immune response may provide an important safety mechanism that helps clear the cells from the host as the marrow recovers.
TI  - Inactivation of bacterial opportunistic skin pathogens by nonthermal DC-operated  afterglow atmospheric plasma.
AB  - AIMS: Multidrug-resistant opportunistic pathogens are clinically significant and  require the development of new antimicrobial methods. In this study, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus cells were exposed to atmospheric plasma on agar plates and in vitro on porcine skin for the purpose of testing bacterial inactivation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Microbial inactivation at varying exposure durations was tested using a nonthermal plasma jet generated with a DC voltage from ambient air. The observed reduction in colony forming units was quantified as log(10) reductions. CONCLUSIONS: Direct plasma exposure significantly inactivated seeded bacterial cells by approx. 6 log(10) on agar plates and 2-3 log(10) on porcine skin. On agar plates, an indirect 'bystander' inactivation outside the plasma delivery area was also observed. The reduced inactivation observed on the skin surface was most likely due to cell protection by the variable surface architecture. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Atmospheric plasma has potential for clinical application as a disinfectant of patient skin and medically relevant surfaces.
TI  - Effectiveness and limitations of hand hygiene promotion on decreasing healthcare-associated infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Limited data describe the sustained impact of hand hygiene programs (HHPs) implemented in teaching hospitals, where the burden of healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) is high. We use a quasi-experimental, before and after, study design with prospective hospital-wide surveillance of HAIs to assess the cost effectiveness of HHPs. METHODS AND FINDINGS: A 4-year hospital-wide HHP, with particular emphasis on using an alcohol-based hand rub, was implemented in April 2004 at a 2,200-bed teaching hospital in Taiwan. Compliance was measured by direct observation and the use of hand rub products. Poisson regression analyses were employed to evaluate the densities and trends of HAIs during the preintervention (January 1999 to March 2004) and intervention (April 2004 to December 2007) periods. The economic impact was estimated based on a case-control study in Taiwan. We observed 8,420 opportunities for hand hygiene during the study period. Compliance improved from 43.3% in April 2004 to 95.6% in 2007 (p<.001), and was closely correlated with increased consumption of the alcohol-based hand rub (r = 0.9399). The disease severity score (Charlson comorbidity index) increased (p = .002) during the intervention period. Nevertheless, we observed an 8.9% decrease in HAIs and a decline in the occurrence of bloodstream, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extensively drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and intensive care unit infections. The intervention had no discernable impact on HAI rates in the hematology/oncology wards. The net benefit of the HHP was US$5,289,364, and the benefit-cost ratio was 23.7 with a 3% discount rate. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of a HHP reduces preventable HAIs and is cost effective.
TI  - Activity of tigecycline and comparators against skin and skin structure pathogens: global results of the Tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial, 2004-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This analysis from the global Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) reports on 24 784 isolates collected from integumentary culture sources between 2004 and 2009. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and susceptibility were determined according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines (US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints applied against tigecycline). RESULTS: All methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were susceptible to tigecycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. MIC(90)s for tigecycline against Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium ranged between 0.12 mg/l and 0.25mg/l. Resistance to the carbapenems and tigecycline was low among the Enterobacteriaceae, with resistance at </= 2.0% between 2004 and 2009 for tigecycline against Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, and Serratia marcescens, for imipenem against E. coli and Enterobacter spp, and for meropenem against E. coli, Enterobacter spp, and S. marcescens. Against the Acinetobacter baumannii collected in 2009, resistance to amikacin, ceftazidime, levofloxacin, meropenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam was >30%; between 2004 and 2009 resistance to minocycline varied between 1.4% and 4.8%, and tigecycline MIC(90)s were </= 2mg/l. Against the Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected, MIC(90)s were greater than the susceptibility breakpoint for cefepime, ceftazidime, imipenem, levofloxacin, and meropenem. CONCLUSIONS: The problem of antimicrobial resistance is demonstrated by the data presented. T.E.S.T. continues to provide valuable information on antimicrobial resistance globally.
TI  - Antimicrobial acrylic materials with in situ generated silver nanoparticles.
AB  - Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) is widely used to treat traumatic head injuries (cranioplasty) and orthopedic injuries (bone cement), but there is a problem with implant-centered infections. With organisms such as Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus developing resistance to antibiotics, there is a need for novel antimicrobial delivery mechanisms without risk of developing resistant organisms. OBJECTIVES: To develop a novel antimicrobial implant material by generating silver nanoparticles (AgNP) in situ in PMMA. RESULTS: All PMMA samples with AgNP's (AgNP-PMMA) released Ag(+) ions in vitro for over 28 days. In vitro antimicrobial assays revealed that these samples (even samples with the slowest release rate) inhibited 99.9% of bacteria against four different strains of bacteria. Long-term antimicrobial assay showed a continued antibacterial effect past 28 days. Some AgNP-loaded PMMA groups had comparable Durometer-D hardness (a measure of degree of cure) and modulus to control PMMA, but all experimental groups had slightly lower ultimate transverse strengths. CONCLUSIONS: AgNP-PMMA demonstrated a tremendously broad-spectrum and long-intermediate-term antimicrobial effect with comparable mechanical properties to control PMMA. Current efforts are focused on further improving mechanical properties by reducing AgNP loading and assessing fatigue properties. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Herpes simplex activation prolongs recovery from severe burn injury and increases bacterial infection risk.
AB  - Recovery from severe burn injury is complicated by infections that are result of  immune suppression created by massive inflammatory states. One indication of immune suppression may be activation of viruses like herpes simplex virus (HSV), which may negatively impact recovery. A 5-year retrospective review was performed of adult patients with >/=30% TBSA burn injury. TBSA burn injury, length of hospital stay, ventilator days, mortality, and cultures were reviewed. Twenty-one patients had cutaneous HSV activation (HSV+) and 50 did not (HSV-). Age (44.2 vs 39.8 years) and TBSA burn injury (45.9 vs 45.5%) did not differ between the groups. Length of hospital stay (60.9 vs 39.8 days, P < .05) and ventilator days (34.9 vs 22.2 days, P < .05) were greater in HSV+ patients. HSV activation increased hospital stay (odds ratio [OR] 1.6, confidence interval [CI] 1.08-2.39, P < .05) and mechanical ventilation (OR 1.02, CI 1.00-1.05, P < .05). HSV activation increased the risk of developing positive Acinetobacter baumannii pulmonary cultures (OR 6.4, CI 1.8-22.3, P < .05) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus wound cultures (OR 3.3, CI 1.2-9.6, P < .05). HSV activation also increased the risk of developing any positive A. baumannii cultures (OR 9.1, CI 1.9-44, P < .05). HSV activation during severe burn injury is associated with increased length of mechanical ventilation and hospital stay. In addition, these patients have an increased risk of infections from opportunistic bacteria.
TI  - Antibiosis of vineyard ecosystem fungi against food-borne microorganisms.
AB  - Fermentation extracts from fungi isolated from vineyard ecosystems were tested for antimicrobial activities against a set of test microorganisms, including five food-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus EP167, Acinetobacter baumannii (clinically isolated), Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Escherichia coli O157:H7 (CECT 5947) and Candida albicans MY1055) and two probiotic bacteria (Lactobacillus plantarum LCH17 and Lactobacillus brevis LCH23). A total of 182 fungi was grown in eight different media, and the fermentation extracts were screened for antimicrobial activity. A total of 71 fungi produced extracts active against at least one pathogenic microorganism, but not against any probiotic bacteria. The Gram-positive bacterium S. aureus EP167 was more susceptible to antimicrobial fungi broth extracts than Gram-negative bacteria and pathogenic fungi. Identification of active fungi based on internal transcribed spacer rRNA sequence analysis revealed that species in the orders Pleosporales, Hypocreales and Xylariales dominated. Differences in antimicrobial selectivity were observed among isolates from the same species. Some compounds present in the active extracts were tentatively identified by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Antimicrobial metabolites produced by vineyard ecosystem fungi may potentially limit colonization and spoilage of food products by food-borne pathogens, with minimal effect on probiotic bacteria.
TI  - [In vitro evaluation of bactericidal activity of an over-heated saturated dry atomized steam electro-medical device on inert contaminated surfaces].
AB  - Surface disinfection together with cleaning practises and aseptic procedures are  established measures for effective prevention of infectious diseases reducing infection risks. In this study, we evaluated the bactericidal effectiveness in vitro of the electro-medical device Sani System, an over-heated saturated dry-steam disinfection system, against predetermined bacterial load dried on inert surfaces. In particular we have tested different materials, representative of operating rooms furnishing and walls commonly used in healthcare setting, with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii. As a result of treatment, the mean bacterial load on all the test surfaces was reduced by a factor of 102 in the contact plate experimental study and by a factor of 10 in the total bioburden experimental study. The Sani System Polti proved to be efficacious in killing 100% of the bacteria in all experimental conditions, therefore it could help to reduce the risk of spreading nosocomial infections in healthcare facilities.
TI  - Effectiveness of low-temperature domestic laundry on the decontamination of healthcare workers' uniforms.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most professionals in the healthcare environment wear uniforms. For the purpose of this study, we concentrated on nurses' uniforms. In the United Kingdom, many nurses are expected to launder their uniforms at home by using a domestic washing machine that frequently has low-temperature wash cycles. We have investigated whether the use of low-temperature wash cycles results in a microbiologically acceptable product to wear on the wards. METHODS: We have assessed the bioburden on uniforms before and after laundry and the effectiveness of low-temperature wash cycles and ironing on removal of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii. We did not assess the role of tumble drying. RESULTS: We demonstrate contamination of uniforms by gram-negative bacteria after wash, the removal of MRSA at low-temperature wash cycles in the presence of detergent, and the eradication of gram-negative bacteria after ironing. CONCLUSIONS: Our conclusions are that laundry in a domestic situation at 60 degrees C (140 degrees F) for 10 minutes is sufficient to decontaminate hospital uniforms and reduces the bacterial load by more than 7-log reduction, that items left in the pockets are decontaminated to the same extent, that the addition of either a biological detergent or a nonbiological detergent is beneficial in removing MRSA from experimentally contaminated swatches, and that uniforms become recontaminated with low numbers of principally gram-negative bacteria after laundry but that these are effectively removed by ironing.
TI  - Antimicrobial fibers: therapeutic possibilities and recent advances.
AB  - The emergence of multi-drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (carbapenemase)-producing Enterobacteriaceae is becoming a serious threat. New-generation antimicrobial agents need to be developed. This includes the design of novel antimicrobial compounds and drug-delivery systems. This review provides an introduction into different classes of antimicrobial materials. The main focus is on strategies for the introduction of antimicrobial properties in polymer materials. These can be roughly divided into surface modification, inclusion of antimicrobial compounds that can leach from the polymer, and the introduction of polymer-bound moieties that provide the polymer with antimicrobial properties. One of the main challenges in the development of antimicrobial polymers for the use in contact with human tissue is the concomitant demand of non-cytotoxicity. Current research is strongly focused on the latter aspect.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial studies of silver carbene complexes: activity of free and  nanoparticle carbene formulations against clinical isolates of pathogenic bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Silver carbenes may represent novel, broad-spectrum antimicrobial agents that have low toxicity while providing varying chemistry for targeted applications. Here, the bactericidal activity of four silver carbene complexes (SCCs) with different formulations, including nanoparticles (NPs) and micelles, was tested against a panel of clinical strains of bacteria and fungi that are the causative agents of many skin and soft tissue, respiratory, wound, blood, and nosocomial infections. METHODS: MIC, MBC and multidose experiments were conducted against a broad range of bacteria and fungi. Time-release and cytotoxicity studies of the compounds were also carried out. Free SCCs and SCC NPs were tested against a panel of medically important pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MRAB), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia and Klebsiella pneumoniae. RESULTS: All four SCCs demonstrated strong efficacy in concentration ranges of 0.5-90 mg/L. Clinical bacterial isolates with high inherent resistance to purified compounds were more effectively treated either with an NP formulation of these compounds or by repeated dosing. Overall, the compounds were active against highly resistant bacterial strains, such as MRSA and MRAB, and were active against the biodefence pathogens Bacillus anthracis and Yersinia pestis. All of the medically important bacterial strains tested play a role in many different infectious diseases. CONCLUSIONS: The four SCCs described here, including their development as NP therapies, show great promise for treating a wide variety of bacterial and fungal pathogens that are not easily killed by routine antimicrobial agents.
TI  - Phytochemical constituents and antibacterial efficacy of the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum (DC.) Baker ex Heyne.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the preliminary phytochemistry and antibacterial activity of the flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum . METHODS: Phytochemical analysis was done by using the standard methods given by Harbone. The methanolic flower extract were tested against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Salmonella typhi, Serratia marsecens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter sp., Proteus mirabilis, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes by the agar disc diffusion method. RESULTS: Preliminary phytochemical screening of flower extract showed the presence of phenolic compounds, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins, xanthoproteins, carboxylic acids, coumarins and carbohydrates. The flower extract of Peltophorum pterocarpum showed significant activity against four gram positive (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis and Streptococcus pyogenes) and three gram negative bacteria (Proteus mirabilis, Acinetobacter baumannii and Serratia marsecens), out of 12 pathogenic bacteria studied. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study confirm the presence of significant antibacterial activity against human pathogens in the flowers of Peltophorum pterocarpum.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization, and light-controlled antibiotic application of a composite material derived from polyurethane and silica xerogel with embedded photoactive manganese nitrosyl.
AB  - The synthesis of a light-sensitive polyurethane-based composite material (PUX-NO) is described. In its polyurethane medium, PUX-NO contains entrapped silica xerogel particles in which a photoactive manganese nitrosyl has been incorporated. Green flexible films of PUX-NO readily release nitric oxide (NO) only when exposed to low power (mW) visible light. Incorporation of the nitrosyl in the xerogel not only retains the nitrosyl (NO donor) within the composite material but also provides the right extent of hydration. Pre-swelled films of PUX-NO have water content close to 30 Wt % and such films can be stored for months under slightly moist condition without loss in NO-delivering capacity. The NO-releasing parameters of the film have been determined. The NO-releasing capacity of PUX-NO films can be conveniently altered by changing the amount of the nitrosyl as well as the thickness of the films. Patches of PUX-NO film have been successfully employed to reduce drastically bacterial loads of both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii under the total control of light. Effective control of infections by these bacterial pathogens via delivery of proper doses of NO only to the sites of infection appears feasible with PUX-NO films.
TI  - Evaluation of 4,5-disubstituted-2-aminoimidazole-triazole conjugates for antibiofilm/antibiotic resensitization activity against MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - A library of 4,5-disubstituted-2-aminoimidazole-triazole conjugates (2-AITs) was  synthesized, and the antibiofilm activity was investigated. This class of small molecules was found to inhibit biofilm formation by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) at low-micromolar concentrations; 4,5-disubstituted-2-AITs were also able to inhibit and disperse Acinetobacter baumannii biofilms. The activities of the lead compounds were compared against the naturally occurring biofilm dispersant cis-2-decenoic acid and were revealed to be more potent. The ability of selected compounds to resensitize MRSA to traditional antibiotics (resensitization activity) was also determined. Lead compounds were observed to resensitize MRSA to oxacillin by 2-4-fold.
TI  - Prevention of infections associated with combat-related extremity injuries.
AB  - During combat operations, extremities continue to be the most common sites of injury with associated high rates of infectious complications. Overall, approximately 15% of patients with extremity injuries develop osteomyelitis, and approximately 17% of those infections relapse or recur. The bacteria infecting these wounds have included multidrug-resistant bacteria such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella species and Escherichia coli, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The goals of extremity injury care are to prevent infection, promote fracture healing, and restore function. In this review, we use a systematic assessment of military and civilian extremity trauma data to provide evidence-based recommendations for the varying management strategies to care for combat-related extremity injuries to decrease infection rates. We emphasize postinjury antimicrobial therapy, debridement and irrigation, and surgical wound management including addressing ongoing areas of controversy and needed research. In addition, we address adjuvants that are increasingly being examined, including local antimicrobial therapy, flap closure, oxygen therapy, negative pressure wound therapy, and wound effluent characterization. This evidence-based medicine review was produced to support the Guidelines for the Prevention of Infections Associated With Combat-Related Injuries: 2011 Update contained in this supplement of Journal of Trauma.

TI  - Current review of antimicrobial treatment of nosocomial pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia (including ventilator-associated pneumonia; VAP), a consistently difficult-to-treat entity, is frequently caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) or pandrug-resistant (PDR) bacteria. Given the high mortality rates caused by drug-resistant bacteria and the difficulty of developing new potent antibiotics to target the problematic pathogens, combination regimens are under ardent evaluation as new strategies to overcome increasing drug resistance. Adjustment of the administration method of certain beta-lactams (meropenem, or imipenem/cilastatin), or combination of tigecycline with some agents, may show promise with regard to successful management of MDR or PDR Acinetobacter baumannii pneumonia. Additionally, vancomycin plus rifampicin is an effective regimen against nosocomial pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) responding poorly to vancomycin monotherapy. The clinical appropriateness of parenteral colistin against pneumonia caused by MDR A. baumannii has been established in a clinical trial. Facing the decline of clinical vancomycin efficacy after initial use, linezolid might be the drug of choice with regard to the treatment of MRSA-VAP. The role of tigecycline monotherapy for the management of nosocomial pneumonia caused by MRSA and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae needs to be cautiously evaluated.
TI  - [Changes in the incidence of multiresistant pathogens and its consequences in the intensive care unit].
AB  - Incidence of nosocomial infections and antibiotics resistance in intensive care units is increasing worldwide. Blood-stream infections of Gram-negative non-fermentive bacteria are associated with higher mortality. AIM AND METHODS: The aim of this study was to compare the antibiotic sensitivity of nosocomial blood-stream infections between years 2008-2010. RESULTS: There was no difference in the sensitivity of methycillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta lactamase producing Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli infections between the two years examined. Antibiotic resistance of Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas infections showed a marked increase in 2010 when compared to that found in 2008: there was no multiresistant Acinetobacter infection in samples obtained in 2008, but all these infections were found to be sensitive only to colistin in samples investigated in 2010. Sensitivity of Pseudomonas infections to carbapenems and piperacillin/tazobactam decreased significantly during this time. In addition, the authors found that the mortality of multiresistant Gram-negative blood-stream infections was higher compared to that caused by non-multiresistant bacteria. CONCLUSIONS: These results emphasize the importance of infection control, adequate dosing and timing of antibiotics, and an appropriate number of nurses in intensive care unit.
TI  - Quantification and analysis of airborne bacterial characteristics in a nursing care institution.
AB  - Indoor air quality has become a critical issue because people spend most of their time in the indoor environment. The factors that influence indoor air quality are very important to environmental sanitation and air quality improvement. This study focuses on monitoring air quality, colony counts, and bacteria species of the indoor air of a nursing care institution. The regular colony counts in two different wards range from 55 to 600 cfu m(-3) Regression analysis results indicate that the bacterial colony counts have close correlation with relative humidity or carbon dioxide (CO2) but not with carbon monoxide (CO) or ozone (O3). Real-time PCR was used to quantify the bacterial pathogens of nosocomial infection, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Citrobacter freundii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The most abundant bacteria species in the air of the nursing care institution is E. coli.
TI  - Device-associated infection rates in 398 intensive care units in Shanghai, China: International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) findings.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine device-associated healthcare-associated infection (DA-HAI) rates and the microorganism profile in 398 intensive care units (ICUs) of 70 hospitals in Shanghai, China. METHODS: An open-label, prospective, cohort, active DA-HAI surveillance study was conducted on patients admitted to 398 tertiary-care ICUs in China from September 2004 to December 2009, implementing the methodology developed by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC). The data were collected in the participating ICUs, and uploaded and analyzed at the INICC headquarters on proprietary software. DA-HAI rates were registered by applying the definitions of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). We analyzed the rates of DAI-HAI, ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), and catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), and their microorganism profiles. RESULTS: During the 5 years and 4 months of the study, 391 527 patients hospitalized in an ICU for an aggregate of 3,245,244 days, acquired 20,866 DA-HAIs, an overall rate of 5.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 5.3-5.4) and 6.4 (95% CI 6.3-6.5) infections per 1000 ICU-days. VAP posed the greatest risk (20.8 per 1000 ventilator-days, 95% CI 20.4-21.1), followed by CAUTI (6.4 per 1000 catheter-days, 95% CI 6.3-6.6) and CLABSI (3.1 per 1000 catheter-days, 95% CI 3.0-3.2). The most common isolated microorganism was Acinetobacter baumannii (19.1%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.2%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%). CONCLUSIONS: DA-HAIs in the ICUs of Shanghai pose a far greater threat to patient safety than in ICUs in the USA. This is particularly the case for the VAP rate, which is much higher than the rates found in developed countries. Active infection control programs that carry out infection surveillance and implement prevention guidelines can improve patient safety and must become a priority.
TI  - Epidemiologic characteristics of resistant microorganisms present in reserves from an intensive care unit.
AB  - In this study, significant contamination in the intensive care unit environment was observed (P < .004). Sampling of inanimate surfaces and equipment found vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, ciprofloxacin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and S epidermidis, and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii with similarities (60%-80%) to blood culture isolates.
TI  - Efficacy of point-of-injury combat antimicrobials.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection is a major complication associated with combat-related injuries. One strategy to decrease infections is immediate delivery of antimicrobials at or near the point-of-injury by the casualty or the first medical responder. The 75th Ranger Regiment systematically collects data on prehospital battlefield care, including antimicrobial administration. We review infectious complications and colonization rates associated with delivery of point-of-injury antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed casualty treatment data from the 75th Ranger Regiment prehospital trauma registry on patients injured between March 2003 and March 2010 and linked this to electronic medical record data to look for the presence of bacterial infection or colonization within 30 days of injury. Patient demographics, antimicrobial therapy, and outcomes were evaluated. Assessment of colonization included surveillance screening cultures performed for multidrug-resistant bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, at US military hospitals in the combat zone, Germany, and stateside. RESULTS: Of 405 total casualties, 28 (6.9%) were infected with gram-negative bacteria, primarily A. baumannii. Of those who were not returned to duty or died near the time of injury, 28 of 211 (13.3%) were infected. The only identified risk factor for infection was higher military Injury Severity Score. Prehospital administration of antimicrobials to 113 of 405 casualties (27.9%), including 8 of the 28 infected casualties, did not affect infection or colonization rates. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited by population size, a significant difference in infection rates and multidrug-resistant pathogen colonization was not seen in those casualties who received single-dose broad-spectrum antimicrobials at the point-of-injury, confirming neither benefit nor harm. Overall adherence with initiating point-of-injury antimicrobials was low.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant chronic osteomyelitis complicating war injury in Iraqi civilians.
AB  - BACKGROUND: War-related orthopedic injury is frequently complicated by environmental contamination and delays in management, placing victims at increased risk for long-term infectious complications. We describe, among Iraqi civilians with war-related chronic osteomyelitis, the bacteriology of infection at the time of admission. METHODS: In the Medecins Sans Frontieres Reconstructive Surgery Project in Amman, Jordan, we retrospectively reviewed baseline demographics and results of initial intraoperative surgical cultures among Iraqi civilians with suspected osteomyelitis. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-seven patients (90% male; median age, 35 years [interquartile range {IQR}, 28-46]; median time since initial injury, 19 months [IQR, 10-35]) were admitted with suspected chronic osteomyelitis after war-related injury. One hundred seven patients had a positive intraoperative culture. Before arrival, patients had undergone a median of 4 (IQR, 2-6) surgical procedures in Iraq. Fifty-nine (55%) of 107 patients with confirmed osteomyelitis had a multidrug-resistant (MDR) organism isolated at admission: cefepime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (n = 40), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 16), and MDR Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 3). An association of borderline significance existed between a history of more than two prior surgical procedures in Iraq and an MDR isolate at program entry (multivariate: odds ratio, 5.3; 95% confidence interval, 0.9-30.6; p = 0.064). CONCLUSION: Health care actors, including Iraqi health facilities and humanitarian medical organizations, must be aware of the link between chronic war injury and antimicrobial drug resistance in this region and should be prepared for the management challenges involved with the treatment of chronic drug-resistant osteomyelitis.
TI  - Prolonged triple therapy for persistent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis.
AB  - PURPOSE: A case of persistent multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis successfully treated with a prolonged and novel combination of antimicrobials is reported. SUMMARY: A 38-year-old, 84-kg Caucasian woman with a recent history of craniotomy was admitted with nausea, fever, headache, photophobia, and drainage from her craniotomy incision. She underwent a repeat craniotomy on hospital day 4 with abscess debridement and repair of a cerebrospinal fluid leak. Cultures grew MDR A. baumannii, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus species, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Based on the limited published pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data for colistin, we determined a favorable outcome with i.v. colistin monotherapy was unlikely and decided to treat the patient with simultaneous i.v. and intraventricular colistin, as well as intraventricular tobramycin and i.v. rifampin. She was treated with a total of 36 days of intraventricular colistin, 40 days of intraventricular tobramycin, 51 days of i.v. colistin and rifampin, and 56 days i.v. vancomycin for infection that persisted despite multiple debridements. The patient had subsequent improvement in clinical manifestations and eradication of infection. She was subsequently discharged to an acute rehabilitation facility on hospital day 77 with posttreatment sequelae including mental impairment and renal failure requiring hemodialysis. Follow-up visits revealed significant improvement in her mental status, speech, and strength on the side not affected by the stroke. CONCLUSION: Prolonged combination therapy with intraventricular colistin and tobramycin plus i.v. colistin, rifampin, and vancomycin led to the resolution of a persistent central nervous system infection caused by MDR A. baumannii.
TI  - Incidence, risk stratification, antibiogram of pathogens isolated and clinical outcome of ventilator associated pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The initial empirical therapy of Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (VAP) modified based on the knowledge of local microbiological data is associated with decreased morbidity and mortality. The objective was to find the incidence and risk factors associated with VAP, the implicated pathogens and their susceptibility pattern as well as to assess the final clinical outcome in VAP. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of 107 patients taken on ventilatory support for two or more days and those not suffering from pneumonia prior were to be taken on ventilator. The study was done over a period of one year. VAP was diagnosed using clinical pulmonary infection score of >6. The mortality, incidence of VAP, frequency of different pathogens isolated, their antibiotic sensitivity pattern, duration of mechanical ventilation and duration of hospital stay were assessed. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Univariate analysis, chi(2) test and paired t-test. RESULTS: The incidence of VAP was 28.04%. Mortality in VAP group was 46.67%, while in the non-VAP group was 27.28%. High APACHE II score was associated with a high mortality rate as well as increased incidence of VAP. The most common organisms isolated from endotracheal aspirate of patients who developed VAP were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Most strains of Pseudomonas (55.56%) were resistant to commonly used beta-lactam antibiotics known to be effective against Pseudomonas. All strains of Staphylococcus aureus were MRSA and most isolates of K. pneumoniae (85.71%) were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing. About 50% isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to carbapenems. Mortality was highest for infections caused by A. baumannii (83.33%) and K. pneumoniae (71.42%). CONCLUSIONS: APACHE II score can be used to stratify the risk of development of VAP and overall risk of mortality. Drug-resistant strains of various organisms are an important cause of VAP in our setting.
TI  - [Common antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in nosocomial infections in Taiwan and their prevention].
AB  - Infections caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant strains (MDR) that cause difficulties in clinical treatment, have long been a problem of global concern. Drug-resistant strains of common nosocomial infections in Taiwan include Gram-positive coccal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Gram-negative bacilli such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, among others. About 10 to 20% of Gram-negative bacteria that encode extended-spectrum beta-lactamases are resistant to cephalosporin, a third generation antibiotic, and the fluoroquinolone-resistance rate has continued to increase in recent years. Despite the high mortality rate in patients with infections caused by MDR, the problem is still solvable by blocking or reducing MDR dissemination in addition to proper antibiotics use. Hand hygiene is the simplest, most effective measure for preventing nosocomial infections. However, healthcare workers' adherence to recommended hand hygiene practices is unacceptably low worldwide, making the promotion of hand hygiene a major challenge for infection control experts. Therefore, as a first step of preventing the spread of MDR bacteria, knowledge of hand hygiene and adherence to hand hygiene practices must be required of healthcare workers. Such should help reduce nosocomial infections significantly and upgrade healthcare quality.
TI  - Longitudinal characterization of Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonizing and infecting combat casualties.
AB  - Drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii-calcoaceticus complex, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus colonize and infect combat casualties from Iraq and Afghanistan. We retrospectively evaluated relatedness, by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and antibiotic susceptibility testing, of isolates colonizing and infecting casualties over 2 years. Colonizing organisms were unrelated to isolates producing later infection in up to 27% of cases; most isolates underwent change in antibiotic susceptibilities. The same is true for serial infecting isolates recovered during hospitalization.
TI  - [Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 produced by Enterococcus faecium strain LWP760].
AB  - Antimicrobial activity of bacteriocin S760 (enterocin) produced by Enterococcusfaecium strain LWP760 was studied. Bacteriocin S760 is a cationic, hydrophobic, and heat stable peptide with the molecular weight of 5.5 kDa and pl of 9.8. Enterocin S760 is shown to inhibit in vitro the growth both of sensitive and resistant to antibacterials gramnegative and grampositive bacteria of 25 species. MICs of the bacteriocin S760 vary between 0.05-1.6 mg/l for Escherichia coli 0157:H117, Salmonella typhimurium, Salmonella enteritidis, Campylobacter jejuni, Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens, that are main food-borne pathogens, and from 0.4-1.6 mg/l for Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Corynebacterium diphteriae. It is also active against antibioticresistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Acinetobacter baumannii (with MICs of 0.05-3 mg/l), Klebsiella pneumoniae (with MICs of 6 mg/l), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (with MICs of 0.4-25 mg/1), as well against fungi belonging to species of Candida albicans, Candida krusei and Aspergillus niger (with MICs of 0.1-0.2 mg/l). Enterocin S760 is a novel antimicrobial agents useful in medicine, veterinary and food industry.
TI  - The challenges of antimicrobial drug resistance in Greece.
AB  - Antimicrobial drug resistance rates in Greece are among the highest in Europe. The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative species has increased considerably, including endemic strains in intensive care units. Pandrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are sporadically reported. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus rates are also high in Greek hospitals. Multidrug resistance increases risk of mortality, hospitalization duration and costs, and undermines the medical system. Administrative responses initiated include action plans, monitoring systems, and guidelines. Common terminology among involved parties for defining and grading resistance is required. Multidrug-resistant microorganisms challenge clinical laboratories; uniform recommendations towards detection of resistance mechanisms need to be established. Prospective multicenter outcome studies comparing antibiotic regimens and containment methods are needed. Because new antimicrobials against Gram-negative pathogens are not foreseeable, judicious use of the existing and strict adherence to infection control best practice might restrain resistance spread. Awareness of resistance patterns and organisms prevailing locally by reporting laboratories and treating physicians is important.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibilities of commonly encountered bacterial isolates to fosfomycin determined by agar dilution and disk diffusion methods.
AB  - We studied the antimicrobial activity of fosfomycin against 960 strains of commonly encountered bacteria associated with urinary tract infection using standard agar dilution and disk diffusion methods. Species studied included 3 common species of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia; methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus; and vancomycin-susceptible and resistant Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium. MICs and inhibition zone diameters were interpreted in accordance with both the currently recommended Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) criteria for urinary tract isolates of Escherichia coli and Enterococcus faecalis and the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria for Enterobacteriaceae. Tentative zone diameter interpretive criteria were developed for species not currently published by CLSI or EUCAST. Escherichia coli was uniformly susceptible to fosfomycin, as were most strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. A. baumannii was resistant to fosfomycin, while the prevalence of resistance in P. aeruginosa and S. maltophilia was greatly affected by the choice of MIC breakpoint. New tentative zone diameter criteria for K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, S. aureus, and E. faecium were able to be set, providing some interim laboratory guidance for disk diffusion until further breakpoint evaluations are undertaken by CLSI and EUCAST.
TI  - The role played by contaminated surfaces in the transmission of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - Studies in the 1970s and 1980s suggested that environmental surface contamination played a negligible role in the endemic transmission of healthcare-associated infections. However, recent studies have demonstrated that several major nosocomial pathogens are shed by patients and contaminate hospital surfaces at concentrations sufficient for transmission, survive for extended periods, persist despite attempts to disinfect or remove them, and can be transferred to the hands of healthcare workers. Evidence is accumulating that contaminated surfaces make an important contribution to the epidemic and endemic transmission of Clostridium difficile, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and norovirus and that improved environmental decontamination contributes to the control of outbreaks. Efforts to improve environmental hygiene should include enhancing the efficacy of cleaning and disinfection and reducing the shedding of pathogens. Further high-quality studies are needed to clarify the role played by surfaces in nosocomial transmission and to determine the effectiveness of different interventions in reducing associated infection rates.
TI  - Isolation of Acinetobacter baumannii complex and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus from hospital rooms following terminal cleaning and disinfection: can we do better?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the frequency of isolation of Acinetobacter baumannii complex (ABC) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) from surfaces of rooms newly vacated by patients with multidrug-resistant (MDR) ABC following various rounds of routine terminal cleaning and disinfection (C/D) with bleach or 1 round of C/D followed by hydrogen peroxide vapor (HPV) treatment. SETTING: A 900-bed tertiary care hospital. METHODS: ABC and MRSA cultures were obtained from hospital rooms including 312 rooms (mean, 18.3 sites/room) following 4 rounds of C/D, 37 rooms (mean, 20 sites/room) following 1 round of C/D before and after HPV treatment, and 134 rooms (mean, 20 sites/room) following 1 round of C/D and HPV treatment. RESULTS: Following 4 rounds of C/D, 83 (26.6%) rooms had 1 or more culture-positive sites; 102 (1.8%) sites in 51 (16.4%) rooms grew ABC, and 108 (1.9%) sites in 44 (14.1%) rooms grew MRSA. The addition of HPV treatment to 1 round of C/D resulted in a significant drop in ABC- and MRSA-positive room sites (odds ratio, 0 [95% confidence interval, 0-0.8]; P = .04 for both organisms). Following 1 round of C/D and HPV treatment, 6 (4.5%) rooms were culture-positive for ABC, MRSA, or both. CONCLUSIONS: Routine terminal C/D of hospital rooms vacated by MDRABC-positive patients may be associated with a significant number of ABC- or MRSA-positive room surfaces even when up to 4 rounds of C/D are performed. The addition of HPV treatment to 1 round of C/D appears effective in reducing the number of persistently contaminated room sites in this setting.
TI  - Effect of antibiotic diversity on ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by ESKAPE Organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to test in the clinic whether antimicrobial diversity affects resistance of Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella species, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species (ESKAPE) pathogens in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Three different strategies of empirical antimicrobial prescription for VAP were consecutively implemented in an ICU: patient specific (10 months); scheduling, including sequential quarterly prioritization (12 months) and restriction (12 months) of antimicrobials; and mixing (10 months). Periods were compared, measuring the antimicrobial heterogeneity index (AHI). Incidence and resistance patterns of VAP caused by ESKAPE were compared. RESULTS: Overall, 127 microbiologic VAP episodes were documented. ESKAPE VAP increased significantly during scheduling (AHI, 0.65) compared with patient-specific (AHI, 0.88) and mixing (AHI, 0.87) periods (relative risk, 2.67 and 3.84, respectively). This finding was associated with a significant (P < .05) increase of carbapenem-resistant A baumannii during the scheduling period (15.0%) compared with the patient-specific (2.4%) and mixing (0%) periods. ICU mortality of resistant patients with ESKAPE VAP was doubled that of patients without ESKAPE VAP (relative risk, 2.25; 95% CI, 1.67-9.48). Thirty-day mechanical ventilation-free days was significantly increased (5 days) in patients with resistant ESKAPE VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Antibiotic strategies promoting diversity may prevent the emergence of resistance of ESKAPE organisms, improving use of health-care resources.
TI  - [Analysis of the drug-resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the use of antibiotics in burn wards].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study changes in the drug-resistance of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) and the use of antibiotics in burn wards so as to optimize the use of antibiotic in the future. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from specimens of blood, venous catheter, stool, sputum, urine, wound tissue from 5717 patients hospitalized in our burn wards within the duration of January 2005 to December 2009. The number of specimens examined and positive rates of bacteria were calculated. Changes in constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli, spectrum of bacteria, the drug-resistance rate of PA, and the usage of antibiotics were analyzed. The number of specimens examined, constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli, drug-resistance rate were processed with chi-square test. Bivariate correlation analysis was performed between the usage of antibiotics and the drug-resistance rate. RESULTS: (1) The number of specimens examined showed no statistical difference during the five years (with rates from 73.2% to 76.1%, chi(2) = 5.583, P > 0.05), while constituent ratio of cocci and bacilli showed statistical difference (with ratios from 105:134 to 169:126, chi(2) = 14.806, P < 0.01). The positive rates of bacteria were increasing in the five years. (2) One thousand six hundred and seventy-five strains were identified during the five years from different kinds of specimens, with 29 from blood, 39 from venous catheter, 3 from stool, 157 from sputum, 13 from urine, and 1434 from wound tissue. Among them, Staphylococcus aureus accounted for 28% to 42%, PA accounted for 10% to 25%, Acinetobacter baumannii accounted for 10% to 19%, and they were the predominant strains. (3) The difference among drug-resistance rates of PA to each kind of 12 antibiotics during the five years were statistically significant (with chi(2) values from 47.911 to 308.095, P values all below 0.01). The drug-resistance rates of PA to some antibiotics showed downward trend in the former four years, including amikacin, ceftazidime, and imipenem/cilastatin, but it rebounded in the fifth year. (4) There was descending trend in usage of cefoperazone/sulbactam and levofloxacin, but vancomycin was always used widely. (5) Drug-resistance rates of PA to 7 antibiotics, including amikacin, imipenem/cilastatin, and ciprofloxacin, etc., were positively correlated with usage of various antibiotics (with r values from 0.879 to 0.978, P < 0.05 or P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: In our burn wards, drug-resistant PA was prevalent. Disinfection and isolation measures, appropriate use of antibiotics, etc. can reduce PA infection.
TI  - Bacteriological differences between COPD exacerbation and community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the differences in pathogen distribution and antibiotic susceptibility between patients with COPD exacerbation and patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and develop guidance for antibiotic treatment of those conditions. METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed the medical records of 586 COPD-exacerbation patients and 345 community-acquired-pneumonia patients from January 2007 to December 2008, including sputum culture results, antibiotic susceptibilities of the microorganisms, and clinical characteristics. RESULTS: 276 (47%) of the COPD-exacerbation patients, and 183 (53%) of the community-acquired-pneumonia patients had a positive sputum culture. In order, the most common pathogens in the COPD-exacerbation patients were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Haemophilus influenzae. The most common pathogens in the community-acquired-pneumonia patients were Streptococcus pneumoniae, H. influenzae, K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: P. aeruginosa was the most common pathogen in our patients with COPD exacerbation, and S. pneumoniae was the most common in our patients with community-acquired pneumonia. P. aeruginosa is especially common in the patients with serious or extremely serious COPD.
TI  - Simultaneous detection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa by multiplex PCR.
AB  - A PCR-based assay that can simultaneously detect and differentiate five different types of nosocomial bacterial pathogens was developed. Six pairs of selected primers targeting femA (132 bp) and mecA (310 bp) of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, gltA (722 bp) of Acinetobacter baumannii, phoA (903 bp) of Escherichia coli, mdh (364 bp) of Klebsiella pneumoniae and oprL (504 bp) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were used in this study. The conditions were optimized for the multiplex PCR to ensure specific amplification of the selected targets. Sensitivity and specificity tests were also carried out using a blind test approach on 50 bacterial cultures and resulted in 100% for both positive and negative predictive values.
TI  - Susceptibility of Gram-positive and -negative bacteria to novel nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle technology.
AB  - The rapidly evolving crisis of antibiotic resistance among microorganisms has contributed to the rise of patient morbidity and mortality from nosocomial and community-acquired infections. Therefore, innovative antimicrobial technology targeting mechanisms to which the bacteria are unlikely to evolve resistance is urgently needed. We have previously described a nitric oxide-releasing nanoparticle (NO-np) with efficacy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro and in murine wound and abscess models. Although the prior findings suggest that the NO-np can be a useful therapeutic for skin and soft tissue infections, the antimicrobial spectrum of NO-np has yet to be fully elucidated. In the current study, we investigated the efficacy of a NO-np against several Gram-positive and -negative clinical isolates. We found that the NO-np were uniformly active against all of the Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa clinical isolates examined, including strains that were both sensitive and resistant to commonly used antibiotics. We concluded that the NO-np have the potential to serve as a novel broad spectrum antimicrobial agent.
TI  - Changing pattern of antibiotic susceptibility in intensive care units: ten years  experience of a university hospital.
AB  - The study was performed to assess microorganisms and antibiotic susceptibility patterns during ten years in intensive care units of a University Hospital. Infection Control Committee has active, prospective surveillance in ICUs for thirteen years. Ten years data of ICUs was evaluated retrospectively from surveillance forms. Microorganisms and their antibiotic resistance were recorded according to the years. During ten years, gram negative microorganisms were the most frequent isolated microorganisms from clinical specimens. Acinetobacter baumannii (21.8%), Pseudomonas aerigunosa (16%), Escherichia coli (10.4%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (8%) were the most common gram negative microorganisms. However, Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent gram positive microorganism, the incidence decreased from 18.6% to 4.8% during ten years. Also antibiotic susceptibility of microorganisms changed during ten years. Carbapenem resistance increased from 44% to 92% in A. baumannii and ciprofloxacin resistance increased in E. coli from 28% to 60% and in K. pneumoniae from 21% to 55% during ten years. However, methicilin resistance decreased in S. aureus from 96% to 54%. In conclusion, antibiotic resistance is growing problem in ICUs. Rationale antibiotic policies and infection control measures will prevent the development of resistance.
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing on burn wound isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test the antimicrobial effectiveness of a silver alginate dressing  on opportunistic pathogens, namely meticillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) and meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella spp., Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter sakazakii, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Chryseobacterium indologenes, Proteus vulgaris and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHOD: In total, 40 microorganisms were isolated from patients attending three burn centres in the US and evaluated for their susceptibility to a silver alginate wound dressing, employing a corrected zone of inhibition assay, conducted on Mueller Hinton agar (MHA). RESULTS: The sizes of the corrected zones of inhibition varied between and within genera. For example, all Acinetobacter baumannii strains were found to be sensitive to ionic silver at pH 7, with a mean of 2.8mm, compared with 3.5mm at pH 5.5. The silver alginate dressing also demonstrated activity on all strains of Enterobacter and Escherichia coli, with susceptibility to the silver alginate dressing enhanced at pH 5.5. For Enterococcus spp. the average corrected zone of inhibition at pH 7 was 3.6mm, versus 4.9mm at pH 5.5. All strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing. The average corrected zone of inhibition was 6.9mm at pH 7, compared with 8mm at pH 5.5. For MRSA and Staphylococcus aureus, it ranged from 4.5mm to 7.5mm at pH 7. When the pH was decreased to 5.5, the corrected zone of inhibition increased. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the activity of a silver alginate dressing on a wide range of burn isolates, including antibiotic-resistant bacteria, isolated from three different burn centres in the US. It also highlights the possible importance of pH and its potential effects on antimicrobial performance and microbial susceptibility. However, more extensive testing is required to substantiate this. CONFLICT OF INTEREST: SLP is employed by Advanced Medical Solutions Ltd.
TI  - Activity of a dry mist-generated hydrogen peroxide disinfection system against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the activity of a dry mist-generated hydrogen peroxide (DMHP) system (Sterinis; Gloster Sante Europe, Labege cedex, France) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii. METHODS: McFarland 0.5 suspensions of 2 test bacteria, either pure or containing 5% sterile serum, were prepared and inoculated onto sterile stainless steel disks. Each disk in a Petri dish-with the Petri dish cover either closed or open-was placed in different locations in an intensive care unit room. Quantitative cultures were performed after the cycle. RESULTS: No growth occurred on the disks in the absence of a barrier, except 1 disk containing serum. Existence of a barrier, as a drawer or a covered Petri dish, caused failure in the disinfection activity. The mean reduction in initial log(10) bacterial count was lower for both of the test bacteria in presence of a barrier: 4.44- to 4.70-log(10) colony-forming units (cfu) decrease was observed in absence of a barrier, whereas 1.49- to 3.79-log(10) cfu decrease was observed in presence of a barrier. When the culture results were compared according to organic load content, the mean (+/-standard deviation) reduction of initial contamination in pure and in serum containing MRSA suspensions was 4.25 +/- 1.20- and 3.34 +/- 1.89-log(10) cfu, respectively. The mean (+/-standard deviation) reduction in pure and in serum containing A baumannii suspensions was 4.34 +/- 0.89- and 3.87 +/- 1.26-log(10) cfu, respectively. The differences were statistically significant (P < .001). CONCLUSION: Sterinis was capable of killing MRSA and A baumannii on open surfaces; however, it was not effective in closed or semiclosed areas. Presence of serum also caused failure in the disinfection activity of the system.
TI  - The inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil on drug-resistant bacteria and evaluation of its acute toxicity.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The excessive and irregular use of antibiotics could result in the generation and diffusion of drug-resistant bacteria. The aim of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effect of Zingiber corallinum Hance essential oil (ZCHO) on drug-resistant bacteria, especially on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. MATERIAL/METHODS: Susceptibility testing was used to evaluate the effect of ZCHO on growth inhibition of drug-resistant bacteria by paper disk method. Mice orally administered with ZCHO were used to observe acute toxicity and to determine median lethal dose (LD(5)(0)) of ZCHO. Broth dilution method was used to determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. RESULTS: ZCHO exhibited an obvious inhibitory effect not only on gram-negative drug-resistant bacteria including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii, but also on gram-positive drug-resistant bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus. The ZCHO containing 79% terpinen-4-ol revealed better bacteriostatic effect than ZCHO with 34% terpinen-4-ol. The LD(5)(0) of ZCHO was 1790.427 mg/kg. The MIC and MBC of ZCHO on drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii were 1457.81 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: ZCHO has obvious bacteriostasis and bactericidal effects, especially against drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Therefore, ZCHO is a promising natural bioactive component with antibacterial effect and satisfactory safety due to its low toxicity.
TI  - Microbial isolation and emergence of antimicrobial resistance associated with tigecycline usage.
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing experience of tigecycline usage, its ecological impact on microorganisms raises concerns but remains unknown. We aimed to analyze the difference in microorganisms isolated before, during, and after tigecycline usage and their susceptibility to antimicrobial agents. METHODS: Between July 2008 and August 2009, 66 patients who received tigecycline monotherapy for more than 2 days at a Taiwan medical center were enrolled. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution method with VITEK-2 system and was analyzed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, except for tigecycline. We followed USA Food and Drug Administration criteria for interpretation of susceptibility to tigecycline. RESULTS: The median duration of tigecycline monotherapy was 13.4 days. After tigecycline treatment, the isolation frequency of Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Klebsiella pneumoniae decreased, but that of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus sp, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia did not change. A baumannii and P aeruginosa were the two most common pathogens when tigecycline was administered. The tigecycline susceptibility rate of A baumannii isolates decreased after the administration of tigecycline. CONCLUSION: The most common pathogens isolated in patients receiving tigecycline were A baumannii and P aeruginosa. Tigecycline usage decreased the isolation frequency of A baumannii, methicillin-resistant S aureus, E coli, and K pneumoniae. Exposure to tigecycline may be associated with a decreased susceptibility rate of A baumannii for tigecycline.
TI  - Antibiotic activity of tigecycline against clinical pathogens by the micro dilution method.
AB  - Resistant pathogens are the cause of clinical infections which threatening the patients lives and challenging the health systems through their economic importance. Therefore, new antibacterial agents with a broader spectrum of activity that protect against development of resistance are required. Tigecycline (Tygacil, Wyeth) is a relatively new FDA and EMEA approved glycylcycline antimicrobial with an expanded broad-spectrum activity against pathogens involved in complicated skin and skin structure infections. In this study we evaluated the in vitro activity of tigecycline in comparison to 14 other antibiotics against 182 clinical pathogens by use of the micro dilution method. In overall, tigecycline exhibited the lowest Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values in almost all bacteria with a mean of 0.52 +/- 1.25mg/L, followed by meropenem and levofloxacin (mean MIC values 1.29 +/- 2.52 and 1.45 +/- 3.078 mg/L, respectively). MIC50 and MIC90 values of tigecycline were: 0.06 and 0.15 mg/L for E. coli, 0.12 and 1.00 mg/L for Klebsiella sp., 0.12 and 0.85 mg/L for various Enterobacter sp., 1.00 and 8.00 mg/L for Pseudomonas sp., 0.25 and 1.00 mg/L for Acinetobacter sp., 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L for Serratia sp., 0.12 and 0.25mg/L for Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5 and 5.00 mg/L for Streptococcus sp. The MIC values recorded were among the lowest in recent literature for Acinetobacter sp. (included A. baumannii), and comparable to those obtained for Klebsiella, Serratia and Enterobacter indicating that tigecycline has a promising in vitro activity.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in intensive care units in Hubei Province, China: a multicentre prospective cohort survey.
AB  - A multicentre prospective cohort study was performed in 17 intensive care units (ICUs) in tertiary care hospitals in Hubei Province, China. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was defined according to modified criteria from the published literature. Among 4155 ventilated patients, the crude incidence and incidence rate of VAP were 20.9% and 28.9 cases per 1000 ventilator-days. Multivariate analysis using logistic regression revealed risk factors including male sex [risk ratio (RR): 1.5; P<0.001], coma (RR: 2.1; P<0.001), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (RR: 1.4; P<0.001), infections at other sites (RR: 1.6; P=0.001), serious disease predating the onset of VAP (RR: 1.6; P<0.001) and interventions including antacid treatment (RR: 1.4; P<0.001), antimicrobial treatment (RR: 5.1; P<0.001), bronchoscopy (RR: 1.5; P=0.041) and tracheostomy (RR: 1.4; P=0.014). The most frequently isolated causative pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Of all Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 45.7% were meticillin resistant. Rates, risk factors and causal pathogens of VAP in ICUs in Hubei differ from those reported from developed countries. These data show the need for more effective infection control interventions in Hubei, China.
TI  - Synergistic combination of chitosan acetate with nanoparticle silver as a topical antimicrobial: efficacy against bacterial burn infections.
AB  - Chitosan and nanoparticle silver are both materials with demonstrated antimicrobial properties and have been proposed singly or in combination as constituents of antimicrobial burn dressings. Here, we show that they combine synergistically to inhibit the in vitro growth of Gram-positive methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, and Acinetobacter baumannii), as judged by bioluminescence monitoring and isobolographic analysis, and also produce synergistic killing after 30 min of incubation, as measured by a CFU assay. The hypothesized explanation involves chitosan-mediated permeabilization of bacterial cells, allowing better penetration of silver ions into the cell. A dressing composed of freeze-dried chitosan acetate incorporating nanoparticle silver was compared with a dressing of chitosan acetate alone in an in vivo burn model infected with bioluminescent P. aeruginosa. The survival rates of mice treated with silver-chitosan or regular chitosan or left untreated were 64.3% (P = 0.0082 versus regular chitosan and P = 0.0003 versus the control), 21.4%, and 0%, respectively. Most of the fatalities occurred between 2 and 5 days postinfection. Silver-chitosan dressings effectively controlled the development of systemic sepsis, as shown by blood culture. These data suggest that a dressing combining chitosan acetate with silver leads to improved antimicrobial efficacy against fatal burn infections.
TI  - Risk factors and pathogen profile of ventilator-associated pneumonia in a neonatal intensive care unit in China.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to explore the incidence and risk factors of, and summarize the involved pathogens in, neonates with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the authors' neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) to determine the effective strategies for prevention. METHODS: A retrospective case-control study including 117 VAP patients and 232 controls was conducted from January 2002 to July 2008. The antibiotics sensitivity spectrum was determined on quantitative microbiological evaluation. Multiple logistic regression and Cox model analysis were performed to determine independent and accumulative risk factors for VAP. RESULTS: Multivariate analysis showed that birthweight, mechanical ventilation (MV), parenteral alimentation, dexamethasone and other respiratory disease were associated with the development of VAP. The cumulative risk for developing VAP increased over the duration of stay in the NICU. The most common isolated bacteria of the pathogen spectrum in VAP were Klebsiella spp. (33/146), Acinetobacter baumannii (26/146), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18/146) and Staphylococcus aureus(13/146). Meanwhile, we found that previous use of antibiotics before VAP diagnosis was not associated with the onset of VAP. CONCLUSIONS: The daily risk for VAP increases with duration of stay in the NICU after ventilation. Drug-resistant bacteria are common pathogens for neonatal VAP in the authors' NICU.
TI  - The antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against a broad spectrum of clinically relevant wound isolates.
AB  - Wound dressings impregnated with silver have a role to play in aiding to reduce both the dressing and wound microbial bioburden. It is therefore imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings have efficacy on a broad range of clinical significant microorganisms. Accordingly, this study aimed to determine the antimicrobial efficacy of a silver alginate dressing against 115 wound isolates that had been isolated routinely from patients at West Virginia University Hospital. Standardised corrected zones of inhibition (CZOIs) were performed on all clinical isolates. It was found that the silver alginate dressing was able to inhibit the growth of all microorganisms tested. In particular, the silver alginate dressing inhibited the growth of Candida albicans and yeasts with CZOI of 3-11.5 mm. All meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains were found to be sensitive to the silver alginate dressing with a CZOI range calculated at 3-7.8 mm. Sensitivity to the silver alginate dressing was also evident for S. aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococci. CZOIs of 4.25 mm were calculated for Enterococcus faecium and 9.8 mm for viridans streptococcus. The bacteria which demonstrated the highest tolerance to ionic silver included Enterobacter cloacae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Contrary to this the most responsive microorganisms to ionic silver included strains of staphylococci, viridans streptococcus and Candida albicans. No antibiotic-resistant isolates, as identified by Kirby Bauer Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute classification system, were found to be resistant to ionic silver. When a selected number of microorganisms were grown in the biofilm phenotypic state enhanced tolerance to silver was observed, compared to their non biofilm counterparts. Overall, this study has demonstrated the broad antimicrobial activity of a silver alginate dressing on wound isolates grown in the non biofilm and biofilm state. This finding is clinically relevant as both the non biofilm and biofilm phenotypic states of microorganisms are evident in wounds and therefore significant to delayed healing. Consequently, it is imperative that antimicrobial wound dressings demonstrate antimicrobial activity against microorganisms in both phenotypic states.
TI  - The challenges of antimicrobial resistance in Brazil.
AB  - Brazil is a country with continental proportions with high geographic and economic diversity. Despite its medical centers of excellence, antimicrobial resistance poses a major therapeutic challenge. Rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus are up to 60% and are related to an endemic Brazilian clone. Local resistance to vancomycin in Enterococci was first related to Enterococcus faecalis, which differs from European and American epidemiology. Also, local Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli isolates producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have a much higher prevalence (40%-50% and 10%-18%, respectively). Carbapenem resistance among the enterobacteriaceae group is becoming a major problem, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase isolates have been reported in different states. Among nonfermenters, carbapenem resistance is strongly related to SPM-1 (Pseudomonasaeruginosa) and OXA-23 (Acinetobacter baumannii complex) enzymes, and a colistin-only susceptible phenotype has also emerged in these isolates, which is worrisome. Local actions without loosing the global resistance perspective will demand multidisciplinary actions, new policies, and political engagement.
TI  - [Bacterial epidemiology in the burns unit at military teaching hospital Mohamed V of Rabat].
AB  - We aimed to establish the ecology of the Burns Unit of the Military Teaching Hospital Mohammed V of Rabat. We present results of a retrospective study of four years (March 2006-June 2010) on all micro-organisms isolated from patient samples. During the study period, we analyzed 307 samples corresponding to isolate bacterial strains from 288 non-redundant and 5 yeasts among which 4 corresponded to Candida albicans. The bacteriological profile of the isolated stumps showed a change between 2006 and 2010. Staphylococcus aureus in 2007 and 2008 (52.3%, 33.9%) was in 3rd position in 2010 (10.5%). Acinetobacter baumannii found in 3rd position or below (3.7%, 11.6%, 15.3%), between 2006 and 2008, reached the summit in 2009 and 2010 (22.6% and 23.7%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa, strain dominant in 2006 (33.3%) maintained its second position in 2007, 2008 and 2010 (19.8%, 18.6%, 18.4%) while it was third in 2009 (14.3%). Study of the resistance in antibiotics of the main isolated bacteria showed a stability of the profile of resistance. In conclusion, an epidemiological surveillance of bacteria is necessary, in the burns unit and in the hospital, to guide better the probability antibiotic treatment.
TI  - Causative pathogen dictates optimal duration of antimicrobial therapy for ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) guidelines recommend considering abbreviated therapy in patients with non-Pseudomonas aeruginosa VAP if clinical signs resolve. However, using an arbitrary day cutoff or clinical signs can be suboptimal for some, especially multiply injured patients, resulting in relapse and/or antibiotic resistance. Previously, we showed that repeat bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) could guide antimicrobial duration for community-acquired VAP in trauma patients. The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP in trauma patients secondary to hospital-acquired pathogens. STUDY DESIGN: Patients with VAP secondary to MRSA, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (SM), or Enterobacteriaceae (ENB) during 6 years were evaluated. All received empiric antimicrobial therapy based on duration of ICU stay. Therapy was tailored based on culture data. Repeat BAL was performed on day 4 of appropriate therapy. Microbiological resolution was defined as </=10(3) colony-forming units/mL. Recurrence was defined as >/=10(5) colony-forming units/mL on subsequent BAL performed within 2 weeks after completion of appropriate therapy. RESULTS: Six hundred and fifty-nine patients were identified. Seventy-seven percent of patients underwent repeat BAL: 96 with MRSA, 100 with AB, 139 with PA, 50 with SM, and 120 with ENB. The majority of patients with MRSA or PA achieved microbiological resolution after 14 days. Nearly 60% of patients with AB, SM, or ENB achieved microbiological resolution after 10 days. Overall recurrence was 2%. CONCLUSIONS: Repeat BAL provides objective evidence for VAP resolution in the face of potentially confounding clinical factors. Hospital-acquired VAP can be managed effectively by a defined course of therapy with a low recurrence. Duration of antimicrobial therapy for VAP in trauma patients should be dictated by the causative pathogen.
TI  - Changing trends in antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens, 1985-2005: a study from a medical center in northern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance is a major health problem worldwide. We evaluated the antimicrobial resistance trends of 16 major bacterial pathogens at a tertiary medical center in northern Taiwan. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of annual summary documents for antimicrobial susceptibility of clinically isolated gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria from 1985 to 2005. The numbers of isolates and susceptibilities were calculated for three 7-year periods: first period, 1985-1991; second period, 1992-1998; and the third period, 1999-2005. RESULTS: During the 21-year period, 219,715 bacterial pathogens were identified. A significant increase in incidence over time was found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S epidermidis, penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, erythromycin-resistant S pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, cefotaxime/ceftriaxone-resistant Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, and imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Additionally, a significant increase in ciprofloxacin resistance rates over time from 1996 to 2005 was noted for E coli, Enterobacter cloacae, and A baumannii (through 1997 to 2005). However, a significant decrease in erythromycin resistance rate with time from 1999 to 2005 was found for Groups A and B streptococci, non-A, B, D streptococci, and S pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Resistance to antimicrobial agents increased rapidly in the past two decades in Taiwan and has become very common in major bacterial pathogens. Continuous enforcement of policies to limit use of antimicrobial agents and active surveillance of antimicrobial resistance through a nationwide system are both warranted.
TI  - In vitro activity of ceftaroline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens isolated from patients in Canadian hospitals in 2009.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ceftaroline and comparative agents were determined for a collection of the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogens from hospital-associated patients across Canada in 2009 as part of the ongoing CANWARD surveillance study. In total, 4,546 isolates from 15 sentinel Canadian hospital laboratories were tested using the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution method. Compared with other cephalosporins, including ceftobiprole, cefepime, and ceftriaxone, ceftaroline exhibited the greatest potency against methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), with a MIC(9)(0) of 0.25 mug/ml. Ceftaroline also demonstrated greater potency than ceftobiprole against community-associated methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (MIC(9)(0), 0.5 mug/ml) and health care-associated MRSA (MIC(9)(0), 1 mug/ml) and was at least 4-fold more active than other cephalosporins against Staphylococcus epidermidis; all isolates of MSSA and MRSA tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=1 mug/ml). Against streptococci, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, ceftaroline MICs (MIC(9)(0), </=0.03 mug/ml) were comparable to those of ceftobiprole; however, against penicillin-nonsusceptible, macrolide-nonsusceptible, and multidrug-nonsusceptible isolates of S. pneumoniae, ceftaroline demonstrated 2- to 4-fold and 4- to 16-fold more potent activities than those of ceftobiprole and ceftriaxone, respectively. All isolates of S. pneumoniae tested were susceptible to ceftaroline (MIC, </=0.25 mug/ml). Among Gram-negative isolates, ceftaroline demonstrated potent activity (MIC(9)(0), </=0.5 mug/ml) against Escherichia coli (92.2% of isolates were susceptible), Klebsiella pneumoniae (94.1% of isolates were susceptible), Proteus mirabilis (97.7% of isolates were susceptible), and Haemophilus influenzae (100% of isolates were susceptible). Ceftaroline demonstrated less potent activity (MIC(9)(0), >/=4 mug/ml) against Enterobacter spp., Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Overall, ceftaroline demonstrated potent in vitro activity against a recent collection of the most frequently encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates from patients attending hospitals across Canada in 2009.
TI  - Association of red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans and non-oral bacteria with periodontal diseases.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Pathogens related to systemic infections have been detected in the periodontal microbiota. The relationship amongst these pathogens, periodontal bacteria and periodontal clinical status is poorly understood. This study evaluated the association amongst red complex, A. actinomycetemcomitans (A.a) and non-oral pathogenic bacteria in subjects with good periodontal health (PH), gingivitis (G), chronic (CP) and aggressive (AP) periodontitis. METHODS: Subgingival biofilm samples were obtained from 51 PH, 42 G, 219 CP and 90 AP subjects. The presence and levels of A.a, red complex (Porphyromonas gingivalis, Tannerella forsythia, Treponema denticola), Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus were determined by DNA probes and DNA-DNA hybridization technique. RESULTS: CP and AP subjects presented significantly higher prevalence and levels of A.a, red complex and A. baumannii than G and PH individuals (p<0.01), whereas S. aureus was detected in lower frequency and counts in AP as compared to the other groups (p<0.001). The predictor variables age, prevalence of red complex, and the presence of A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa were strongly associated with the frequency of sites with PD and CAL >/=5 mm. Increasing age (OR 1.08), high frequency of red complex (OR 6.10), and the presence of A.a with P. aeruginosa (OR 1.90) were associated with periodontal disease (p<0.001). Subjects harbouring a high prevalence of A.a, A. baumannii, and red complex with P. aeruginosa were more likely to have AP than CP (p<0.001). CONCLUSION: Putative periodontal pathogens and non-oral bacteria alone or in association were strongly associated with periodontitis.
TI  - Synthesis and biological activity of 2-aminoimidazole triazoles accessed by Suzuki-Miyaura cross-coupling.
AB  - A pilot library of 2-aminoimidazole triazoles (2-AITs) was synthesized and assayed against Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococus aureus (MRSA). Results from these studies show that these new derivatives have improved biofilm dispersal activities as well as antibacterial properties against A. baumannii. With MRSA biofilms they are found to possess biofilm inhibition capabilities at low micromolar concentrations.
TI  - Cytotoxicity, antiviral and antimicrobial activities of alkaloids, flavonoids, and phenolic acids.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Some natural products consisting of the alkaloids yohimbine and vincamine (indole-type), scopolamine and atropine (tropane-type), colchicine (tropolone-type), allantoin (imidazolidine-type), trigonelline (pyridine-type) as well as octopamine, synephrine, and capsaicin (exocyclic amine-type); the flavonoid derivatives quercetin, apigenin, genistein, naringin, silymarin, and silibinin; and the phenolic acids namely gallic acid, caffeic acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinic acid, were tested for their in vitro antiviral, antibacterial, and antifungal activities and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antiviral activity of the compounds was tested against DNA virus herpes simplex type 1 and RNA virus parainfluenza (type-3). Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines, and their cytopathogenic effects were expressed as maximum non-toxic concentration. Antibacterial activity was assayed against following bacteria and their isolated strains: Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Bacillus subtilis, although they were screened by microdilution method against two fungi: Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis. RESULTS: Atropine and gallic acid showed potent antiviral effect at the therapeutic range of 0.8-0.05 microg ml(-1), whilst all of the compounds exerted robust antibacterial effect. CONCLUSION: Antiviral and antimicrobial effects of the compounds tested herein may constitute a preliminary step for further relevant studies to identify the mechanism of action.
TI  - Immobilization of amphiphilic polycations by catechol functionality for antimicrobial coatings.
AB  - A new strategy for preparing antimicrobial surfaces by a simple dip-coating procedure is reported. Amphiphilic polycations with different mole ratios of monomers containing dodecyl quaternary ammonium, methoxyethyl, and catechol groups were synthesized by free-radical polymerization. The polymer coatings were prepared by immersing glass slides into a polymer solution and subsequent drying and heating. The quaternary ammonium side chains endow the coatings with potent antibacterial activity, the methoxyethyl side chains enable tuning the hydrophobic/hydrophilic balance, and the catachol groups promote immobilization of the polymers into films. The polymer-coated surfaces displayed bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in a dynamic contact assay and prevented the accumulation of viable E. coli, S. aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii for up to 96 h. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) images of coating surfaces indicated that the surfaces exhibit virtually the same smoothness for all polymers except the most hydrophobic. The hydrophobic polymer without methoxyethyl side chains showed clear structuring into polymer domains, causing high surface roughness. Sum-frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy characterization of the surface structures demonstrated that the dodecyl chains are predominantly localized at the surface-air interface of the coatings. SFG also showed that the phenyl groups of the catechols are oriented on the substrate surface. These results support our hypothesis that the adhesive or cross-linking functionality of catechol groups discourages polymer leaching, allowing the tuning of the amphiphilic balance by incorporating hydrophilic components into the polymer chains to gain potent biocidal activity.
TI  - High burden of antimicrobial resistance in Asia.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Marked variations in the resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens as well as the quality of public hygiene have had a considerable impact on the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents in Asian countries. In Asia, one of the epicentres of antimicrobial drug resistance, there is an alarming number of antibiotic-resistant species, including penicillin- and erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (particularly mediated by CTX-M-9, CTX-M-14 and CTX-M-15), New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase 1 (NDM-1)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, MDR Salmonella enterica serotypes Choleraesuis and Typhi, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (OXA-58 and OXA-23 carbapenemases) and azole-resistant Candida glabrata. A few clones of MDR A. baumannii and hospital-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have been widely disseminated in hospital settings in Asia, and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae strains have been widely distributed in China. In addition, the emergence of extensively drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (XDR-TB) has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of resistance profiles of clinical isolates as well as the deliberative use of fluoroquinolones. Continuous surveillance of resistance data from clinical isolates as well as implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings are required to mitigate the progression of antimicrobial resistance.
TI  - Introduction to the CANWARD Study (2007-2009).
AB  
TI  - Broad-spectrum antimicrobial efficacy of peptide A3-APO in mouse models of multidrug-resistant wound and lung infections cannot be explained by in vitro activity against the pathogens involved.
AB  - Although the designer proline-rich antimicrobial peptide A3-APO has only modest activity against Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii in vitro, in mouse models of systemic and wound infections it shows superior efficacy compared with conventional antibiotics. In this study, the efficacy of A3-APO in several additional mouse models was investigated, including Staphylococcus aureus wound infection, mixed Klebsiella pneumoniae-A. baumannii-Proteus mirabilis wound infection and K. pneumoniae lung infection, mimicking blast wound infections, foot ulcers and ventilator-induced nosocomial infections, respectively. Whilst the peptide practically did not kill the strains in vitro, when administered intramuscularly or as an aerosol it significantly improved mouse survival and reduced bacterial counts at the infection site and in blood. In the lung infection study, the blood bacterial counts following A3-APO treatment were as low as after treatment with colistin and were lower than after treatment with imipenem or amikacin. The wounds of treated animals, unlike their untreated counterparts, lacked pus and signs of inflammation. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, A3-APO upregulated the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 by four- to six-fold. One of the mechanisms mediating the in vivo protective effects might be the prevention of inflammation around bacterial infiltration.
TI  - [Surfaces of the hospital environment as possible deposits of resistant bacteria: a review].
AB  - The main objective of this study is to identify, in the literature, articles about the occurrence of contamination from inanimate surfaces and a possible dissemination of resistant bacteria in the hospital environment. A bibliographic survey was performed with articles published in the databases LILACS, MEDLINE, Science Direct, SCOPUS and ISI Web of Knowledge, between 2000 and 2008. Twenty-one articles were selected and analyzed. The analyzed studies highlighted the presence of bacteria on monitors, bed grids, tables, faucets, telephones, keyboards and other objects. There was a prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus resistant to methicillin, Clostridium difficile, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterococcus resistant to vancomycin, being the predictive factor the previous occupation of patients colonized by these microorganisms. There was a similarity observed among the isolated strains of colonized and/or infected patients and the strains of the environment by molecular typification. These evidences reinforce the need for knowledge and control of the sources of pathogens in the hospital environment.
TI  - Contamination of anesthesia circuits by pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Evaluation of contamination of anesthesia circuits by  collecting 56 culture samples from the circular system; previously reprocessed tracheas by disinfection with 1% hypochlorite or 2% glutaraldehyde after being washed in non-sterile water and soap and dried by using compressed air and stored in surgical grade paper; and from other places of the non-reprocessed respiratory circuit, before anesthetic procedures. METHODS: Samples from the inspiratory and expiratory branches of the tracheas, canister, soda-lime, and collector jar (drain) through swab in Stuart medium and streaked in Agar blood, Mac Conkey, and Sabouraud growth media. RESULTS: The level of contamination with fungus and bacteria in the inspiratory and expiratory branches of tracheas reached up to 39.3% in some sites; in some cases, more than one microorganism was present, 75% fungal and 25% bacterial contamination. Cultures were positive for Candida sp., Dermatophytus sp., Penicillium sp., Aspergillus sp., Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus saprophyticus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis. Contamination was observed in 25% of the canisters with growth of Candida sp., Penicillium sp., Dermatophytus sp., Aspergillus sp., and Fusarium sp. In the collector jar, a contamination rate of 36% was observed with growth of Candida sp., Dermatophytus sp., S. saprophyticus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Microorganisms did not grow in soda-lime cultures. CONCLUSIONS: In all sites investigated except for soda-lime growth of microorganisms was observed with the possibility of cross infection.
TI  - Bacteremia is an independent risk factor for mortality in nosocomial pneumonia: a prospective and observational multicenter study.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since positive blood cultures are uncommon in patients with nosocomial pneumonia (NP), the responsible pathogens are usually isolated from respiratory samples. Studies on bacteremia associated with hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) have reported fatality rates of up to 50%. The purpose of the study is to compare risk factors, pathogens and outcomes between bacteremic nosocomial pneumonia (B-NP) and nonbacteremic nosocomial pneumonia (NB-NP) episodes. METHODS: This is a prospective, observational and multicenter study (27 intensive care units in nine European countries). Consecutive patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for an admission diagnosis of pneumonia or on mechanical ventilation for > 48 hours irrespective of admission diagnosis were recruited. RESULTS: A total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 689 intubated patients presented with NP, 224 of them developed HAP and 465 developed ventilation-acquired pneumonia. Blood samples were extracted in 479 (69.5%) patients, 70 (14.6%) being positive. B-NP patients had higher Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS) II score (51.5 +/- 19.8 vs. 46.6 +/- 17.5, P = 0.03) and were more frequently medical patients (77.1% vs. 60.4%, P = 0.01). Mortality in the intensive care unit was higher in B-NP patients compared with NB-NP patients (57.1% vs. 33%, P < 0.001). B-NP patients had a more prolonged mean intensive care unit length of stay after pneumonia onset than NB-NP patients (28.5 +/- 30.6 vs. 20.5 +/- 17.1 days, P = 0.03). Logistic regression analysis confirmed that medical patients (odds ratio (OR) = 5.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.93 to 16.99, P = 0.002), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) etiology (OR = 3.42, 95% CI = 1.57 to 5.81, P = 0.01), Acinetobacter baumannii etiology (OR = 4.78, 95% CI = 2.46 to 9.29, P < 0.001) and days of mechanical ventilation (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.03, P < 0.001) were independently associated with B-NP episodes. Bacteremia (OR = 2.01, 95% CI = 1.22 to 3.55, P = 0.008), diagnostic category (medical patients (OR = 3.71, 95% CI = 2.01 to 6.95, P = 0.02) and surgical patients (OR = 2.32, 95% CI = 1.10 to 4.97, P = 0.03)) and higher SAPS II score (OR = 1.02, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.03, P = 0.008) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: B-NP episodes are more frequent in patients with medical admission, MRSA and A. baumannii etiology and prolonged mechanical ventilation, and are independently associated with higher mortality rates.
TI  - Antimicrobial drug resistance in Taiwan.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is a major global health threat associated with high mortality rates and high medical costs. Geographic variations in resistance profiles of bacterial and fungal pathogens have had a considerable impact on antimicrobial prescription. In Taiwan, there is an alarmingly high prevalence of penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, penicillin- and fluoroquinolone-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, and azole-resistant Candida species. In addition, the emergence of XDR Mycobacterium tuberculosis has illustrated the need for regular monitoring of the resistance profiles of clinical isolates. A few clones of XDR A. baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus of unique sequence type (ST 59) have disseminated in Taiwanese hospital settings. Besides, the existence of a transposon-harboring carbapenemase gene has been verified in XDR P aeruginosa strains throughout Taiwan. An end to the worsening trends in the emergence of antimicrobial resistance will require continuous survey of resistance data from clinical isolates and effective implementation of strict infection control policies in healthcare settings and animal husbandry.
TI  - Synthesis, conformational analysis and biological properties of a dicarba derivative of the antimicrobial peptide, brevinin-1BYa.
AB  - Brevinin-1BYa (FLPILASLAAKFGPKLFCLVTKKC), first isolated from skin secretions of  the frog Rana boylii, displays broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and potent haemolytic activity. This study investigates the effects on conformation and biological activity of replacement of the intramolecular disulphide bridge in the peptide by a non-reducible dicarba bond. Dicarba-brevinin-1BYa was prepared by microwave irradiation of [Agl(18),Agl(24)]-brevinin-1BYa (Agl = allylglycine) in the presence of a second generation Grubbs' catalyst. Circular dichroism spectroscopy in 50% trifluoroethanol-water indicated that the degree of alpha-helicity of the dicarba derivative (22%) was less than that of brevinin-1BYa (27%) but comparable to that of the acyclic derivative [Ser(18),Ser(24)]-brevinin-1BYa (23%). Dicarba-brevinin-1BYa showed a two-fold increase in potency against reference strains of Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Candida albicans compared with the native peptide and displayed potent bactericidal activity against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC in the range 1-8 muM). Compared with brevinin-1BYa and [Ser(18),Ser(24)]-brevinin-1BYa, the dicarba derivative was associated with increased cytotoxicity against human erythrocytes (2.5-fold), MDA-MB-231 breast carcinoma cells (1.3-fold) and HepG2 hepatoma-derived cells (1.5-fold).
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of ceftobiprole against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of this study were to determine the in vitro activity profile of ceftobiprole, a pyrrolidinone cephalosporin, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorisation according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. MICs of ceftobiprole were determined by broth microdilution against 1548 clinical isolates collected in eight French hospitals. Disk diffusion testing was performed using 30 mug disks according to the method of the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CA-SFM). The in vitro activity of ceftobiprole, expressed by MIC(50/90) (MICs for 50% and 90% of the organisms, respectively) (mg/L), was as follows: meticillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, 0.25/0.5; meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), 1/2; meticillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), 0.12/0.5; meticillin-resistant CoNS, 1/2; penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, </= 0.008/0.03; penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, 0.12/0.5; viridans group streptococci, 0.03/0.12; beta-haemolytic streptococci, </= 0.008/0.016; Enterococcus faecalis, 0.25/1; Enterococcus faecium, 64/128; Enterobacteriaceae, 0.06/32; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 4/16; Acinetobacter baumannii, 0.5/64; Haemophilus influenzae, 0.03/0.12; and Moraxella catarrhalis, 0.25/0.5. According to the regression curve, zone diameter breakpoints could be 28, 26, 24 and 22 mm for MICs of 0.5, 1, 2 and 4 mg/L respectively. In conclusion, this study confirms the potent in vitro activity of ceftobiprole against many Gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA but not E. faecium, whilst maintaining a Gram-negative spectrum similar to the advanced-generation cephalosporins such as cefepime. Thus ceftobiprole appears to be well suited for the empirical treatment of a variety of healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - The prevention of biofilm colonization by multidrug-resistant pathogens that cause ventilator-associated pneumonia with antimicrobial-coated endotracheal tubes.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) continues to be the nosocomial infection associated with the highest mortality in critically ill patients. Since silver-coated endotracheal tubes (ETT) was shown in a multicenter prospective randomized trials to decrease the risk of VAP, we compared the efficacy of two antiseptic agents such as gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs with that of silver-coated ETTs in preventing biofilm. The ETTs were tested for their ability to prevent the biofilm formation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, and Candida albicans. Scanning electron microscopy studies revealed a heavy biofilm on uncoated and silver-coated ETT but not on the gardine-coated ETT. The gardine and gendine ETTs completely inhibited the formation of biofilms by all organisms tested and were more effective in preventing biofilm growth than the silver ETTs (p < 0.001). The gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs were more durable against MRSA than either the silver-coated or uncoated ETTs for up to 2 weeks (p < 0.0001). We have therefore shown that gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs are superior to silver-coated ETTs in preventing biofilm. Future animal and clinical studies are warranted to determine whether the gardine- and gendine-coated ETTs can significantly reduce the risk of VAP.
TI  - Chitosan augments photodynamic inactivation of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - Antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (PDI) was shown to be a promising treatment modality for microbial infections. This study explores the effect of chitosan, a polycationic biopolymer, in increasing the PDI efficacy against Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), as well as the Gram-negative bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Chitosan at <0.1% was included in the antibacterial process either by coincubation with hematoporphyrin (Hp) and subjection to light exposure to induce the PDI effect or by addition after PDI and further incubation for 30 min. Under conditions in which Hp-PDI killed the microbe on a 2- to 4-log scale, treatment with chitosan at concentrations of as low as 0.025% for a further 30 min completely eradicated the bacteria (which were originally at approximately 10(8) CFU/ml). Similar results were also found with toluidine blue O (TBO)-mediated PDI in planktonic and biofilm cells. However, without PDI treatment, chitosan alone did not exert significant antimicrobial activity with 30 min of incubation, suggesting that the potentiated effect of chitosan worked after the bacterial damage induced by PDI. Further studies indicated that the potentiated PDI effect of chitosan was related to the level of PDI damage and the deacetylation level of the chitosan. These results indicate that the combination of PDI and chitosan is quite promising for eradicating microbial infections.
TI  - Antibacterial activity of Acinetobacter baumannii phage varphiAB2 endolysin (LysAB2) against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria.
AB  - To investigate the nature and origin of the antibacterial activity of the lytic phage varphiAB2 toward Acinetobacter baumannii, we successfully isolated and characterized a novel phage lysozyme (endolysin) from varphiAB2 and named it LysAB2. To analyze antibacterial activity of LysAB2, the complete LysAB2 and two deletion derivatives were constructed, purified and characterized. Zymographic assays showed that only the intact LysAB2 could lyse the peptidoglycan of A. baumannii and the Staphylococcus aureus cell wall. Antibacterial analysis also showed that only the intact LysAB2 retained the complete bactericidal activity. When applied exogenously, LysAB2 exhibited a broad bacteriolytic activity against a number of Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria. Thermostability assays indicated that LysAB2 was stable at 20 approximately 40 degrees C. Its optimal pH was 6.0, and it was active from pH 4 to 8. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that exposure to 500 mugml(-1) LysAB2 for up to 60 min caused a remarkable modification of the cell shape of the bacteria. Treating bacteria with LysAB2 clearly enhanced permeation of the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane. These results indicate that LysAB2 is an effective lysozyme against bacteria, and they suggest that it is a good candidate for a therapeutic/disinfectant agent to control nosocomial infections caused by multiple drug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - The impact of enhanced cleaning within the intensive care unit on contamination of the near-patient environment with hospital pathogens: a randomized crossover study in critical care units in two hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the effect of enhanced cleaning of the near-patient environment on the isolation of hospital pathogens from the bed area and staff hands. DESIGN: Prospective randomized crossover study over the course of 1 yr. SETTING: Intensive care units at two teaching hospitals. PATIENTS: There were 1252 patients staying during enhanced cleaning and 1331 staying during standard cleaning. INTERVENTIONS: In each of six 2-month periods, one unit was randomly selected for additional twice-daily enhanced cleaning of hand contact surfaces. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Agar contact samples were taken at five sites around randomly selected bed areas, from staff hands, and from communal sites three times daily for 12 bed days per week. Patients admitted in the year commencing April 2007 were analyzed for hospital-acquired colonization and infection. Over the course of 1152 bed days, 20,736 samples were collected. Detection of environmental methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus per bed-area day was reduced during enhanced cleaning phases from 82 of 561 (14.6%) to 51 of 559 (9.1%) (adjusted odds ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval, 0.40-0.86; p = .006). Other targeted pathogens (Acinetobacter baumannii, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and Clostridium difficile) were rarely detected. Subgroup analyses showed reduced methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus contamination on doctors' hands during enhanced cleaning (3 of 425; 0.7% vs. 11 of 423; 2.6%; adjusted odds ratio, 0.26; 95% confidence interval, 0.07-0.95; p = .025) and a trend to reduction on nurses' hands (16 of 1647; 1.0% vs. 28 of 1694; 1.7%; adjusted odds ratio 0.56; 95% confidence interval, 0.29-1.08; p = .077). All 1252 critical care patients staying during enhanced and 1,331 during standard cleaning were included, but no significant effect on patient methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus acquisition was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% confidence interval, 0.58-1.65; p = .93). CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced cleaning reduced environmental contamination and hand carriage, but no significant effect was observed on patient acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.

TI  - Suprathel-antiseptic matrix: in vitro model for local antiseptic treatment?
AB  - Acetic acid is a traditional antiseptic agent that has been used for more than 6000 years. The main goal of this study was to demonstrate the suitability of Suprathel (PolyMedics Innovations GmbH, Denkendorf, Germany) in combination with various antiseptic agents to create an "antiseptic-matrix" especially designed for problematic microorganisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii, or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which are frequently associated with burns. The study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a "Suprathel-antiseptic matrix" (Suprathel combined with acetic acid 3%, povidone-iodine 11% [Betaisodona], polyhexanide 0.04% [Lavasept], phenoxyethanol 2%/octenidine dihydrochloride 0.1% [Octenisept], mafenide acetate 5%, and chlorhexidine gluconate 1.5%/cetrimid 15% [Hibicet]). As a means to assess the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S aureus, and beta-hemolytic streptococcus groups A and B. The tests showed a positive bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-antiseptic matrix, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P vulgaris, P aeruginosa, and A baumannii, except for the combination of Suprathel and mafenide acetate. It can be concluded that Suprathel-antiseptic matrix appears to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but clinical studies need to be performed to confirm these in vitro observations. The authors' previous studies have shown that acetic acid demonstrates a wide antiseptic spectrum for microorganisms typically found in burn patients. The combination of Suprathel and acetic acid worked well in this study and appears to be promising for future clinical application.
TI  - Purification and properties of antimicrobial peptides from skin secretions of the Eritrea clawed frog Xenopus clivii (Pipidae).
AB  - Five peptides with antimicrobial activity were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the tetraploid frog Xenopus clivii Peracca, 1898 (Pipidae). Characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they are structurally similar to magainins (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, CPF (2 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, XPF (1 peptide) that have been previously isolated from other species of the genus Xenopus. The magainins and the XPF peptide were active only against the Gram-negative microorganism Escherichia coli whereas the CPF peptides were also active against the Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus. The most abundant antimicrobial peptide in the secretions, CPF-C1 (GFGSLLGKALRLG ANVL.NH(2)) inhibited the growth of the Gram-negative bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MIC</=25muM) suggesting potential for development into an anti-infective agent for use against these emerging antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Identification of Streptomyces sp. KH29, which produces an antibiotic substance processing an inhibitory activity against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The Actinomycete strain KH29 is antagonistic to the multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Based on the diaminopimelic acid (DAP) type, and the morphological and physiological characteristics observed through the use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), KH29 was confirmed as belonging to the genus Streptomyces. By way of its noted 16S rDNA nucleotide sequences, KH29 was found to have a relationship with Streptomyces cinnamonensis. The production of an antibiotic from this strain was found to be most favorable when cultured with glucose, polypeptone, and yeast extract (PY) medium for 6 days at 27 degrees C. The antibiotic produced was identified, through comparisons with reported spectral data including MS and NMR as a cyclo(L-tryptophanyl-L-tryptophanyl). Cyclo(L-Trp-L-Trp), from the PY cultures of KH29, was seen to be highly effective against 41 of 49 multidrugresistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Furthermore, cyclo(LTrp- L-Trp) had antimicrobial activity against Bacillus subtilis, Micrococcus luteus, Staphylococcus aureus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus niger, and Candida albicans, However, it was ineffective against Streptomyces murinus.
TI  - [Microbiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers in a Portuguese hospital].
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the microbiological profile and antibiotic susceptibility patterns of organisms isolated from diabetic foot ulcers in a Portuguese hospital. METHODS: Microbiological data from ambulatory and hospitalized patients with diabetic foot infection during the year 2010 were retrospectively analysed. The profile of the isolated organisms was identified, regarding their prevalence both in the outpatient and inpatient settings. Multidrug-resistant organisms ( MDRO ) under surveillance program at the hospital and their antibiotic susceptibility tests were analysed. RESULTS: Gram-positive aerobes were most frequently isolated ( 59.6 % ) from outpatient diabetic foot ulcers. Staphylococcus was the main genus identified ( 49.8 % ), of which 70.0 % were methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. Considering samples obtained from hospitalized patients, Gram-negative aerobes were dominant ( 63.3 % ), mainly Pseudomonas aeruginosa ( 35.5 % ). Staphylococcus aureus represented 22.2 % of all isolates, with 60.0 % methicillin-resistance. Extended spectrum beta-lactamase production and methicillin resistance was noted in 35.0 % and 38.0 % of all bacterial isolates, respectively. High levels of resistance were also documented for Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii complex. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological differences seem to exist between the outpatient and inpatient settings concerning the microbiological profile of clinically infected diabetic foot ulcers. MDRO are prevalent in this study. Other studies are needed in order to adapt empirical therapy to the portuguese reality.
TI  - Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in a general intensive care unit in Saudi Arabia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria causing infections in patients at the intensive care units (ICUs) of Riyadh Military Hospital (RMH), as well as their antimicrobial resistance patterns for one year. METHODS: A retrospective, cohort investigation was performed. Laboratory records from January to December 2009 were studied for the prevalence of MDR Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and their antimicrobial resistance in ICU patients from RMH, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. RESULTS: A total of 1210 isolates were collected from various specimens such as: respiratory (469), blood (400), wound/tissue (235), urinary (56), nasal swabs (35), and cerebro-spinal fluid (15). Regardless of the specimen, there was a high rate of nosocomial MDR organisms isolated from patients enrolled in the General ICU (GICU) in Riyadh. Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) comprised 40.9%, Klebsiella pneumonia (K. pneumonia) - 19.4%, while Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) formed 16.3% of these isolates. CONCLUSION: The P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus (methycillin sensitive and methycillin resistant), and Staphylococccus coagulase negative are the most common isolates recovered from clinical specimens in the GICU of RMH. Respiratory tract specimens represented nearly 39% of all the specimens collected in the ICU. The most common MDR organisms isolated in this unit were A. baumannii, and K. pneumoniae.
TI  - [Infection in patients with malignant tumors].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the characters of infection in patients with malignant  tumors, especially the distribution, yearly change of pathogens, and pathogen resistance to common antibacterial agents. METHODS: We respectively analyzed the characters of infection in 489 patients with malignant tumors. RESULTS: The respiratory tract was the most frequent infection site (61.1%). The infection was mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens. The Gram-negative bacterias mainly consisted of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii (46.3%). The Gram-positive bacteria mainly consisted of Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis (29.9%), and the rest 23.8% of the infection was caused by different fungi, mainly consisting of Candida albicans. The ratio of the Gram-negative bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins (except ceftazidime), sulfanilamides, tetracyclines and quinolones was higher. The ratio of the Gram-positive bacteria resistance to antibiotics such as penicillins, macrolides and quinolones was higher. The ratio of fungus resistance to antibacterial agents such as fluconazol and itraconazole was higher. The infection caused by fungi obviously increased in the past 5 years. CONCLUSION: The infection in patients with malignant tumors is mainly caused by opportunistic pathogens, and the pathogen resistance to antibacterial agents is serious. The infection caused by fungi is increasing.
TI  - Clinical outcomes of health-care-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in patients admitted to European intensive-care units: a cohort study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients admitted to intensive-care units are at high risk of health-care-associated infections, and many are caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. We aimed to assess excess mortality and length of stay in intensive-care units from bloodstream infections and pneumonia. METHODS: We analysed data collected prospectively from intensive-care units that reported according to the European standard protocol for surveillance of health-care-associated infections. We focused on the most frequent causative microorganisms. Resistance was defined as resistance to ceftazidime (Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa), third-generation cephalosporins (Escherichia coli), and oxacillin (Staphylococcus aureus). We defined 20 different exposures according to infection site, microorganism, and resistance status. For every exposure, we compared outcomes between patients exposed and unexposed by use of time-dependent regression modelling. We adjusted results for patients' characteristics and time-dependency of the exposure. FINDINGS: We obtained data for 119 699 patients who were admitted for more than 2 days to 537 intensive-care units in ten countries between Jan 1, 2005, and Dec 31, 2008. Excess risk of death (hazard ratio) for pneumonia in the fully adjusted model ranged from 1.7 (95% CI 1.4-1.9) for drug-sensitive S aureus to 3.5 (2.9-4.2) for drug-resistant P aeruginosa. For bloodstream infections, the excess risk ranged from 2.1 (1.6-2.6) for drug-sensitive S aureus to 4.0 (2.7-5.8) for drug-resistant P aeruginosa. Risk of death associated with antimicrobial resistance (ie, additional risk of death to that of the infection) was 1.2 (1.1-1.4) for pneumonia and 1.2 (0.9-1.5) for bloodstream infections for a combination of all four microorganisms, and was highest for S aureus (pneumonia 1.3 [1.0-1.6], bloodstream infections 1.6 [1.1-2.3]). Antimicrobial resistance did not significantly increase length of stay; the hazard ratio for discharge, dead or alive, for sensitive microorganisms compared with resistant microorganisms (all four combined) was 1.05 (0.97-1.13) for pneumonia and 1.02 (0.98-1.17) for bloodstream infections. P aeruginosa had the highest burden of health-care-acquired infections because of its high prevalence and pathogenicity of both its drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. INTERPRETATION: Health-care-associated bloodstream infections and pneumonia greatly increase mortality and pneumonia increase length of stay in intensive-care units; the additional effect of the most common antimicrobial resistance patterns is comparatively low. FUNDING: European Commission (DG Sanco).
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates from intensive care unit patients of a tertiary-care university hospital in Iran: 2006-2009.
AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was conducted to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns among common pathogens in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital in Iran between 2006 and 2009. METHODS: The isolates cultured in appropriate media and antimicrobial susceptibility were determined by disk diffusion tests according to the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. RESULTS: A total of 606 isolates were recovered from respiratory (70.63%), urine (20.13%), blood (4.95%) and wound (1.82%) specimens of 456 patients. The most common isolates were Acinetobacter baumannii (22.4%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.1%), Escherichia coli (8.3%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (4.8%). Less than 7% of A. baumannii isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, ceftazidime, cefotaxime, imipenem, cefepime and ciprofloxacin. None was susceptible to piperacillin and piperacillin-tazobactam. The susceptibility rates of P. aeruginosa to ciprofloxacin, gentamicin and piperacillin-tazobactam were 13.6, 17.4 and 33.3%, respectively. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus made up 96.2% of S. aureus isolates and was 100% susceptible to vancomycin and 51.9% susceptible to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSION: Due to the high antimicrobial resistance in the ICU, we must focus on both a wiser use of antimicrobials and the prevention of infection.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of doripenem against clinical isolates from French teaching hospitals: proposition of zone diameter breakpoints.
AB  - The aims of the study were to determine the in vitro activity of doripenem, a new carbapenem, against a large number of bacterial pathogens and to propose zone diameter breakpoints for clinical categorization in France according to the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) breakpoints. The MICs of doripenem were determined by the broth microdilution method against 1,547 clinical isolates from eight French hospitals. The disk diffusion test was performed (10-mug discs) according to the Comite de l'Antibiogramme de la Societe Francaise de Microbiologie (CASFM) method. The MIC(50/90) (mg/L) values were as follows: methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (0.03/0.25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (1/2), methicillin-susceptible coagulase-negative staphylococci (MSCoNS) (0.03/0.12), methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCoNS) (2/8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (0.016/0.25), viridans group streptococci (0.016/2), beta-hemolytic streptococci (</=0.008/</=0.008), Enterococcus faecalis (2/4), Enterococcus faecium (128/>128), Enterobacteriaceae (0.06/0.25), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5/8), Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/2), Haemophilus influenzae (0.12/0.25), and Moraxella catarrhalis (0.03/0.06). According to the regression curve, the zone diameter breakpoints were 24 and 19 mm for MICs of 1 and 4 mg/L, respectively. This study confirms the potent in vitro activity of doripenem against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter, Enterobacteriaceae, MSSA, MSCoNS, and respiratory pathogens. According to the EUCAST MIC breakpoints (mg/L) </=1/>4 for Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter, and </=1/>1 for streptococci, pneumococci, and Haemophilus, the zone diameter breakpoints could be (mm) >/=24/<19 and >/=24/<24, respectively.
TI  - Changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections in 11 teaching hospitals in Taiwan between 1993 and 2006.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Healthcare-associated infections, formerly known as nosocomial infections, are one of the most important issues in current practice. Understanding trends in overall infection rates, as well as their incidence and proportion among different causative organisms, can help us to better define our infection control methods and therapy goals. To understand the changing epidemiology of nosocomial bloodstream infections (BSI) in Taiwan, we retrospectively collected nosocomial infection data from 11 hospitals and examined the trends and changing patterns of nosocomial BSI. METHODS: Eleven major teaching hospitals in Taiwan were invited to participate in the study. The overall density of nosocomial infections and major BSI-causing organisms, including Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida species, were collected. The distribution of the different Candida species was also recorded. Background parameters from the 11 hospitals, including the size of the hospital, hospital capacity, the number of blood stream infection events, and average length of stay, were also recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of nosocomial BSI ranged 0.23-2.56 per 1,000 patient-days, which accounted for 8-43% of all nosocomial infections. The most common causative organism of nosocomial bacteremia was S. aureus, ranging 0.88-0.01 per 1,000 patient-days. Overall, the incidence of S. aureus bacteremia has decreased over the last 13 years, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.053). The rate of Candida fungemia (p < 0.01) and A. baumannii (p = 0.03) bacteremia increased significantly. C. albicans accounted for most cases of nosocomial fungemia, ranging from 40% to 80%, followed by Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis and Candida glabrata. However, the incidence varied significantly from hospital to hospital, and the highest incidence was observed in a cancer center. CONCLUSION: The overall incidence rate of S. aureus bacteremia in the 11 major hospitals studied had decreased over the last decade, though the difference was not statistically significant. However, the rate of Candida fungemia and A. baumannii bacteremia had increased significantly.
TI  - Efficacy of concurrent application of chlorhexidine gluconate and povidone iodine against six nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) and povidone iodine (PI) are rarely used concurrently despite a lack of evidence regarding functional incompatibility of these agents. METHODS: CHG and PI, alone and combined, were evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible S aureus [MSSA] and methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli using checkerboard microbroth dilution techniques. Minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) was the concentration (percent wt/vol) that reduced bacterial burden >/= 5-log(10) colony-forming units/mL at 2 hours when compared with bacterial densities in growth controls. Fractional bactericidal concentration indexes (FBCIs) were calculated to determine CHG and PI compatibility. Additionally, tissue plugs from freshly excised porcine vaginal mucosa were infected with S aureus (MSSA), treated for 2 hours with CHG 3%, PI 5%, or CHG 3% and PI 5% combined and then viable bacteria on the tissue plugs enumerated. RESULTS: In broth, CHG demonstrated dose-dependent bactericidal activity, whereas PI activity was all-or-none. All isolates studied were similarly susceptible to CHG (MBCs: 0.0078% +/- 0.0019%, 0.0069% +/- 0.0026%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0024% +/- 0.0005%, 0.0059% +/- 0.0%, and 0.0029% +/- 0.0%, respectively). The MBCs of PI were identical (0.625%) for all isolates. Overall, FBCI calculations showed indifference. Treatment of MSSA-infected porcine tissue for 2 hours demonstrated that the CHG-PI combination was superior to either antiseptic alone. CONCLUSION: FBCIs, determined in broth culture, indicate that combining CHG and PI had no negative impact on antisepsis. Moreover, data from an ex vivo porcine mucosal infection model suggest a potential benefit when combining the 2 antiseptic agents.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in trauma patients is associated with lower mortality: results from EU-VAP study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Differences in trauma patients developing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) are described regarding etiology and risk factors associated. We aim to describe the differences in outcomes in trauma and nontrauma patients with VAP. METHODS: A prospective, observational study conducted in 27 intensive care units from nine European countries. We included patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for >48 hours who developed VAP. Logistic regression model was used to assess the factors independently associated with mortality in trauma patients with VAP. RESULTS: A total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 465 developed VAP and of these 128 (27.5%) were trauma patients. Trauma patients were younger than nontrauma (45.3 +/- 19.4 vs. 61.1 +/- 16.7, p < 0.0001). Nontrauma had higher simplified acute physiology score II compared with trauma patients (45.5 +/- 16.3 vs. 41.1 +/- 15.2, p = 0.009). Most prevalent pathogens in trauma patients with early VAP were Enterobacteriaceae spp. (46.9% vs. 27.8%, p = 0.06) followed by methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (30.6% vs. 13%, p = 0.03) and then Haemophilus influenzae (14.3% vs. 1.9%, p = 0.02), and the most prevalent pathogen in late VAP was Acinetobacter baumannii (12.2% vs. 44.4%, p < 0.0001). Mortality was higher in nontrauma patients than in trauma patients (42.6% vs. 17.2%, p < 0.001, odds ratio [OR] = 3.55, 95%CI = 2.14-5.88). A logistic regression model adjusted for sex, age, severity of illness at intensive care unit admission, and sepsis-related organ failure assessment score at the day of VAP diagnosis confirmed that trauma was associated with a lower mortality compared with nontrauma patients (odds ratio [OR] = 0.37, 95%CI = 0.21-0.65). CONCLUSIONS: Trauma patients developing VAP had different demographic characteristics and episodes of etiology. After adjustment for potential confounders, VAP episodes in trauma patients are associated with lower mortality when compared with nontrauma patients.
TI  - Nosocomial infections and multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms in the pediatric intensive care unit.
AB  - Nosocomial infections in Pediatric Intensive Care Units (PICUs) caused by multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms are increasing. This review attempts to report on significant findings in the current literature related to nosocomial infections in PICU settings with an international perspective. The types of nosocomial infections are addressed, including catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, urinary tract infections, gastrointestinal infections and post-surgical wound infections. A review of emerging resistant bacterial pathogens includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus sp., Clostridium difficile, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing strains and multi-drug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Basic and enhanced infection control methods for the management and control of multidrug-resistant organisms are also summarized with an emphasis on prevention.
TI  - Progress and challenges in implementing the research on ESKAPE pathogens.
AB  - The ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter species) are responsible for a substantial percentage of nosocomial infections in the modern hospital and represent the vast majority of isolates whose resistance to antimicrobial agents presents serious therapeutic dilemmas for physicians. Over the years, improved molecular biology techniques have led to detailed information about individual resistance mechanisms in all these pathogens. However, there remains a lack of compelling data on the interplay between resistance mechanisms and between the bacteria themselves. In addition, data on the impact of clinical interventions to decrease the prevalence of resistance are also lacking. The difficulty in identifying novel antimicrobial agents with reliable activity against these pathogens argues for an augmentation of research in the basic and population science of resistance, as well as careful studies to identify optimal strategies for infection control and antimicrobial use.
TI  - The impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones (FQ) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(PMR), Acinetobacter multiresistant (AMR) and multidrug resistant bacteria(MDRB). AIM: Our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of FQ and antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and A. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. METHODS: The study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2003). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the French Society of Microbiology. The consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed as the antimicrobial use density (AD) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in Grams converted to defined daily doses (DDD) and the number of day hospitalization. Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0. 0 5 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in P. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05). Moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) and ceftazidime (rs=0. 95, p<0. 05) in P. aeruginosa . A restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in P. aeruginosa (p<0, 05 ). The use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with MRSA (rs=0. 96, P<0. 05) . The restriction use of FQ was significantly associated with a decrease of MRSA. The consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (P<0. 05) with resistance of ceftazidime in K. pneumoniae. However, there is not a correlation (P> 0. 05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in A. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. CONCLUSION: Our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of MDRB. The use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Preventing catheter-associated urinary tract infections: An executive summary of  the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, Elimination Guide.
AB  - The Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC) began publishing their series of Elimination Guides in 2007. Since then, 9 Elimination Guides have been developed that cover a range of important infection prevention issues, including the prevention of catheter-related bloodstream infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs), as well as mediastinitis surgical site surveillance. Multidrug-resistant organisms, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Clostridium difficile, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, also have been the focus of APIC Elimination Guides. The content of each of these Elimination Guides will be summarized in a series of upcoming Brief Reports published in The Journal. This article provides an executive summary of the APIC Elimination Guide for CAUTIs. Infection preventionists are encouraged to obtain the original, full-length APIC Elimination Guide for more thorough coverage of CAUTI prevention.
TI  - Chemical composition and antibacterial activities of Illicium verum against antibiotic-resistant pathogens.
AB  - In recent years, human pathogenic microorganisms have developed multiple drug resistance and caused serious nosocomial infections. In this study, we identified four new antimicrobial compounds from the Chinese herbal medicine Illicium verum and assessed their antibacterial efficacies. The supercritical CO(2) and ethanol extracts of Illicium verum showed substantial antibacterial activity against 67 clinical drug-resistant isolates, including 27 Acinetobacter baumannii, 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 20 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. The diethyl ether (EE) fraction obtained from partition extraction and supercritical CO(2) extracts revealed an antibacterial activity with a minimum inhibitory concentration value of 0.15-0.70 mg/mL and 0.11 mg/mL, respectively. The EE fraction of I. verum showed synergetic effects with some commercial antibiotics. The antimicrobial mechanism was investigated with killing curves and scanning electron microscopy observation. The chemical components of the extracts were analyzed by spectrophotometry; (E)-anethole, anisyl acetone, anisyl alcohol, and anisyl aldehyde exhibited antibacterial activity against different clinical isolates. These extracts from I. verum can be further developed into antibiotic medicines due to their proven antibacterial activity.
TI  - Design, synthesis, and crystal structures of 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones as potent inhibitors of Acinetobacter baumannii OXA-24 carbapenemase.
AB  - Class D beta-lactamases represent a growing and diverse class of penicillin-inactivating enzymes that are usually resistant to commercial beta-lactamase inhibitors. As many such enzymes are found in multi-drug resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, novel beta-lactamase inhibitors are urgently needed. Five unique 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillanic acid sulfones (1-5) were synthesized and tested against OXA-24, a clinically important beta-lactamase that inactivates carbapenems and is found in A. baumannii. Based upon the roles Tyr112 and Met223 play in the OXA-24 beta-lactamase, we also engineered two variants (Tyr112Ala and Tyr112Ala,Met223Ala) to test the hypothesis that the hydrophobic tunnel formed by these residues influences inhibitor recognition. IC(50) values against OXA-24 and two OXA-24 beta-lactamase variants ranged from 10 +/- 1 (4 vs WT) to 338 +/- 20 nM (5 vs Tyr112Ala, Met223Ala). Compound 4 possessed the lowest K(i) (500 +/- 80 nM vs WT), and 1 possessed the highest inactivation efficiency (k(inact)/K(i) = 0.21 +/- 0.02 muM(-1) s(-1)). Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry revealed a single covalent adduct, suggesting the formation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. X-ray structures of OXA-24 complexed to four inhibitors (2.0-2.6 A) reveal the formation of stable bicyclic aromatic intermediates with their carbonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole. These data provide the first structural evidence that 6-alkylidene-2'-substituted penicillin sulfones are effective mechanism-based inactivators of class D beta-lactamases. Their unique chemistry makes them developmental candidates. Mechanisms for class D hydrolysis and inhibition are discussed, and a pathway for the evolution of the BlaR1 sensor of Staphylococcus aureus to the class D beta-lactamases is proposed.
TI  - Room decontamination with UV radiation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the effectiveness of a UV-C-emitting device to eliminate  clinically important nosocomial pathogens in a contaminated hospital room. METHODS: This study was carried out in a standard but empty hospital room (phase 1) and in a room previously occupied by a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) infection (phase 2) in an acute care tertiary hospital in North Carolina from January 21 through September 21, 2009. During phase 1, 8 x 8 cm Formica sheets contaminated with approximately 10(4)-10(5) organisms of MRSA, VRE, multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii, or Clostridium difficile spores were placed in a hospital room, both in direct line of sight of the UV-C device and behind objects. After timed exposure, the presence of the microbes was assessed. During phase 2, specific sites in rooms that had housed patients with MRSA or VRE infection were sampled before and after UV-C irradiation. After timed exposure, the presence of MRSA and VRE and total colony counts were assessed. RESULTS: In our test room, the effectiveness of UV-C radiation in reducing the counts of vegetative bacteria on surfaces was more than 99.9% within 15 minutes, and the reduction in C. difficile spores was 99.8% within 50 minutes. In rooms occupied by patients with MRSA, UV-C irradiation of approximately 15 minutes duration resulted in a decrease in total CFUs per plate (mean, 384 CFUs vs 19 CFUs; P < .001), in the number of samples positive for MRSA (81 [20.3%] of 400 plates vs 2 [0.5%] of 400 plates; P < .001), and in MRSA counts per MRSA-positive plate (mean, 37 CFUs vs 2 CFUs; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS: This UV-C device was effective in eliminating vegetative bacteria on contaminated surfaces both in the line of sight and behind objects within approximately 15 minutes and in eliminating C. difficile spores within 50 minutes.
TI  - Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus acticoat and aquacel as an antiseptic dressing: an in vitro study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The treatment of burn wounds is still a challenge regarding the management of antiseptic wound conditioning. Especially, in the United States, silver-containing dressings, such as Acticoat and Aquacel are frequently used. Because silver-containing dressings have well-known drawbacks such as an antimicrobial lack against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we sought to develop an alternative dressing method. In previous studies, we could demonstrate the excellent antiseptic properties of acetic acid against common burn unit germs, and in another study, the feasibility and suitability of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix as an antiseptic dressing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was designed to test the in vitro antimicrobial effect of a Suprathel-acetic acid matrix versus Acticoat and Aquacel. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria strains were tested: Escherichia coli, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. RESULTS: The tests showed an excellent bactericidal effect of the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as Proteus vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The efficiency was superior to that of Acicoat and Aquacel. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the notion, that the Suprathel-acetic acid matrix has an excellent bactericidal effect and therefore seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent in the treatment of burn wounds.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii and MRSA contamination on reusable phlebotomy tourniquets.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: A study was undertaken to determine the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) contamination on reusable phlebotomy tourniquets at Wilford Hall Medical Center, Lackland AFB, TX. DESIGN: Reusable tourniquets (n=200) were collected after being used for one day in the outpatient blood collection center (n=100) or during morning blood collection rounds on inpatient wards (n=100). Tourniquets were cultured and growth was screened for A. baumannii and S. aureus. A. baumannii isolates were identified using colonial morphology, oxidase, and GNI+ card on Vitek Legacy. S. aureus isolates were identified and screened for MRSA using colonial morphology, catalase, Staphaurex, and Oxacillin screening agar. RESULTS: Each outpatient tourniquet was used on an average of 33 patients and each inpatient tourniquet was used on an average of 11 patients. The overall contamination rate was 9% (18/200). A. baumannii was isolated from 11% (11/100) of the outpatient tourniquets and 3% (3/100) of the inpatient tourniquets. Methicillin-susceptible S. aureus was isolated from 2% (2/100) of the outpatient tourniquets and 3% (3/100) of the inpatient tourniquets. No MRSA was isolated. One ou'tpatient tourniquet had both A. baumannii and methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. CONCLUSIONS: Reusable tourniquets could serve as a potential reservoir for bacterial pathogens.
TI  - [Formation of bacterial biofilm on deep vein catheters in burn patients and its significance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the biofilm (BF) formation of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) on the surface of deep vein catheters in burn patients after infection. METHODS: The bacteria from deep vein catheters in 20 patients hospitalized from November 2008 to August 2009 were isolated, and were compared with their respective standard stains. Catheters tips were examined with scanning electron microscope (SEM). The semi-quantitative adhesion assay of bacterial BF was performed with modified microtiter-plate test, and the thickness of BF was scanned and measured by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) after double fluorescence staining, after being cultured in vitro for 12, 24, 48, 72 hours and 5 days, respectively. Data were processed with grouped t test. RESULTS: Six strains of SA, 8 strains of AB, and 6 strains of PA, all drug resistant, were isolated from the deep vein catheters. SEM showed that the BF structures on the inner surfaces of catheters were in diverse in their shape and degree, characterized by adherence and flake formation, and embedded in polysaccharide matrix. BF gathered in clusters, forming three-dimensional structure, in which small amount of red blood cells were found. A small number of bacteria were incompletely embedded, with some bacteria adhered to them. The absorbance values for SA after 24, 48 and 72 hours of culture (PCH) were above the cut-off value, the same for AB at PCH 12, 24, 48 and 72, and PA after PCH 48. Except for PA standard strain, CLSM showed scattered green fluorescence, mainly close to the bottom of plate, while the red fluorescence was observed in full scope at PCH 24 for each strain. At PCH 48 green fluorescence increased obviously and extended upward from the bottom, overlapping partly with red fluorescence, forming yellow fluorescence, and among the bacteria it was most obvious in AB culture, with SA the next. Compared with those of the standard stains, the intensity and quantity of fluorescence from the clinical strains were stronger; at PCH 72 the green fluorescence increased obviously especially for PA and its standard strain, while the yellow fluorescence was full of the scope for other strains. On in vitro culture day 5, the green fluorescence was dispersed and was obvious on the bottom of the plate. BF mature time for AB and SA was PCH 48, and for PA was PCH 72. The BF thickness of AB was (18.2 +/- 3.6) microm at PCH 72, which was thicker than that [(9.4 +/- 2.6) microm] of its standard strain (t = 5.42, P < 0.05), and was also the thickest among the three clinically found strains. CONCLUSIONS: SA, AB and PA, which are commonly found bacteria in burn patients, can form BF in deep vein catheters. Their ability to form BF seems to be stronger than other usually pathogenic strains, especially AB, which is the important pathogen leading to catheter related infection.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant bacteria at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico: special focus on Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Our aim was to determine the prevalence of multidrug resistance of Acinetobacter  baumannii and other pathogens at a tertiary-care teaching hospital in Mexico over a 3-year period. Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (n = 550), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 250), some Enterobacteriaceae species (n = 500) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 250) collected over a 3-year period were included. Susceptibility tests were performed by the broth microdilution method. 74% of A. baumannii, 40% of Escherichia coli, 34% of P. aeruginosa, 22% of Klebsiella pneumoniae, 9% of Enterobacter cloacae, and 7% of Serratia sp. were multidrug resistant. 59% of A. baumannii clinical isolates were meropenem-resistant. A. baumannii isolates from the lower respiratory tract were the most susceptible, followed by urine clinical isolates. Species from Enterobacteriaceae showed susceptibility rates higher than 90% to meropenem and tigecycline and Serratia sp. showed the highest susceptibility to the drugs evaluated. For P. aeruginosa, the most potent drug was levofloxacin, followed by meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam. With regard to S. aureus, 96% of the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, followed by tigecycline and minocycline (91% of strains susceptible). The high multidrug resistance observed underscores the need for surveillance of bacterial drug resistance.
TI  - Point prevalence surveys of healthcare-associated infection in 13 hospitals in Hubei Province, China, 2007-2008.
AB  - Successive point prevalence surveys were conducted in November 2007 and 2008 to monitor the prevalence of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) in 13 grade III, 1st class hospitals in Hubei Province of China, using the case definition criteria established by the Ministry of Health in the People's Republic of China. In total, of 20 350 patients surveyed, 833 (4.09%) HCAIs were observed in 790 (3.88%) patients. There was no significant difference between the overall prevalence of HCAI in 2007 (4.14%) and 2008 (3.72%). Respiratory tract infection was the most common HCAI (63.15%), followed by surgical site infection (9.60%) and urinary tract infection (8.64%). Only 35.29% (294/833) of HCAI patients had positive microbiology results. Gram-negative bacteria were isolated most frequently and the most frequent organism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa, followed by Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus. Antibiotic use was documented for 10,344 (50.83%) patients, and cephalosporins, penicillins, and quinolones were the most commonly used agents for treatment or prophylaxis.
TI  - Influence of third-generation cephalosporin resistance on adult in-hospital mortality from post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical features, etiology and predictors of in-hospital mortality in adults with post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis. METHODS: This retrospective analysis included 60 adult patients with culture-proven post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis hospitalized between September 2006 and August 2008. RESULTS: Of the 60 patients, 88.3% had monomicrobial infection and 11.7% had mixed infection. The mean duration from the first neurosurgical procedure to the diagnosis of meningitis was 21 days (range, 1-134 days). The median frequency of neurosurgical procedure before meningitis was 1 (range, 1-5). A total of 69 isolates were identified from the cerebrospinal fluid, the most common pathogens were Gram-negative bacilli (43, 62.3%), followed by Gram-positive bacteria (24, 34.8%). The three most common Gram-negative bacilli were Serratia marcescens (7, 10.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6, 8.7%), and Enterobacter cloacae (4, 5.8%). Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii isolates comprised less than 3%. Notably, glucose non-fermenting Gram-negative bacilli other than Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas spp. accounted for 11.6% of the total. Of the Gram-negative bacilli, resistance rates to the third-generation cephalosporins, ceftriaxone and ceftazidime, were 58.1% and 34.9%, respectively. The two most common Gram-positive pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus (10, 14.5%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (including S. epidermidis) (10, 14.5%). The in-hospital mortality rate was 15.0%, which was significantly related to Gram-negative bacilli resistant to third-generation cephalosporins in multivariate analysis (adjusted odds ratio = 33.65; p = 0.047). CONCLUSION: These findings may portend the spread of serious resistance to third-generation cephalosporins in nosocomial Gram-negative bacilli throughout the neurosurgical units, suggestive of the need to reassess the empirical use of third-generation cephalosporins in post-neurosurgical bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Overview perspective of bacterial resistance.
AB  - The rapidly escalating prevalence of antimicrobial resistance is a global concern. This reduced susceptibility to currently available antimicrobial agents coupled with the progressive shortage of newly approved compounds is a worrisome situation. Major problems are encountered for a growing number of Gram-positive (i.e., Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp.) and Gram-negative pathogens (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae). We provide an overview of bacterial resistance focusing on the most common pathogens responsible for infection in both the community and healthcare settings. In addition, several strategies to curb antimicrobial resistance are also discussed. It is increasingly evident that without the introduction of novel antimicrobial agents, a return to the clinical outcomes associated with the pre-antibiotic era are inevitable.
TI  - Diacyl glycerol arginine-based surfactants: biological and physicochemical properties of catanionic formulations.
AB  - In this paper, we report on a catanionic vesicles-based strategy to reduce the cytotoxicity of the diacyl glycerol arginine-based synthetic surfactants 1,2-dimyristoyl-rac-glycero-3-O-(N(alpha)-acetyl-L-arginine) hydrochloride (1414RAc) and 1,2-dilauroyl-rac-glycero-3-O-(N(alpha)-acetyl-L-arginine) hydrochloride (1212RAc). The behavior of these surfactants was studied either as pure components or after their formulation as pseudo-tetra-chain catanionic mixtures with phosphatidylglycerol (PG) and as cationic mixtures with 1,2-dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) used as control. The antimicrobial activity of the negatively charged formulations against Acinetobacter baumannii was maintained with respect to the surfactant alone, while a significant improvement of the antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus was observed, together with a strong decrease of hemolytic activity. The influence of the net charge of the catanionic vesicles on membrane selectivity was studied using model membranes. The dynamics of surface tension changes induced by the addition of 1414RAc/PG aqueous dispersions into phospholipid monolayers composed of zwitterionic DPPC as model system for mammalian membranes and of negatively charged PG mimicking cytoplasmic membrane of gram-positive bacteria was followed by tensiometry. Our results constitute a proof of principle that tuning formulation can reduce the cytotoxicity of many surfactants, opening their possible biological applications.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii is not associated with osteomyelitis in a rat model: a pilot study.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR AB) with and without Staphylococcus aureus (SA) is a commonly isolated organism in infected segmental bone defects in combat-related trauma in Iraq and Afghanistan. Although MDR AB in visceral infections is a therapeutic challenge, control of infection appears more common for combat-related osteomyelitis. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: Using a rat model, we explored the virulence of MDR AB in segmental bone defects alone and in combination with SA. METHODS: Segmental defects in 60 rat femurs were created, stabilized, and inoculated with MDR AB alone and 60 with MDR AB and SA. We performed qualitative and quantitative bacteriology and radiographic assessments at 2, 4, and 8 weeks for MDR AB and at 1, 2, and 3 weeks for MDR AB and SA. RESULTS: Quantitative bacteriology revealed a 3- to 5-log decrease in MDR AB from the initial inoculum. After polymicrobial inoculation, only 10 of 60 animals had positive cultures for MDR AB, whereas 59 of 60 animals had positive cultures for SA. Recovered SA were 2 to 5 log greater than the initial inoculum, while there again was a 3- to 5-log decrease in MDR AB. MDR AB alone did not cause bony lysis, but there was radiographic evidence of new bone formation in 67% of the segmental defects. Osteolysis was noted with MDR AB and SA. CONCLUSIONS: MDR AB did not appear to cause or contribute to clinically apparent osteomyelitis in this pilot study. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Resolution of infections in combat-related segmental bone defects inoculated with MDR AB may be attributable to low virulence. Additional studies are needed to confirm low virulence and bone formation with MDR AB.
TI  - Secular trends of healthcare-associated infections at a teaching hospital in Taiwan, 1981-2007.
AB  - The National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) adopted international guidelines for surveillance and control of healthcare-associated infection (HCAI) in 1981. This report describes the secular trends in HCAI at the NTUH over the past 27 years according to site of infection, aetiological agents and control measures. Clinical and microbiological data were collected by infection prevention and control nurses using a standardised case-record form. Specific control programmes were implemented and/or intensified as needed. Poisson or negative binomial regression analysis was used to quantify time trends of the incidence of HCAI. The annual number of discharges increased from 25 074 to 91 234 with a parallel increase in the Charlson comorbidity index. Active HCAI surveillance and periodic feedback were associated with a marked decrease in surgical site infections from 1981 to 2007 (2.5 vs 0.5 episodes per 100 procedures, P<0.0001). On the other hand, there was a 4.8-fold increase in bloodstream infections (BSIs) (0.39 vs 1.88 episodes per 100 discharges, P<0.0001). The average annual increase of pathogen-specific HCAI incidence during 1981-2007 was 11.4% for meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 75.4% for extensively drug-resistant A. baumannii (XDRAB), and 7.5% for Candida albicans (P<0.0001, respectively). The infection prevention and control programme was upgraded in 2004 by implementing annual, intensive, project-based control programmes, and decreases in rates of HCAI, BSI, MRSA and XDRAB were observed. This long term study demonstrates the need to couple surveillance of HCAI with focused control programmes. Hospitals must invest in adequate manpower to accomplish these goals.
TI  - Antimicrobial peptides with therapeutic potential from skin secretions of the Marsabit clawed frog Xenopus borealis (Pipidae).
AB  - Nine peptides with differential growth inhibitory activity against Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were isolated from norepinephrine-stimulated skin secretions of the tetraploid frog Xenopus borealis Parker, 1936 (Pipidae). Structural characterization of the peptides demonstrated that they were orthologous to magainin-2 (1 peptide), peptide glycine-leucine-amide, PGLa (2 peptides), caerulein-precursor fragments, CPF (4 peptides), and xenopsin-precursor fragments, XPF (2 peptides), previously isolated from Xenopus laevis and X. amieti. In addition, a second magainin-related peptide (G**KFLHSAGKFGKAFLGEVMIG) containing a two amino acid residue deletion compared with magainin-2 was identified that had only weak antimicrobial activity. The peptide with the greatest potential for development into a therapeutically valuable anti-infective agent was CPF-B1 (GLGSLLGKAFKIGLKTVGKMMGGAPREQ) with MIC=5 microM against E. coli, MIC=5 microM against S. aureus, and MIC=25 microM against Candida albicans, and low hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LC(50)>200 microM). This peptide was also the most abundant antimicrobial peptide in the skin secretions. CPF-B1 was active against clinical isolates of the nosocomial pathogens, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB) with MIC values in the range 4-8 microM.
TI  - [Investigation of distribution of bacteria and fungi in severe acute pancreatitis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the spectrum of bacteria and fungi in different sites in severe acute pancreatitis (SAP). METHODS: The prospective study was performed in 205 patients with SAP treated from January 2000 to December 2008. The Infection rate of bacteria and fungi was observed prospectively in pancreatic necrosis and(or) pus form abdomen, body fluids and deep vein catheter in SAP. Body fluids and pancreatic necrosis were cultured twice a week. Central venous catheter was cultured when it had been placed for two weeks. Blood was cultured for bacteria and fungi when body temperature was more than 39 degrees C. Constituent ratio of bacteria and fungi was observed in different sites and in all sites within 28 days after onset of SAP. RESULTS: There were 937 pathogens, among which infection rates of gram-negative bacteria was higher than gram-positive bacteria and fungi (P < 0.05), the infection rates of gam-positive bacteria and fungi were similar. Infection rates of gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis (55.2%), bile (55.4%), blood (68.1%) and central venous catheter (44.4%) were increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-positive bacteria and (30.2%, 33.9%, 23.4%, 38.9%) and fungi (14.6%, 10.7%, 8.5%, 16.7%); however, infection rate of fungi (59.6%) was increased significantly (P < 0.05) compared with gram-negative bacteria (24.0%) and gram-positive bacteria (16.3%) in urine; infection rate of gram-negative bacteria (53.2%) was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of fungi (27.1%) and gram-positive bacteria (19.7%) in sputum. Infection rate of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia) in gram-negative bacteria in pancreatic necrosis, bile, blood, central venous catheter and sputum was significantly higher than that of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter cloacae) (P < 0.01); infection rate of zymogenic bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) was higher significantly (P < 0.01) than that of non-zymogenic bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii). Infection rate of staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus was significantly higher (P < 0.05) than that of Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium in pancreatic necrosis and sputum;but infection rate of Enterococcus faecium in bile and urine was significantly higher than other gram-positive bacteria (P < 0.05). There was not difference among gram-positive bacteria;however, infection rate of Staphylococcus epidermidis in central venous catheter was increased significantly (P < 0.05). Infection rate of candida mycoderma in pancreatic necrosis, bile, urine and sputum was significantly higher than that of tricho bacteria (P < 0.05). The peak of infection rate of microbes in body fluid was within 2 to 3 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Constituent ratio in gram-negative, gram-positive bacteria and fungi as well as their species in different sites is diverse. The peak of infection rate of microbes is 2 to 3 weeks after onset of the disease.
TI  - Rifampin resistance in carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in Siriraj Hospital, Thailand.
AB  - There is a growing evidence on emergence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) in Thailand and recent treatment guidelines recommend a combination therapy using carbapenem and/or polymyxin with rifampin. Rifampin would be added in a combination therapy. The susceptibility of this pathogen to rifampin is not known, so we studied the rifampin susceptibility and possible mechanisms of resistance used by CRAB. The disk diffusion test was performed on 111 clinical isolates using 5 microg rifampin disk following CLSI guidelines. The inhibition zone was interpreted based upon the recommendation for Staphylococcus aureus (inhibition zone < 20 mm = resistant). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the primers specific for arr-2 encoding rifampin ADP-ribosyltransferase was performed in all isolates. The rpoB DNA sequences from two isolates, with or without arr-2, were compared. All isolates under study were rifampin resistant. Inhibition zone was < 14 mm for all isolates. The arr-2 was positive for 35 isolates (31.5%) and these isolates correlated with high level of resistance (inhibition zone < 10mm). The DNA sequences of rpoB genes in arr-2 negative isolate showed mutations L904S, P906R, K909N and M1262K that might have roles in rifampin resistance. Mutations of rpoB genes in some isolates and possession of arr-2 in class 1 integron element were mechanisms for rifampin resistance and these resistant determinants can disseminate through both vertical and horizontal gene transfer. Under this circumstance, it is not recommended to use rifampin in the treatment of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii in Thailand.
TI  - [Clinical relevance of time-to-positivity in BACTEC9240 blood culture system].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Continuous monitoring systems have allowed determination of the time-to-positivity (TTP). We evaluated the clinical relevance of TTP in the BACTEC9240 system (Becton-Dickinson, USA). METHODS: A total of 2,354 vials of positive blood cultures were evaluated over 2 months. TTP was monitored from each of BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F (BD) or Pediatric Plus/F and Lytic Anaerobic/F bottles, and the differential time-to-positivity (DTP) for blood samples drawn simultaneously via catheter and a peripheral site was determined. RESULTS: The average TTP of the positive vials was 17.4 hr, and 79.9% and 95.2% of the vials showed positivity within 24 and 48 hr, respectively. While the average TTP values for Aeromonas hydrophila, Bacillus cereus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Streptococcus pneumoniae were less than 10 hr, those for Candida spp., anaerobes, Propionibacterium acnes, Corynebacterium spp, Bacillus spp. other than cereus, and coagulase-negative staphylococci were 35.3, 27.0, 56.8, 45.8, 23.0, and 26.3 hr, respectively. The negative predictive values of TTP over 24 hr to predict Staphylococcus aureus among staphylococci and S. pneumoniae among alpha-hemolytic streptococci were 76.7% and 100%, respectively. Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus faecalis showed shorter TTP in anaerobic vials than in aerobic vials. DTP of more than 2 hr was observed for 27.8%, 72.2%, and 45.5% of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TTP can be used to discriminate pathogens and contaminants. The shorter TTP in anaerobic vials of certain Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus spp. would facilitate further identification. DTP is useful for diagnosing catheter-related bloodstream infection by S. aureus, S. epidermidis, and Candida spp.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 2 against nosocomial strains.
AB  - Human beta-defensin 2 (hBD-2) is a 41-amino acid cationic peptide of the innate immune system that serves as antimicrobial molecule. We determined the bactericidal activity of synthetic hBD-2 against nosocomial strains belonging to eight different bacterial species and exhibiting various antimicrobial resistance phenotypes. The native disulfide connectivity was found essential for the bactericidal activity of hBD-2, while sodium chloride concentration was reversely associated with its potency. hBD-2 exhibited high bactericidal activity against Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus clinical strains. Characteristically, A. baumannii strains that exhibited multi-drug resistant (MDR) phenotypes were susceptible to lower concentrations of hBD-2 (vLD(90)=3.25-4.5 microg/ml) in comparison with non-MDR (wild-type) A. baumannii strains (vLD(90)=3.90-9.35 microg/ml). Bactericidal activity of hBD-2 was less pronounced against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis strains but was significantly enhanced against strains of these species that exhibited resistance to several beta-lactam antibiotics. These observations give indications that the natural hBD-2 has a potential therapeutic role against bacterial pathogens and particularly against those exhibiting MDR phenotypes.
TI  - A study of cytotoxicity of novel chlorokojic acid derivatives with their antimicrobial and antiviral activities.
AB  - A series of 6-chloromethyl-3-hydroxy-2-substituted 4H-pyran-4-one derivatives were synthesized and tested for their antimicrobial and antiviral activities. Mannich base derivatives were prepared through the reaction of substituted piperazine or piperidine derivatives on chlorokojic acid and formaline. The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by IR, (1)H and (13)C NMR, ESI-MS, and elemental analysis. According to the activity studies, compounds 2-7 (MIC: 1-2 microg/mL) were found to be highly active against Bacillus subtilis and Staphylococcus aureus, while compounds 3, 5 and 6 showed significant activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Also, compounds 2-7 were more remarkably active against Candida albicans and Candida parapsilosis (MIC: 4-8 microg/mL). Additionally, compound 2 was the most active one against RNA virus PI-3.
TI  - Dramatic increase of third-generation cephalosporin-resistant E. coli in German intensive care units: secular trends in antibiotic drug use and bacterial resistance, 2001 to 2008.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the present study was to analyse secular trends in antibiotic consumption and resistance data from a network of 53 intensive care units (ICUs). METHODS: The study involved prospective unit and laboratory-based surveillance in 53 German ICUs from 2001 through 2008. Data were calculated on the basis of proportions of nonduplicate resistant isolates, resistance densities (that is, the number of resistant isolates of a species per 1,000 patient-days) and an antimicrobial usage density (AD) expressed as daily defined doses (DDD) and normalised per 1,000 patient-days. RESULTS: Total mean antibiotic use remained stable over time and amounted to 1,172 DDD/1,000 patient-days (range 531 to 2,471). Carbapenem use almost doubled to an AD of 151 in 2008. Significant increases were also calculated for quinolone (AD of 163 in 2008) and third-generation and fourth-generation cephalosporin use (AD of 117 in 2008). Aminoglycoside consumption decreased substantially (AD of 86 in 2001 and 24 in 2008). Resistance proportions were as follows in 2001 and 2008, respectively: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) 26% and 20% (P = 0.006; trend test showed a significant decrease), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) faecium 2.3% and 8.2% (P = 0.008), third-generation cephalosporin (3GC)-resistant Escherichia. coli 1.2% and 19.7% (P < 0.001), 3GC-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae 3.8% and 25.5% (P < 0.001), imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii 1.1% and 4.5% (P = 0.002), and imipenem-resistant K. pneumoniae 0.4% and 1.1%. The resistance densities did not change for MRSA but increased significantly for VRE faecium and 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. In 2008, the resistance density for MRSA was 3.73, 0.48 for VRE, 1.39 for 3GC-resistant E. coli and 0.82 for K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Although total antibiotic use did not change over time in German ICUs, carbapenem use doubled. This is probably due to the rise in 3GC-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Increased carbapenem consumption was associated with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria and imipenem-resistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia: role of colonizers and value of routine endotracheal aspirate cultures.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the role of colonizers in the causation of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) and the value of routine pre-VAP endotracheal aspirate (EA) cultures in appropriately treating VAP. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was conducted over a period of 15 months. Two hundred patients on mechanical ventilation for>48h were studied. RESULTS: Acinetobacter spp (33.7%) and Pseudomonas spp (29.8%) were the most common colonizers. Of the 200 patients, 36 developed VAP. In 20 VAP patients, the pre-VAP EA culture-based strategy was not useful. However, in the remaining 16 VAP patients, a pre-VAP EA culture-based strategy would have appropriately treated 13 (81%; 95% confidence interval (CI) 62-100%), in comparison to only nine (56%; 95% CI 32-80%) by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) strategy. The seven patients in whom the ATS guidelines were inappropriate had Acinetobacter spp and Pseudomonas spp resistant to the higher antibiotics recommended by the ATS for multidrug-resistant pathogens. The positive predictive values of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated from pre-VAP EA cultures were 88%, 83%, and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSION: VAP patients should be treated based on ATS guidelines, but whenever P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, and MRSA are isolated from pre-VAP EA cultures, the initial antibiotic therapy should be extended to treat these.
TI  - The impact of fluoroquinolones use on antibiotic resistance in an intensive care  burn department.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoroquinolones (FQ) use has been identified as a risk factor for colonization and infection to methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosae multiresistant(PMR) , Acinetobacter multiresistant (AMR) and multidrug resistant bacteria(MDRB). AIM: Our study proposes to measure the annual antibiotic use of FQ and antimicrobial resistance in P. aeruginosa, S. aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae and A. baumannii in an intensive care burn unit. METHODS: The study was conducted during a 4 year period (1 January 2000 to 31 December 2003). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed using the disk diffusion method as recommended by the French Society of Microbiology. The consumption of the following antibiotics: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin was expressed as the antimicrobial use density (AD) taking into account the quantity of antibiotics in Grams converted to defined daily doses (DDD) and the number of day hospitalization. Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05 for the corresponding correlation coefficient. RESULTS: There were statistically significant relationship between use of ciprofloxacin and resistance in P. aeruginosa to this drug (rs=0.95, p<0.05). Moreover, the ciprofloxacin consumption was correlated with resistance to imipenem (rs=0.95, p<0.05) and ceftazidime (rs=0.95, p<0.05) in P. aeruginosa . A restriction use of ciprofloxacin has been taken during 2003, it is followed by a significant decrease of resistance to imipenem, ceftazidime and ciprofloxacin in P. aeruginosa (p<0, 05). The use of fluoroquinolones was correlated significantly with MRSA (rs=0.96, P<0.05) . The restriction use of FQ was significantly associated with a decrease of MRSA. The consumption of ciprofloxacin was also correlated (P<0.05) with resistance of ceftazidime in K. pneumoniae. However, there is not a correlation (P> 0.05) between fluoroquinolones use and resistance in A. baumannii as well in ciprofloxacin, imipenem and ceftazidime. Our study illustrates the pressure of selection of fluoroquinolones use in the development of MDRB. The use and or the duration of treatment with theses antibiotics should be rationalised as part of efforts to control the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria.
TI  - Causes of infection after earthquake, China, 2008.
AB  - To determine which organisms most commonly cause infection after natural disasters, we cultured specimens from injured earthquake survivors in Wenchuan, China, 2008. Of 123 cultures, 46 (59%) grew only 1 type of pathogenic bacteria. Smear was more effective than culture for early diagnosis of gas gangrene. Early diagnosis and treatment of wounds are crucial.
TI  - Clinical and microbiological spectrum of necrotizing fasciitis in surgical patients at a Philippine university medical centre.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study describes the clinical characteristics, bacteriology and risk factors for mortality of patients with necrotizing fasciitis (NF), seen in a university medical centre. METHODS: The medical charts of NF patients admitted to the institution from January 2004 to July 2007 were retrieved and reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The majority of the 67 patients included in the study presented with localized nonspecific inflammatory manifestations: tenderness (94%), warmth (86%), oedema (76%), skin necrosis (75%), and ulceration (68%). Diabetes mellitus (22%) was the most common predisposing medical condition. The most frequent isolates were Escherichia coli (44%), Acinetobacter baumannii (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%) and Enterococcus faecium (15%). Overall mortality rate was 36%. Risk factors significantly associated with mortality were truncal involvement (p = 0.034), leukocytosis (p = 0.038), acidosis (p = 0.001), hypoalbuminaemia (p = 0.004), hypocalcaemia (p = 0.000) and hyponatraemia (p = 0.023). Logistic regression analysis revealed acidosis [p < 0.05, odds ratio (OR) = 9] and hypoalbuminaemia (p < 0.05, OR = 14) as significant independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSION: The identified risk factors can inform clinicians of increased mortality risks for certain patients with NF. They should serve as a trigger for more aggressive surgical and critical care, and antimicrobial therapy for these patients.
TI  - Frequent multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii contamination of gloves, gowns, and hands of healthcare workers.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacilli are important nosocomial pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of transmission of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from patients to healthcare workers (HCWs) during routine patient care. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Medical and surgical intensive care units. Methods. We observed HCWs who entered the rooms of patients colonized with MDR A. baumannii or colonized with both MDR A. baumannii and MDR P. aeruginosa. We examined their hands before room entry, their disposable gloves and/or gowns upon completion of patient care, and their hands after removal of gloves and/or gowns and before hand hygiene. RESULTS: Sixty-five interactions occurred with patients colonized with MDR A. baumannii and 134 with patients colonized with both MDR A. baumannii and MDR P. aeruginosa. Of 199 interactions between HCWs and patients colonized with MDR A. baumannii, 77 (38.7% [95% confidence interval {CI}, 31.9%-45.5%]) resulted in HCW contamination of gloves and/or gowns, and 9 (4.5% [95% CI, 1.6%-7.4%]) resulted in contamination of HCW hands after glove removal before hand hygiene. Of 134 interactions with patients colonized with MDR P. aeruginosa, 11 (8.2% [95% CI, 3.6%-12.9%]) resulted in HCW contamination of gloves and/or gowns, and 1 resulted in HCW contamination of hands. Independent risk factors for contamination with MDR A. baumannii were manipulation of wound dressing (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 25.9 [95% CI, 3.1-208.8]), manipulation of artificial airway (aOR, 2.1 [95% CI, 1.1-4.0]), time in room longer than 5 minutes (aOR, 4.3 [95% CI, 2.0-9.1]), being a physician or nurse practitioner (aOR, 7.4 [95% CI, 1.6-35.2]), and being a nurse (aOR, 2.3 [95% CI, 1.1-4.8]). CONCLUSIONS: Gowns, gloves, and unwashed hands of HCWs were frequently contaminated with MDR A. baumannii. MDR A. baumannii appears to be more easily transmitted than MDR P. aeruginosa and perhaps more easily transmitted than previously studied methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. This ease of transmission may help explain the emergence of MDR A. baumannii.

TI  - Bactericidal performance of visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst with silver nanostructures.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Titania dioxide (TiO(2)) photocatalyst is primarily induced by ultraviolet light irradiation. Visible-light responsive anion-doped TiO(2) photocatalysts contain higher quantum efficiency under sunlight and can be used safely in indoor settings without exposing to biohazardous ultraviolet light. The antibacterial efficiency, however, remains to be further improved. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Using thermal reduction method, here we synthesized silver-nanostructures coated TiO(2) thin films that contain a high visible-light responsive antibacterial property. Among our tested titania substrates including TiO(2), carbon-doped TiO(2) [TiO(2) (C)] and nitrogen-doped TiO(2) [TiO(2) (N)], TiO(2) (N) showed the best performance after silver coating. The synergistic antibacterial effect results approximately 5 log reductions of surviving bacteria of Escherichia coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Scanning electron microscope analysis indicated that crystalline silver formed unique wire-like nanostructures on TiO(2) (N) substrates, while formed relatively straight and thicker rod-shaped precipitates on the other two titania materials. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggested that proper forms of silver on various titania materials could further influence the bactericidal property.
TI  - [Prosthetic joint infections by multi-drug resistant bacteria].
AB  - Prosthetic joint infections by multi-drug resistant bacteria are today one of the most important and complex problems in orthopedics and traumatology. Most important and frequent resistant bacteria involved in infection of total joint replacements include: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. There are several laboratory tests available, but none has been shown to achieve 100% of sensitivity and specificity. Treatment of a patient with infection by a resistant organism, requires costly and prolonged hospital stay, weeks or months of antibiotic therapy, and often multiple surgical procedures. Only a strictly cooperation between orthopedic surgeon and infectious disease specialist, before, during and after prosthetic joint procedure, could improve patient management.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in long-term ventilator-assisted individuals.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Information on the characteristics of pneumonia in long-term ventilator-assisted individuals is scarce. We evaluate the incidence, risk factors and outcome of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in a large series of chronically ventilated patients. METHODS: All patients assisted in a chronic ventilator-dependent unit were prospectively followed up for the development of VAP. Patients with a new and persistent lung infiltrate and a purulent tracheal aspirate were suspected to have VAP. Pneumonia was considered microbiologically confirmed in the presence of (1) a positive blood culture and/or (2) >/=10(5) CFU ml(-)(1) in quantitative bacterial culture of tracheal aspirates or >/=10(3) CFU ml(-)(1) in quantitative mini-bronchoalveolar lavage cultures. RESULTS: In total, 100 consecutive long-term ventilated individuals with spinal cord injury (mean age 49 years) were prospectively followed up. The length of mechanical ventilation before admission in the unit was 54+/-37 days, and the follow-up after admission was 119+/-127 days. There were 32 episodes of VAP in 27 patients (1.74 episodes per 1000 days of mechanical ventilation). By logistic regression analysis, hypoalbuminaemia (P=0.03), administration of antacids (P=0.002) and length of mechanical ventilation (P=0.05) were independent risk factors for VAP. The most frequently isolated organisms were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (62%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (25%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (15%); 9 (28%) episodes were polymicrobial. Antimicrobial treatment, including monotherapy in 66%, was successful in most patients. Only three patients (11%) died in relation to VAP. CONCLUSIONS: Patients on long-term ventilation are at significant risk for the development of VAP, but the mortality is low.
TI  - The global problem of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Amid the recent attention justly focused on the potential problem of microbial sources for weapons of bioterrorism, it is also apparent that human pathogens frequently isolated from infections in patients from community and hospital sources have been growing more resistant to commonly used antibiotics. Much of the growth of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacterial pathogens can be contributed to the overuse of broad-spectrum antimicrobial products. However, an equally troubling and often overlooked component of the problem involves the elegant ways in which pathogenic bacteria continually evolve complex genetic systems for acquiring and regulating an endless array of antibiotic-resistance mechanisms. Efforts to develop new antimicrobials have over the past two decades been woefully behind the rapid evolution of resistance genes developing among both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. Several new agents that are best suited for use in the hospital environment have been developed to combat staphylococci resistant to beta-lactam antimicrobials following acquisition of the mecA gene. However, the dramatic spread in the US of the now common community strain of Staphylococcus aureus USA300 has shifted the therapeutic need for new antibiotics useful against MRSA to the community. As the pharmaceutical industry focused on discovering new agents for use against MRSA, hospitals in many parts of the world have seen the emergence of gram-negative pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumoniae that are clinically resistant to almost all available antimicrobials. Such MDR isolates usually contain multiple-resistance determinants, including loss of outer membrane porins via gene inactivation by chromosomally encoded insertion sequences, up-regulation of inate efflux pumps, as well as acquisition of drug-inactivating enzymes whose genes are encoded on self-transmissible plasmids, integrons, and complex transposable elements. These determinants confer a complex resistance phenotype that is often superimposed on mutations in the primary drug target in the cell. The continued evolution of such a complex array of antibiotic-resistance genes presents a formidable challenge at a time when large pharmaceutical companies have scaled down their presence in the anti-infectives arena.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in pathogens causing nosocomial infections in surgery and intensive care units of two hospitals in Antananarivo, Madagascar.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In developing countries, knowledge of antimicrobial resistance patterns is essential to define empirical therapy. METHODOLOGY: All the surgery and intensive care wards of two hospitals in Antananarivo were included to study the antimicrobial susceptibility of the pathogenic bacteria causing nosocomial infections. A repeated cross-sectional survey was conducted between September 2006 and March 2008, one day per week. Isolates were identified using classical methods, and resistance to antibiotics was assessed according to the recommendations of the Antibiogram Committee of the French Microbiology Society. RESULTS: Clinical specimens from 706 from 651 patients were collected. Of the 533 bacterial pathogens, 46.7% were Enterobacteriaceae, 19.3% were Staphylococcus aureus, and 19.1% were pathogens from the hospital environment (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii).Frequencies of resistance were high, particularly in Enterobacteriaceae; however, the rate of Staphylococcus aureus isolates resistant to oxacillin (13.6 %) was moderate and all these isolates were susceptible to glycopeptids. The percentages of isolates susceptible to ceftazidim were 81.8% for E. coli, 60.9% for Klebsiella, and 52.5% for Enterobacter spp. Resistance to third-generation cephalosporins was due to extended spectrum betalactamases (ESBL). Multivariate analysis showed that diabetes (adjusted OR: 3.9) and use of an invasive procedures (adjusted OR: 3.5) were independent risk factors for resistance to third-generation cephalosporins. CONCLUSION: A nationwide surveillance programme is needed to monitor the microbial trends and antimicrobial resistance in Madagascar.
TI  - Synergistic effects between conventional antibiotics and 2-aminoimidazole-derived antibiofilm agents.
AB  - 2-aminoimidazoles are an emerging class of small molecules that possess the ability to inhibit and disperse biofilms across bacterial order, class, and phylum. Herein, we report the synergistic effect between a 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate and antibiotics toward dispersing preestablished biofilms, culminating with a 3-orders-of-magnitude increase of biofilm dispersion toward Staphylococcus aureus biofilms. Furthermore, we document that the 2-aminoimidazole/triazole conjugate will also resensitize multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria to the effects of conventional antibiotics, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
TI  - Synergy of fosfomycin with other antibiotics for Gram-positive and Gram-negative  bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The alarming increase in drug resistance and decreased production of  new antibiotics necessitate the evaluation of combinations of existing antibiotics. Fosfomycin shows no cross-resistance to other antibiotic classes. Thus, its combination with other antibiotics may potentially show synergy against resistant bacteria. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the available published evidence regarding the in vitro synergistic activity of fosfomycin with other antibiotic agents against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. METHODS: PubMed and the Cochrane Library were searched. RESULTS: Forty-one studies, including 34 (82.9%) conducted/published before 2000, were eligible for inclusion. The relatively limited number of isolates examined and the considerable heterogeneity of the retrieved studies regarding the definitions of synergy and the methodologies used hamper conclusive remarks for specific combinations of fosfomycin with other antibiotics. Yet, in the 27 studies providing data for Gram-positive strains (16 for Staphylococcus aureus, 3 for coagulase-negative staphylococci, 5 for Streptococcus pneumoniae, and 3 for Enterococcus spp.), fosfomycin showed synergy against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus when combined with cefamandole, cephazolin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, and rifampicin. Data regarding Gram-negative strains reported from 15 studies (12 exclusively for P. aeruginosa, 2 exclusively for Enterobacteriaceae, 1 for both, and 1 for Acinetobacter baumannii) suggested that fosfomycin showed an estimable synergistic effect with gentamicin, amikacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and aztreonam against P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS: The synergistic combination of fosfomycin with other antibiotics may be a useful alternative treatment option for Gram-negative and Gram-positive infections. Additional studies using more stringent definitions of synergy, and studies reporting on the clinical efficacy of fosfomycin combinations in the current era of high antimicrobial resistance are needed.
TI  - International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) report, data summary for 2003-2008, issued June 2009.
AB  - We report the results of the International Infection Control Consortium (INICC) surveillance study from January 2003 through December 2008 in 173 intensive care units (ICUs) in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Europe. During the 6-year study, using Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) US National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN; formerly the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system [NNIS]) definitions for device-associated health care-associated infection, we collected prospective data from 155,358 patients hospitalized in the consortium's hospital ICUs for an aggregate of 923,624 days. Although device utilization in the developing countries' ICUs was remarkably similar to that reported from US ICUs in the CDC's NHSN, rates of device-associated nosocomial infection were markedly higher in the ICUs of the INICC hospitals: the pooled rate of central venous catheter (CVC)-associated bloodstream infections (BSI) in the INICC ICUs, 7.6 per 1000 CVC-days, is nearly 3-fold higher than the 2.0 per 1000 CVC-days reported from comparable US ICUs, and the overall rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was also far higher, 13.6 versus 3.3 per 1000 ventilator-days, respectively, as was the rate of catheter-associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI), 6.3 versus 3.3 per 1000 catheter-days, respectively. Most strikingly, the frequencies of resistance of Staphylococcus aureus isolates to methicillin (MRSA) (84.1% vs 56.8%, respectively), Klebsiella pneumoniae to ceftazidime or ceftriaxone (76.1% vs 27.1%, respectively), Acinetobacter baumannii to imipenem (46.3% vs 29.2%, respectively), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa to piperacillin (78.0% vs 20.2%, respectively) were also far higher in the consortium's ICUs, and the crude unadjusted excess mortalities of device-related infections ranged from 23.6% (CVC-associated bloodstream infections) to 29.3% (VAP).

TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against patient isolates collected during phase  3 clinical trials for hospital acquired pneumonia.
AB  - The in vitro activity of tigecycline was evaluated against 819 baseline pathogens isolated from 383 patients enrolled in the phase 3 clinical trial investigating the efficacy of tigecycline in hospital acquired pneumonia (HAP). The trials were global, enrolling patients in 27 countries. Tigecycline was active against the most prevalent pathogens in HAP, including gram-positive and gram-negative strains (90% of MICs </=2 microg/mL for the entire collection). The spectrum of activity of tigecycline included important pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Enterococcus faecalis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus complex, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Enterobacter cloacae. As reported previously, a few genera, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the Proteeae, were generally less susceptible to tigecycline by comparison to other gram-negative pathogens. The excellent in vitro, expanded, broad-spectrum activity of tigecycline in the clinical isolates confirmed the potential utility of tigecycline for pathogens associated with with hospital acquired pneumonia infections.
TI  - [Microbiologic study on the pathogens isolated from wound culture among orthopaedic patients after Wenchuan earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To observe the bacterial characteristic of orthopedic open wounds injured in Wenchuan earthquake and their drug-resistant pattern for reasonable application of antibiotics. METHODS: A total of 340 secretion specimens isolated from 148 cases of orthopedic open wounds of earthquake victims were analyzed. Among the patients, 71 patients were male and 77 patients were female, ranging in age from 2 to 82 years, with an average of 40.4 years. Thirty-seven patients were detained under the ground ranged from 5 min to 102 h. The 340 specimens of exudation in the wound were collected for bacterial culture and drug sensitivity tests. RESULTS: The infection rate of 148 cases was 66.2 percent. Two hundred and fifty-seven pathogens were isolated from 340 secretion specimen, including gram-negative bacteria accounted for 77.8%, gram-positive bacteria accounted for 20.6%. The most frequent pathogens isolated from secretion culture in Wenchuan earthquake survivors were Escherichia coli (16.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (16.0%), Staphylococcus aureus (13.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (12.5%) and Enterobacter cloacae (8.6%). CONCLUSION: The drug sensitivity test of exudation as well as exact application of antibiotics should be highly payed attention to by doctors in order to reduce the occurrence of bacterial resistance.
TI  - Infectious complications in OIF/OEF veterans with traumatic brain injury.
AB  - Of veterans from the U.S. Global War on Terrorism who have sought care in the Department of Veterans Affairs, approximately 12% have an infectious disease diagnosis. Infections in those veterans with traumatic brain injury (TBI) include infections associated with blast injuries and burns, such as skin and soft tissue infections; infections as a result of retained bullet or shrapnel fragments; pulmonary infections resulting from lung injury, intubation, or resultant tracheostomy; hospital-acquired infections, such as those associated with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and other antimicrobial resistant organisms such as Acinetobacter baumannii; and infections from implanted prosthetic devices, such as metal hardware or skull flaps. Longer-term cognitive impairment may result in behaviors that place veterans with TBI at risk for human immunodeficiency virus or hepatitis C virus infections. Finally, chronic infections acquired abroad, such as cutaneous leishmaniasis or Q-fever, may be diagnosed after veterans return to the United States. These infections present challenges in terms of added morbidity and costs associated with complex antimicrobial management; isolation requirements; and surgical procedures, such as those to remove infected retained fragments or prosthetic devices. In this review, providers will become more familiar with the scope and complexity of infectious disease management in veterans with TBI.
TI  - Microbiological study of pathogenic bacteria isolated from paediatric wound infections following the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake.
AB  - On 12 May 2008, the Wenchuan earthquake struck in Sichuan, China. Within 1 month  after the earthquake, 98 injured children were admitted to the Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical University. According to clinical manifestations, 50 children were diagnosed with wound infections. Wound secretions were cultured for bacteria. Pathogen distribution and drug resistance were analyzed. A total of 99 pathogens were isolated; 16 (16%) were Gram-positive bacteria and 81 (82%) were Gram-negative bacteria. The distribution of pathogens isolated within 1 month after the earthquake was different to the distribution of pathogens in 546 general hospitalized cases in the y before the earthquake. The pathogens most frequently isolated 1 month after the earthquake were Acinetobacter baumannii (27%), Enterobacter cloacae (18%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%). The pathogens most frequently isolated in the y prior to the earthquake were Escherichia coli (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (23%) and coagulase-negative staphylococci (9%). The rate of isolated drug-resistant bacteria was higher in the earthquake cases than in the general hospitalized cases. In the cases injured in the earthquake, the rates of isolation of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. cloacae, E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were higher than in the cases from before the earthquake. Multidrug-resistant and pandrug-resistant A. baumannii were isolated at a higher rate in cases after the earthquake than in those before the earthquake. These changes in the spectrum of pathogens and in the drug resistance of the pathogens isolated following an earthquake will provide the basis for emergency treatment after earthquakes.
TI  - Prospective analysis of nosocomial infections in a burn care unit, Turkey.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Prevention of infection in burned patients poses a great  challenge as infection is the most common cause of mortality after burn injury. An analysis of burned patients, admitted and treated between January 2004 and December 2005 in a nine-bed burn unit in Turkey, was performed prospectively to identify the common pathogens and incidence of nosocomial infection in these patients. METHODS: Of the 182 burn cases admitted to Burn Care Unit during the study period, 169 met the inclusion criteria. Information related to nosocomial infection (NI) was collected. Samples were collected for culture and microorganisms isolated were tested for antimicrobial sensitivity. RESULTS: Of the 169 burn patients, 127 acquired 166 nosocomial infection (NI) (15.7% pneumonia, 56.0% burn wound infection, 8.4% urinary tract infection and 19.9% blood stream infection) with an overall NI rate of 18.2 per 1000 patient-days. The mean age (38 +/- 21 yr), the mean length of hospitalization (45.06 +/- 11.67 days) and the total burned surface area (TBSA) (34.58 +/- 18.46%) of the patients with NI were higher than those of the patients with non NI (23 +/- 17 yr), (16.38 +/- 11.14 days) and (12.44 +/- 8.69%) (P=0.03, P=0.001, P=0.01) respectively. By multiple logistic regression analysis, TBSA co-morbidities, broad spectrum antibiotic usage and invasive devices usage were significantly related to acquisition of NI. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (57%), Acinetobacter baumannii (21%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14%) were the most common resistant organisms isolated. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSION: Our findings emphasize the need for careful disinfection and more strict infection control procedures in areas that serve immunosupressed individuals, such as burn patients.
TI  - [Investigation of antibacterial activity of sertralin].
AB  - Sertralin is a psychotropic drug which acts by inhibiting the selective serotonin re-uptake in the synaptic area. Previous studies have shown that some antidepressant agents have antibacterial activity. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vitro antibacterial activity of sertralin. A total of 224 bacterial strains isolated from clinical specimens together with standard control strains were included to the study. The antibacterial activity of sertralin was determined by microdilution method in Mueller-Hinton broth according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guideline. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were found to be 4-32 microg/ml for 22 methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 25 methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains, 8-32 microg/ml for 20 methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci strains, 16-32 microg/ml for 4 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecalis strains, 0.5-32 microg/ml for 10 vancomycin-susceptible Enterococcus faecium strains, 2-8 microg/ml for 12 vancomycin-resistant E. faecium strains, 16-128 microg/ml for 21 Acinetobacter baumannii strains, 4->128 microg/ml for 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 0.25-128 microg/ml for 24 Escherichia coil strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 22 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains, 128->128 microg/ml for 2 Proteus vulgaris strains, 64->128 microg/ml for 8 Proteus mirabilis strains, 32->128 microg/ml for 7 Stenotrophomonas maltophilia strains, 32-128 microg/ml for 21 Enterobacter cloacae strains and 8-128 microg/ml for 6 Enterobacter aerogenes strains. The MIC values of sertralin against standard strains were as follows; 16 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 29213 (methicillin-susceptible), 32 microg/ml for S. aureus ATCC 43300 (methicillin-resistant), 16 microg/ml for E. faecalis ATCC 29212, 32 microg/ml for K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, 32 microg/ml for E. coli ATCC 25922 and > 128 microg/ml for P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853. Sertralin has showed antibacterial activity mainly against gram-positive bacteria, and it was surprising that MIC values of vancomycin-resistant enterococci were lower than those of vancomycin-susceptible ones. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are required to provide reliable data about the use of sertralin as an adjuvant agent in the antibacterial treatment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of multidrug-resistant organisms recovered at a military burn center.
AB  - Infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens are associated with significant morbidity and mortality in patients with burn injuries. We performed a 6-year antibiotic susceptibility records review from January 2003 to December 2008 to assess the prevalence of MDR isolates by pathogen at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center. During the study period Acinetobacter baumannii (780 isolates [22%]) was the most prevalent organism recovered, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa (703 isolates [20%]), Klebsiella pneumoniae (695 isolates [20%]), and Staphylococcus aureus (469 isolates [13%]). MDR prevalence rates among these isolates were A. baumannii 53%, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) 34%, K. pneumoniae 17% and P. aeruginosa 15%. Two isolates, 1 A. baumannii and 1 P. aeruginosa, were identified as resistant to all 4 classes of antibiotics tested plus colistin. A. baumannii isolates recovered from patients with burns greater than 30% of total body surface area (TBSA) were more likely to be MDR (61%) with no significant difference for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. A higher proportion of MDR P. aeruginosa isolates were recovered from respiratory specimens compared to blood specimens (24% vs. 9%) while the opposite was true for MRSA (35% vs. 54%). A comparison of A. baumannii recovered during hospitalization days 1-5 and 15-30 revealed higher MDR levels as length of stay increased (48% vs. 75%) while no significant trends were observed for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae. A similar pattern was observed for MDR A. baumannii levels for the facility between 2003 and 2005 and 2006-2008 (39% vs. 70%), with no significant increase in MDR P. aeruginosa and MDR K. pneumoniae. Increasing antibiotic resistance patterns of the most prevalent isolates recovered during extended hospitalization, impact of % TBSA and other clinical parameters may affect empirical antimicrobial therapy and patient management decisions during treatment.
TI  - [Recent trend and research issues related to antimicrobial-resistant bacteria].
AB  - The discovery of penicillin in 1928 was followed by the discovery and synthesis of various kinds of antimicrobial agents such as quinolone, aminogycoside, macrolide, tetracyclone, and oxazolidinone. These discoveries dramatically decreased the mortality rate due to infectious diseases. However, bacteria have also acquired antimicrobial-resistance genes or changed their own genes to oppose these antimicrobial agents, and now drug-resistant bacteria are becoming a serious clinical concern. Today, contagious diseases must be treated with the limited number of effective antimicrobial agents available. Infection control measures are required to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria in the clinical environment, and we must also increase our understanding of the drug-resistant mechanisms of bacteria. In this issue we wish to introduce the recent worldwide trend in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, especially multidrug-resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, along with recently-discovered antimicrobial-resistant systems.
TI  - Selection of Streptomyces isolates from Turkish karstic caves against antibiotic  resistant microorganisms.
AB  - In this work, actinomycetes isolates were isolated from rock wall and speleothem  surfaces and soil samples of 19 karstic caves in Turkey. Out of 290 isolates isolated, 180 isolates (62%) exhibited antimicrobial activity against a panel of four bacteria, two yeasts and four filamentous fungi in the screening program. One of them, Streptomyces sp. 1492, was examined for antibiotic production in batch culture. The maximum of antimicrobial activity was shown at 5th day. Antimicrobial activity of the extracted active compound was recorded as dose dependent bacteriostatic or bactericidal against antibiotic resistant clinical bacteria strains; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin resistant Enterobacter faecium (VRE), and Acinetobacter baumanii. Minimum inhibitor concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined as lower than standard antibiotic streptomycin; 125 microg/ml and 250-1000 microg/ml, respectively. Active component was found as heat-stable.
TI  - Chemical synthesis and biological screening of 2-aminoimidazole-based bacterial and fungal antibiofilm agents.
AB  - A collection of 2-aminoimidazole/triazole amides has been synthesized and screened for antibiofilm activity. This class of small molecules was found to modulate the biofilm activity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multidrug-resistant strain of Acinetobacter baumannii (MDRAB), a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Rhodospirillum salexigens, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Vibrio vulnificus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium as well as the yeast Candida albicans and Cryptococcus neoformans. Furthermore, lead compounds were found to not lyse red blood cells at active concentrations.
TI  - Risk factors for pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli among liver recipients.
AB  - Pneumonia caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacilli is associated with a higher mortality rate. The appropriate empiric therapy is based on the understanding of local etiology and MDR pattern. This study was to evaluate the spectrum of Gram-negative bacilli, MDR rate, risk factors and mortality in 475 liver transplantation (LT) recipients. In the first six months after LT, the incidence of bacterial pneumonia was 21.3% (101/475). The overall infectious incidence during the first post-transplant month was 80.2%. The most frequent pneumonia isolates were Enterobacteriaceae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Gram-negative bacilli accounted for 69.6% of all pneumonia pathogens. Of the main 124 Gram-negative bacilli isolates, MDR rate was 58.9%. Four risk factors for post-LT pneumonia caused by MDR Gram-negative bacilli were LT candidates with grade II-IV encephalopathy (OR 2.275, 95%CI 1.249-4.124, p = 0.006), prolonged duration of endotracheal intubation (OR 8.224, 95%CI 4.276-15.815, p = 0.013), tracheostomy (OR 4.929, 95%CI 1.099-18.308, p = 0.027) and post-LT episode(s) of reoperations (OR 10.597, 95%CI 3.726-30.134, p < 0.001). MDR Gram-negative bacterial pneumonia-related mortality was significantly higher than that because of antibiotic-susceptible bacilli (45.6% vs. 11.4%, p = 0.010). Our data suggest that pneumonia caused by MDR Gram-negative bacilli after LT is common, and associated with the severity of underlying disease, prolonged mechanical ventilation and upper abdominal surgery.
TI  - Streptococcus pneumoniae coinfection is correlated with the severity of H1N1 pandemic influenza.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Initial reports in May 2009 of the novel influenza strain H1N1pdm estimated a case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.6%, similar to that of seasonal influenza. In July 2009, however, Argentina reported 3056 cases with 137 deaths, representing a CFR of 4.5%. Potential explanations for increased CFR included virus reassortment or genetic drift, or infection of a more vulnerable population. Virus genomic sequencing of 26 Argentinian samples representing both severe and mild disease indicated no evidence of reassortment, mutations associated with resistance to antiviral drugs, or genetic drift that might contribute to virulence. Furthermore, no evidence was found for increased frequency of risk factors for H1N1pdm disease. METHODS/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We examined nasopharyngeal swab samples (NPS) from 199 cases of H1N1pdm infection from Argentina with MassTag PCR, testing for 33 additional microbial agents. The study population consisted of 199 H1N1pdm-infected subjects sampled between 23 June and 4 July 2009. Thirty-nine had severe disease defined as death (n = 20) or hospitalization (n = 19); 160 had mild disease. At least one additional agent of potential pathogenic importance was identified in 152 samples (76%), including Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 62); Haemophilus influenzae (n = 104); human respiratory syncytial virus A (n = 11) and B (n = 1); human rhinovirus A (n = 1) and B (n = 4); human coronaviruses 229E (n = 1) and OC43 (n = 2); Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2); Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2); Serratia marcescens (n = 1); and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 35) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA, n = 6). The presence of S. pneumoniae was strongly correlated with severe disease. S. pneumoniae was present in 56.4% of severe cases versus 25% of mild cases; more than one-third of H1N1pdm NPS with S. pneumoniae were from subjects with severe disease (22 of 62 S. pneumoniae-positive NPS, p = 0.0004). In subjects 6 to 55 years of age, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) of severe disease in the presence of S. pneumoniae was 125.5 (95% confidence interval [CI], 16.95, 928.72; p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The association of S. pneumoniae with morbidity and mortality is established in the current and previous influenza pandemics. However, this study is the first to demonstrate the prognostic significance of non-invasive antemortem diagnosis of S. pneumoniae infection and may provide insights into clinical management.
TI  - Incidence and bacteriology of burn infections at a military burn center.
AB  - Considerable advancements in shock resuscitation and wound management have extended the survival of burned patients, increasing the risk of serious infection. We performed a 6-year review of bacteria identification and antibiotic susceptibility records at the US Army Institute of Surgical Research Burn Center between January 2003 and December 2008. The primary goal was to identify the bacteria recovered from patients with severe burns and determine how the bacteriology changes during extended hospitalization as influenced by population and burn severity. A total of 460 patients were admitted to the burn ICU with 3507 bacteria recovered from 13,727 bacteriology cultures performed. The most prevalent organisms recovered were Acinetobacter baumannii (780), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (703), Klebsiella pneumoniae (695) and Staphylococcus aureus (469). A. baumannii was most often recovered from combat-injured (58%) and S. aureus the most frequent isolate from local (46%) burn patients. Culture recovery rate of A. baumannii and S. aureus was highest during the first 15 hospital days (73% and 71%); while a majority of P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae were recovered after day 15 (63% and 53%). All 4 pathogens were recovered throughout the course of hospitalization. A. baumannii was the most prevalent pathogen recovered from patients with total body surface area (TBSA) burns less than 30% (203) and 30-60% (338) while P. aeruginosa was most prevalent in patients with burns greater than 60% TBSA (292). Shifting epidemiology of bacteria recovered during extended hospitalization, bacteriology differences between combat-injured and local burn patients, and impact of % TBSA may affect patient management decisions during the course of therapy.
TI  - The chemical synthesis and antibiotic activity of a diverse library of 2-aminobenzimidazole small molecules against MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii.
AB  - Multidrug-resistant bacterial infections continue to be a rising global health concern. Herein is described the development of a class of novel 2-aminobenzimidazoles with antibiotic activity. These active 2-aminobenzimidazoles retain their antibiotic activity against several strains of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii when compared to susceptible strains.
TI  - New antibiotics: optimal use in current clinical practice.
AB  - The optimal choice of antibacterial therapy among the few available options for infections caused by pathogens with advanced antimicrobial drug resistance is fundamental to maximize clinical effectiveness and minimize the likelihood for further resistance development. We herein review the available data on the effectiveness of antibiotics introduced in clinical practice during the past 10 years for specific clinical indications. Quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin and tigecycline have increased the available therapeutic options against specific types of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium infections. The newer fluoroquinolones, moxifloxacin and gemifloxacin, along with the ketolide telithromycin and the oral third-generation cephalosporin cefditoren are particularly valuable for the treatment of specific types of multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae infections. Tigecycline appears as a promising therapeutic option for infections caused by Enterobacteriaceae producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), or multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Ertapenem and doripenem may be particularly useful against infections caused by ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, respectively.
TI  - [Update on antimicrobial chemotherapy].
AB  - There is a constant need for new antibacterial agents because of the unavoidable  development of bacterial resistance that follows the introduction of antibiotics in clinical practice. As observed in many fields, innovation generally comes by series. For instance, a wide variety of broad-spectrum antibacterial agents became available between the 1970s and the 1990s, such as cephalosporins, penicillin/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations, carbapenems, and fluoroquinolones. Over the last 2 decades, the arrival of new antibacterial drugs on the market has dramatically slowed, leaving a frequent gap between isolation of resistant pathogens and effective treatment options. In fact, many pharmaceutical companies focused on the development of narrow-spectrum antibiotics targeted at multidrug-resistant Gram-positive bacteria (e.g. methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium). Therefore, multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (e.g. extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii) recently emerged and rapidly spread worldwide. Even if some molecules were developed, new molecules for infections caused by these multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria remain remarkably scarce compared to those for Gram-positive infections. This review summarises the major microbiological, pharmacological, and clinical properties of systemic antibiotics recently marketed in France (i.e. linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, ertapenem, and doripenem) as well as those of antibacterial drugs currently in development (i.e. ceftobiprole, ceftaroline, dalbavancin, telavancin, oritavancin, iclaprim, and ramoplanin) or available in other countries (i.e. garenoxacin, sitafloxacin, and temocillin).
TI  - Synthetic {beta}-(1->6)-linked N-acetylated and nonacetylated oligoglucosamines used to produce conjugate vaccines for bacterial pathogens.
AB  - Vaccines for pathogens usually target strain-specific surface antigens or toxins, and rarely is there broad antigenic specificity extending across multiple species. Protective antibodies for bacteria are usually specific for surface or capsular antigens. beta-(1-->6)-Poly-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine (PNAG) is a surface polysaccharide produced by many pathogens, including Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Yersinia pestis, Bordetella pertussis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and others. Protective antibodies to PNAG are elicited when a deacetylated glycoform (deacetylated PNAG [dPNAG]; <30% acetate) is used in conjugate vaccines, whereas highly acetylated PNAG does not induce such antibodies. Chemical derivation of dPNAG from native PNAG is imprecise, so we synthesized both beta-(1-->6)-d-glucosamine (GlcNH(2)) and beta-(1-->6)-d-N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) oligosaccharides with linkers on the reducing termini that could be activated to produce sulfhydryl groups for conjugation to bromoacetyl groups introduced onto carrier proteins. Synthetic 5-mer GlcNH(2) (5GlcNH(2)) or 9GlcNH(2) conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) elicited mouse antibodies that mediated opsonic killing of multiple S. aureus strains, while the antibodies that were produced in response to 5GlcNAc- or 9GlcNAc-TT did not mediate opsonic killing. Rabbit antibodies to 9GlcNH(2)-TT bound to PNAG and dPNAG antigens, mediated killing of S. aureus and E. coli, and protected against S. aureus skin abscesses and lethal E. coli peritonitis. Chemical synthesis of a series of oligoglucosamine ligands with defined differences in N acetylation allowed us to identify a conjugate vaccine formulation that generated protective immune responses to two of the most challenging bacterial pathogens. This vaccine could potentially be used to engender protective immunity to the broad range of pathogens that produce surface PNAG.
TI  - Epidemiology of bloodstream infections in patients with haematological malignancies with and without neutropenia.
AB  - All bacterial isolates from 7058 patients admitted to haemato-oncology wards at National Taiwan University Hospital between 2002 and 2006 were characterized. In total 1307 non-duplicate bloodstream isolates were made from all patients with haematological malignancy; 853 (65%) of these were from neutropenic patients. Gram-negative bacteria predominated (60%) in neutropenic isolates with Escherichia coli (12%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10%), Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex (6%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (6%) the most frequent. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (19%) and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the most common Gram-positive pathogens. Resistance to ciprofloxacin was found in 50% of E. coli and 20% of K. pneumoniae isolates from neutropenic patients. Extensively drug-resistant A. calcoaceticus-baumannii complex and vancomycin-resistant enterococci were also found during the study period. Emerging antimicrobial resistant pathogens are an increasing threat to neutropenic cancer patients.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial efficacy of a fixed dose combination of ceftazidime + sulbactam with ceftazidime and sulbactam alone against five bacteria.
AB  - The efficacy of the agents was evaluated on the basis of minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and time-kill curve analysis in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Mycobacterium smegmatis, and Citrobacter braakii; MIC was found to be 0.5, 4.0, 0.015625, 0.0078125, and 0.0625 mg/L in FDC of ceftazidime + sulbactam, respectively, which is lower than ceftazidime and sulbactam individually. Time-kill curve analysis demonstrated maximum killing of bacteria after 4 h. A fixed dose combination of ceftazidime + sulbactam was found to have stronger antibacterial properties than ceftazidime and sulbactam alone at in vitro analysis.
TI  - Building a benchmark through active surveillance of intensive care unit-acquired  infections: the Italian network SPIN-UTI.
AB  - The Italian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) (SPIN-UTI) project of the Italian Study Group of Hospital Hygiene (GISIO - SItI) was undertaken to ensure standardisation of definitions, data collection and reporting procedures using the Hospital in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS)-ICU benchmark. Before starting surveillance, participant ICUs met in order to involve the key stakeholders in the project through participation in planning. Four electronic data forms for web-based data collection were designed. The six-month patient-based prospective survey was undertaken from November 2006 to May 2007, preceded by a one-month surveillance pilot study to assess the overall feasibility of the programme and to determine the time needed and resources for participant hospitals. The SPIN-UTI project included 49 ICUs, 3053 patients with length of stay >2 days and 35 498 patient-days. The cumulative incidence of infections was 19.8 per 100 patients and the incidence density was 17.1 per 1000 patient-days. The most frequently encountered infection type was pneumonia, Pseudomonas aeruginosa being the most frequent infection-associated micro-organism, followed by Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. Site-specific infection rates for pneumonia, bloodstream infections, central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections, stratified according to patient risk factors, were below the 75th centile reported by the HELICS network benchmark. The SPIN-UTI project showed that introduction of ongoing surveillance should be possible in many Italian hospitals. The study provided the opportunity to participate in the HELICS project using benchmark data for comparison and for better understanding of factors influencing risks.
TI  - Use of automated repetitive-sequence-based PCR for rapid laboratory confirmation  of nosocomial outbreaks.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Rapid and reliable diagnosis of genetic relatedness of clinical isolates in microbiologic laboratory is essential in case of nosocomial outbreak investigation. Most molecular techniques used to type microorganisms are technically demanding and time consuming. Currently repetitive-sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) technique has been adapted to an automated format on the DiversiLab system (bioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Aim of this study was to compare the performance of the DiversiLab system to that of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) in nosocomial outbreaks. METHODS: 122 clinical isolates (28 Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 26 Acinetobacter baumannii, 45 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and 13 ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca) were investigated. 70 isolates originated from six well-documented outbreaks, 52 were non-outbreak isolates. RESULTS: Concordant results for identification of outbreak and non-outbreak MRSA, A. baumannii and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae strains were achieved with both methods. In the outbreak of ESBL-producing K. oxytoca automated rep-PCR was slightly more discriminatory than PFGE. Rep-PCR identified investigated ESBL-producing K. oxytoca outbreak-strains as indistinguishable or closely related, showing similarity of >90%, while PFGE identified these strains as indistinguishable. CONCLUSION: Automated rep-PCR assays on the DiversiLab system were used for MRSA, A. baumannii and for the first time ESBL-producing Klebsiella spp. and proved as a rapid and reliable method for molecular analysis of nosocomial outbreaks.
TI  - The in-vitro antimicrobial activity of some medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: In effort to identify novel bacterial agents, this study was initiated to evaluate the antimicrobial properties of 17 crude extracts from 12 medicinal plants against beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from <or= 0.3 to >or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: <or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)). CONCLUSION: Of the 17 plant extracts studied, seven showed good antimicrobial activity against the tested bacteria. The stem bark of B. micrantha and the leaves of D. picta were most active towards beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. This study shows that medicinal plants could be sources of compounds which can be used to fight against beta-lactam resistant bacteria.
TI  - Antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activities of some flavonoids.
AB  - Antibacterial and antifungal activities of six plant-derived flavonoids representing two different structural groups were evaluated against standard strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Bacillus subtilis and their drug-resistant isolates, as well as fungi (Candida albicans, C. krusei) using the microdilution broth method. Herpes simplex virus Type-1 and Parainfluenza-3 virus were employed for antiviral assessment of the flavonoids using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. Ampicillin, gentamycin, ofloxacin, levofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, acyclovir, and oseltamivir were used as the control agents. All tested compounds (32-128 microg/ml) showed strong antimicrobial and antifungal activities against isolated strains of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanni, S. aureus, and C. krusei. Rutin, 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside and 5,7,3'-trihydroxy-flavanone-4'-O-beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.2-0.05 microg/ml) were active against PI-3, while 5,7-dimethoxyflavanone-4'-O-[2''-O-(5'''-O-trans-cinnamoyl)-beta-D-apiofuranosyl] -beta-D-glucopyranoside (0.16-0.2 microg/ml) inhibited potently HSV-1.
TI  - In vitro effect of physiological concentrations of human albumin on the antibacterial activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine C(max) tigecycline activity in the presence/absence of physiological concentrations of human albumin with free fraction concentrations as controls. METHODS: Killing curves (final inoculum: 1.0-5.0 x 10(7) cfu/mL) were performed with 0.88 mg/L final concentrations (serum C(max) after a 100 mg 1 h infusion) in Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with Ca(2+) and Mg(2+) (MH) and in MH with 4 g/dL human albumin. Controls were curves in MH with concentrations similar to the free fraction (fC(max) = 0.17 mg/L) calculated using protein binding. Activity was measured as log(10) initial inoculum reduction (log(10) initial inoculum-log(10) at 12 h/24 h). Target strains (tigecycline MIC/MBC; mg/L) were: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus heteroresistant to vancomycin (0.12/0.25); Enterococcus faecium (0.12/0.25); Escherichia coli producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (0.12/0.25); and Acinetobacter baumannii (0.25/1). RESULTS: At 24 h the fC(max) produced mean decreases of < or =0.1 cfu/mL for all strains, in contrast to the bactericidal activity (mean >3 log(10) reduction) provided by C(max) concentrations in the presence or absence of albumin for E. coli and E. faecium, and an activity nearly bactericidal for S. aureus (mean approximately 2.8 log(10) reduction). In the case of the A. baumannii isolate the C(max) in the presence or absence of albumin produced a mean reduction of 2.56 log(10) cfu/mL at 12 h (time of one dosing interval), with a bacteriostatic profile when considering 24 h colony counts (similar counts at 0 and 24 h). CONCLUSIONS: Correcting the total concentration for the reported literature binding values is unreliable since tigecycline antibacterial activity was greater than that suggested by the free fraction of the drug.
TI  - Central nervous system infections in patients with severe burns.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Central nervous system (CNS) infections develop in 3-9% of neurosurgical ICU patients and 0.4-2% of all patients hospitalized with head trauma. CNS infection incidence in burn patients is unknown and this study sets out to identify the incidence and risk factors associated with CNS infections. METHODS: A retrospective electronic chart review was performed from 1 July 2003 to 30 June 2008 evaluating inpatient medical records along with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) microbiological results for the presence of CNS infection. The presence of facial and head injuries and burns, along with intracranial interventions were reviewed for association with CNS infections. RESULTS: There were 1964 admissions with 2 patients (0.1%) found to have CNS infection; 1 each with MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii. Both patients had facial burns and trauma to their head that required intracranial surgery. Of note, both patients had bacteremia with the same microorganisms isolated from their CSF and both survived. Of all patients, 29% had head or neck trauma and burns; 0.35% of those had a CNS infection. Scalp harvest for grafts or debridement of burned scalp was performed on 125 patients of which 9 had an invasive surgical procedure that involved penetration of the skull. The 2 infected patients were from these 9 intracranial surgical patients revealing a 22% infection rate. CONCLUSION: The incidence of CNS infections in patients with severe burns is extremely low at 0.1%. This rate was low even with head and face burns with trauma unless the patient underwent an intracranial procedure.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in community-acquired pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Antimicrobial therapy is the mainstay of management for community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Accordingly, the choices of treatment are influenced by the likely etiologies, local resistance patterns of the pathogens, as well as patient factors. As the leading cause of acute CAP, the susceptibility patterns of Streptococcus pneumoniae have greatly influenced antimicrobial agents and dosage recommended for empirical treatment of this condition. The worldwide emergence of community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus has also led to discussion of this pathogen in recent revisions of the international CAP guidelines. This pathogen is important because of its resistance to antibiotics commonly recommended for the empirical treatment of CAP and the association with a rapidly fatal form of pneumonia characterized by tissue necrosis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and rapid progression to respiratory failure. In tropical regions of Australia and Asia, CAP due to Acinetobacter baumannii is also increasingly recognized. This review discusses their recent epidemiology, microbiology, clinical features, and treatment of CAP caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [Analysis of the molecular epidemiology and distribution of pathogenic bacteria in burn wards of Ruijin Hospital from 2004 to 2006].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyse the distribution, drug resistance and epidemiology of pathogenic bacteria in the burn wards of Ruijin Hospital. METHODS: Seventeen strains of Methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 52 strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA), and 11 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii (AB) isolated from the wound secretion, venous catheters, blood, urine and stool etc. were collected from burn patients hospitalized in our department from January 2004 to December 2006. The distribution and the drug resistance profile of bacteria were analyzed, and the homology analysis was performed by randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). RESULTS: MRSA, PA and AB were the major strains in our burn wards in recent years, of which Staphylococcus aureus (SA) was the most dominant. During these 3 years, MRSA accounted for 77% (63/82), 85% (63/74), and 75% (74/99), respectively, for SA isolated in this period. MRSA was resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Erythromycin, Clindamycin and Levofloxacin; PA was resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Piperacillin, Ceftazidime, Cefoperazone, Aztreonam and Imipenem; AB was resistant to Amikacin, Gentamicin, Piperacillin, Ceftazidime, Imipenem and Ciprofloxacin. Three bacteria were found to belong to the same type in the RAPD homology analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There are many kind of multi-drug resistant pathogenic bacteria for nosocomial infection in our burn wards. To control the spread of infection due to above-mentioned 3 bacteria is the focus of nosocomial infection control.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii on computer interface surfaces of hospital wards and association with clinical isolates.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Computer keyboards and mice are potential reservoirs of nosocomial pathogens, but routine disinfection for non-water-proof computer devices is a problem. With better hand hygiene compliance of health-care workers (HCWs), the impact of these potential sources of contamination on clinical infection needs to be clarified. METHODS: This study was conducted in a 1600-bed medical center of southern Taiwan with 47 wards and 282 computers. With education and monitoring program of hand hygiene for HCWs, the average compliance rate was 74% before our surveillance. We investigated the association of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii, three leading hospital-acquired pathogens, from ward computer keyboards, mice and from clinical isolates in non-outbreak period by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and antibiogram. RESULTS: Our results revealed a 17.4% (49/282) contamination rate of these computer devices by S. aureus, Acinetobacter spp. or Pseudomonas spp. The contamination rates of MRSA and A. baumannii in the ward computers were 1.1% and 4.3%, respectively. No P. aeruginosa was isolated. All isolates from computers and clinical specimens at the same ward showed different pulsotypes. However, A. baumannii isolates on two ward computers had the same pulsotype. CONCLUSION: With good hand hygiene compliance, we found relatively low contamination rates of MRSA, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii on ward computer interface, and without further contribution to nosocomial infection. Our results suggested no necessity of routine culture surveillance in non-outbreak situation.
TI  - [Is pneumatic sample transport system also a carrier for microorganisms?].
AB  - The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible infection and contamination risk of the pneumatic system used in our hospital and to establish essential infection control measures. The study was conducted in a quaternary health care center with 1.000 bed capacity. A total of 614 specimens were taken 2 times weekly from the pneumatic transport system and its carriers at 22 wards, 5 intensive care units, 3 laboratories, 2 blood taking units, and pharmacy. Samples were also obtained from the fingertips of 33 subjects using the system, before and after contact with the carriers. A questionnaire that consisted of 8 questions was applied to 224 subjects who worked in those units, evaluating the degree of compliance to the obligations for the cleaning of the pneumatic system and carriers and their approach in case of visible pollution at the system. Bacterial growth was observed in 15.2% (45/296) of samples in the 1st week and 7.6% (18/238) of the samples in the 2nd week, making a total of 11.8% (63/534) bacterial growth. No growth was detected from the areas where the carriers were placed. Of these 69.8% were coagulase negative staphylococci, 11.1% diphteroids, 7.9% Acinetobacter Iwoffii, 4.8% Staphylococcus aureus, 4.8% Bacillus spp. and 1.6% Enterococcus durans. Acinetobacter baumannii and Aspergillus were detected at two fingertip samples taken before the contact with carriers, while again A. baumannii and Enterobacter cloacae were detected at the samples following contact. Moreover, 31.3% of the subjects noted that they cleaned the carriers only if any visible contamination was present. In addition, 14.3% reported that they have encountered broken or spilled up material in the system for more than 5 times, 10.3% reported that they followed the instructions in case of presence of infected material inside the carriers, 23.7% reported that they always washed their hands after any contact with the carriers, 9.8% noted that they always used gloves during contact with the system. Of the subjects 73.7% declared that they had no information about cleaning and decontamination procedures related to the system. These data revealed that the pneumatic system used in our hospital carried contamination risk and the rules for hygiene and disinfection regarding the pneumatic transport system has to be determined, implemented and checked in order to establish appropriate infection control measures.
TI  - Antimicrobial properties of brevinin-2-related peptide and its analogs: Efficacy  against multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Brevinin-2 related peptide (B2RP; GIWDTIKSMG(10)KVFAGKILQN(20)L.NH(2)), first isolated from skin secretions of the mink frog Lithobates septentrionalis, shows broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity but its therapeutic potential is limited by moderate hemolytic activity. The peptide adopts an alpha-helical conformation in a membrane-mimetic solvent but amphipathicity is low. Increasing amphipathicity together with hydrophobicity by the substitutions Lys(16)-->Leu and Lys(16)-->Ala increased hemolytic activity approximately fivefold without increasing antimicrobial potency. The substitution Leu(18)-->Lys increased both cationicity and amphipathicity but produced decreases in both antimicrobial potency and hemolytic activity. In contrast, increasing cationicity of B2RP without changing amphipathicity by the substitution Asp(4)-->Lys resulted in a fourfold increase in potency against Escherichia coli [minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) = 6 microm) and twofold increases in potency against Staphylococcus aureus (MIC = 12.5 microm) and Candida albicans (MIC = 6 microm) without changing significantly hemolytic activity against human erythrocytes (LC(50) = 95 microm). The emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains of the Gram-negative bacterium Acinetobacter baumannii constitutes a serious risk to public health. B2RP (MIC = 3-6 microm) and [Lys(4)]B2RP (MIC = 1.5-3 microm) potently inhibited the growth of nosocomial isolates of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Although the analogs [Lys(4), Lys(18)]B2RP and [Lys(4), Ala(16), Lys(18)]B2RP showed reduced potency against Staphylococcus aureus, they retained activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC = 3-6 microm) and had very low hemolytic activity (LC(50) > 200 microm).
TI  - Association of bacterial colonization at the time of presentation to a combat support hospital in a combat zone with subsequent 30-day colonization or infection.
AB  - U.S. casualties have developed multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterial infections. A  surveillance project to evaluate U.S. military patients for the presence of MDR pathogens from wounding through the first 30 days of care in the military healthcare system (MHS) was performed. U.S. military patients admitted to a single combat support hospital in Iraq during June-July of 2007 had screening swabs obtained for the detection of MDR bacteria and a subsequent retrospective electronic medical records review for presence of colonization or infection in the subsequent 30 days. Screening of 74 U.S. military patients in Iraq found one colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Fifty-six patients of these were screened for Acinetobacter in Germany and one found colonized. Of patients evacuated to the U.S., 9 developed infections. Carefully obtained screening cultures immediately after injury combined with look-back monitoring supports the role of nosocomial transmission. Consistent infection control strategies are needed for the entire MHS.
TI  - Non-adherence to guidelines: an avoidable cause of failure of empirical antimicrobial therapy in the presence of difficult-to-treat bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the risk factors of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to difficult-to-treat (DTT) bacteria (i.e., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), and to assess the rate and the causes of inappropriateness of empirical antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: In an intensive care unit of a university hospital, patients with VAP were empirically treated with antibiotics without activity against DTT bacteria if the patients had no prior hospitalization or prior administration of antibiotics, according to local guidelines. RESULTS: Overall, the empirical antimicrobial therapy was appropriate in 190 (87%) out of 218 patients with VAP. Fifty (23%) patients developed problems due to DTT bacteria. The risk factors for VAP due to DTT bacteria were shock state, prior antimicrobial therapy, prior stay in long-term care facilities and late-onset VAP. Empirical antimicrobial therapy was inappropriate in 20 (40%) patients with VAP due to DTT bacteria and 8 (5%) patients with VAP due to non-DTT (P = 0.001). Guidelines violations (nine patients), bacteria not included in antibiotic spectrum (eight patients) and bacterial resistance (three patients) were the causes of inappropriateness in case of DTT bacteria. CONCLUSION: Despite the abundant information for the treatment of VAP and the establishment of guidelines, too many patients with DTT bacteria received inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. Since 45% of the cases are related to non-adherence to the local protocol, there is room for improvement by implementing educational programs. Also, since DTT bacteria are found in 23% of late-onset VAP, empirical antibiotic treatment should be directed against these pathogens.
TI  - Is there an association between nosocomial infection rates and bacterial cross transmissions?
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Surveillance data of nosocomial infection rates are increasingly used  for public reporting and interhospital comparisons. Approximately 15% of nosocomial infections on intensive care units are the result of patient-to-patient transmissions of the causative organisms. These exogenous infections could be prevented by adherence to basic infection control measures. The association between bacterial cross transmissions and nosocomial infection rates was analyzed. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study during 24 months. SETTING: Eleven intensive care units from two university hospitals. PATIENTS: All inpatients. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Primary isolates of six indicator organisms (Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus) cultured from clinical samples or methicillin-resistant S. aureus surveillance testing of all inpatients were genotyped. Indistinguishable isolates in > or =2 patients defined potential episodes of transmissions. Surveillance of nosocomial infection rates was performed according to the German nosocomial infection surveillance system, Krankenhaus Infektions Surveillance System. Transmission events and nosocomial infection rates were pooled by intensive care unit to calculate Spearman's rank-correlation test. During 100,781 patient days, 100,829 microbiological specimens from 24,362 patients were sampled (average investigation density: 1.0 sample per patient and day) and 3419 primary indicator organisms were cultured. Altogether, 462 transmissions (incidence density of 4.6 transmissions per 1000 patient days; range, 1.4-8.4 days) and 1216 nosocomial infections (incidence density of 12.1 per 1000 patient days; range, 6.2-16.6 days) were discerned. Correlation analysis was unable to reveal any association between the incidence of cross transmissions and nosocomial infections, duration of hospitalization, or device use. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in nosocomial infection rates between study intensive care units are not explained solely by cross transmissions. Other factors, like the severity of the patient's underlying diseases, the patient's endogenous flora, or invasive procedures, likely have a dominant effect on the magnitude of nosocomial infection rates.
TI  - Antimicrobial and antioxidant activities of plants from northeast of Mexico.
AB  - Traditional medicine has a key role in health care worldwide. Obtaining scientific information about the efficacy and safety of the plants from our region is one of the goals of our research group. In this report, 17 plants were selected and collected in different localities from northeast Mexico. The dried plants were separated into leaves, flowers, fruit, stems, roots and bark. Each part was extracted with methanol, and 39 crude extracts were prepared. The extracts were tested for their antimicrobial activity using three Gram-negative bacterial strains (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii), three Gram-positive bacterial strains (Enterococcus faecalis and two Staphylococcus aureus strains), and seven clinically isolated yeasts (Candida albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis and C. glabrata); their antioxidant activity was tested using a DPPH free radical assay. No activity against Gram-negative bacteria was observed with any extract up to the maximum concentration tested, 1000 mug ml(-1). We report here for the first time activity of Ceanothus coeruleus against S. aureus (flowers, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) 125 mug ml(-1)), C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)) and C. parapsilosis (MICs between 31.25 and 125 mug ml(-1)); Chrysanctinia mexicana against C. glabrata (MICs 31.25 mug ml(-1)); Colubrina greggii against E. faecalis (MICs 250 mug ml(-1)) and Cordia boissieri against C. glabrata (MIC 125 mug ml(-1)). Furthermore, this is the first report about antioxidant activity of extracts from Ceanothus coeruleus, Chrysanctinia mexicana, Colubrina greggii and Cyperus alternifolius. Some correlation could exist between antioxidant activity and antiyeast activity against yeasts in the species Ceanothus coeruleus, Schinus molle, Colubrina greggii and Cordia boissieri.
TI  - Description of Streptococcus pneumoniae infections in burn patients.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Longer survival in burn patients has resulted in more infectious complications, typically with Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Staphylococcus aureus. Although Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are common in the community and can cause nosocomial infections, the incidence and risk factors for pneumococcal infections in burn patients is unclear. METHODS: We performed an electronic retrospective chart review to collect rates of and risk factors for S. pneumoniae infections in patients with thermal burns from March 2003 through June 2008. RESULTS: Of the 1838 patients admitted to the burn center, 10 were infected (0.54% incidence). Patients presented with pneumonia (seven patients, 0.38% incidence) and bacteremia (three patients, 0.16% incidence) within a week of initial burn (median 1 day, range 0-8), often in the setting of bacterial co-infection (five patients). This group was mainly young males with median 28.8% total body surface area burns; 60% had concomitant inhalational injury. Most did not have traditional risk factors for pneumococcal infection but had objective signs of infection at time of positive culture and were treated with appropriate antibiotics. Two patients in this series died, although no mortality was attributed to S. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: Pneumococcal disease is not common in burn patients and generally occurs early on in hospitalization after burn making it more likely to be a community-acquired pathogen rather than nosocomial in the burn population. It should be considered in the setting of sepsis or new pulmonary infiltrates within a week after burn, but typical empiric antibiotics against the usual burn pathogens should be adequate to also treat for pneumococcal infection.
TI  - In vitro activities of moxifloxacin and tigecycline against bacterial isolates associated with intraabdominal infections at a medical center in Taiwan, 2001-2006.
AB  - A total of 569 nonduplicate isolates recovered from patients with community-onset or hospital-onset intraabdominal infections (IAIs) from 2001 to 2006 were studied. These included 28 Staphylococcus aureus and 541 Gram-negative isolates (33.6% Escherichia coli, 29.0% Klebsiella pneumoniae, 8.1% Acinetobacter baumannii, and 6.3% Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the isolates to moxifloxacin, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin were determined using the agar dilution method and to tigecycline using the broth microdilution method. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers were found in 15.5% (29 out of 182) of E. coli, 15.3% (24 out of 157) of K. pneumoniae, and 15.4% (2 out of 13) of K. oxytoca isolates. More than 85% of Enterobacteriaceae were susceptible to moxifloxacin, but this percentage was lower among E. coli (78%). The percentage of E. coli (K. pneumoniae) isolates that were not susceptible to moxifloxacin was 6% (0%) in 2001, 39% (17%) in 2003, and 21% (14%) in 2006. Tigecycline exhibited good in vitro activities against all S. aureus and >95% of all Enterobacteriaceae tested. Among the 24 isolates of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae, 4 had tigecycline MICs > or = 2 microg/ml. Eighty percent of A. baumannii isolates exhibited tigecycline MICs of < or = 2 microg/ml. This study found that moxifloxacin and tigecycline exhibited good in vitro activity against bacterial isolates causing IAIs.
TI  - In vitro activity of nemonoxacin, a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, against 2,440 clinical isolates.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nemonoxacin (TG-873870), a novel nonfluorinated quinolone, was tested against 2,440 clinical isolates. Nemonoxacin was at least fourfold more active than levofloxacin and moxifloxacin against most gram-positive cocci tested (shown by the following MIC(90)/range [microg/ml] values; community-associated methicillin [meticillin]-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, 0.5/0.015 to 2; Staphylococcus epidermidis, 0.5/0.015 to 4 for methicillin-susceptible staphylococci and 2/0.12 to 2 for methicillin-resistant staphylococci; Streptococcus pneumoniae, 0.015/< or = 0.008 to 0.25; Enterococcus faecalis, 1/0.03 to 128). Nemonoxacin activity against gram-negative bacilli was similar to levofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MIC(90)/range [microg/ml]; Escherichia coli, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Klebsiella pneumoniae, 2/< or = 0.015 to 128; K. oxytoca, 0.5/0.06 to 1; Proteus mirabilis, 16/0.25 to > or = 512; Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 32/< or = 0.015 to > or = 512; Acinetobacter baumannii, 1/0.12 to 16).
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms: tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial 2004 to 2007.
AB  - The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial began in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against a global collection of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. Against Gram negatives (n = 63 699), tigecycline MIC(90)'s ranged from 0.25 to 2 mg/L for Escherichia coli, Haemophilus influenzae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serratia marcescens (but was > or =32 for Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Gram-positive organisms (n = 32 218), tigecycline MIC(90)'s were between 0.06 and 0.25 mg/L for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Streptococcus agalactiae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Enterococcus faecalis. The in vitro activity of tigecycline was maintained against resistant phenotypes, including multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (9.2% of isolates), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli (7.0%) and K. pneumoniae (14.0%), beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzae (22.2%), methicillin-resistant S. aureus (44.5%), vancomycin-resistant E. faecium (45.9%) and E. faecalis (2.8%), and penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae (13.8%). Tigecycline represents a welcome addition to the armamentarium against difficult to treat organisms.
TI  - The clinical consequences of antimicrobial resistance.
AB  - The continued evolution of antimicrobial resistance in the hospital and more recently in the community threatens to seriously compromise our ability to treat serious infections. The major success of the seven-valent Streptococcus pneumoniae vaccine at reducing both infection and resistance has been followed by the emergence of previously minor serotypes that express multiresistance. The almost universal activity of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones against community Escherichia coli strains has been compromised by the spread of CTX-M beta-lactamase-producing, fluoroquinolone-resistant strains, and the emergence of community-onset methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, particularly in the United States, has forced us to re-think our empirical treatment guidelines for skin and soft-tissue infections. Finally, our most potent and reliable class of antibiotics, the carbapenems, is compromised by the growth, primarily in intensive care units, of multiresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumanni, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The lack of a robust pipeline of new agents, particularly against resistant Gram-negative bacteria, emphasizes the importance of optimizing our use of current antimicrobials and promoting strict adherence to established infection control practices.
TI  - [Quantitative culture sampling of tracheal aspirates for diagnosis of nosocomial  pneumonia in the ITU].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial pneumonia is defined as a pneumonia developing within 48 hours of admission, in a patient with previously normal lung tissue. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) due to migration of microorganisms from the nose, throat and digestive tract is typical in ITU patients. Microbiological diagnosis is difficult, and there is no single method approved for VAP diagnosis. We have assessed the usefulness of Quantitative Endotracheal Aspirate (QETA) for this purpose, basing on its reported high sensitivity (mean 76% +/- 9%) and specificity (mean 75 +/- 28%). METHODS: Endotracheal aspirates were sampled from ITU patients fulfilling the following criteria: (1) New or progressive infiltrations in the lungs plus hyperthermia (>38.3 degrees C) or hypothermia (<36 degrees C); (2) leukocytosis (>12 G L(-1)) or leukopenia (<4 G L(-1)); or (3) purulent sputum. RESULTS: Nosocomial pneumonia was diagnosed in 40 out of 312 patients treated in the ITU during the study period. VAP was diagnosed in 33 patients. Multi-drug resistant bacteria: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16), Acinetobacter baumannii (19), ESBL pathogens (8) and MRSA (1) were cultured from QETA in 32 patients. The sensitivity of QETA was 86%. CONCLUSION: The results allowed for early and accurate diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia and institution of the best possible treatment.
TI  - Accuracy of American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America criteria in predicting infection or colonization with multidrug-resistant bacteria at intensive-care unit admission.
AB  - The aim of this prospective observational study was to determine the accuracy of  American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) criteria in predicting infection or colonization related to multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria at intensive-care unit (ICU) admission. MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime-resistant or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. Screening for MDR bacteria (using nasal and rectal swabs and tracheal aspirates from intubated patients) was performed at ICU admission. Risk factors for infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. The accuracy of ATS/IDSA criteria in predicting infection or colonization with these bacteria at ICU admission was calculated. Eighty-three (13%) of 625 patients were infected or colonized with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. Multivariate analysis allowed identification of prior antimicrobial treatment (OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.2-4.3; p 0.008), residence in a nursing home (OR 2, 95% CI 1.1-3.7; p <0.001), and prior hospitalization (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.7-8.8; p <0.001) as independent predictors of infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. Although sensitivity (89%) and negative predictive values (96%) were high, low specificity (39%) and a positive predictive value (18%) were found when ATS/IDSA criteria were used in predicting infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission. In patients with pneumonia, adherence to guidelines was associated with increased rates of appropriate initial antibiotic treatment and de-escalation. ATS/IDSA criteria had an excellent negative predictive value and a low positive predictive value concerning infection or colonization with MDR bacteria at ICU admission.
TI  - Has the era of untreatable infections arrived?
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a major public health concern, with fears expressed that we shortly will run out of antibiotics. In reality, the picture is more mixed, improving against some pathogens but worsening against others. Against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)--the highest profile pathogen--the range of treatment options is expanding, with daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline all launched, and telavancin, ceftobiprole, ceftaroline and dalbavancin anticipated. There is a greater problem with enterococci, especially if, as in endocarditis, bactericidal activity is needed and the isolate has high-level aminoglycoside resistance; nevertheless, daptomycin, telavancin and razupenem all offer cidal potential. Against Enterobacteriaceae, the rapid and disturbing spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, AmpC enzymes and quinolone resistance is forcing increased reliance on carbapenems, with resistance to these slowly accumulating via the spread of metallo-, KPC and OXA-48 beta-lactamases. Future options overcoming some of these mechanisms include various novel beta-lactamase-inhibitor combinations, but none of these overcomes all the carbapenemase types now circulating. Multiresistance that includes carbapenems is much commoner in non-fermenters than in the Enterobacteriaceae, depending mostly on OXA carbapenemases in Acinetobacter baumannii and on combinations of chromosomal mutation in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No agent in advanced development has much to offer here, though there is interest in modified, less-toxic, polymyxin derivatives and in the siderophore monobactam BAL30072, which has impressive activity against A. baumannii and members of the Burkholderia cepacia complex. A final and surprising problem is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, where each good oral agent has been eroded in turn and where there is now little in reserve behind the oral oxyimino cephalosporins, to which low-level resistance is emerging.
TI  - Antibiotic considerations in the treatment of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens: a case-based review.
AB  - The recent rise in antimicrobial resistance among health-care associated pathogens is a growing public health concern. According to the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System, rates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in intensive care units have nearly doubled over the last decade. Of equal importance, gram-negative agents such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and extended-spectrum beta lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae demonstrate increasing resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, and, in some cases, carbapenems. As a consequence, hospitalists may find themselves utilizing new antibiotics in the treatment of bacterial infections. This case-based review will highlight 8 antibiotics that have emerging clinical indications in treating these multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.
TI  - Minocycline--an old drug for a new century: emphasis on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The epidemiology of nosocomial and community-acquired infections has changed in recent years. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), especially community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA), has emerged as a gram-positive organism with an increasing impact in clinical practice. Infections with Acinetobacter baumannii have become a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Minocycline has significant in vitro activity against MRSA and A. baumannii that is comparable with agents currently used against these organisms. The absence of an intravenous (i.v.) minocycline formulation in recent years has limited its use in seriously ill patients infected with these organisms. However, minocycline i.v. has recently been reintroduced to the US market. The objective of this study was to review available information on the chemistry, mechanism of action, in vitro activity, resistance mechanisms, pharmacokinetics, tolerability and efficacy of minocycline against MRSA and A. baumannii. This article provides suggestions for future studies and potential uses of minocycline and is designed to trigger interest in systematic clinical evaluation of minocycline for patients infected with these organisms. In conclusion, minocycline is an old drug that has the potential to become an important part of the armamentarium against emerging infections such as CA-MRSA and A. baumannii. Owing to its promising profile against these clinically important pathogens as well as excellent pharmacokinetic properties, minocycline merits evaluation in serious infections.
TI  - Intra-abdominal infections: etiology, epidemiology, microbiological diagnosis and antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  The etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. in community-acquired IAIs enterobacteria predominate (mostly Escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly Bacteroides fragilis). In nosocomial IAIs, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. and Candida spp. Diagnostic microbiology of IAIs is complex and plays a relevant role, especially in some situations (e.g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). Antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing IAIs. Resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.
TI  - Detection of Enterobacter sakazakii and other pathogens associated with infant formula powder by use of a DNA microarray.
AB  - Pathogen detection is critical to the process of generating and testing powdered  infant formula (PIF). An obstacle associated with PIF microbial surveillance is that most current procedures are time-consuming and labor-intensive. We have developed a rapid, DNA microarray-based detection technique to identify 10 different pathogenic bacteria associated with PIF contamination based on the 16S-23S rRNA gene internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences and wzy (O antigen polymerase) gene. Using this procedure, Enterobacter sakazakii, Salmonella enterica, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli O157 were identified. One hundred eighty-five strains were used to validate the microarray assay (including 134 target pathogen strains and 51 closely related bacteria). Twenty-seven probes reproducibly detected multiple pathogens with high specificity and sensitivity (0.100 ng genomic DNA or 10(4) CFU/ml). Twenty-one real PIF samples were tested by the microarray with 100% accuracy. The data presented reveal that the designed oligonucleotide microarray is a promising method for basic microbiology, clinical diagnosis, food safety, and epidemiological surveillance.
TI  - Carbapenems and subsequent multiresistant bloodstream infection: does treatment duration matter?
AB  - It has been proposed that initial empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy will result in better clinical outcomes and that shorter courses will reduce the 'collateral damage' of promoting antibiotic resistance. There are few data from Intensive Care Units (ICUs) that support this latter conclusion. A prospective observational study was undertaken at the National University Hospital, Singapore, to examine the relationship between duration of carbapenem therapy and subsequent nosocomial multidrug-resistant (MDR) bloodstream infection (BSI). Over a 2-year period, 415 ICU patients receiving empirical carbapenem therapy were prospectively followed. MDR BSI occurred on 35 occasions in 31 patients, comprising 21 carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, 3 carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 11 meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). There was no difference in the duration of carbapenems for those who developed MDR BSI compared with those who did not [median duration 8 days (range 3-23 days) vs. 9 days (range 3-59 days); P=0.78]. On multivariate analysis using the Cox proportional hazard model the hazard ratio was 0.935 (P=0.070). In this cohort of critically ill patients, a shorter duration of carbapenem therapy was not shown to protect against subsequent development of MDR BSI. Strategies that depend primarily on reducing broad-spectrum antibiotic duration may be inadequate in preventing the emergence of MDR organisms.
TI  - Synthesis, characterization and evaluation of antibacterial activity of some thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties.
AB  - A series of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole incorporating diphenylsulfone moieties were synthesized starting from 5-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thioles 3a-c, X=H, Cl, Br. Thus, alkylation of 1,2,4-triazoles 3 with phenacyl bromide or 4-bromophenacyl bromide afforded S-substituted 1,2,4-triazoles 4, 5. These new intermediates 4 and 5, in the presence of H(2)SO(4) (c), were cyclized to 2-[4-(4-X-phenylsulfonyl)phenyl]-6-(4-Y-phenyl)[1,3]thiazolo[3,2-b]-[1,2,4]-triaz oles 6, 7 (I) and not to isomeric thiazolo[2,3-c][1,2,4]-triazoles 6, 7 (II). The newly synthesized compounds were characterized by IR, (1)H, (13)C NMR and elemental analysis. MS spectra confirmed the formation of thiazolo[3,2-b][1,2,4]triazole 6, 7 (forms I) in detriment of [2,3-c] isomeric compounds (forms II). The potential antibacterial effects of the synthesized compounds were investigated using standard bacterial strains: Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 19606, Citrobacter freundii ATCC 8090, Escherichia coli ATCC 11775, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 19433, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 12600, Staphylococcus epidermidis ATCC 14990, Bacillus cereus ATCC 14579.
TI  - Serious antimicrobial resistance status of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections in North China.
AB  - Antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens causing hospital-acquired lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in Shandong Province, China were investigated using data collected from January 2002 to December 2006. A total of 10 337 isolates were characterized in sputum samples from 39 920 LRTI patients: 68.72% were Gram-negative bacteria, 20.65% were Gram-positive bacteria, and 10.62% were fungi. Organisms most frequently isolated were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.88%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.80%), Escherichia coli (10.71%), fungi (10.62%), Staphylococcus aureus (9.68%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (9.03%). Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against Gram-negative bacteria. Most Gram-positive bacteria were susceptible to vancomycin. Susceptibility to cephalosporins was not optimal and resistance to fluoroquinolones was high. Resistance of Gram-negative bacteria showed a rapid increase over the study period, while resistance of Gram-positive bacteria remained relatively stable. The emergence of resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents used against LRTI pathogens has compounded the problem of using empirical therapy and created selective pressure on physicians to use certain antibiotics.
TI  - Mixture model to assess the extent of cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in hospitals.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Creation of a mixture model based on Poisson processes for assessment  of the extent of cross-transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in the hospital. METHODS: We propose a 2-component mixture of Poisson processes to describe the time series of detected cases of colonization. The first component describes the admission process of patients with colonization, and the second describes the cross-transmission. The data set used to illustrate the method consists of the routinely collected records for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii over a period of 3 years in a German tertiary care hospital. RESULTS: For MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cross-transmission was estimated to be responsible for more than 80% of cases; for imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, cross-transmission was estimated to be responsible for 59% of cases. For new cases observed within a window of less than 28 days for MRSA and multidrug-resistant A. baumannii or 40 days for imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, there was a 50% or greater probability that the cause was cross-transmission. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method offers a solution to assessing of the extent of cross-transmission, which can be of clinical use. The method can be applied using freely available software (the package FlexMix in R) and it requires relatively little data.
TI  - [Etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the etiology of infections in the wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake. METHODS: 2135 smears of secretion were made from 1823 hospitalized wounded victims of Wenchuan Earthquake to detect the pathogens. Specimens were delivered to be cultured. The bacteria thus obtained were identified. Drug sensitivity test was conducted. RESULTS: 2002 specimens, 1243 specimens of secretion (62.1%), 600 blood specimens (30.0%), 102 specimens of pus or secretion of respiratory tract (5.1%), 45 specimens from catheter (2.2%), and 12 urine specimens (0.5%). Pathogens were found in 725 cases. The top five pathogenic bacteria isolated within 1 month after the quake were Acinetobacter baumannii (16.7%), Staphylococcus haemolyticus (16.7%), Escherichia coli (12.5%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), and Candida tropicalis (8.3%), quite different from the pathogen spectrum of the common in-patients within one month before the quake: Escherichia coli (18.2%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.4%), Candida glabrata (11.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (9.1%). The isolation rate of methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus after the earthquake was significantly lower, and the isolation rates of extended spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Klebsiella oxytoca were all significantly higher than those from the common surgical patients before the quake (all P < 0.05). There were not significant differences in the isolation rates of multi-drug resistant Pseudomonas alcaligenes and Acinetobacter baumannii before and after the quake. CONCLUSION: Infection is frequent after natural disasters. It is necessary to summarize the changes of spectrum of pathogens and drug-resistant spectrum.
TI  - Advances in antibacterial therapy against emerging bacterial pathogens.
AB  - During the last decade, both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that are resistant to most or all available antibacterial classes have become increasingly prevalent nosocomial pathogens, particularly among immunocompromised patients and those hospitalized in intensive care units. Among gram-positive bacteria, increasing concerns are posed for health care- and community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), S aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). A spectrum of newer antibacterial agents has been developed for the treatment of multi-resistant gram-positive bacteria, such as linezolid, tigecycline, daptomycin, and novel glycopeptides. Gram-negative bacteria have also developed multidrug resistance (MDR), which in the Enterobacteriacae is commonly due to the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases of VIM, IMP, or KPC types. Currently, non-fermenting bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are commonly resistant to all available antibiotics, including the newer agents. Colistin retains activity against most P aeruginosa and A baumannii, but its clinical use remains questionable, while newer carbapenems and tigecycline have limited additional advantages. Rational use of newer antibacterial agents coupled with enhanced infection control measures may be able to sufficiently control MDR organisms as to allow hematological patients to recover from serious infectious complications.
TI  - Spectrum of practice in the diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in patients requiring mechanical ventilation in European intensive care units.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Information on clinical practice regarding the diagnosis of pneumonia in European intensive care units is limited. The aim of this study was to describe the spectrum of actual diagnostic practices in a large sample of European intensive care units. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, multicenter study. SETTING: Twenty-seven intensive care units of nine European countries. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation for an admission diagnosis of pneumonia or receiving mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs irrespective of admission diagnosis. INTERVENTIONS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 2,436 patients were evaluated; 827 were admitted with or developed nosocomial pneumonia (hospital-acquired pneumonia [HAP], 27.1%; ventilator-associated pneumonia [VAP], 56.2%; very early onset VAP, 16.7%). Mean age was 59.4 +/- 18.1 yrs, 65.0% were men, and mean admission Simplified Acute Physiology Score II was 46.7 +/- 17.1. Worsening oxygenation (76.8%), purulent/changing respiratory secretions (72.1%), and new temperature elevation (69.2%) were the most frequent clinical signs of nosocomial pneumonia. Etiological diagnosis was based on noninvasive respiratory specimens in 74.8% of episodes. Bronchoscopy was performed in 23.3% of episodes. Bronchoscopy performance, after adjustment by severity of illness, age, and type of hospital, were predicted by worsening oxygenation (odds ratio 2.03; 95% confidence interval, 1.27-3.24) and male sex (odds ratio 1.77; 95% confidence interval, 1.19-2.65). Definite cause was documented in 69.5% of nosocomial pneumonia cases. The most common isolates were Staphylococcus aureus (16.3% methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and 16.0% methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (23.1%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (19.1%). Presence of nosocomial pneumonia significantly prolonged mean length of mechanical ventilation (10.3 days, p < .05) and mean intensive care unit length of stay (12.2 days, p < .05) in intensive care unit survivors. Mortality rate was 37.7% for nosocomial pneumonia vs. 31.6% for patients without pneumonia (p < .05). CONCLUSIONS: Etiological diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia in a large sample of European intensive care units was based mainly on noninvasive techniques. However, there was high variability in bronchoscopy use between the participating intensive care units.
TI  - The relative roles of bacteria and host inflammatory cells in SIgA degradation.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Secretory Immunoglobulin (Ig) A, the most important Ig for lung defense, is highly dependent on its molecular structure for its immune activity. Proteolytic cleavage of SIgA may occur in the airways and render the SIgA molecule inactive. Previous studies have attributed IgA cleavage to neutrophils (polymorphonucleur cells [PMNs]) and other host immunoinflammatory cells in the airways or bacterial pathogens. The resultant IgA degradation leads to airway inflammation and subsequent pneumonia. The aim of this study was to discern the relative roles of host inflammatory cells and bacteria in SIgA cleavage in vitro. METHODS: SIgA was cocultured with PMNs, PMNs activated with fMLP, monocytes, monocytes pretreated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas, or Acinetobacter alone or with monocyte culture supernatants and PMNs. SIgA cleavage resulted in two fractions, a <75 kDa fraction (secretory component fraction) and an intact SIgA fraction by size exclusion ultrafiltration. This was quantified by ELISA and confirmed by SDS-PAGE. RESULTS: Neither naive nor activated PMNs showed any cleavage of SIgA. Unstimulated monocytes or LPS stimulated monocytes also failed to demonstrate fragmentation of SIgA. Only modest SIgA cleavage was noted when both PMNs and monocytes were stimulated before coculture with SIgA but marked SIgA proteolysis was noted with the addition of Pseudomonas or Acinetobacter but not MRSA. CONCLUSIONS: Bacterial pathogens, but not activated immunoinflammatory cells, were responsible for SIgA degradation in this study. This was evident only with Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter. This may be a virulence factor for pneumonia with these pathogens in vivo.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance in clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus does not impact sensitivity to human beta defensin 4.
AB  - Antibiotic usage is essential for infection control but hastens emergence of antibiotic resistant microbes. In particular, Acinetobacter baumannii is an important pathogen because of its heightened ability to acquire drug resistance. The need for novel antibacterial agents led us to evaluate the sensitivity of drug-resistant bacteria to the antimicrobial activity of human beta defensin 4 (HBD-4). Clinical isolates of A. baumannii (N=14), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=15), and Staphylococcus aureus (N=20), including 10 methicillin-resistant (MRSA) isolates, were examined. All bacterial strains were susceptible to HBD-4 antimicrobial activity, with no correlation between antibiotic resistance and HBD-4 sensitivity. The results demonstrate that antibiotic resistant microorganisms, including MRSA, can be inhibited by HBD-4, which may represent an effective therapeutic agent for infections involving drug-resistant microorganisms.
TI  - Antibacterial and antifungal activity of Flindersine isolated from the traditional medicinal plant, Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam.
AB  - AIM OF THE STUDY: The leaves and root of Toddalia asiatica (L.) Lam. (Rutaceae) are widely used as a folk medicine in India. Hexane, chloroform, ethyl acetate, methanol and water extracts of Toddalia asiatica leaves and isolated compound Flindersine were tested against bacteria and fungi. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were tested against bacteria and fungi using disc-diffusion method and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs). The compound was confirmed using X-ray crystallography technique. RESULTS: Antibacterial and antifungal activities were observed in ethyl acetate extract. One active principle Flindersine (2,6-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-5H-pyrano [3,2-c] quinoline-5-one-9cl) was isolated from the ethyl acetate extract. The MIC values of the compound against bacteria Bacillus subtilis (31.25 microg/ml), Staphylococcus aureus (62.5 microg/ml), Staphylococcus epidermidis (62.5 microg/ml), Enterococcus faecalis (31.25 microg/ml), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (250 microg/ml), Acinetobacter baumannii (125 microg/ml) and fungi Trichophyton rubrum 57 (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton mentagrophytes (62.5 microg/ml), Trichophyton simii (62.5 microg/ml), Epidermophyton floccosum (62.5 microg/ml), Magnaporthe grisea (250 microg/ml) and Candida albicans (250 microg/ml) were determined. CONCLUSIONS: Ethyl acetate extract showed promising antibacterial and antifungal activity and isolated compound Flindersine showed moderate activity against bacteria and fungi.
TI  - A longitudinal analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility in clinical institutions  in Germany as part of the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (2004-2007).
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (T.E.S.T.) global surveillance program has been designed to assess the in vitro activity of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent tigecycline plus several comparative agents. METHODS: In vitro activities of bacterial isolates obtained from 13 centers in Germany between 2004 and 2007 were evaluated longitudinally and pooled, using the interpretive criteria of the European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST). RESULTS: Tigecycline demonstrated good activity against both Gram-positive and -negative pathogens monitored in this study [minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) 0.06-2 microg/ml] with the exception of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which had elevated MICs for most antimicrobial agents. Imipenem and meropenem also showed good activity (MIC(90) <or=0.06-4 microg/ml) against most Gram-negative pathogens but were less active against Gram-positive organisms (MIC(90) <or=0.12 to >or=32 microg/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline was highly active against most pathogens monitored in the T.E.S.T. study. A low tigecycline MIC(90) was reported against Acinetobacter baumannii and drug-resistant Enterococcus faecium,Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The carbapenems showed the lowest MIC(90) values against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-positive E. coli. E. coli susceptibility to most antimicrobial agents decreased over the course of this study.
TI  - Radical Scavenging Activity of the Essential Oil of Silver Fir (Abies alba).
AB  - The essential oil of silver fir (Abies alba) is known to help respiratory system  and have easing and soothing effect for muscle. In the present study, we investigated the chemical composition, cytotoxicity and its biological activities of silver fir (Abies alba) essential oil. The composition of the oil was analyzed by GC-MS and bornyl acetate (30.31%), camphene (19.81%), 3-carene (13.85%), tricyclene (12.90%), dl-limonene (7.50%), alpha-pinene (2.87%), caryophyllene (2.18%), beta-phellandrene (2.13%), borneol (1.74%), bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-2-ene,2,3-dimethyl (1.64%) and alpha-terpinene (1.24%) were the major components in the oil. The results tested by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay indicated that the oil showed no cytotoxic effect, at concentrations of 1 and 5%, for as long as 24 and 3 h, respectively. The antiradical capacity was evaluated by measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oil on the 2,20-diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2,2'-azino-bis 3-ethyl benzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) radicals. The oil was able to reduce the both radicals dose-dependently, and the concentration required for 50% reduction (RC(50)) against DPPH radicals (2.7 +/- 0.63%) was lower than ABTS radicals (8.5 +/- 0.27%). The antibacterial activity of the oil was also evaluated using disc diffusion method against Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus mutans, Listeria monocytogenes, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, and Vibrio parahaemolyticcus. The oil exhibited no antibacterial activity against all the bacterial strains tested except S. aureus of mild activity.
TI  - Silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coatings: antibacterial activity and surface analysis.
AB  - The colonisation of clinical and industrial surfaces with pathogenic microorganisms has prompted increased research into the development of effective antibacterial and antifouling coatings. There is evidence that implanted biomedical surfaces coated with metallic silver can be inactivated by physiological fluids, thus reducing the bioactivity of the coating. In this work, we report the biofilm inhibition of Staphylococcus epidermidis using a room temperature processed silver doped perfluoropolyether-urethane coating. The release of silver ions from these fluoropolymers over a six-day period inhibited bacterial encrustation - as observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis indicated differences in carbon, fluorine and sodium surface composition between silver doped and undoped fluoropolymers after exposure to nutrient rich media. These silver doped perfluoropolyether coatings also exhibited antibacterial activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii; suggesting potential use in preventing transmission of pathogenic and opportunistic microbes on environmental surfaces in healthcare facilities. The broad-spectrum antibacterial activity of these silver release coatings may be exploited on biomaterials surfaces to combat the development of resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae that can occur during prophylactic treatment for urinary tract infections.
TI  - A simple and large-scale strategy for the preparation of Ag nanoparticles supported on resin-derived carbon and their antibacterial properties.
AB  - A simple strategy was developed for preparing stable Ag nanoparticles supported on carbon by carbonizing Ag(+)/acrylic acid type ion-exchange resin complexes under N(2) atmosphere. The products were characterized by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and UV-visible absorption spectroscopy. The results indicated that the Ag nanoparticles were well dispersed on the surface of carbon, and their size could be regulated by tuning the carbonization temperature. The antibacterial assay showed that the Ag/C composites possess good antibacterial properties that are determined largely by the Ag particle size. Furthermore, the composites are very stable and they do not show obviously change even after storing at ambient conditions for more than one year.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of tigecycline and comparators against bacterial isolates collected as part of the TEST study in Europe (2004-2007).
AB  - Tigecycline is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that has been approved for the treatment of skin and soft-tissue infections as well as intra-abdominal infections. The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) is a global, longitudinal surveillance study established in 2004 to monitor the in vitro activity of tigecycline and comparator agents against key Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens. This report examines data obtained for 24748 isolates collected across 24 European countries between 2004 and 2007. Tigecycline, meropenem and imipenem were the most active antimicrobial agents against most Gram-negative isolates including multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (15.7% of the A. baumannii isolates in this study), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli (8.5% of E. coli) and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.6% of K. pneumoniae). Only amikacin was active against >90% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates (92.8% susceptible). Tigecycline, linezolid and vancomycin were the most active agents against Gram-positive agents across Europe between 2004 and 2007, with tigecycline displaying the lowest MIC(90) values (minimum inhibitory concentration for 90% of the organisms) against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26.5% of the collected S. aureus isolates), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (15.7% of the E. faecium strains) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (9.3% of the S. pneumoniae strains). Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline MIC values over the 4-year study period, whilst increased resistance was noted for several comparator agents.
TI  - [Retrospective evaluation of 15 cases with psoas abscesses].
AB  - Psoas abscesses are suppurative collections within the fascia surrounding the psoas and iliacus muscles. In this retrospective study it was aimed to evaluate the demographic characteristics, clinical and laboratory findings and treatment outcomes of 15 psoas abscess cases admitted to Baskent University Hospital, Ankara, Turkey during June 2003-January 2008 period. The mean age of the patients was 55.8 years (range 18 to 70 years) with a female to male ratio of 5/10. Thirteen of the cases (86.5%) were admitted with the complaints of fever and back pain. Thirteen of the cases were diagnosed by abdominal computerized tomography while the other two by abdominal ultrasonography. One of the 15 patients was considered as primary psoas abscess, while the remaining 14 as secondary psoas abscess. The most common accompanying disease was diabetes mellitus (66.6%). Fourteen patients with secondary psoas abscess had vertebral osteomyelitis which was due to tuberculosis in five cases, to urinary tract infection in five cases, to pneumoniae in two cases, to surgical infection in one case and to brucellosis in one case. The cultivation of the abscess material from the 14 secondary psoas abscess cases revealed growth of bacteria in 11 of them (5 Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 1 Escherichia coli, 1 methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, 1 methicilin-resistant S. aureus, 1 Acinetobacter baumannii, 1 Brucella melitensis, 1 Serratia marcescens). The biochemical parameters of the cases (mean leukocyte counts: 14.500 cell/mm3; mean erythrocyte sedimentation rates: 78 mm/hour; mean C-reactive protein levels: 108 mg/dl) were also high. Thirteen patients underwent percutaneous drainage and received appropriate antibiotic treatment and the other two patients were treated with open surgical debridement. The duration of antimicrobial treatment was one year for M. tuberculosis cases and about 4-6 weeks in the others. One of the cases died due to complicating meningitis and sepsis. It is remarkable that in our series none of the psoas abscess cases were secondary to the diseases of the digestive tract unlike the series indicated in the literature. The isolation of M. tuberculosis as the causative agent in 5 (33.3%) cases emphasizes the fact that tuberculosis is still an important public health problem in Turkey.
TI  - Regulation of Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm formation.
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a Gram-negative opportunistic nosocomial pathogen. This microorganism survives in hospital environments despite unfavorable conditions such as desiccation, nutrient starvation and antimicrobial treatments. It is hypothesized that its ability to persist in these environments, as well as its virulence, is a result of its capacity to form biofilms. A. baumannii forms biofilms on abiotic surfaces such as polystyrene and glass as well as biotic surfaces such as epithelial cells and fungal filaments. Pili assembly and production of the Bap surface-adhesion protein play a role in biofilm initiation and maturation after initial attachment to abiotic surfaces. Furthermore, the adhesion and biofilm phenotypes of some clinical isolates seem to be related to the presence of broad-spectrum antibiotic resistance. The regulation of the formation and development of these biofilms is as diverse as the surfaces on which this bacterium persists and as the cellular components that participate in this programmed multistep process. The regulatory processes associated with biofilm formation include sensing of bacterial cell density, the presence of different nutrients and the concentration of free cations available to bacterial cells. Some of these extracellular signals may be sensed by two-component regulatory systems such as BfmRS. This transcriptional regulatory system activates the expression of the usher-chaperone assembly system responsible for the production of pili, needed for cell attachment and biofilm formation on polystyrene surfaces. However, such a system is not required for biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces when cells are cultured in chemically defined media. Interestingly, the BfmRS system also controls cell morphology under particular culture conditions.
TI  - [Clinical experience with tigecycline in the treatment of nosocomial infections caused by isolates exhibiting prevalent resistance mechanisms].
AB  - This article reviews the clinical experience with tigecycline in the treatment of infections caused by microorganisms with prevalent resistance mechanisms among nosocomial microbiota, as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug- resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and enterobacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases. Most of articles found in the literature describe the use of tigecycline in the treatment of severe infections (sepsis and septic shock, nosocomial pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia...) produced by multidrug-resistant microorganisms, in patients with multiple comorbidities (admitted in ICU, with malignancies, transplants and/or immunodepressed...) and in many occasions after failures of previous antibiotic treatments. Favourable outcomes with tigecycline are reported in most articles. However, an accurate global assessment is difficult since, in addition to the described confounding factors, there are concomitant or sequential antibiotic treatments in several communications, and lack of relevant clinical (as comorbidities), microbiological (as susceptibility) and outcome (different criteria by different authors) data in others. More even, the described series are retrospective and lack of control groups. Nevertheless the usefulness of this revision is based on the fact that in daily clinical practice the use of tigecycline will increase, since epidemiology of specific hospital medical units shows multidrug resistance among nosocomial isolates and tigecycline can be one of the scarce available compounds active against multidrug-resistant strains/clones.
TI  - Success of an infection control program to reduce the spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of enhanced infection control measures with screening for gastrointestinal colonization on limiting the spread of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae in a New York City hospital endemic for this pathogen. DESIGN: Retrospective observational study with pre- and postinterventional phases. METHODS: Beginning in 2006, a comprehensive infection control program was instituted in a 10-bed medical and surgical intensive care unit at a university-based medical center. In addition to being placed in contact isolation, all patients colonized or infected with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus were cohorted to one end of the unit. Improved decontamination of hands and environmental surfaces was encouraged. In addition, routine rectal surveillance cultures were screened for the presence of carbapenem-resistant pathogens. The number of patients per quarter with clinical cultures positive for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae was compared during the approximately 2-year periods before and after the intervention. RESULTS: The mean number (+/-SD) of new patients per 1,000 patient-days per quarter with cultures yielding carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae decreased from 9.7 +/- 2.2 before the intervention to 3.7 +/- 1.6 after the intervention (P < .001). There was no change in the mean number of patient-days or the mean number of patients per quarter with cultures yielding methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus, or carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa after the intervention. There was no association between antibiotic usage patterns and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. CONCLUSIONS: The comprehensive intervention that combined intensified infection control measures with routine rectal surveillance cultures was helpful in reducing the incidence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae in an intensive care unit where strains producing the carbapenemase KPC were endemic.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of acetic acid--an alternative to common local antiseptics?
AB  - Acetic acid has been commonly used in medicine for more than 6000 years for the disinfection of wounds and especially as an antiseptic agent in the treatment and prophylaxis of the plague. The main goal of this study was to prove the suitability of acetic acid, in low concentration of 3%, as a local antiseptic agent, especially for use in salvage procedures in problematic infections caused by organisms such as Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This study was designed to compare the in vitro antimicrobial effect of acetic acid with those of common local antiseptics such as povidone-iodine 11% (Betaisodona), polyhexanide 0.04% (Lavasept), mafenide 5% and chlohexidine gluconate 1.5% cetrimide 15% (Hibicet). Former studies suggest the bactericidal effect of acetic acid, but these data are very heterogeneous; therefore, a standardised in vitro study was conducted. To cover the typical bacterial spectrum of a burn unit, the following Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacterial strains were tested: Escherichia coli, P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and beta-haemolytic Streptococcus group A and B. The tests showed excellent bactericidal effect of acetic acid, particularly with problematic Gram-negative bacteria such as P. vulgaris, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The microbiological spectrum of acetic acid is wide, even when tested at a low concentration of 3%. In comparison to our currently used antiseptic solutions, it showed similar - in some bacteria, even better - bactericidal properties. An evaluation of the clinical value of topical application of acetic acid is currently underway. It can be concluded that acetic acid in a concentration of 3% has excellent bactericidal effect and, therefore, seems to be suitable as a local antiseptic agent, but further clinical studies are necessary.
TI  - The effects of the bacterial interaction with visible-light responsive titania photocatalyst on the bactericidal performance.
AB  - Bactericidal activity of traditional titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalyst is effective only upon irradiation by ultraviolet light, which restricts the potential applications of TiO2 for use in our living environments. Recently carbon-containing TiO2 was found to be photoactive at visible-light illumination that affords the potential to overcome this problem; although, the bactericidal activity of these photocatalysts is relatively lower than conventional disinfectants. Evidenced from scanning electron microscopy and confocal Raman spectral mapping analysis, we found the interaction with bacteria was significantly enhanced in these anatase/rutile mixed-phase carbon-containing TiO2. Bacteria-killing experiments indicate that a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens including Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella flexneri and Acinetobacter baumannii, were eliminated by the new nanoparticle with higher bacterial interaction property. These findings suggest the created materials with high bacterial interaction ability might be a useful strategy to improve the antimicrobial activity of visible-light-activated TiO2.
TI  - Tigecycline.
AB  - Infection with resistant pathogens can adversely affect clinical, microbiological and economic outcomes. New agents for the treatment of many such serious infections are acutely needed in hospital practice. Tigecycline is a novel glycylcycline antimicrobial for intravenous use. It has an expanded broad-spectrum antibacterial activity including multi-drug resistant pathogens, like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , vancomycin-resistant enterococci , multi-drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae , extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria and Acinetobacter baumannii . Tigecycline however is not active against Proteus, Providencia and Pseudomonas species. Its currently approved indications include complicated skin and skin structure infections and complicated intra-abdominal infections. It has also been found to be effective for the treatment of community- as well as hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia and bacteremia, sepsis with shock and urinary tract infections. Tigecycline appears to be a valuable treatment option for the management of superbugs, especially where conventional therapy has failed.
TI  - Novel use of antimicrobial hand sanitizer in treatment of nosocomial acinetobacter infection.
AB  - Colonization of wounds with multidrug-resistant organisms is a difficult orthopedic problem. Acinetobacter infections are especially difficult because they are resistant to all currently available antibiotics. We present the use of a novel skin sanitizer, Stay Byotrol Clean (Byotrol Inc, Spartanburg, South Carolina), to treat a multidrug-resistant wound infection. A 31-year-old T10 paraplegic man presented with chronic bilateral stage IV decubitus trochanteric ulcers. Cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus. The ulcers were initially treated with irrigation and debridement and vancomycin, levaquin, and cefepime. After 4 months of aggressive treatment, the cultures continued to be positive for Escherichia coli and Acinetobacter baumannii. The patient was started on amikacin and tigecycline. Despite 1 additional month of aggressive wound care, debridements, and intravenous antibiotics, the cultures continued to grow A baumannii and Pseudomonas aerug. The A baumannii was resistant to all available antibiotics tested. The ulcers were then treated with daily application of Stay Byotrol Clean hand and skin sanitizer. Four days later, cultures were negative for any bacterial growth, with no A baumannii. After 1 week, the ulcers showed new granulation tissue with no visible necrotic tissue. After 3 months of treatment, the ulcers had healed. Stay Byotrol Clean is nonirritating and contains no iodine or alcohol. It is currently being used for decolonization of patients on admission to the hospital, however, there is great potential for its use in wound treatment, preoperative surgical sterilization, and orthopedic devices.
TI  - [Distribution and drug resistance analysis of bacteria in different wound infections].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the distribution and drug resistance of bacteria in different wound infections and provide evidence for wound infection control in subtropical regions. METHODS: This study involved 265 patients from 4 different departments of our hospital who experienced wound infections between July, 2007 and July, 2008. The bacterial strain distribution in the wounds and drug resistance of the bacteria were analyzed. RESULTS: Acinetobacter baumanii (39% of the total strain identified) was the most frequent bacterial strain causing infection of the burn wounds, followed by Proteus mirabilis (20%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20%). E. coli infection was prevalent in the departments of general surgery (37%) and urinary surgery (64%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Pseudomonas pneumonia infections were detected at the rate of 30% and 43% in the urinary surgery department, respectively. Different bacterial strains were found at similar rates around 10% in the wounds of patients undergoing traumatic surgery. CONCLUSION: Despite that the commonly seen pathogenic bacteria in burn patients including Staphylococcus aureus have been effectively controlled by early application of antibiotics, the opportunistic pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumanii and Proteus mirabilis often survive these antibiotics, and some strains evolve to be drug-resistant and even multi-drug-resistant. E. coli infection is prevalent in general surgery and urinary surgery departments, where Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections can also be found frequently. All kinds of bacteria infection are present in trauma surgery department, each found at the rate around 10%.
TI  - Decontamination of laundry at low temperature with CuWB50, a novel copper-based biocidal compound.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Traditional laundry decontamination relies on thermal disinfection that degrades textiles. We investigated the ability of a novel copper-based biocidal compound, CuWB50, to assist in the decontamination of swatches purposely contaminated with Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter during "real-life" low-temperature machine washing with and without 2 commercial detergents. METHODS: Contaminated and noncontaminated swatches were attached to ballast sheets and washed in cold water for 15 minutes in an industrial Electrolux machine. We assessed colony-forming units (cfu) on the swatches and in the postwash water. RESULTS: Low-temperature machine washing produced only partial reductions in viable methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus baumannii counts on swatches and resulted in cross contamination of other swatches in the same wash. Washing with CuWB50 alone at high concentration (100 mg/L), however, resulted in superior decontamination compared with water alone, whereas washing with a combination of detergent and CuWB50 at low concentration (5 mg/L) yielded synergistic and complete decontamination of swatches and postwash water. CONCLUSION: Our results show highly effective laundry decontamination using CuWB50 with detergent at low temperature and are timely both in terms of rising energy costs and textile degradation issues.
TI  - [Bacteriological profile and antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolates in a burn department].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial infections remain the main cause of morbidity and mortality in burn patients. Ongoing surveillance of infections in burned patients is essential to detect changes in epidemiology and to guide better empirical antibiotherapy and infection control policies. The aim of this study is to analyze the bacterial flora and the antibiotic resistance of isolates in a burn department during a two year period METHODS: From 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2006, 1268 strains were isolated from different specimens. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing has been carried out by disk diffusion method as referred to the French Society of Microbiology. All data were stored in a laboratory data base using whonet 5.3 software. Duplicate isolates defined as the same bacterial species for the same patient with the same antimicrobial susceptibility profile were excluded. RESULTS: The most frequently identified species were Staphylococcus aureus (19.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (11.8%), Providencia stuarttii. The rate of meticillin resistant S. aureus was 68.1%, all isolates were fully susceptibles to glycopeptide. P. aeruginosa resistance was 35.6% and 35.4% respectively for ceftazidime and imipenem. Concerning A. baumannii, 98.7% of strains were resistant to ceftazidime, 59.5% to imipenem and 87.5% to ciprofloxacin. 77.3% of P. stuarttii isolates were resistant to ceftazidime and were producing extended spectrum, lactamase (ESBL). The frequencies of resistance to ceftazidime, of loxacin and amikacin of K. pneumoniae were respectively 60.9%, 25.4% and 47.1%. CONCLUSION: Comparatively to the previous years, S. aureus still be the commonest pathogen in the burn department. The incidence of antimicrobial resistance has decreased during 2006 after a peak of multiresistance during 2005. Our results should be helpful in providing useful information regarding antimicrobial resistance among the burn isolates and this will help in formulation of effective guideline for therapy.
TI  - [Surveillance of multidrug resistant bacteria in a Tunisian hospital].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Controlling antibiotic resistance of bacteria is a priority for public healthcare. AIM: This study concerned the frequency of multidrug resistant bacteria (MDRB) in a Tunisian Hospital with the aim of establishing guidelines for MDRB prevention. METHODS: The study was conducted during two years (1 January 2005-31 December 2006). Samples collected for the clinical diagnostic were included. The MDRB concerned were: methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus(MRSA), Enterobacteriacae resistant to of third generation cephalosporin (ER3GC), Acinetobacter baumannii resistant to both imipenem and ceftazidime, Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to both imipenem and ceftazidime. RESULTS: During the study period, 2475 bacteria were tested by disk diffusion. 597 MDRB were collected, the rate of MBR was 24.1%. These MDRB were mainly recovered in burn unit (82.6%). ER3GC (47%) and MRSA (29,2%) were the most frequent MDRB. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa multiresistant concerned 14,8% and 9% of MDRB. MDRB were isolated mainly from blood cultures (45%). The rate of MRSA was 46.4% among 375 strains of S. aureus. ER3GC represented 25,6% among 1096 isolates. Concerning A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa, 51.7% and 20.5% were resistant to both imipenem and ceftazidime among 170 and 264 isolates. Antibiotic resistance evolution showed a decrease of resistance in 2006 versus 2005. This decrease should be explained by the improvement of hygiene measure especially hand washing with the introduction of hydro- alcoholic solutions, a better targeted antibiotherapy promoted by a close cooperation between microbiologists and clinicians. CONCLUSION: The MDRB were frequent in our hospital. They were mainly isolated from the burn department. The measures of prevention already implemented are effective and must be strengthened with the continuous surveillance of MDRB.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a paediatric intensive care unit in a developing country with high HIV prevalence.
AB  - AIM: To obtain preliminary prevalence, aetiological and outcome data on South African paediatric patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). METHODS: Non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens taken between January 2004 and September 2005 were prospectively recorded and related clinical data were retrospectively reviewed. VAP was defined as a new isolate on BAL and a modified Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score > or =5. RESULTS: A total of 230 patients aged 3.9 (2.2-9.1) months (median interquartile range (IQR) ) underwent 309 BALs during 244 paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admissions. Most patients (84%) were admitted with acute infectious diseases, with a 70% incidence of comorbidity. Thirty-three patients (14.3%) were HIV-exposed but uninfected and 58 (25.2%) were HIV-infected. Of 172 BALs taken > or =48 h after intubation, 63 specimens from 55 patients fulfilled VAP criteria. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most common VAP pathogen, followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae, viruses, yeasts and Staphylococcus aureus. Patients who developed VAP had a higher proportion of comorbid conditions (76% vs. 55%, P= 0.01) and reintubations (39% vs. 12%, P < 0.0001) when compared with non-VAP patients. Median (IQR) length of PICU stay was 12.5 (5-21) days versus 8 (5-14) days (P= 0.03); and the risk adjusted PICU mortality was 1.38 versus 0.79 (P= 0.002) in VAP versus non-VAP patients, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VAP is associated with significant morbidity and mortality and may relate to the high incidence of comorbid conditions in this population. Primary VAP pathogens differ from developed countries.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial activity of cationic polyethylenimines on dry surfaces.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of cationic N-dodecyl-N-methylpolyethylenimine (PEI+)  against S. aureus, A. baumannii, and E. coli was evaluated when the polymer was applied as a coating to various surfaces using a paint-like procedure. Antimicrobial activity of PEI+ as a function of time was determined using an assay for long-term survival involving placement of single drops of various bacterial concentrations on dry surfaces. These data were compared with an assay method where bacteria were applied by spraying and surfaces were incubated overnight under agar. PEI+-coated surfaces were found to be highly bactericidal after 30 min when bacteria were sprayed onto surfaces. However, when bacteria were applied as single drops, PEI+-coated surfaces were less biocidal at short contact times particularly for A. baumannii and E. coli. The observations are explained in the context of the difference in drying time between drops deposited on uncoated surfaces and PEI+-coated surfaces and the sensitivity of bacterial survival to dehydration. These results demonstrate that PEI+-coated surfaces are not effectively biocidal for some types of bacteria under certain conditions and that the method of assaying bactericidal efficiency can greatly affect the results obtained.
TI  - Inhibition of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm formation with a class of TAGE-triazole conjugates.
AB  - A chemically diverse library of TAGE-triazole conjugates was synthesized utilizing click chemistry on the TAGE scaffold. This library of small molecules was screened for anti-biofilm activity and found to possess the ability of inhibiting biofilm formation against Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. One such compound in this library demonstrated the most potent inhibitory effect against Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation that has been displayed by any 2-aminoimidazole derivative.
TI  - Gallium maltolate treatment eradicates Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection in thermally injured mice.
AB  - Gallium (Ga) is a semimetallic element that has demonstrated therapeutic and diagnostic-imaging potential in a number of disease settings, including cancer and infectious diseases. Gallium's biological actions stem from its ionic radius being almost the same as that of ferric iron (Fe(3+)), whereby it can replace iron (Fe) in Fe(3+)-dependent biological systems, such as bacterial and mammalian Fe transporters and Fe(3+)-containing enzymes. Unlike Fe(3+), ionic gallium (Ga(3+)) cannot be reduced, and when incorporated, it inactivates Fe(3+)-dependent reduction and oxidation processes that are necessary for bacterial and mammalian cell proliferation. Most pathogenic bacteria require Fe for growth and function, and the availability of Fe in the host or environment can greatly enhance virulence. We examined whether gallium maltolate (GaM), a novel formulation of Ga, had antibacterial activity in a thermally injured acute infection mouse model. Dose-response studies indicated that a GaM dose as low as 25 mg/kg of body weight delivered subcutaneously was sufficient to provide 100% survival in a lethal P. aeruginosa-infected thermally injured mouse model. Mice treated with 100 mg/kg GaM had undetectable levels of Pseudomonas aeruginosa in their wounds, livers, and spleens, while the wounds of untreated mice were colonized with over 10(8) P. aeruginosa CFU/g of tissue and their livers and spleens were colonized with over 10(5) P. aeruginosa CFU/g of tissue. GaM also significantly reduced the colonization of Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii in the wounds of thermally injured mice. Furthermore, GaM was also therapeutically effective in preventing preestablished P. aeruginosa infections at the site of the injury from spreading systemically. Taken together, our data suggest that GaM is potentially a novel antibacterial agent for the prevention and treatment of wound infections following thermal injury.
TI  - Efficacy of novel antimicrobial gloves impregnated with antiseptic dyes in preventing the adherence of multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Contaminated gloves are a major source of transmission of bacteria in the hospital and food industry. We investigated the efficacy of gloves impregnated with a combination of antiseptics consisting of brilliant green dye and chlorhexidine (Gardine). METHODS: Gardine-coated and uncoated 1-cm(2) segments of latex examination and nitrile examination gloves (Spontex, Columbia, TN) were exposed to 1.5 x 10(8) colony-forming units (CFU)/mL methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci, multidrug resistant (MDR) Escherichia coli, MDR-Acinetobacter baumannii, or Candida albicans as indicated by our brief exposure method. At least 3 glove segments were tested in each group, and growth was scored as mean CFU/cm(2). Segments were dried for various time periods (30 seconds, 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 1 hour) and streaked face down on agar plates. Plates were incubated overnight at 37 degrees C, and growth was quantitated. RESULTS: Gardine-coated latex and nitrile gloves showed significant reduction, an average of 6 logs and 5 logs, respectively, within 30 seconds or 10 minutes when tested against MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, MDR-E coli, MDR-Acientobacter, and C albicans. Complete kill, 8-log reduction, was seen within 30 seconds for MRSA and E coli in both Gardine-coated latex and nitrile gloves. CONCLUSION: Gloves impregnated with Gardine antiseptic dye were highly efficacious in preventing contamination of nosocomial-resistant pathogens on the outer surface of glove and may be useful in the food industry or clinical setting.
TI  - [Investigation of the effect of efflux pump inhibitors to MIC values of ciprofloxacin in clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus].
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of efflux pump inhibitors on the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of ciprofloxacin (CIP) in fluoroquinolone-resistant 42 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n= 42), Escherichia coil (n= 97), Acinetobacter baumannii (n= 58) and Staphylococcus aureus (n= 80) strains isolated from clinical specimens. For this purpose phenylalanyl-arginyl-beta-naphthylamide (PA beta N) was used for P. aeruginosa, E. coli, A. baumannii and reserpine for S. aureus isolates as pump inhibitors. Fluoroquinolone resistance of the clinical isolates were determined by VITEK2 Compact (BioMerieux, France) automated system and confirmed with standard broth microdilution method. For the investigation of the effects of inhibitor agents, the MIC values were also determined in the presence of 25 microg/ml and 100 microg/ml PA beta N and 20 microg/ml reserpine. In the presence of 25 mg/l PA beta N, 61.9% of CIP resistant P. aeruginosa strains converted to susceptible ones, while this rate was 73.8% in the presence of 100 mg/l PA beta N. In A. baumannii clinical isolates, 8.6% and 15.5% of CIP-resistant strains have become susceptible in the presence of 25 mg/l and 100 mg/l PA beta N, respectively. Similarly the MIC values for CIP have decreased > or = 4 folds in 42.2%, and > or = 2 folds in 30.9% of E. coli isolates, in the presence of 25 mg/l PA beta N, however, there was no change in MICs of 26.9% of E. coli strains. The MIC values have also been lowered for > or = 4 folds in 83.6%, and two folds in 13.4% of E. coli strains by the use of 100 mg/l PA beta N concentration, however, no decrease in MIC values was detected in 3% of the isolates. 20 mg/l of reserpine have caused a decrease of > or = 4 folds in 8.75%, and two folds in 33.75% of S. aureus isolates, while there was no change in MIC values of 57.5% of S. aureus strains. Our results showed that PA beta N causes significant reduction in MIC values for CIP in the clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, E. coli and A. baumannii and this effect may be attributed to efflux pump inhibition. In contrast, it was concluded that reserpine does not have a considerable effect on the MIC values of S. aureus against ciprofloxacin.
TI  - Microbiologic study of the pathogens isolated from wound culture among Wenchuan earthquake survivors.
AB  - On May 12, an unprecedented earthquake struck Wenchuan County, Sichuan, China, and 1823 victims were admitted to West China Hospital, Sichuan, China. A total of 464 nonduplicate clinical isolates from wounds of earthquake victims were analyzed. The results show that the most common pathogen was Staphylococcus aureus, but only 24.4% of the total isolates were Gram-positive bacteria, and 73.2% were Gram-negative bacteria. The isolates were significantly different from isolation pattern of 2004 tsunami in Thailand. The isolation rates of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producer and pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii in this study might increase the risk of nosocomial infection. In this situation, clinical microbiologists, infection control staff, and administration decision makers should pay high attention to prevent disaster-associated nosocomial infections.
TI  - Therapeutic index of gramicidin S is strongly modulated by D-phenylalanine analogues at the beta-turn.
AB  - Analogues of the cationic antimicrobial peptide gramicidin S (GS), cyclo(Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro)2, with d-Phe residues replaced by different (restricted mobility, mostly) surrogates have been synthesized and used in SAR studies against several pathogenic bacteria. While all D-Phe substitutions are shown by NMR to preserve the overall beta-sheet conformation, they entail subtle structural alterations that lead to significant modifications in biological activity. In particular, the analogue incorporating D-Tic (1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid) shows a modest but significant increase in therapeutic index, mostly due to a sharp decrease in hemolytic effect. The fact that NMR data show a shortened distance between the D-Tic aromatic ring and the Orn delta-amino group may help explain the improved antibiotic profile of this analogue.
TI  - [Two cases of vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus isolated from joint tissue or wound].
AB  - Since its first isolation in 1997, vancomycin-intermediate Staphylococcus aureus  (VISA) has been a clinical concern because it may lead to treatment failure. Up to the present, there were two reports of clinical VISA cases in Korea. We now report two additional cases of VISA with the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 4 microg/mL. The first patient was a 59 yr-old man who had undergone total hip replacement arthroplasty in 1999 due to avascular necrosis of femur heads. He had recurrent episodes of infected hip caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and was treated with vancomycin. He underwent replacement operation of prosthesis. Cultures of joint fluid and joint tissue grew S. aureus. Vancomycin MIC as determined by a broth microdilution method was 4 microg/mL for the both isolates. The patient was treated with high enough doses of vancomycin to maintain serum trough concentrations at 20-25 microg/mL for 52 days and was discharged. The second patient was a 57 yr-old man with diabetes. He lost consciousness from drinking. After recovery of consciousness, he was diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia. MRSA and Acinetobacter baumannii were cultured from sputum and the patient was treated with vancomycin and meropenem. During hospitalization, bed sores developed in his ankle and back. A wound culture from the sore grew S. aureus with vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. Since infection was localized, systemic antibiotics did not seem necessary, and the patient was transferred to another hospital for isolation and management.
TI  - Update on antimicrobial susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms in the United States: results from the Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TEST) 2005 to 2007.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Tigecycline Evaluation and Surveillance Trial (TTEST) is a global surveillance study initiated in 2004.Its goal is to assess the in vitro activity of the glycylcycline, tigecycline, and comparator antimicrobials. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to measure the in vitro activity of a panel of antimicrobial agents against gram-negative and gram-positive organisms collected in the United States in 2005, 2006, and 2007. METHODS: Isolates were collected from 172 centers across the United States.In vitro activity was assessed using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines and CLSI or US Food and Drug Administration interpretive criteria. RESULTS: Overall, data on 20,897 gram-negative and 8949 gram-positive isolates were collected. For the majority of organisms, percentage susceptibilities were unchanged over the 3 years of collection. One exception was Acinetobacter baumannii; rates of susceptibility to the majority of agents in the panel decreased by approximately 10% over the 3 years. Rates of resistant phenotypes were relatively unchanged with mean percentages over the 3 years of: 8.9% (337/3787) for extended beta-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae; 2.1% (17/801) for ESBL-producing Klebsiella oxytoca; 2.3% (111/4861) for ESBL-pproducing Escherichia coli; 56.2% (2564/4560) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus; 5.1% (97/1903) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; and 67.2% (487/725) for vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium. The minimum inhibitory concentration required to inhibit the growth of 90% of organisms (MIC(90)) for tigecycline was stable over the 3 years and was < or = 22 mg/L against non-ESBL-producing K pneumoniae, K oxytoca, E coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, and A baumannii. Against methicillin susceptible and -resistant S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or = 0.25 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: This report of 3 years of data from the TEST study suggests stable susceptibility rates among gram-negative and gram-positive organisms, with the exception of decreased susceptibility rates for A baumannii. Tigecycline continued to have good activity against Enterobacteriaceae, A baumannii, S aureus, E faecalis, E faecium, and S agalactiae.
TI  - [Bacterial etiology of pneumonia in hospitalized children: combined detection with culture and polymerase chain reaction].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Bacterial cultures from respiratory aspirate or sputum have been the conventional diagnostic method for pneumonia, but the results of culture was often affected by early extensive use of antibiotics, sample collection and delivery. The objective of this study was to explore application of the combined detection of culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay in hospitalized children with pneumonia. METHODS: Totally 187 hospitalized children with pneumonia were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 1 month to 10 years, 124 were male, 63 female; 175 of the patients received antibiotics treatment before admission. Deep respiratory aspirate sample from patients was cultured by Streptococcus pneumoniae selective plate, Hemophilus influenzae selective plate and conventional plate. The aspirate samples were also amplified for DNA of 14 bacteria with target enriched multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Tem-PCR) and detected with Luminex xMAP technology platform. RESULTS: The total positive rate by bacterial culture was 40.1% (75/187), of which 17.1% (24/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 4.8% (9/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 3.7% (7/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 1.6% (3/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 1.1% (2/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. The total positive rate by combined detection of culture and Tem-PCR assay were 78.6% (147/187), of which 28.9% (54/187) were Hemophilus influenzae b, 19.3% (36/187) were Streptococcus pneumoniae, 8.6% (16/187) were Escherichia coli, 6.4% (12/187) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, 5.9% (11/187) were Staphylococcus aureus, 5.9% (11/187) were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2.7% (5/187) were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1.1% (2/187) were Enterobacter cloacae. CONCLUSION: The Tem-PCR assay may increase the detection rate of Hemophilus influenzae b, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The Combined detection may increase the positive rate of bacterial pathogens in hospitalized children with pneumonia, and the results might reflect the real patterns of bacterial etiology. The Tem-PCR needs further improvement for diagnosis of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae.
TI  - [Bacterial death and heteroresistance to antimicrobial agents].
AB  
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance in Europe and its potential impact on empirical therapy.
AB  - The problem of microbial drug resistance is a major public health concern, due to its global dimension and alarming magnitude, although the epidemiology of resistance can exhibit remarkable geographical variability and rapid temporal evolution. The major resistance issues overall are those related to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Enterobacteriaceae producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Europe is not free from any of these issues, although their impact may be significantly different in different countries. MRSA rates are high in several European countries, but seem to have levelled off in some settings. Diffusion of VRE is still irregular. The most alarming resistance trends are those observed for Enterobacteriaceae and the Gram-negative non-fermenters, with a generalized increase in rates of resistance to the most important anti-Gram-negative agents (beta-lactams and fluoroquinolones) and the circulation of strains showing multidrug resistance phenotypes.
TI  - Summer Peaks in the Incidences of Gram-Negative Bacterial Infection Among Hospitalized Patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Recognition of seasonal trends in hospital infections may improve diagnosis, use of empirical therapy, and infection prevention interventions. There are very few data available regarding the seasonal variability of these infections. We quantified the seasonal variation in the incidences of hospital infection caused by common bacterial pathogens and estimated the association between temperature changes and infection rates. METHODS: A cohort of all adult patients admitted to the University of Maryland Medical Center during the period from 1998 through 2005 was analyzed. Time-series analyses were used to estimate the association of the number of infections per month caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and enterococci with season and temperature, while controlling for long-term trends. RESULTS: There were 218,594 admissions to the index hospital, and analysis of 26,624 unique clinical cultures that grew the organisms of interest identified increases in the mean monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (28% of isolates recovered; P ! .01), E. cloacae (46%; P ! .01), E. coli (12%; P ! .01), and A. baumannii (21%; Pp.06). For each 10 degrees F increase, we observed a 17% increase in the monthly rates of infection caused by P. aeruginosa (Pp.01) and A. baumanii (Pp.05). CONCLUSION: Significantly higher rates of gram-negative infection were observed during the summer months, compared with other seasons. For some pathogens, higher temperatures were associated with higher infection rates, independent of seasonality. These findings have important implications for infection prevention, such as enhanced surveillance during the warmer months, and for choice of empirical antimicrobial therapy among hospitalized adults. Future, quasi-experimental investigations of gram-negative infection prevention initiatives should control for seasonal variation.
TI  - [Nationwide susceptibility surveillance of ciprofloxacin and various parenteral antimicrobials against bacteria isolated from patients with severe infections--third ciproxan injection special survey (2005)].
AB  - We conducted 3 nationwide surveillance studies between 2001 and 2005 at 39 participating institutions throughout Japan according to the special survey plan to investigate susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (CPFX) and various parenteral antimicrobials using clinical isolates from patients with severe infection during the reexamination period of parenteral CPFX. Results of the first special survey (2001) were already reported in this journal. The current third special survey (2005) was conducted at 34 participating institutions throughout Japan to determine susceptibility to CPFX and 22 various parenteral antimicrobials with the use of the microdilution method with respect to 1696 strains isolated and identified from various clinical specimens between January and June 2005. The results of CPFX in this survey were compared with those in the first and second special surveys. The minimum inhibitory concentration of CPFX at which 90% of isolates were susceptible (MIC90) ranged from < or =0.063 to 2 microg/mL for methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Moraxella catarrhalis, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella spp., Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter spp., Proteus spp., Serratia marcescens, and Acinetobacter baumannii, revealing no marked change from results of the first and second surveys. However, the CPFX-susceptibility rate of Escherichia coli decreased in the second and third surveys compared to that in the first survey. For Morganella morganii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the MIC90 of CPFX tended to increase with time. The CPFX-susceptibility rates calculated from the pneumonia breakpoint were 85.2% for P. aeruginosa and 67.9% for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. With the exception of these 2 species, major causative organisms of respiratory tract infection had susceptibility rates as high as 90% or more for CPFX, which were similar to results of the first and second special surveys. These susceptibility rates for CPFX were similar to the rates for cefozopran and imipenem. These values generally indicated favorable CPFX susceptibility testing results of major bacteria and the potent antimicrobial activity of CPFX particularly against Gram-negative bacteria. Further surveillance is required regarding the trend in susceptibility of E. coli, M. morganii, and P. aeruginosa, which tended to become less susceptible with time.
TI  - Tackling antibiotic resistance: a dose of common antisense?
AB  - Resistance to antimicrobial agents undermines our ability to treat bacterial infections. It attracts intense media and political interest and impacts on personal health and costs to health infrastructures. Bacteria have developed resistance to all licensed antibacterial agents, and their ability to become resistant to unlicensed agents is often demonstrated during the development process. Conventional approaches to antimicrobial development, involving modification of existing agents or production of synthetic derivatives, are unlikely to deliver the range or type of drugs that will be needed to meet all future requirements. Although many companies are seeking novel targets, further radical approaches to both antimicrobial design and the reversal of resistance are now urgently required. In this article, we discuss 'antisense' (or 'antigene') strategies to inhibit resistance mechanisms at the genetic level. These offer an innovative approach to a global problem and could be used to restore the efficacy of clinically proven agents. Moreover, this strategy has the potential to overcome critical resistances, not only in the so-called 'superbugs' (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, glycopeptide-resistant enterococci and multidrug-resistant strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), but in resistant strains of any bacterial species.
TI  - A study on nosocomial pathogens in ICU with special reference to multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii harbouring multiple plasmids.
AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVES: Antibiotic resistant bacterial nosocomial infections are a leading problem in intensive care units (ICU). Present investigation was undertaken to know antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii and some other pathogens obtained from clinical samples from ICU causing nosocomial infections. Special emphasis was given on plasmid mediated transferable antibiotic resistance in Acinetobacter. METHODS: The clinical specimens obtained from ICU, were investigated to study distribution of nosocomial pathogens (272) and their antibiotic resistance profile. Acinetobacter isolates were identified by API2ONE system. Antimicrobial resistance was studied with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by double dilution agar plate method. The plasmid profile of 26 antibiotic resistant isolates of Acinetobacter was studied. Curing of R-plasmids was determined in three antibiotic resistant plasmid containing A. baumannii isolates. Plasmid transfer was studied by transformation. RESULTS: Major infections found in ICU were due to Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. The infection rate was maximum in urinary tract (44.4%) followed by wound infections (29.4%), pneumonia (10.7%) and bronchitis (7.4%). Acinetobacter isolates displayed high level of antibiotic resistance (up to 1024microg/ml) to most of antibiotics. More than 90 per cent isolates of Acinetobacter were resistant to a minimum of 23 antibiotics. Plasmid profile of Acinetobacter isolates showed presence of 1-4 plasmids. Ethidium bromide cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281, pUPI282 with curing efficiencies 20, 16 and 11 per cent respectively while acridine orange cured plasmids pUPI280, pUPI281 with curing efficiencies 7 and 18 per cent retrospectively. Transformation frequency of E. coli HB101 with pUPI281 was 4.3 x 10(4) transformants/microg plasmid DNA. INTERPRETATION & CONCLUSIONS: A. baumannii was found to be associated with urinary tract infections, respiratory tract infections, septicaemia, bacteraemia, meningitis and wound infections. A. baumannii displayed higher resistance to more number of antibiotics than other nosocomial pathogens from ICU. Antibiotic sensitivity of A. baumannii cured isolates confirmed plasmid borne nature of antibiotic resistance markers. Transfer of antibiotic resistant plasmids from Acinetobacter to other nosocomial pathogens can create complications in the treatment of the patient. Therefore, it is very important to target Acinetobacter which is associated with nosocomial infections.
TI  - The evolution of drug-resistant microorganisms in patients with prolonged mechanical ventilation.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation (PMV) tend to become reservoirs of antimicrobial resistance. We assessed antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms in the respiratory tracts of patients receiving PMV. METHODS: Over a 6-month period, the microorganisms from tracheal aspirates of PMV patients with lower airway infection were analyzed. RESULTS: Antimicrobial use was greatest during the acute critical stage of respiratory failure. Antimicrobial resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae peaked during the fourth to 15th weeks of PMV. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) developed rapidly during the first 3 weeks of PMV. The acquisition of multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa and MRSA were significantly correlated with previous exposure to ceftazidime (odds ratio [OR] = 121.3 and 72.5; P = .01 and .01, respectively). The rise of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii was significantly correlated with previous exposure to piperacillin/tazobactam (OR = 26.81; P = .02) and imipenem (OR = 16.91; P = .03). Using univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, the lower respiratory tract infections with multidrug-resistant microorganisms were independently associated with increased 6-month mortality (OR = 3.41; P < .01). CONCLUSION: In patients receiving PMV, lower respiratory tract infection with multidrug-resistant microorganisms is common and is associated with higher mortality.
TI  - NHSN annual update: antimicrobial-resistant pathogens associated with healthcare-associated infections: annual summary of data reported to the National Healthcare Safety Network at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2006-2007.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the frequency of selected antimicrobial resistance patterns among pathogens causing device-associated and procedure-associated healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) reported by hospitals in the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN). METHODS: Data are included on HAIs (ie, central line-associated bloodstream infections, catheter-associated urinary tract infections, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and surgical site infections) reported to the Patient Safety Component of the NHSN between January 2006 and October 2007. The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing of up to 3 pathogenic isolates per HAI by a hospital were evaluated to define antimicrobial-resistance in the pathogenic isolates. The pooled mean proportions of pathogenic isolates interpreted as resistant to selected antimicrobial agents were calculated by type of HAI and overall. The incidence rates of specific device-associated infections were calculated for selected antimicrobial-resistant pathogens according to type of patient care area; the variability in the reported rates is described. RESULTS: Overall, 463 hospitals reported 1 or more HAIs: 412 (89%) were general acute care hospitals, and 309 (67%) had 200-1,000 beds. There were 28,502 HAIs reported among 25,384 patients. The 10 most common pathogens (accounting for 84% of any HAIs) were coagulase-negative staphylococci (15%), Staphylococcus aureus (15%), Enterococcus species (12%), Candida species (11%), Escherichia coli (10%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (8%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (6%), Enterobacter species (5%), Acinetobacter baumannii (3%), and Klebsiella oxytoca (2%). The pooled mean proportion of pathogenic isolates resistant to antimicrobial agents varied significantly across types of HAI for some pathogen-antimicrobial combinations. As many as 16% of all HAIs were associated with the following multidrug-resistant pathogens: methicillin-resistant S. aureus (8% of HAIs), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (4%), carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (2%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae (1%), extended-spectrum cephalosporin-resistant E. coli (0.5%), and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, K. pneumoniae, K. oxytoca, and E. coli (0.5%). Nationwide, the majority of units reported no HAIs due to these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - Ozone gas is an effective and practical antibacterial agent.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial infections continue to pose a threat to health in many institutional and communal settings, and epidemics are frequent. Current control measures are clearly inadequate; thus, there is a need for a simple, effective, and safe way to decontaminate surfaces. METHODS: We evaluated the efficacy of a portable ozone-generating machine, equipped with a catalytic converter and an accessory humidifier, to inactivate 15 different species of medically important bacteria. RESULTS: An ozone dosage of 25 ppm for 20 minutes, with a short burst of humidity in excess of 90% relative humidity, was able to inactivate more than 3 log(10) colony-forming units of most of the bacteria, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Clostridium difficile, and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, in both in a laboratory test system and simulated field conditions. In many cases, complete eradication was achieved. Dried and wet samples were equally vulnerable to the ozone. Inactivation of bacterial samples dried onto soft surfaces (eg, fabric, cotton, filter paper) were comparable with that observed for samples on plastic. CONCLUSIONS: The ozone generator can provide a valuable decontamination tool for the removal of bacteria in many institutional and communal settings, including hospitals and other health care institutions.
TI  - [Obtain best usage of meropenem dose in severe infections. Results of an observational multicenter study].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the effectiveness and tolerability of the dose adjustment  of meropenem in empirical treatment of nosocomial infections in critically-ill patients admitted to intensive care medicine services. METHODS: Prospective, observational and multicenter study in patients admitted to 17 intensive care medicine services with nosocomial infection, who were initially treated with meropenem, 1 g every 8 h, were eligible. The initial dose was adjusted to 0.5 g every 8 h if there were: a) a favorable clinical course, and b) microbiological isolation of meropenem-susceptible pathogens or absence of pathogens in cultures. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients in whom meropenem doses were adjusted to 0.5 g every 8 h were included. Ventilator-associated pneumonia followed by bacteremia was the most frequently treated infections. Microbiological studies were positive in 53 patients, with a predominance of gram-positive bacteria (53.7%), especially methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, followed by gram-negative bacteria (42.7 %). A total of 18 patients were not evaluable at the end of treatment. Sixty-seven (90.5 %) of the 74 evaluable patients had a favorable clinical course (54 patients cured and 13 improved). In 50 out of 53 microbiologically evaluable cases, eradication or apparent eradication of initial microorganisms was achieved. In 3 cases, the initial pathogen persisted: Acinetobacter baumannii (2 cases) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1 case). On three occasions, new pathogens developed during treatment: A. baumannii (2 cases) and methicillin-resistant S. aureus (1 case). Adverse events occurred in 3 patients (4%), none of which was considered severe, and withdrawal of meropenem was not necessary. A total of 25 (27.2 %) patients died, three of them in relation to the infectious process. CONCLUSIONS: Dose adjustment of meropenem to 0.5 g every 8 h is a useful tool in the treatment of severe nosocomial infections in patients admitted to services of intensive care medicine except in cases in which causative pathogens are non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - Prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii in a long-term acute care facility.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients in long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities often have many known risk factors for acquisition of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the prevalence of resistance in these facilities has not been well described. METHODS: We performed a single-day, point-prevalence study of a 180-bed, university-affiliated LTAC facility in Baltimore to assess the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii in the anterior nares, perirectal area, sputum, and wounds. RESULTS: Among the 147 patients evaluated, we found a high prevalence of colonization by both MRSA (28%) and A baumannii (30%). Of the A baumannii isolates, 90% were susceptible to imipenem and 92% were susceptible to ampicillin-sulbactam. No isolates were resistant to both imipenem and ampicillin-sulbactam. CONCLUSION: The high prevalence of resistance found in this study supports the need for increased surveillance of patients in the LTAC environment. The fact that these patients are often frequently transferred to tertiary care facilities also supports the need for coordination and collaboration among facilities within the same health care system and the broader geographic area.
TI  - Infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Greece.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the clinical and microbiological characteristics of the patients who developed an infection in our surgical intensive care unit (SICU). METHODS: This was a prospective study of all patients who sustained an ICU-acquired infection from 2002 to 2004. RESULTS: Among 683 consecutive SICU patients, 123 (18.0%) developed 241 infections (48.3 infections per 1000 patient-days). The mean age of patients was 66.7+/-3.8 years, the mean APACHE II score (acute physiology and chronic health evaluation) on SICU admission was 18.2+/-2.4, and the mean SOFA score (sepsis-related organ failure assessment) at the onset of infection was 8.8+/-2. Of the study patients, 51.2% were women. Infections were: bloodstream (36.1%), ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP; 25.3%, 20.3/1000 ventilator-days), surgical site (18.7%), central venous catheter (10.4%, 7.1/1000 central venous catheter-days), and urinary tract infection (9.5%, 4.6/1000 urinary catheter-days). The most frequent microorganisms found were: Acinetobacter baumannii (20.3%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15.7%), Candida albicans (13.2%), Enterococcus faecalis (10.4%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (9.2%), Enterococcus faecium (7.9%), and Staphylococcus aureus (6.7%). High resistance to the majority of antibiotics was identified. The complication and mortality rates were 58.5% and 39.0%, respectively. Multivariate analysis identified APACHE II score on admission (odds ratio (OR) 4.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.69-5.26, p=0.01), peritonitis (OR 1.85, 95% CI 1.03-3.25, p=0.03), acute pancreatitis (OR 2.27, 95% CI 1.05-3.75, p=0.02), previous aminoglycoside use (OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.06-5.14, p=0.03), and mechanical ventilation (OR 3.26, 95% CI: 2.43-6.15, p=0.01) as risk factors for infection development. Age (OR 1.16, 95% CI 1.01-1.33, p=0.03), APACHE II score on admission (OR 2.53, 95% CI 1.77-3.41, p=0.02), SOFA score at the onset of infection (OR 2.88, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, p=0.02), and VAP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04-1.85, p=0.03) were associated with mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Infections are an important problem in SICUs due to high incidence, multi-drug resistance, complications, and mortality rate. In our study, APACHE II score on admission, peritonitis, acute pancreatitis, previous aminoglycoside use, and mechanical ventilation were identified as risk factors for infection development, whereas age, APACHE II score on admission, SOFA score at the onset of infection, and VAP were associated with mortality.
TI  - The epidemiology of antibiotic resistance.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance has reached crisis point in many hospitals around the world. The majority are swamped with meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), and many with multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negatives. Whilst there are good treatment alternatives available for serious infections due to MRSA, mortality rates remain high. For MDR Gram-negatives the situation is more complex and worrying. There are few, if any, new agents in development that can be expected to benefit the situation in the next decade. Moreover, extreme (or extensive) drug-resistant and even pandrug-resistant Gram-negative infections are increasingly being described. Although definitions are confused in this area, reports suggest that patients in some intensive care units are dying from lack of availability of any antibiotic active against certain strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. A better understanding of the molecular basis of resistance is urgently needed if it is to be successfully overcome. Moreover, we urgently need better global early warning systems to detect new resistances and put mechanisms in place for their control.
TI  - Anti-adherence activity and antimicrobial durability of anti-infective-coated catheters against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the anti-adherence and antimicrobial durability of anti-infective catheters against multidrug-resistant (MDR) Staphylococcus aureus (resistant to vancomycin, rifampicin and methicillin) and MDR Gram-negative bacteria (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii/calcoaceticus and Enterobacter agglomerans) that are often associated with catheter-related bloodstream infections (CRBSIs). METHODS: Catheters impregnated with minocycline and rifampicin (M/R) or with silver-platinum and carbon (SPC) or with chlorhexidine and silver sulfadiazine (CHX/SS) were compared with non-coated catheters. Adherence of organisms was tested by using an established biofilm colonization model. All isolates were rifampicin-resistant. Antimicrobial durability was tested by soaking 1 cm segments of the catheter in serum and determining zones of inhibition against the tested organisms at weekly intervals. RESULTS: The M/R catheters showed significantly superior anti-adherence activity and more prolonged antimicrobial durability when compared with CHX/SS-central venous catheter (CVC), SPC-CVC and uncoated control catheters against MDR and vancomycin-resistant S. aureus (MDR VRSA) (all P values < or = 0.02), MDR S. maltophilia (all P values < 0.005) and MDR A. baumannii/calcoaceticus (all P values < 0.002), respectively. M/R-CVC and CHX/SS-CVC had comparable anti-adherence and antimicrobial durability against MDR E. agglomerans, and these two were superior to SPC-CVC and the uncoated control catheters (all P values < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: M/R-CVC demonstrated superior anti-adherence activity and more prolonged antimicrobial durability when compared with other approved anti-infective catheters against MDR VRSA and/or MDR Gram-negative bacteria that are often associated with CRBSIs. This finding could explain their efficacy and better performance in clinical studies.
TI  - Prediction models to identify hospitalized patients at risk of being colonized or infected with multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii calcoaceticus complex.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The multidrug-resistant (MDR) Acinetobacter baumannii calcoaceticus complex (Abc) has emerged as an important cause of nosocomial infections. The aims of the study were to evaluate risk factors for MDR-Abc in intensive care units (ICUs) as well as in medical and surgical wards, to define the likelihood ratios (LRs) of risk factors and to determine if risk factors differ depending on whether colonization or infections are considered. METHODS: Two prospective matched case-control studies were performed. MDR-Abc was defined as a strain resistant to four or more classes of antibiotics. The two case groups included patients with MDR-Abc infections or colonization. Controls were selected among patients not harbouring Abc. Matching criteria were the number of days from admission to MDR-Abc isolation among cases and the duration of hospitalization among controls. RESULTS: Overall, 514 patients were included in the study. One hundred and thirty-seven patients were infected and 120 colonized. A Charlson score >3 and previous methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolation and beta-lactam use were independent risk factors for colonization and infection. Bedridden status and previous ICU admission were associated with colonization, while the presence of a central venous catheter and surgery were related to infection. The analysis of LRs showed an association between the presence of more than two risk factors and colonization or infection. The highest predicting value was observed for the presence of more than two risk factors and colonization in patients with no history of ICU admission. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel information that can be used to identify interventions for different stages of the spread of MDR-Abc.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens as evaluated by broth microdilution and Etest.
AB  - The current surveillance establishes the activity profile of tigecycline against  recent clinical U.S. isolates of target pathogens. Findings from a distributed surveillance that utilized Etest yielded a tigecycline activity profile that varied from that observed in a separate centralized broth microdilution (BMD) surveillance (D. C. Draghi et al., Poster D-0701, 46th Intersci. Conf. Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., San Francisco, CA). Differences were noted among Acinetobacter spp. and Serratia marcescens and, to a lesser extent, with Streptococcus pyogenes. To address whether these differences were due to discordance in testing methodology or to variations among the analyzed populations, isolates from the current surveillance were concurrently tested by BMD and Etest. In all, 1,800 Staphylococcus aureus, 259 S. pyogenes, 226 Streptococcus pneumoniae, 93 Enterococcus faecalis, 1,356 Enterobacteriaceae, and 227 Acinetobacter baumannii strains were evaluated. Tigecycline had potent activity by BMD, with >99.6% susceptibility (%S) observed for all pathogens with interpretive criteria, excluding Enterobacter cloacae (98.3% S) and E. faecalis (86.0% S), and MIC(90)s ranged from 0.03 mug/ml (S. pyogenes/S. pneumoniae) to 1 mug/ml (Enterobacteriaceae/A. baumannii). Similar profiles were observed by Etest, with the exception of A. baumannii, although for most evaluated pathogens Etest MICs trended one doubling-dilution higher than BMD MICs. Major or very major errors were infrequent, and a high degree of essential agreement was observed, excluding A. baumannii, S. marcescens, and S. pneumoniae, for which >/=4-fold differences in MICs were observed for 29, 27.1, and 34% of the isolates, respectively. Further analysis regarding the suitability of the tigecycline Etest for testing S. marcescens, Acinetobacter spp., and S. pneumoniae is warranted.
TI  - [Etiology, epidemiology and microbiological diagnosis of intra-abdominal infections].
AB  - Intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) are commonly encountered in clinical practice.  The etiology of these infections, often polymicrobial in nature, can be variable and usually includes organisms derived from the gut microbiota. In community-acquired IAIs enterobacteria predominate (mostly Escherichia coli) in combination with anaerobes (mostly Bacteroides fragilis). In nosocomial IAIs, which can complicate abdominal surgery, other pathogens can also play a role, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp. e Candida spp. Diagnostic microbiology of IAIs is complex and plays a relevant role especially in some situations (e. g. presence of foreign bodies, potential presence of resistant or uncommon pathogens, nosocomial infections in subjects with risk factors). Antibiotic resistance issues are currently encountered in most pathogenic species causing IAIs. Resistance affects all major classes of antimicrobial agents, often involving multiple classes and resulting in complex resistance phenotypes for which only a very limited number of drugs remain active.
TI  - Acinetobacter baumannii: an emerging multidrug-resistant threat.
AB  - Amid the recent attention focused on the growing impact of methicillin-resistant  Staphylococcus aureus and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections, the pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii has been stealthily gaining ground as an agent of serious nosocomial and community-acquired infection. Historically, Acinetobacter spp. have been associated with opportunistic infections that were rare and of modest severity; the last two decades have seen an increase in both the incidence and seriousness of A. baumannii infection, with the main targets being patients in intensive-care units. Although this organism appears to have a predilection for the most vulnerable patients, community-acquired A. baumannii infection is an increasing cause for concern. The increase in A. baumannii infections has paralleled the alarming development of resistance it has demonstrated. The persistence of this organism in healthcare facilities, its inherent hardiness and its resistance to antibiotics results in it being a formidable emerging pathogen. This review aims to put into perspective the threat posed by this organism in hospital and community settings, describes new information that is changing our view of Acinetobacter virulence and resistance, and calls for greater understanding of how this multifaceted organism came to be a major pathogen.
TI  - beta-lactams against emerging 'superbugs': progress and pitfalls.
AB  - Bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents is an ever-growing problem. So-called 'superbugs', such as multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa harboring multiple resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, carbapenemases, efflux pumps and downregulated outer-membrane proteins or porins, are becoming more prevalent in hospital, intensive and long-term care settings. Enterobacteriaceae are also acquiring a myriad of beta-lactamases, such as class A and D carbapenemases, and plasmid-borne class C cephalosporinases. Gram-positive superbugs, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-intermediate or heteroglycopeptide-intermediate S. aureus, vancomycin-resistant S. aureus and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PRSP), are problematic pathogens, both in the hospital and in the community (e.g., community-acquired MRSA and PRSP). beta-lactam antibiotics remain among the most effective and safest anti-infectives in use, although their utility is being severely challenged by these superbugs. This review will discuss aspects of resistance seen in these pathogens and will review some of the newer beta-lactam agents, both investigational and in clinical use, that target these superbugs.
TI  - Susceptibilities of common bacterial isolates from oman to old and new antibiotics.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study is to compare the antimicrobial activity of linezolid and tigecycline with other commonly used antibiotics against a variety of clinical isolates at Royal Hospital, Muscat. METHODS: Clinically-significant bacterial isolates in Royal hospital during the period from 1st of March to 30th of June 2007 were collected, stored and finally tested to determine their susceptibility to different antibiotics by broth microdilution (microscan panels). RESULTS: Two hundred ten bacterial strains were collected and tested including Staphylococcus aureus (29), Group B ss-haemolytic Streptococcus (10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (15), Enterococcus spp. (16), Haemophilus spp. (15), Escherichia coli (26), Klebsiella spp. (26), Enterobacter spp. (25), Serratia spp. (10), Acinetobacter baumannii (17) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (21). All strains except P. aeuginosa were susceptible to tigecycline. All gram-positive strains were susceptible to linezolid. Meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam showed good activity against most organisms tested including P. aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Levofloxacin showed 100% activity against K. pneumoniae and 61% activity against E. coli. The activity of 3rd generation cephalosporins against E.coli and K.pneumoniae ranged from 76% to 100%. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline and linezolid showed excellent activity against microorganisms in their relevant spectrum of activity. However, they should be used wisely and judiciously.
TI  - Bacterial resistance surveillance in China: a report from Mohnarin 2004-2005.
AB  - The aim of this study was to establish a nationwide antimicrobial resistant surveillance network and obtain information on bacterial resistance in China. A total of 4075 clinical bacterial isolates were collected from 17 hospitals in 15 cities throughout China. Antibacterial minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by the standard agar dilution method recommended by Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. The results of the MICs revealed the following bacterial resistance characteristics. Oxacillin resistance was shown by 62.9% of Staphylococcus aureus and 82.89% of Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. Penicillin non-sensitivity was show by 40.7% of the Streptococcus pneumoniae strains, which included 10.5% penicillin-resistant strains and 30.2% penicillin-intermediate strains. Five strains of Enterococci were vancomycin-intermediate, but all Enterococci strains were sensitive to teicoplanin. All Staphylococci were susceptible to glycopeptides. A high resistance to macrolides was a predominant characteristic of the Gram-positive cocci. Enterobacteriaceae strains were clearly resistant to the third generation cephalosporins, with the exception of ceftazidime, and the resistance rates ranged from 20 to 70%. About 65% of the Escherichia coli strains were resistant to fluoroquinolones. Carbapenems remained highly active against all the target bacteria. Latamoxef, piperacillin/tazobactam, cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime were all active against Enterobacteriaceae, which showed resistant rates of less than 10%. Imipenem resistance was found in 10.6% of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 10.4% of Acinetobacter baumannii strains, most of which were multidrug resistant isolates. Combinations of beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor and fluoroquinolones also had potent antibacterial activity against non-fermenters. Amikacin was active against Enterobacteriaceae and P. aeruginosa. In conclusion, methicillin-resistant Staphylococci, penicillin-insensitive S. pneumoniae, macrolides-resistant Gram-positive cocci, cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, multidrug-resistant nonfermenters and fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli were revealed to be the most serious problems in terms of bacteria resistance in China. No glycopeptides-resistant Staphylococcus strains were isolated, and the appearance of glycopeptides-resistant Enterococci was seldom.
TI  - The stethoscope as a vector of infectious diseases in the paediatric division.
AB  - AIM: Nosocomial infections are of great concern in hospital settings, and even more so in the paediatric ward. Health professionals and their medical equipment have long been known to act as vectors of infectious diseases. This study aimed at evaluating the presence of bacterial pathogens on the stethoscopes of medical personnel in the paediatric division. METHODS: Forty-three stethoscopes belonging to senior physicians, residents, interns and medical students at the paediatric ward were sampled. Bacterial cultures and antibiotic sensitivity testing were carried out. RESULTS: All but six bacterial cultures were positive (85.7%). Staphylococcal species were the most common contaminants (47.5%). One case of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was encountered. Gram-negative organisms were isolated in nine different samples (21%) including one case of Acinetobacter baumannii in the neonatal intensive care unit. CONCLUSION: Most stethoscopes harbour potential pathogens. The isolation of Gram-negative organisms pose a real risk of spreading potentially serious infections, especially in the setting of intensive care departments. Apparently, the current recommendations of regular disinfection of stethoscopes are not carried out by health personnel that participated in the study.
TI  - In vitro activity of tigecycline against resistant micro-organisms isolated from  burn patients.
AB  - Infections in burn patients are usually caused by multidrug-resistant micro-organisms. Tigecycline, a derivative of glycylcyclines, is an effective antibiotic against the resistant strains. The aim of this study is to determine the in vitro activity of tigecycline against the multidrug-resistant bacteria isolated from burn patients. Fourty-seven bacteria isolated from 118 patients hospitalized in the burn unit during 2003-2006 were included in the study. Gram-negative bacteria that were resistant to at least six broad-spectrum antibiotics, methicillin-resistant staphylococci and ampicillin-resistant enterococci were studied. Minimal inhibitory concentration values of tigecycline against these bacteria were tested by E-test strips. Susceptibility breakpoints were determined according to the previous studies; <or=0.25mg/L for enterococci, <or=0.5mg/L for staphylococci and <or=2mg/L for Acinetobacter baumannii. Thirty-six percent of the materials were obtained from tissue specimens, 30% from wound, 25% from blood and 9% from other samples (e.g., catheter, tracheal aspiration, urine). MIC(90) values were 2, 0.25 and 1.5mg/L and susceptibility rates were 99.4%, 93.6%, 85.5% for A. baumannii, enterococci and MRSA, respectively. To conclude, this study demonstrated that tigecycline exhibits in vitro activity against clinical isolates of MDR A. baumannii, MRSA, and Enterococcus spp. isolated from burn patients. Tigecycline is a promising therapeutic option for difficult to treat burn infections due to these pathogens.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of 3931 organisms isolated from intensive care units in Canada: Canadian National Intensive Care Unit Study, 2005/2006.
AB  - We tested the in vitro activity of 15 antimicrobials against Gram-positive cocci  and 12 antimicrobials against Gram-negative bacilli versus 3931 isolates (20 most common organisms) obtained between September 1, 2005, and June 30, 2006, from 19 intensive care units (ICUs) across Canada. The most active (based upon MIC only) agents against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis were dalbavancin, daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, and vancomycin with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.06 and < or =0.03, 0.25 and 0.12, 2 and 1, 0.5 and 0.5, and 1 and 2, respectively. The most active agents against vancomycin-resistant enterococci were daptomycin, linezolid, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 1, 4, and 0.12, respectively. The most active agents against Escherichia coli were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4, < or =1, < or =0.12, 8, and 0.5, respectively. The most active agents against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli were meropenem and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of < or =0.12 and 1, respectively. The most active agents against Pseudomonas aeruginosa were amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, and piperacillin/tazobactam with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 16, 32, 16, and 64, respectively. The most active agents against Stenotrophomonas maltophilia were tigecycline and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 4 and 4, respectively. The most active agents against Acinetobacter baumannii were fluoroquinolones (e.g., levofloxacin), meropenem, and tigecycline with MIC(90) (microg/mL) of 0.5, 1, and 2, respectively. In conclusion, the most active agents versus Gram-positive cocci and Gram-negative bacilli obtained from Canadian ICUs were daptomycin, linezolid, tigecycline, dalbavancin and amikacin, cefepime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tigecycline (not P. aeruginosa), respectively.
TI  - Effect of antibiotic prophylaxis on the risk of surgical site infection in orthotopic liver transplant.
AB  - Surgical site infections are common bacterial infections in orthotopic liver transplantation. The purpose of this study was to determine the incidence, timing, location, and risk factors, specifically antibiotic prophylaxis, for surgical site infections. A prospective study was performed that included a population of 1222 consecutive patients (73.0% males) who underwent liver transplantation in Spanish hospitals belonging to the Red de Estudio de la Infeccion en el Trasplante research network. One hundred seven patients developed surgical site infections. The predominant infection sites were incisional wound (53 episodes) and peritonitis (40 episodes). The timing of the organ/space surgical site infections was slightly delayed in comparison with incisional surgical site infections. Enterococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter baumannii were the predominant pathogens. Choledochojejunal or hepaticojejunal reconstruction (odds ratio, 4.2; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-10.7), previous liver or kidney transplant (odds ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-6.3), and more than 4 red blood cell units transfused (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-3.4) were independently associated with the development of surgical site infections. Biliary reconstruction by choledochojejunostomy or hepaticojejunostomy increases the risk of surgical site infections.
TI  - Evaluation of disinfectants on military NATO and DECON litters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the effectiveness of five disinfectants: A33, 10% bleach, 1% bleach, SPOROX, and 3% H2O2, on military NATO and DECON litters. DESIGN: Suspensions of Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and spore-enhanced Bacillus subtilis, with five percent albumin, were inoculated onto litters and dried overnight. The litters were saturated with disinfectant solutions and sampled after 10 minutes. The Log10 reduction in the number of bacteria recovered was calculated. SETTING: 59th Medical Wing, 59th Clinical Research Division, Lackland AFB TX. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: A reduction of > or =3 Log10 in the number of bacteria recovered from the test squares compared to the control squares was considered effective disinfection. RESULTS: On the NATO litter 10% bleach and SPOROX were effective against vegetative cells. On the DECON litter A33, 10% bleach, and SPOROX were effective against vegetative cells. After the 10 minute exposure none of the disinfectants evaluated were effective against spore-enhanced B. subtilis. CONCLUSION: When contaminated with vegetative cells military NATO and DECON litters can be effectively disinfected with a 10 minute exposure to some disinfectants. Further research is needed to find an effective disinfectant for spore contamination.
TI  - Control of bacterial biofilms with marine alkaloid derivatives.
AB  - Bacterial biofilms are defined as a community of surface-attached bacteria that are protected by an extracellular matrix of biomolecules. We have recently reported the synthesis of a small molecule, denoted TAGE, based on the natural product bromoageliferin and demonstrated that TAGE has anti-biofilm activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Herein we demonstrate that TAGE: (1) does not have selective toxicity against cells within the biofilm state, (2) will inhibit biofilm development under flow conditions, indicating that the CV staining protocol correlates with the ability to be active under biomimetic conditions, and (3) will disperse preformed P. aeruginosa biofilms. We also present preliminary toxicity work that indicates that TAGE is devoid of cytotoxicity in rat and mice cell lines. Advanced derivatives of TAGE have generated compounds shown to be exceedingly effective as biofilm inhibitors against the gamma-proteobacteria in this study (P. aeruginosa strains PAO1, PA14, PDO300, and Acinetobacter baumannii). TAGE derivatives also possessed anti-biofilm activity against the beta-proteobacterium Bordetella bronchiseptica (Rb50) and the Gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus;TAGE derivatives inhibited the formation of biofilms, however, some of this activity is attributed to microbicidal activity. The TAGE derivatives presented in this study, however, do not disperse pre-formed biofilms with the same efficiency as TAGE.
TI  - Evaluation of the antimicrobial properties of an alcohol-free 2% chlorhexidine gluconate solution.
AB  - Surgical site infections (SSIs) contribute to morbidity and mortality and increase the costs of patient care. Effective skin decontamination is recommended to reduce the risk of SSI and the transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A macrodilution broth method and an in vitro time-kill method were used to determine the antimicrobial properties of an alcohol-free 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) solution against seven bacterial strains, including clinically derived strains of Acinetobacter baumannii and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The CHG solution reduced bacterial counts of drug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and community-associated MRSA by 99.9% within three minutes of exposure, and effectiveness was maintained with significant dilutions of the CHG solution.
TI  - [Investigation of 728 strains of infectious bacteria in burn ward and analysis of their antibiotic resistance].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the infectious strains of bacteria in our burn ward in recent 5 years, and analyze their antibiotic resistance. METHODS: Bacteria were isolated from the wound excretions of 306 burn patients hospitalized during 2001 to 2006 for analyzing their strains and their antibiotic resistance. RESULTS: 378 strains were Grams positive bacteria, among them Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant strain. Further analysis showed that methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) ranked the first in occurrence, followed by methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE) and Enterococcus fecalis, 338 strains were Gram negative bacteria, and among them Acinetobacter baumannii was predominant, and Enterobacter cloacae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the 2nd and 3rd. Twelve strains were fungi. CONCLUSION: Drug resistance to antibiotics in our burn ward may be related to the beta-lactamases from acinetobacter baumannii and multiple-drug-resistance of MRSA.
TI  - Healthcare-associated infections in neonates.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To identify important findings in the recent literature related to healthcare-associated infections in neonatal care. RECENT FINDINGS: Bloodstream infection remains the leading healthcare-associated infection in the neonatal unit, but multimodal interventions have been shown to successfully reduce this life-threatening complication. Emerging pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative organisms and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Serratia marcescens complicate the use of standard antibiotic treatment and are a particular concern in this setting because of the limitation in antibiotic classes among neonates. Community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus infections are increasing in frequency and are particularly worrisome. Fluconazole prophylaxis offers a simple solution for the prevention of invasive Candida infection and has been already widely adopted. Although there is evidence for its efficacy, there is still some debate about the pros and cons of azole prophylaxis in the prevention of invasive Candida infections. Furthermore, its use in low-prevalence settings remains highly questionable. The introduction of restrictive guidelines limiting the use of antibiotics in early-onset neonatal infections has proved to be safe and efficient and may also reduce the incidence of late-onset infection. Outbreaks remain an ongoing concern in neonatal care and are increasingly complicated by emerging multiresistant pathogens. SUMMARY: Healthcare-associated infections remain a permanent challenge among neonates.
TI  - Symptoms and signs of port-related infections in oncology patients related to the offending pathogens.
AB  - AIM: There is limited information about symptoms and signs of port-related infections linking to their offending pathogens. METHODS: Oncology patients proven to have port-related infections were retrospectively analysed. We divided them into two subgroups according to their symptoms and signs. Onset of fever and chills with or without hypotension following the port flush was classified as 'port flush form infection'. Presence of local inflammatory signs, including erythema, warmth, tenderness and pus formation and systemic infection signs, including fever, chills with or without hypotension was classified as 'local inflammatory form infection'. RESULTS: There were 29 episodes of port-related infection among 28 patients, with port flush form 22 episodes and local inflammatory form seven episodes. Of 22 episodes of port flush form infections, 20 (91%) were nosocomial glucose non-fermenting gram-negative bacilli, with Acinetobacter baumannii (11 episodes, 50%) and Enterobacter cloacae (four episodes, 18%) the most common. Polymicrobial infections occurred in four episodes (18%). Candida infection occurred in two episodes (9%). Of seven episodes of local inflammatory form infections, six (86%) were gram-positive cocci, with Staphylococcus aureus (five episodes, 71%) the most common. The time from port implantation to its infection was 272 +/- 255 days (30-993 days) for the port flush form infections and 82 +/- 87 days (22-265 days) for the local inflammatory form infections. This difference was not significant difference (p = 0.068). CONCLUSIONS: The differences between infection of patients with port flush form and local inflammatory form in incidence and offending microorganism suggest that the aetiology of infection were different.
TI  - [Survey on the distribution of burn pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in  burn unit].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the distribution of burn pathogens and their antibiotic resistance in a burn unit, so as to provide reference for clinical practice. METHODS: Three hundred and forty-eight burn patients hospitalized in our department were enrolled in this study. The pathogens isolated from the wounds, blood, venous catheter, sputum, urine, purulent discharge of wounds in these patients, and their antibiotic resistance were surveyed by retrospective analysis from Jan, 2001 to Dec, 2006. RESULTS: Total-ly 464 strains were isolated, among which Gram negative (G-) bacilli accounted for 52.6%, Gram positive microorganisms (G+) accounted for 40.5%, and fungi accounted for 6.9%. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and Escherichia coli, among which Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was predominant (93.5%). MRSA was 100% resistant to levofloxacin, penicillium, oxacillin, and it was also resistant to other antibiotics except Vancomycin. The resistance rate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa to Cefoperazone/Sulbactam, Imipenem and cefepime were 15.8%, 36.8%, 33.3%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter species and Escherichia coli were predominant in the burn unit,among them Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter were more resistant to antibiotics.
TI  - [Epidemiological surveillance cultures in antimicrobial-resistant bacteria causing nosocomial infection].
AB  - Implementation of surveillance culture programs and molecular typing are important contributions of Clinical Microbiology to the control of nosocomial infections. This document provides information on collection, transport, preservation, and processing of samples for surveillance culture, as well as the criteria for interpreting and reporting the results of relevant etiologic agents in nosocomial infection. This includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus spp., enterobacteria producing extended-spectrum beta -lactamases (ESBLs), multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Details on the available methods for rapid diagnosis are also presented. The information in this document attempts to provide a general approach to the problem and may be considered a starting point for laboratories that are developing their own guidelines, according to needs defined by the multidisciplinary nosocomial infection control team.
TI  - Emerging gram-negative antibiotic resistance: daunting challenges, declining sensitivities, and dire consequences.
AB  - Emerging antibiotic resistance has created a major public health dilemma, compounded by a dearth of new antibiotic options. Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative organisms have received less attention than Gram-positive threats, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, but are just as menacing. Pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii employ a variety of resistance mechanisms and are associated with dangerous nosocomial outbreaks. In some cases these pathogens have expressed resistance to all clinically available compounds. The emergence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing organisms in the community has raised alarm. Furthermore, the carbapenems, currently the most successful class of antibiotics, are showing signs of vulnerability. While the search for new antibiotic options continues, there is urgent need to employ strategies that will slow the development of resistance to the current armamentarium, such as avoiding prolonged antibiotic use or under-dosing, using pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic principles to choose dosing regimens, and encouraging early and aggressive empirical therapy, followed by de-escalation and narrowing the antimicrobial spectrum when culture results become available.
TI  - Antimicrobial resistance of bacterial isolates from respiratory care wards in Taiwan: a horizontal surveillance study.
AB  - A horizontal surveillance study was conducted to identify common bacteria and mycobacteria from 611 respiratory aspirates and 165 urinary samples from 611 patients hospitalised at 17 respiratory care wards (RCWs) in Taiwan. Some major resistance phenotypes, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Proteus mirabilis, and multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDR-PA) and Acinetobacter baumannii (MDR-AB), were identified. Pulsotypes of ESBL-producing P. mirabilis isolates were determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The prevalences of MRSA, ESBL-producing E. coli (K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis), carbapenem-resistant (resistant to imipenem and meropenem) P. aeruginosa, MDR-PA, carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii and MDR-AB were, respectively, 86.7%, 20.0% (50.7% and 24.1%), 18.4%, 1.2%, 32.1% and 8.9% for respiratory aspirates and 100%, 25.4% (27.3% and 25.0%), 48.3%, 10.3%, 50.0% and 21.4% for catheterised urinary samples. Among the 44 respiratory isolates of P. mirabilis with an ESBL phenotype, 22 different pulsotypes (>80% identity) were identified. Among 103 isolates of mycobacteria, 90 (87.4%) belonged to rapidly growing mycobacteria and 4 (4%) were Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Among the 404 patients with available clinical information, true infections were found in 28.0%, the most prevalent of which were urinary tract infection (20.5%) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (10.9%). High prevalences of various multidrug-resistant bacteria among the respiratory and urinary tracts of patients present a clinical difficulty in choosing empirical antibiotic treatment in RCWs.
TI  - Multidrug-resistant organisms in military wounds from Iraq and Afghanistan.
AB  - Mortality from battlefield wounds has historically declined, thanks to better surgical management, faster transport of casualties, and improved antibiotics. Today, one of the major challenges facing U.S. military caregivers is the presence of multidrug-resistant organisms in orthopaedic extremity wounds. The most frequently identified resistant strains of bacteria are Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex. Overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics may be an important factor in building resistant strains. Acinetobacter infections appear to hospital-acquired and not from an initial colonization of the injury. More research is required to give military physicians the tools they require to reduce the infection rate and defeat multidrug-resistant organisms.
TI  - Outcomes of bacteremia in burn patients involved in combat operations overseas.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Burn patients constitute approximately 5% of casualties injured in support of US military operations in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom [OIF]) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom [OEF]). Since the onset of these conflicts, there have been numerous casualties infected with multidrug-resistant bacteria. It is currently unclear if bacteremia with these multidrug-resistant organisms in OIF/OEF burn casualties is associated with increased mortality. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients admitted to the US Army Institute of Surgical Research burn center from January 2003 to May 2006 to evaluate bacteremia in our burn-patient population. RESULTS: One hundred twenty-nine of 1,258 patients admitted to the burn center became bacteremic during their hospitalization. Of these, 92 had bacteremia with the top four pathogens in our burn center, ie, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii complex, and Staphylococcus aureus. Presence of any bacteremia was associated with mortality and increased ventilator days. Bacteremia with K pneumoniae was associated with a statistically increased mortality and a prolonged ventilator course relative to all other pathogens. CONCLUSIONS: Casualties of OIF/OEF with burn injuries did not have different outcomes than patients whose burns were not associated with military operations. Bacteremia, especially with a multidrug-resistant organism, causes increased mortality in burn patients. Of all the pathogens causing bacteremia, K pneumonia appears to have the greatest impact on mortality.
TI  - Melatonin as an antibiotic: new insights into the actions of this ubiquitous molecule.
AB  - The incidence of serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria has been increasing rapidly worldwide despite advances in antibacterial therapy in the last two decades. Among multidrug-resistant gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are of great importance, because they have emerged as primary nosocomial pathogens in hospital outbreaks. In this study, we investigated whether melatonin has antibacterial effects against these microorganisms in vitro. The minimum inhibitory concentration of melatonin was determined using a standard microdilution method at 24 and 48 hr. Melatonin inhibited microbial growth at both 24 and 48 hr; but results showed that melatonin had antibacterial effects against these microorganisms after 48 hr of incubation in lower doses [concentrations between 31.25 to 125 microg/mL (0.13-0.53 mM)]. Also, it was determined that melatonin has a more potent antimicrobial effect on gram-negative microorganism. Among possible mechanisms, it is concluded that melatonin showed antibacterial effects by reducing intracellular substrates.
TI  - Comparative analysis of antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK as part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial.
AB  - As part of the tigecycline evaluation and surveillance trial (TEST), bacterial isolates were collected from 39 centres in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the UK between January 2004 and August 2006. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined according to CLSI guidelines. Italy had the highest rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (36.4%), and was the only country to report vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis (8.6%). Tigecycline was the only agent to which all Gram-positive isolates were susceptible. For many of the Gram-negative organisms collected, antimicrobial susceptibilities were lowest among isolates from Italy and highest among isolates from Spain. The notable exception was Acinetobacter baumannii, where the poorest susceptibility profile was among isolates from Spain. For A. baumannii, MIC(90)s of imipenem varied from 1 mg/L for isolates in France and Germany to > or =32 mg/L for isolates from Italy and Spain. Tigecycline was the only agent to maintain an MIC(90) of < or =1 mg/L against isolates from all five countries. The in-vitro activity of tigecycline against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates may make it valuable in the treatment of hospital infections, including those caused by otherwise antimicrobial-resistant organisms.
TI  - Synthesis and biological evaluation of novel 1,3,5-triazine derivatives as antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Numerous studies have contributed to the development of natural and synthetic antimicrobial peptides as a prospective source of antibiotic agents. Based on the concept that cationic charge, bulk, and lipophilicity are major factors determining antibacterial activity in these peptides, we designed and screened several combinatorial libraries based on 1,3,5-triazine as a template. A set of compounds were identified to show potent antimicrobial activity together with low hemolytic activity.
TI  - Microbiological surveillance of the surgical intensive care unit in Zagreb--a pivot for guideline-based therapy of severe sepsis.
AB  - The aim of this retrospective study was to create guidelines for therapy of severe sepsis in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) for unknown causative agent based on antimicrobial susceptibility of causative bacteria. Seventy-four patients with severe sepsis from surgical ICU in 2003.-2005. were included in study. Their clinical and microbiological data were analyzed from the medical records. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains isolated from the blood-culture was tested by disk diffusion method according to CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institution). APACHE II score was used to predict the severity of illness. Statistical significance difference between results was tested by Mann-Whitney test and chi2 test. Important problem remained type of sepsis: mono-agent sepsis presented less therapeutic problem than sepsis caused with two or more agents (mixed sepsis). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were predominant causative agents in both type of sepsis. There was remarkable increase of A. baumannii prevalence in 2005 compared to 2004 and to 2003. There was also decrease of MRSA prevalence in 2004 and 2005 compared to 2003. P. aeruginosa were the predominant causative agents in 2004. MRSA displayed good susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolide, whereas P. aeruginosa showed excellent susceptibility to ceftazidime and carbapenems. A. baumannii, third predominant causative agent, exhibited excellent susceptibility to ampicillin+ sulbactam and carbapenems. The recommended therapy is empirical and should cover all important pathogens.
TI  - [Monitoring of nosocomial infections using the HELICS network].
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Hospitals in Europe Link for Infection Control through Surveillance (HELICS) network has been implemented in 15 countries of the EU. The network has been responsible for standardization of definitions, collection of data, and therapeutic procedures. The aim of study was to assess the usefulness of ICU-HELICS programme for surveillance of infections in ITU. METHODS: The following data were recorded: kind of infections and their incidence, device utilization ratios for lung ventilation, central venous and urinary catheters. Infections were diagnosed according to CDC and HELICS criteria. RESULTS: During the 12-months period nosocomial infection was diagnosed in 62 out of 178 patients (35%). The incidence of device-associated nosocomial infection was 34.8 per 1000 patients, and the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was 16 per 1000 ventilator days. CVC-related bloodstream infections (BSI) occurred in 5.6 cases per 1000 catheter days. The incidence of catheter-associated urinary tract infections (UTI) was 6.8 per 1000 catheterisation days. The most common pathogen in VAP was Acinetobacter baumanii and in UTI--methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative Staphylococci. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In the present study overall incidence of nosocomial infections within ITU was not found to be different from that in 1995. The incidence of device-associated nosocomial infections was higher than the mean value for developing countries, but lower than in Finland. The incidence of VAP was higher than in USA and in the majority of European countries with the exception of Holland, Spain, and Finland. In conclusion, we found the HELICS networkto be very helpful, allowing for observation and analysis of nosocomial infections and comparison with other centres.
TI  - A class IIa peptide from Enterococcus mundtii inhibits bacteria associated with otitis media.
AB  - Peptide ST4SA, produced by Enterococcus mundtii ST4SA, inhibits the growth of Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Gram-positive bacteria isolated from patients diagnosed with middle ear infections. The peptide adsorbed at a level of 94% to S. pneumoniae 40, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 25 and E. faecium HKLHS. Low concentrations of peptide ST4SA (51200 arbitrary units (AU)/mL) caused DNA and enzyme leakage from target cells, whilst 1638400AU/mL caused cell lysis. No decrease in antimicrobial activity was observed when tested on solid medium with human blood as base. Peptide ST4SA revealed a similar level of activity compared with tetracycline (30 microg), but much higher activity compared with nasal sprays, aminoglycosides, cephalosporins, fluoroquinolones, lincosamides, macrolides, nitroimidazole, penicillin, quinolones, sulphonamides, chloramphenicol, furazolidone, fusidic acid, rifampicin, trimethoprim, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and vancomycin when tested in vitro. Peptide ST4SA dissipates the proton-motive force and may be used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant strains where antibiotics are excluded from cells by efflux pumps dependent on the membrane proton gradient.
TI  - [Microorganisms isolated from blood cultures and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns at a university hospital during 1994-2003].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Blood culture is important for the determination of the etiologic agent of bacteremia. Analysis of blood culture results and antimicrobial susceptibility trend can provide clinicians with relevant information for the empirical treatment of patients. METHODS: The species and antimicrobial susceptibility of the isolates from blood cultures at the Severance Hospital during 1994-2003 were analysed. Blood specimens were cultured for 7 days using tryptic soy broth and thioglycollate medium. Identification of organism was based on conventional methods or commercial kit systems. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by a disk diffusion method. RESULTS: Of 536,916 blood specimens cultured, 24,877 (4.6%) from 13,102 patients were positive. Among the isolates, 93.1% were aerobic or facultative anaerobic bacteria, 3.3% anaerobes, and 3.6% fungi. Escherichia coli was isolated most frequently, followed by Staphylococcus aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, Enterococcus spp., and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of patients with Enterococcus faecium and K. pneumoniae gradually increased during this study. Enterococcus, S. aureus and alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus were frequently isolated from the age group of less than 2 yr. E. coli, Enterococcus spp., K. pneumoniae and S. aureus from the age group of over 50 yr. Oxacillin-resistant S. aureus decreased, whereas vancomycin-resistant E. faecium and imipenemresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii increased. CONCLUSIONS: E. coli was the most common cause of bacteremia and S. aureus, alpha-hemolytic Streptococcus, and K. pneumoniae were frequently isolated pathogens. The bacteremia due to Enterococcus, K. pneumoniae, fungi, vancomycin-resistant E. faecium, and imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii gradually increased during this period.
TI  - The antimicrobial activity of copper and copper alloys against nosocomial pathogens and Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolated from healthcare facilities in the Western Cape: an in-vitro study.
AB  - Clinical isolates of meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Candida albicans and Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) were tested against copper (Cu) and its alloys. Stainless steel and polyvinylchloride (PVC) were used as controls. The amount of Cu required to inhibit test isolates at room temperature (24 degrees C) and at 4 degrees C was determined. At room temperature, Cu, DZR Brass (Cu 62%, Pb 2.5%, arsenate 0.13% and Zn 22.5%) and Brass 70/30 (Cu 70% and zinc 30%) inhibited C. albicans and K. pneumoniae at 60 min; nickel silver (NiAg) inhibited C. albicans at 60 min and K. pneumoniae at 270 min. P. aeruginosa was inhibited by Brass 70/30 and nickel silver (NiAg) at 180 min and at 270 min by Cu and DZR. Cu and DZR inhibited A. baumannii at 180 min while the other alloys were effective at 360 min. Stainless steel and PVC showed little or no inhibitory activity. Two M. tuberculosis strains, one isoniazid resistant (R267) and the other multidrug resistant (R432), demonstrated growth inhibition with Cu of 98% and 88% respectively compared with PVC; the other alloys were less active. Time to positivity (TTP) for R267 was >15 days with Cu and 11 days for the other alloys; with R432 it was 5 days. Effective inhibition of nosocomial pathogens and MTB by Cu and alloys was best when the Cu content was >55%.
TI  - [Epidemiology and susceptibility profile of blood culture isolates in an intensive care unit (2002-2005)].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The aim of our study was to determine the epidemiological profile and the antibiotics susceptibility of bacteria identified in blood culture in the intensive care unit, to improve empirical antibiotherapy. MATERIAL AND METHOD: A retrospective study was made over a four-year period (2002-2005) in the intensive care unit of the Mohammed-V Military Hospital. It included all the bacteria identified in blood culture. RESULTS: During this period, we collected 286 isolates, Gram-negative bacilli 49.3% and Gram-positive cocci 46.85%. The most frequently identified species were Acinetobacter baumannii (13.63%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (12.6%), Staphylococcus aureus (11.9%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7%). Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 25.54%: Klebsiella pneumoniae 7%, and Enterobacter cloacae 7%. The rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 52.94 % and coagulase negative staphylococci 60.24%. No resistance to glycopeptides was observed. Enterobacteriaceae were resistant to third generation cephalosporins in 42.6 % and had a broad-spectrum betalactamase phenotype in 18%. The resistance rate of A. baumannii was 68.7% for ceftazidime and 31.4% for imipenem. The resistance rate of P. aeruginosa to the third generation cephalosporines and the imipenem were respectively 16.6% and 10.5%. CONCLUSION: A regular epidemiologic study of blood culture isolates and determination of susceptibility to antibiotics are necessary to improve empiric therapy.
TI  - Evaluation of the inhibitory effects of human serum components on bactericidal activity of human beta defensin 3.
AB  - Naturally occurring cationic antimicrobial peptides (CAPs) are an essential component of the innate immune system of multicellular organisms. At concentrations generally higher than those found in vivo, most CAPs exhibit strong antibacterial properties in vitro, but their activity may be inhibited by body fluids, a fact that could limit their future use as antimicrobial and/or immunomodulatory agents. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of human serum components on bactericidal activity of the human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3), a CAP considered particularly promising for future therapeutic employment. Human serum diluted to 20% strongly inhibited the bactericidal activity of the peptide against both the Gram-positive species Staphylococcus aureus and the Gram-negative species Acinetobacter baumannii. Such activity was not restored in serum devoid of salts (dialyzed), pre-treated with protease inhibitors, or subjected to both of these treatments. The addition of physiological concentrations of NaCl, CaCl2, and human albumin in the bactericidal assay abolished bactericidal activity of hBD-3 against S. aureus, while it only partially inhibited the activity of the peptide against A. baumannii. Although a proteolytic activity of serum on hBD-3 was demonstrated at the protein level by Western blot, addition of physiological concentrations of trypsin to the bactericidal assay only partially affected the antibacterial properties of the peptide. Altogether, these results demonstrate a major role of mono-divalent cations and serum proteins on inhibition of hBD-3 antibacterial properties and indicate a relative lack in sensitivity of the bactericidal activity of this peptide to trypsin and trypsin-like proteases.
TI  - Identification and characterization of an Acinetobacter baumannii biofilm-associated protein.
AB  - We have identified a homologue to the staphylococcal biofilm-associated protein (Bap) in a bloodstream isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii. The fully sequenced open reading frame is 25,863 bp and encodes a protein with a predicted molecular mass of 854 kDa. Analysis of the nucleotide sequence reveals a repetitive structure consistent with bacterial cell surface adhesins. Bap-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) 6E3 was generated to an epitope conserved among 41% of A. baumannii strains isolated during a recent outbreak in the U.S. military health care system. Flow cytometry confirms that the MAb 6E3 epitope is surface exposed. Random transposon mutagenesis was used to generate A. baumannii bap1302::EZ-Tn5, a mutant negative for surface reactivity to MAb 6E3 in which the transposon disrupts the coding sequence of bap. Time course confocal laser scanning microscopy and three-dimensional image analysis of actively growing biofilms demonstrates that this mutant is unable to sustain biofilm thickness and volume, suggesting a role for Bap in supporting the development of the mature biofilm structure. This is the first identification of a specific cell surface protein directly involved in biofilm formation by A. baumannii and suggests that Bap is involved in intercellular adhesion within the mature biofilm.
TI  - Five-year review of infections in a burn intensive care unit: High incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii in a tropical climate.
AB  - A 5-year review of nosocomial infections, bacteraemia and wound colonization in patients admitted to a burn intensive care unit from June 2001 to May 2006 was carried out. All patients required intubation at some point, and ICU support. Data on bacterial and fungal isolates were entered prospectively into a hospital-wide computerized database. Nosocomial infections (NIs) were defined using standard CDC criteria. Seventy-six patients were admitted during the study period, with 57 qualifying for analysis. Forty-two patients (74%) developed 137 NIs, with 240 NIs/100 admissions. The most common NI was pneumonia (43%), followed by burn wound infection (34%), primary bloodstream infection (20%) and urinary tract infection (3%). The device specific rate of pneumonia was 143 infections per 1000 ventilator days. There were 113 episodes of bacteraemia and 173 episodes of wound colonization without infection. The most common organisms causing nosocomial infections were Acinetobacter sp. (n=33), followed by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (n=24) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=22). A. baumannii isolates were highly multiresistant, with 82 distinct strains isolated from 47 patients (82% of patients). Data from this and other studies supports the hypothesis that A. baumannii is more common in tropical, warm climes necessitating vigorous infection control measures to optimise patient outcome.
TI  - Inhibitory effect of Gram-negative and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effect of several Gram-negative  and Gram-positive microorganisms against Helicobacter pylori clinical isolates. METHODS: The in vitro effect of 32 microorganisms against H. pylori clinical isolates was determined by a diffusion method. Time-kill assay was performed with two Staphylococcus spp. strains. RESULTS: Anti-H. pylori activity was detected with Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus spp., 1 Enterococcus faecium and 2 Lactobacillus spp. against 7, 11, 1, 5 and 6 H. pylori strains tested. All Staphylococcus spp. showed an anti-H. pylori effect: one Staphylococcus auricularis and two Staphylococcus epidermidis against all H. pylori tested; Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus hominis and S. auricularis against six, five and seven H. pylori strains; and two other coagulase-negative Staphylococcus against one H. pylori strain. An inhibitory effect was detected with one Escherichia coli against one H. pylori. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Salmonella spp. and Acinetobacter baumannii showed activity against four H. pylori strains, and Enterobacter cloacae and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia showed activity against 14 H. pylori isolates. No anti-H. pylori activity was detected with one Lactobacillus spp., two Lactococcus lactis, four Streptococcus spp., one Bacillus cereus, one E. faecium, one Enterococcus faecalis, one E. coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella oxytoca. Time-kill assay showed bactericidal activity at 24 h with the two Staphylococcus spp. strains tested. CONCLUSIONS: Several strains of human pathogens or commensal bacteria are able to inhibit H. pylori growth in vitro and it is a strain-dependent phenomenon.
TI  - Comparative analysis of the bactericidal activities of amphibian peptide analogues against multidrug-resistant nosocomial bacterial strains.
AB  - Due to the widespread resistance of bacteria to the available drugs, the discovery of new classes of antibiotics is urgently needed, and naturally occurring antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are considered promising candidates for future therapeutic use. Amphibian skin is one of the richest sources of such AMPs. In the present study we compared the in vitro bactericidal activities of five AMPs from three different species of anurans against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates belonging to species often involved in nosocomial infections (Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii). The peptides tested were temporins A, B, and G from Rana temporaria; the fragment from positions 1 to 18 of esculentin 1b [Esc(1-18)] from Rana esculenta; and bombinin H2 from Bombina variegata. When they were tested in buffer, all the peptides were bactericidal against all bacterial species tested (three strains of each species) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 48 microM, with only a few exceptions. The temporins were found to be more active against gram-positive bacteria, especially when they were assayed in human serum; Esc(1-18) showed fast and strong bactericidal activity, within 2 to 20 min, especially against the gram-negative species, which were killed by Esc(1-18) at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 1 microM; bombinin H2 displayed similar bactericidal activity toward all isolates. Interestingly, while the activities of the temporins and bombinin H2 were almost completely inhibited in the presence of 20% human serum, the activity of Esc(1-18) against the gram-negative species was partially preserved in the presence of 40% serum. This property renders this peptide an attractive molecule for use in the development of new compounds for the treatment of infectious diseases.
TI  - Postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections: an unsolved problem in  thoracic surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antibiotics currently recommended for prophylaxis in thoracic surgery are first-generation and second-generation cephalosporins. Despite this prophylaxis, postoperative pneumonia after major pulmonary resections remains frequent and severe. However, in the medical literature, the origin of these infections is poorly documented. METHODS: To evaluate the efficiency of current prophylactic regimens, we retrospectively analyzed 312 consecutive cases of major pulmonary resection, performed between January 2000 and December 2004. For patients who experienced postoperative pulmonary infection, the microbiologic agents and their antibiotic susceptibility were studied. RESULTS: A postoperative pneumonia was diagnosed in 76 patients (24.4% +/- 0.43%). Sixty patients (78.9%) experienced the infection in the first 5 postoperative days. A microbiologic documentation was obtained in 44 cases (57.9%) with 56 microorganisms involved. Pathogens responsible for the infections were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 10), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 8), group B Streptococcus organisms (n = 1), nongroupable Streptococcus organisms (n = 2), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1), Haemophilus spp. (n = 9), Branhamella catarrhalis (n = 2), Enterobacteriaceae (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 3), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 1), and Candida spp. (n = 4). According to the antibiotic susceptibility testings, the prophylactic regimen by cefazolin proved ineffective for 84% of the microbiologically documented cases. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirmed the inefficiency of current prophylaxis against pathogens involved in postoperative pneumonia after major lung resections. Evaluation of new and more-adapted approaches of antibiotic prophylaxis should be the subject of prospective multicenter trials.
TI  - Epidemiology of multidrug-resistant bacteria in patients with long hospital stays.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine rates of colonization with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria (ie, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA], vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus [VRE], extended-spectrum beta -lactamase [ESBL]-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and Acinetobacter baumannii) after prolonged hospitalization and to assess the yield of surveillance cultures and variables associated with colonization with MDR bacteria. DESIGN: Prospective observational cohort study conducted from February 6 to May 26, 2006. METHODS: All patients who spent more than 30 days in our university hospital (Paris, France) were included. Rectal and nasal swab samples obtained during day 30 screening were examined for MRSA, VRE, ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and A. baumannii. RESULTS: Of 470 eligible patients, 439 had surveillance culture samples available for analysis, including 51 patients (11.6%) with a history of colonization or infection due to 1 or more types of MDR bacteria (MRSA, recovered from 35 patients; ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, from 16 patients; A. baumannii, from 6 patients; and VRE, from 0 patients) and 37 patients (9.5% of the 388 patients not known to have any of the 4 MDR bacteria before day 30 screening) newly identified as colonized by 1 or more MDR bacteria (MRSA, recovered from 20 patients; ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae, from 16 patients; A. baumannii, from 1 patient; and VRE, from 0 patients). A total of 87 (19.8%) of 439 patients were identified as colonized or infected with MDR bacteria at day 30. Factors that differed between patients with and without MRSA colonization included age, McCabe score, comorbidity score, receipt of surgery, and receipt of fluoroquinolone treatment. Patients with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization were younger than patients with MRSA colonization. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the variables associated with MRSA colonization and ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae colonization suggest differences in the epidemiology of these 2 organisms. Day 30 screening resulted in a 72.5% increase in the number of patients identified as colonized with at least 1 type of MDR bacteria.
TI  - Preoperative sterilization and disinfection of drill guide templates.
AB  - The aim of the in vitro study was to evaluate the decontamination potential of common antiseptic solutions for heat-sensitive implantological drill guide templates. One hundred implantologists were evaluated on the basis of a questionnaire for their measures of disinfection. On the basis of these results, 80% alcohol, Octenidine 0.1%, and Chlorhexidine 0.12% were tested in an in vitro model for their decontamination efficacy for heat-sensitive plastic material infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Candida albicans. The microorganisms were selected on the basis of results of environmental testing of dental laboratories. The results of the questionnaire revealed that Chlorhexidine was used by 30%, 80% alcohol by 23%, and Octenidine by 7% of the dentists. Using the in vitro model, with the exception of S. aureus, Chlorhexidine was not able to completely eliminate the microorganisms after 15 min of application. In contrast, the treatment with Octenidine revealed no further growth of the tested microorganisms after that time. The 80% alcohol was more efficient. No growth of microorganisms could be detected in any of the tests after 5 min of incubation. On the basis of our results and due to the fact that suitable installations for sterilization were hardly used by the dental practitioners, the disinfection of templates should be preferentially performed with 80% alcohol or Octenidine using an incubation time of 15 min with ultrasonication.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among organisms from the Asia/Pacific Rim, Europe and Latin and North America collected as part of TEST and the in vitro activity of tigecycline.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To describe antimicrobial susceptibility among bacterial isolates associated with hospital infections collected from 266 centres in Asia/Pacific Rim (n = 1,947), North America (n = 24,283), Latin America (n = 1,957) and Europe (n = 8,796). METHODS: Isolates were collected from blood, respiratory tract, urine, skin, wound, body fluids and other defined sources between January 2004 and August 2006. Only one isolate per patient was accepted. In vitro MICs for the isolates were determined according to the CLSI (formerly NCCLS) guidelines. RESULTS: Key organisms collected were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2,902), Enterobacter spp. (n = 5,731), Escherichia coli (n = 6,504), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 4,916), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 5,128), Serratia marcescens (n = 2,313), Enterococcus faecalis (n = 2,701), Enterococcus faecium (n = 1,035) and Staphylococcus aureus (n = 5,753). Rates of methicillin resistance among S. aureus and of vancomycin resistance among enterococci were highest in North America (2,016/3,809, 52.9% and 571/2,544, 22.4%, respectively) and lowest in Europe (337/1,340, 25.1% and 36/916, 3.9%, respectively). Tigecycline was the only antimicrobial to maintain activity against all Gram-positive isolates (MIC(90) values of <or=0.25 mg/L). Overall, tigecycline and imipenem were the most active (>93% susceptibility in all regions) antimicrobials against the Gram-negative species, except for A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Piperacillin/tazobactam and amikacin were the most active against P. aeruginosa. Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers among K. pneumoniae occurred most frequently in Latin America (124/282, 44.0%). CONCLUSIONS: Tigecycline is a novel broad-spectrum antimicrobial that is active against the common organisms associated with infections.
TI  - Empirical antibiotic therapy of sepsis in surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - Retrospective study was conducted in surgical intensive care unit (ICU) in Clinical Hospital Center Zagreb in 2005. The aim of study was to create guidelines for empirical antibiotic therapy of sepsis in ICU for unknown causative agent based on antimicrobial susceptibility of causative bacteria. Thirty-two patients with severe sepsis were included in study and from medical records their clinical and microbiological data were analyzed. Antimicrobial susceptibility of the strains isolated from the blood-culture was tested by disk diffusion method according to CLSI (Clinical Laboratory Standard Institution). We used APACHE II score to predict the severity of illness. Mann-Whitney test and chi2 test were used to test statistical significance difference between results. Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the predominant causative agent. Acinetobacter baumannii was displaying excellent susceptibility to ampicillin+sulbactam and carbapenems, whereas Pseudomonas aeruginosa was showed good susceptibility on ceftazidim and carbapenems. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), third predominant causative agent exhibiting good susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolide. The recommended therapy is empirical antibiotic therapy and should cover all important pathogens.
TI  - Investigation of sources of potential bias in laboratory surveillance for anti-microbial resistance.
AB  - PURPOSE: There are a number of biases that may influence the validity of laboratory-based surveillance for antimicrobial resistance. Our objective was to evaluate the potential magnitude of bias in reporting of etiologic agents and their resistance rates associated with inclusion of multiple patient samples and non-random timing and location of sampling. METHODS: All urine cultures submitted to a regional laboratory in the Calgary Health Region during 2004 and 2005 were studied. Comparisons were then made using either the overall cohort or different subgroups compared with the "reference" or gold standard population where only the first isolate per patient per year per species was included. RESULTS: Overall 56,897 organisms were cultured at > or =104 cfu/mL from 53,548 samples from 35,890 patients; 39,835 organisms were included in the reference cohort. Escherichia coli was reported in 37,246 (65.5%) of overall cohort and 28,257 (70.9%) of the reference cohort. Therefore, the overall cohort resulted in a relative underestimation of the importance of E. coli as the principal cause of urinary tract infections by 8%. Similarly, reported rates of resistance to antimicrobial agents most notably ciprofloxacin [6,480/52,544 (12.3%) vs. 2,647/37,086 (7.1%)], gentamicin [2,991/48,070 (6.2%) vs. 1,567/34,608 (4.5%)], and ceftriaxone [1,737/44,922 (3.9%) vs. 889/32,745 (2.7%)] were higher in the overall than in the reference cohorts. There were large differences in both the distribution of organisms and rates of resistance associated with sampling during different times of the day, week, and year as well as from acute care hospitals and outpatient clinics (P< or =0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Reports from laboratory-based surveillance studies may be biased depending on the population studied and method of sampling employed. Care must be taken in interpreting results of surveillance studies that do not protect from these major sources of bias.

TI  - Three novel highly charged copper-based biocides: safety and efficacy against healthcare-associated organisms.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We investigated three novel highly charged copper-based inorganic biocidal formulations for their activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infection. METHODS: The three copper-based formulations were tested: (i) against clinical isolates of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Legionella pneumophila, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus/baumannii (ACCB), glycopeptide-resistant Enterococcus and spores of Clostridium difficile in time-kill assays; (ii) for their ability to decontaminate ultramicrofibre (UMF) cloths; and (iii) for their cytotoxicity to human skin and intestinal epithelial cells. RESULTS: All three copper-based formulations were potently biocidal down to concentrations of 1 ppm for both stationary- and log-phase organisms, and they were all active against C. difficile spores. At 150 ppm, they achieved a complete (>6 log10) kill of MRSA and ACCB mostly within 1 h. This biocidal activity was not achieved by copper sulphate or the inorganic binders used in the formulations. All three copper-based formulations completely decontaminated UMF cloths containing MRSA, ACCB or C. difficile spores, suggesting that any of these copper-based formulations would be highly beneficial in the healthcare environment. All three copper-based formulations and copper sulphate were not cytotoxic to human epithelial cells up to concentrations of 100-200 ppm. CONCLUSIONS: All three of the novel copper-based biocidal formulations, but not their components (copper sulphate and inorganic binders), have potent activity against organisms highly relevant to healthcare-associated infections.
TI  - The antimicrobial effect of heparin on common respiratory pathogens.
AB  - AIM: The mucolytic, anticoagulative, anti-inflammatory and neo-angiogenic properties of inhaled heparin may benefit patients with burns and cystic fibrosis. We assessed the antibacterial effects of unfractionated heparin. METHODS: Stored clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (n =4), Candida albicans (n = 5), Haemophilus influenzae (n =5), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =4), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=3), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 2), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 7) were subcultured on horse blood agar, incubated at 35 degrees C overnight, then inoculated into trypticase soy broth to a density of 1 McFarland standard. Dilutions of unfractionated heparin (containing 250- 7500 U) and 100 microL of the 1.0 McFarland standard broth were incubated at 35 degrees C overnight in microtitre plates and then subcultured on horse blood agar using 1 microL standard loops. Colonies (representing viable organisms) were counted. RESULTS: Heparin produced dose-dependent growth inhibition of three of seven S. pneumoniae isolates (complete inhibition at 2500U dose per 200 microL) and one of five H. influenzae isolates (complete inhibition at 7500 U dose per 200 microL), but no inhibition of other isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Unfractionated heparin is unlikely to have antibacterial effects because of its unpredictable inhibition of growth of common respiratory pathogens.
TI  - Resistance to disinfectants in epidemiologically defined clinical isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - Decreased susceptibility to biocides may contribute to epidemic spread of Acinetobacter baumannii in the hospital. This study was conducted to evaluate the susceptibility of different clinical A. baumannii strains to disinfectants. Twenty A. baumannii strains were examined, ten of which were outbreak-related and ten that were sporadic. Clinical isolates were selected on the basis of demonstrating a unique pulsed-field gel electrophoresis pattern. The in-vitro activities of propanol, combination of 1-propanol, 2-propanol and mecetronium ethylsulphate, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-iodine, triclosan and chlorhexidine were determined using a broth macrodilution method. Exposure times to the disinfectant ranged from 15 s to 2 min and concentrations ranged from undiluted to a 1:4000 dilution in order to investigate the impact of inadvertent dilution that might occur in clinical practice. Five American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) type strains (A. baumannii, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus aureus) were used as controls. All disinfectants inhibited growth of all isolates at concentrations and contact times recommended by the respective manufacturer. With most of the disinfectants tested, a relevant number of viable bacteria remained if contact times < 30s or diluted agents were used. No significant differences in susceptibility between outbreak-related and sporadic strains were detected, but larger studies would be required to confirm this. Resistance to currently used disinfectants is probably not a major factor in the epidemic spread of A. baumannii. However, even minor deviations from the recommended procedures leading to decreased concentrations or exposure times may play a role in nosocomial cross-transmission.
TI  - New strategies for combating multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - Antibiotic resistance is a problem that continues to challenge the healthcare sector. In particular, multidrug resistance is now common in familiar pathogens such as Staphylococcus aureus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as emerging pathogens such as Acinetobacter baumannii. New antibiotics and new therapeutic strategies are needed to address this challenge. Advances in identifying new sources of antibiotic natural products and expanding antibiotic chemical diversity are providing chemical leads for new drugs. Inhibitors of resistance mechanisms and microbial virulence are orthogonal strategies that are also generating new chemicals that can extend the life of existing antibiotics. This new chemistry, coupled with a growing understanding of the mechanisms, origins and distribution of antibiotic resistance, position us to tackle the challenges of antibiotic resistance in the 21st century.
TI  - Prediction of specific pathogens in patients with sepsis: evaluation of TREAT, a  computerized decision support system.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prediction of bacterial infections and their pathogens allows for early, directed investigation and treatment. We assessed the ability of TREAT, a computerized decision support system, to predict specific pathogens. METHODS: TREAT uses data available within the first few hours of infection presentation in a causal probabilistic network to predict sites of infection and specific pathogens. We included 3529 patients (920 with microbiologically documented infections) participating in the observational and interventional trials of the TREAT system in Israel, Germany and Italy. Discriminatory performance of TREAT to predict individual pathogens was expressed by the AUC with 95% confidence intervals. Calibration was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit statistic. RESULTS: The AUCs for Gram-negative bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli, ranged between 0.70 and 0.80 (all significant). Adequate calibration was demonstrated for any Gram-negative infection and individual bacteria, except for E. coli. Discrimination and calibration were acceptable for Enterococcus spp. (AUC 0.71, 0.65-0.78), but not for Staphylococcus aureus (AUC 0.63, 0.55-0.71). The few infections caused by Candida spp. and Clostridium difficile were well predicted (AUCs 0.74, 0.54-0.95; and 0.94, 0.88-1.00, respectively). The coverage with TREAT's recommendation exceeded that observed with physicians' treatment for all pathogens, except Candida spp. CONCLUSIONS: TREAT predicted individual pathogens causing infection well. Prediction of S. aureus was inferior to that observed with other pathogens. TREAT can be used to triage patients by the risk for specific pathogens. The system's predictions enable it to prescribe appropriate antibiotic treatment prior to pathogen identification.
TI  - Comparison of in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against aerobic bacterial pathogens from patients with nosocomial infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is a rapid worldwide emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens, especially in nosocomial isolates. This study compared the in vitro activities of levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam against 208 aerobic bacterial pathogens that caused 197 nosocomial infections in 184 patients. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was evaluated by E test in accordance with the guidelines of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. RESULTS: Most (140/208, 67%) of the isolates were facultative Gram-negative bacilli. Levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were the most effective (22/22, 100%) against oxacillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. None of the antibiotics tested were found to be effective (0/25) against oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. Of the 11 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii that were not pandrug-resistant (PDR), only 9 isolates (9/11, 81%) were sensitive to imipenem and 5 isolates (5/11, 45%) were sensitive to levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, and ceftazidime. Another 22 isolates of A. baumannii that were PDR were completely resistant to all 6 antibiotics. The majority of isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to these 6 antimicrobial agents with 10/11 (91%) sensitive to levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin, 9/11 (83%) sensitive to ceftazidime, cefepime and piperacillin-tazobactam, and 8/11 (75%) sensitive to imipenem. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of the bacterial isolates causing nosocomial infections were found to be sensitive to the 6 antibiotics tested. Bacterial isolates of nosocomial infections that were completely resistant to these 6 antibiotics were PDR A. baumannii, PDR P. aeruginosa, and oxacillin-resistant S. aureus. More potent antimicrobial agents are needed to treat infections caused by PDR A. baumannii and PDR P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility profile of selected bacteraemic pathogens from private institutions in South Africa.
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The National Antimicrobial Surveillance Forum is a continuous surveillance organisation comprising all academic/public and private sector laboratories in South Africa. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility of blood culture isolates of Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter species, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus from patients in private hospitals in five major centres were investigated. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed by 12 participating laboratories according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was determined in selected species of Enterobacteriaceae irrespective of source. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of ampicillin resistance in blood culture isolates of E. coli (N = 471) was 84%, and 20% were resistant to the fluoroquinolones. Considerable geographical differences were noted between the centres with regard to the K. pneumoniae (N = 636) resistance rates for ceftriaxone and/or cefotaxime (39 - 87%). The most active agents in the Enterobacter spp. (N = 244) were imipenem/meropenem, ertapenem, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and cefepime, with 100%, 94%, 88%, 87% and 80% susceptibility, respectively. Carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa (N = 382) varied between 42% and 45%, and in the case of A. baumannii (N = 190) resistance varied between 32% and 33% for meropenem and imipenem respectively. The nationwide incidence of oxacillin resistance in S. aureus (N = 629) was 36%. Overall, the prevalence of ESBL production among all isolates of K. pneumoniae was 26% (N = 7 514), while in Enterobacter spp. it was 12% (N = 4 031) and in E. coli 5% (N = 28 412). CONCLUSIONS: The data highlight the widespread problem of antibiotic resistance among important bacteraemic pathogens in private institutions in South Africa. Continued surveillance is vital to guide appropriate empirical therapy for invasive infections.
TI  - Multiplexed identification of blood-borne bacterial pathogens by use of a novel 16S rRNA gene PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis assay.
AB  - We have developed a novel high-throughput PCR-ligase detection reaction-capillary electrophoresis (PCR-LDR-CE) assay for the multiplexed identification of 20 blood-borne pathogens (Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Neisseria meningitidis, Bacteroides fragilis, Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, Francisella tularensis, and Brucella abortus), the last four of which are biothreat agents. The method relies on the amplification of two regions within the bacterial 16S rRNA gene, using universal PCR primers and querying the identity of specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms within the amplified regions in a subsequent LDR. The ligation products vary in color and size and are separated by CE. Each organism generates a specific pattern of ligation products, which can be used to distinguish the pathogens using an automated software program we developed for that purpose. The assay has been verified on 315 clinical isolates and demonstrated a detection sensitivity of 98%. Additionally, 484 seeded blood cultures were tested, with a detection sensitivity of 97.7%. The ability to identify geographically variant strains of the organisms was determined by testing 132 isolates obtained from across the United States. In summary, the PCR-LDR-CE assay can successfully identify, in a multiplexed fashion, a panel of 20 blood-borne pathogens with high sensitivity and specificity.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial profiles of selected isoquinoline alkaloids from Fumaria and Corydalis species.
AB  - In the current study, 33 isoquinoline alkaloids belonging to protopine-, benzylisoquinoline-, benzophenanthridine-, spirobenzylisoquinoline-, phthalideisoquinoline-, aporphine-, protoberberine-, cularine-, and isoquinolone-types as well as 7 derivatives of them obtained from some Fumaria and Corydalis species growing in Turkey have been evaluated for their in vitro antiviral and antimicrobial activities. Both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madine-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines and their maximum non-toxic concentrations (MNTC) and cytopathogenic effects (CPE) were determined using acyclovir and oseltamivir as the references. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of the alkaloids were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Candida albicans by the microdilution method and compared to ampicilline, ofloxacine, and ketocanazole as the references. The alkaloids did not present any notable antibacterial effect, while they had significant antifungal activity at 8 microg/ml concentration. On the other hand, the alkaloids were found to have selective inhibition against the PI-3 virus ranging between 0.5 and 64 microg/ml as minimum and maximum CPE inhibitory concentrations, whereas they were completely inactive towards HSV.
TI  - Relationship between immunosuppression and intensive care unit-acquired multidrug-resistant bacteria: a case-control study.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between immunosuppression and intensive  care unit (ICU)-acquired multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria. DESIGN: Retrospective case-control study based on prospectively collected data. SETTING: A 30-bed medical and surgical ICU. PATIENTS: All patients hospitalized >48 hrs in the ICU were eligible during a 2-yr period. INTERVENTIONS: Immunosuppression was defined as active solid or hematologic malignancy, leucopenia, or chronic immunosuppressive treatment. MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extending spectrum beta-lactamase producing Gram-negative bacilli. MDR bacteria screening (nasal, anal, and axilla swabs and tracheal aspirate in intubated patients) was performed at ICU admission and weekly. Only MDR bacteria isolated >48 hrs after ICU admission were taken into account; duplicates were excluded. Isolation measures were applied in all patients at ICU admission, in patients with MDR bacteria, and in patients with immunosuppression. Immunosuppressed patients (cases) were matched (1:1) with immunocompetent patients (controls) according to all the following criteria: age +/-5 yrs, Simplified Acute Physiology Score II +/-5, duration of ICU stay +/-3 days, and category of admission (medical/surgical). Risk factors for ICU-acquired MDR bacteria were determined using univariate and multivariate analyses. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of 1,065 eligible patients, nine patients were excluded for absence of MDR bacteria screening at ICU admission. One hundred thirty-three (12%) patients were immunosuppressed, and 128 (96%) of them were successfully matched. Mean time between ICU admission and first ICU-acquired MDR bacteria was 12 +/- 9 days. Incidence of MDR bacteria was significantly higher in cases than in controls (22 vs. 12 MDR bacteria/1000 ICU days, p = .004). However, immunosuppression was not independently associated with ICU-acquired MDR bacteria.Multivariate analysis identified prior antibiotic treatment and antibiotic treatment in the ICU as risk factors for ICU-acquired MDR bacteria (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] = 1.9 [1-3.6], p = .003; 11 [1.4-83], p = .02; respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Immunosuppression is not independently associated with ICU-acquired MDR bacteria. However, infection control measures used in our ICU may have influenced this result.
TI  - A comparison of available and investigational antibiotics for complicated skin infections and treatment-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and enterococcus.
AB  - This article compares vancomycin, teicoplanin, quinupristin-dalfopristin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecyline, dalbavancin, telavancin, ceftobiprole, oritavancin, and ramoplanin for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), enterococcus, and vancomycin-resistant enterococcus. Vancomycin, a glycopeptide antibiotic, is administered intravenously, and is the mainstay of treatment for MRSA and cSSSI. While not available in the U.S., teicoplanin, another glycopeptide antibiotic, can be administered intramuscularly and has simpler dosing and monitoring requirements than vancomycin. Quinupristin/dalfopristin treats vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREF) infections but inhibits cytochrome P450 A3P4, and has only modest activity against MRSA pneumonia. Daptomycin effectively treats cSSSI but not pneumonia caused by MRSA, and is effective against all strains of Staphylococcus. Linezolid, available orally and intravenously, is approved to treat community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia, cSSSI, and infections caused by MRSA and vancomycin-resistant enterococci including infections with concurrent bacteraemia and VREE Tigecycline, a glycylcycline derived from minocycline, has been approved by the FDA to treat cSSSI and complicated intraabdominal infections, and might be effective against Acinetobacter baumannii; its primary side effect is digestive upset. Dalbavancin, effective against MRSA and administered intravenously once weekly, possesses coverage similar to vancomycin. Telavancin deploys multiple mechanisms of action and is effective against MRSA and Gram-positive bacteria resistant to vancomycin. Ceftobiprole, a cephalosporin effective against MRSA, has few side effects. Oritavancin demonstrates similar activity to vancomycin but possesses extended activity against vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus and enterococci. Ramoplanin, a macrocyclic depsipeptide, is unstable in the bloodstream but can be taken orally to treat Clostridium difficile colitis.

TI  - [National Study of Control of Nosocomial Infection in Intensive Care Units. Evolutive report of the years 2003-2005].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Describe the national rates of acquired invasive device-related infections in the ICU during 2003, 2004 and 2005, their etiology and evolution of the multiresistance markers. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. SCOPE: Intensive Care Unit or other units where critical patients are admitted. PATIENTS: 21,608 patients admitted for more than 24 hours in the participating ICUs. MAIN VARIABLES OF INTEREST: Device related infections: pneumonias related with mechanical ventilation (N-MV), urinary infections related with urethral probe (UI-UP) and primary bacteriemias (PB) and/or those related with at risk vascular catheters (BCV). RESULTS: In 2,279 (10.5%) patients, 3,151 infections were detected: 1,469 N-MV, 808 UI-UP and 874 PB/RVC. Incidence rates ranged from 15.5 to 17.5 N-MV per 1,000 days of mechanical ventilation, 5.0 to 6.7 UI-UP per 1,000 days of urethral probe and 4.0 to 4.7 PB/RVC per 1,000 days of vascular catheter. The predominant etiology in the N-MV was meticillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. The UI-UP were originated predominantly by Escherichia coli, Candida albicans and Enterococcus faecalis. A. baumannii and E. coli have increased their resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin or cefotaxime, respectively, in the last year controlled. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated rates persist in all the infections controlled, without change in the etiology and increase of resistance of gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Sputum bacteriology in hospitalized patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in Taiwan with an emphasis on Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Bacterial infection is one of the major causes of acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD). This study was undertaken to investigate the microbiology of AECOPD. METHODS: Medical records from 494 episodes of AECOPD in patients admitted to the National Taiwan University Hospital from January 2000 to June 2004 were reviewed. Severity of COPD was classified according to the 2003 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease guideline. RESULTS: Potential pathogenic microorganisms were isolated from patients in 328 (66.4%) episodes of AECOPD. The predominant bacteria were Klebsiella pneumoniae (19.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (16.8%) and Haemophilus influenzae (7.5%), followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (6.9%), Enterobacter species (6.1%) and Staphylococcus aureus (6.1%). The incidence of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 2.4%. Spirometry results obtained within 1 year of the exacerbation were available in 186 cases. K. pneumoniae was more frequently isolated in stage I COPD (39.1%) than stage II (16.6%), III (13.8%) and IV (9.4%). No glucose non-fermentative Gram-negative bacilli were isolated in stage I patients. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that P. aeruginosa (odds ratio (OR) 3.19; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.21-8.38), intubation (OR 14.81; 95% CI: 5.08-43.12) and age (OR 1.1; 95% CI: 1.03-1.17) were independent risk factors for mortality. CONCLUSIONS: Klebsiella pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa are the most common sputum pathogens in hospitalized patients with AECOPD in Taiwan, with the former being more commonly isolated from mild COPD and the latter associated with poor clinical outcome. These results should be considered when deciding which antibiotics should initially be used to treat patients with AECOPD.
TI  - Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by multiresistant bacteria.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The inappropriate choice of antibiotics (in nearly one third of episodes) is the most important risk factor for death. Traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for subsequent use. RECENT FINDINGS: As multidrug resistance increases in the intensive care unit in patients treated for nosocomial pneumonia, costs, mortality, and morbidity are rising. Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii are frequently considered together, they have different virulence, risk factors and susceptibilities, requiring different antimicrobial choices. Assessment of clinical resolution should be differentiated in the presence of acute lung injury. In the absence of biochemical markers, oxygenation and core temperature should guide therapeutic decisions. SUMMARY: As ventilator-associated pneumonia increases, empiric therapy should be based on local pathogen etiology and antibiotic resistant patterns. A new approach to consider is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results and clinical resolution. With the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics available in empiric therapy tailored after reassessment of the patient, there is hope for reducing costs, length of stay and mortality whereas the emergence of resistance will be minimized.
TI  - [Antimicrobial resistance surveillance: VIRA STUDY 2006].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of this study was to determine the current antimicrobial susceptibility patterns of the most frequent multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the two VIRA studies carried out in 2001 and 2004. METHODS: In February 2006, the 40 participating hospitals sent the following microorganisms: non-penicillin-susceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae (92), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) (290), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (136), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (67), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (365), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (181), and Acinetobacter baumannii (92). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Susceptibility was determined with a broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the non-penicillin-susceptible S. pneumoniae isolates, the proportion of those ones resistant to this antibiotic showed a significant (p < 0.001) decrease (59.8% in 2001, 30.2% in 2004 and 14.3% in 2006). Among MRSA, we detected one isolate nonsusceptible to linezolid, four resistant to quinupristin-dalfopristin and one strain with a vancomycin MIC of 4 microg/mL. The prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli was 12.1%. Resistance of A. baumannii to imipenem varied from 27% in the 2001-2004 period to 47.8% in 2006 (p < 0.005). CONCLUSION: These results again emphasize that resistance surveillance systems are an important tool for preventing the emergence and spread of multi-resistant pathogens.
TI  - [The clinical features of postoperative ventilator-associated pneumonia after lung surgery].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical features of postoperative ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) after lung surgery. METHODS: Of 104 patients who had undergone lung surgery and been treated with ventilator in our surgical intensive care unit between January 2003 and March 2005, 35 patients met with the criteria of both VAP and postoperative pneumonia (POP), and 41 cases had no evidences of pneumonia. The clinical and laboratory data of all 76 cases were recorded and analyzed by a statistical software package (SPSS). RESULTS: The diagnosis of postoperative VAP was established clinically in 35 patients (46.1%), and etiologically in 33 cases. Compared to the patients without postoperative VAP, the patients with postoperative VAP had a significantly longer mean interval between intubation and operation [(2.7 +/- 2.9) days vs. (1.6 +/- 1.7) days, P = 0.039], a longer duration of mechanical ventilation [(32.2 +/- 37.7) days vs. (4.2 +/- 2.9) days, P < 0.001], and higher morbidity (20.0% vs. 2.4%, P = 0.013). There was a significant difference in mean duration of mechanical ventilation between the 15 cases of early-onset VAP and 20 cases of late-onset VAP (17 +/- 15 days vs. 43 +/- 46 days, P = 0.042). Among the initially detected pathogen, Staphylococcus aureus remains the most common Gram-positive coccus whereas Acinetobacter Baumannii took the place of Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the top Gram-negative rod. CONCLUSION: Postoperative VAP after lung surgery has different clinical features from VAP in medical ICU.
TI  - Antiviral and antimicrobial assessment of some selected flavonoids.
AB  - In the current study, the results of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral activity tests of four flavonoid derivatives, scandenone (1), tiliroside (2), quercetin-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (3), and kaempferol-3,7-O-alpha-L-dirhamnoside (4), are presented. Antibacterial and antifungal activities of these compounds were tested against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, and Enterococcus faecalis, as well as the fungus Candida albicans by a micro-dilution method. On the other hand, both DNA virus Herpes simplex (HSV) and RNA virus Parainfluenza-3 (PI-3) were employed for antiviral assessment of the compounds using Madin-Darby bovine kidney and Vero cell lines. According to our data, all of the compounds tested were found to be quite active against S. aureus and E. faecalis with MIC values of 0.5 microg/ml, followed by E. coli (2 microg/ml), K. pneumoniae (4 microg/ml), A. baumannii (8 micro/g/ml), and B. subtilis (8 microg/ml), while they inhibited C. albicans at 1 microg/ml as potent as ketoconazole. However, only compound 3 displayed an antiviral effect towards PI-3 in the range of 8-32 microg/ml of inhibitory concentration for cytopathogenic effect (CPE).
TI  - Tigecycline: a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - Tigecycline is a new glycyclcycline antimicrobial recently approved for use in the USA, Europe and elsewhere. While related to the tetracyclines, tigecycline overcomes many of the mechanisms responsible for resistance to this class. It demonstrates favourable in vitro potency against a variety of aerobic and anaerobic Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including those frequently demonstrating resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials. This includes methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii, beta-lactamase producing strains of Haemophilis influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. In contrast, minimum inhibitory concentrations for Pseudomonas and Proteus spp. are markedly elevated. Tigecycline is administered parenterally twice daily. Randomised, controlled trials have demonstrated that tigecycline is non-inferior to the comparators for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections, as well as complicated intra-abdominal infections. The most frequent and problematic side effect associated with its administration to date has been nausea and/or vomiting.
TI  - Bacterial contamination of health care workers' pagers and the efficacy of various disinfecting agents.
AB  - Health care workers in our facility were surveyed, and their pagers were cultured before and after disinfection with various agents. All pagers were contaminated with bacteria, including the pathogens Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella spp. and methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Disinfection reduced bacterial contamination. No risk factors for pager contamination with pathogens were identified.
TI  - Patterns of antimicrobial resistance in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Turkey.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Several studies have reported higher rates of antimicrobial resistance among isolates from intensive care units than among isolates from general patient-care areas. The aims of this study were to review the pathogens associated with nosocomial infections in a surgical intensive care unit of a university hospital in Turkey and to summarize rates of antimicrobial resistance in the most common pathogens. The survey was conducted over a period of twelve months in a tertiary-care teaching hospital located in the south-eastern part of Turkey, Gaziantep. A total of 871 clinical specimens from 615 adult patients were collected. From 871 clinical specimens 771 bacterial and fungal isolates were identified. RESULTS: Most commonly isolated microorganisms were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), Candida species (15%) and Staphylococcus aureus (12.9%). Among the Gram-negative microorganisms P. aeruginosa were mostly resistant to third-generation cephalosporins (71.3-98.1%), while Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant in all cases to piperacillin, ceftazidime and ceftriaxone. Isolates of S. aureus were mostly resistant to penicillin, ampicillin, and methicillin (82-95%), whereas coagulase-negative staphylococci were 98.6% resistant to methicillin and in all cases resistant to ampicillin and tetracycline. CONCLUSION: In order to reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens in ICUs, monitoring and optimization of antimicrobial use in hospitals are strictly recommended. Therefore local resistance surveillance programs are of most value in developing appropriate therapeutic guidelines for specific infections and patient types.
TI  - Efficacy of super-oxidized water fogging in environmental decontamination.
AB  - The efficacy of decontamination using Sterilox fog was assessed against meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii. Ceramic tiles were inoculated with the test organisms and, once dried, were subjected to Sterilox fogging using a stationary vaporizing machine sited at a distance of 3m for 10 min and then left for a further hour. In a second experiment using the same organisms, the first 10-min fogging period was followed by a directed fogging period of 30s at a distance of 1m. Organisms were cultured from the tiles, plated on to tryptone soya agar and incubated for 48 h. Initial counts of approximately 10(9) colony-forming units/mL for both organisms were reduced approximately 10(4) fold for MRSA and 10(5.8) fold for A. baumannii when using a single fogging. The second fogging resulted in 10(6.8)-fold reductions for both organisms. Sterilox fog is safe and simple to use, and can reduce levels of nosocomial pathogens by a factor of almost 10(7). It is worthy of clinical evaluation in clinical settings to determine whether it maintains its microbicidal effects against a variety of organisms on different surfaces.
TI  - Bacteria recovered from patients admitted to a deployed U.S. military hospital in Baghdad, Iraq.
AB  - The predominant bacteria and antimicrobial susceptibilities were surveyed from a  deployed, military, tertiary care facility in Baghdad, Iraq, serving U.S. troops, coalition forces, and Iraqis, from August 2003 through July 2004. We included cultures of blood, wounds, sputum, and urine, for a total of 908 cultures; 176 of these were obtained from U.S. troops. The bacteria most commonly isolated from U.S. troops were coagulase-negative staphylococci, accounting for 34% of isolates, Staphylococcus aureus (26%), and streptococcal species (11%). The 732 cultures obtained from the predominantly Iraqi population were Klebsiella pneumoniae (13%), Acinetobacter baumannii (11%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%); coagulase-negative staphylococci represented 21% of these isolates. These differences in prevalence were all statistically significant, when compared in chi2 analyses (p < 0.05). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing demonstrated broad resistance among the Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.
TI  - Multiple-drug-resistant bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Prevalence, risk factors, and outcome.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine prevalence, risk factors, and effect on outcome of multiple-drug-resistant (MDR) bacteria in patients with severe acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. DESIGN: Prospective, observational, cohort study. SETTING: Thirty-bed medical intensive care unit (ICU) in a university hospital. METHODS: All chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with acute exacerbation who required intubation and mechanical ventilation for >48 hrs were eligible during a 4-yr period. Patients with pneumonia or other causes of acute respiratory failure were not eligible. In all patients, quantitative tracheal aspirate was performed at ICU admission (positive at 10 colony-forming units [cfu]/mL). MDR bacteria were defined as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, ceftazidime- or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. All patients received empirical antibiotic treatment at ICU admission. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine variables associated with MDR bacteria and variables associated with ICU mortality. RESULTS: A total of 857 patients were included, and 304 bacteria were isolated (>/=10 cfu/mL) in 260 patients (30%), including 75 MDR bacteria (24%) in 69 patients (8%). When patients with MDR bacteria were compared with patients without MDR bacteria, previous antimicrobial treatment (odds ratio [OR], 2.4; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.2-4.7; p = .013) and previous intubation (OR, 31; 95% CI, 12-82; p < .001) were independently associated with MDR bacteria. When patients with bacteria other than MDR or patients with no bacteria were used as a reference group, these risk factors were still independently associated with MDR bacteria. Although ICU mortality rate was higher in patients with MDR bacteria than in patients without MDR bacteria (44% vs. 25%; p = .001; OR, 2.3; 95% CI, 1.4-3.8), MDR bacteria were not independently associated with ICU mortality. Inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment (88% vs. 5%; p = <.001; OR, 6.7; 95% CI, 3.8-12) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (23% vs. 5%; p = <.001; OR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1-1.8) rates were significantly higher in patients with MDR bacteria than in patients with bacteria other than MDR. Inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment was independently associated with increased ICU mortality (OR, 7.1; 95% CI, 1.9-30; p = .003). CONCLUSION: MDR bacteria are common in patients with acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Previous antimicrobial treatment and previous intubation are independent risk factors for MDR bacteria. Although MDR bacteria are not independently associated with ICU mortality, inappropriate initial antibiotic treatment is an independent risk factor for ICU mortality in these patients. Further studies are needed to determine whether broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment is cost-effective in these patients.
TI  - Treatment options for multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - As a consequence of antibiotic overuse and misuse, nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria represent a physician's nightmare throughout the world. No newer antimicrobials active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the main multidrug-resistant nosocomial pathogen, are available or under investigation. The only exceptions are linezolid, some newer glycopeptides (dalbavancin, oritavancin and telavancin) and daptomycin (a lipopeptide), which are active against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) strains, as well as tigecycline, a potent in vitro glycylcycline against MRSA, VRE, Acinetobacter baumannii and entended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)+ Enterobacteriaceae. Colistin, an antibiotic of the 1950s has been rediscovered by intensive care unit physicians for use against ESBL+ Enterobacteriaceae, as well as against multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii isolates. Although success rates with colistin range between 50 and 73%, almost all studies are retrospective. Immunostimulation efforts against S. aureus are still under development. As antibiotic research and development stagnate, rational policies for prescribing existing antibiotics plus strict infection control are the current mainstay efforts for preventing and combating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility among pathogens collected from hospitalized patients in the United States and in vitro activity of tigecycline, a new glycylcycline antimicrobial.
AB  - The activities of tigecycline and comparators against isolates collected from 76  U.S. centers between January 2004 and September 2005 were assessed. Tigecycline MIC(90)s were < or =2 microg/ml for Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerogenes, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, Enterococcus faecium, and Streptococcus agalactiae.
TI  - Using local microbiologic data to develop institution-specific guidelines for the treatment of hospital-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - BACKGROUND: While current guidelines recommend consideration of local microbiologic data when selecting empiric treatment for hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP), few specifics of how to do this have been offered. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of HAP pathogens in 111 consecutive patients who acquired HAP during July to December 2004 and had a corresponding positive culture finding for a bacterial pathogen. These data were used to develop institution-specific guidelines. RESULTS: The most common bacteria identified were Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which were associated with 38%, 25%, and 19% of pneumonias, respectively. Susceptibility of Gram-negative bacteria to piperacillin-tazobactam and cefepime was 80% and 81%, respectively. The isolation of organisms resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime was significantly more frequent in patients who had been hospitalized > or = 10 days. Of Gram-negative isolates resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam or cefepime, ciprofloxacin was active against < 10%, while amikacin was active against > 80%. New treatment guidelines were developed that divided the American Thoracic Society/Infectious Diseases Society of America "late onset/risk of multidrug-resistant pathogens" group of patients into two subcategories: "early-late" pneumonias (< 10 days of hospitalization) and "late-late" pneumonias (> or = 10 days of hospitalization). Guideline-directed treatment regimens would be predicted to provide adequate initial therapy for > 90% of late-onset pneumonias at our institution. CONCLUSIONS: Current guidelines suggest adding either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone to beta-lactam therapy for empiric Gram-negative coverage. However, in our institution, adding ciprofloxacin would not appreciably enhance the likelihood of providing initial appropriate antibiotic coverage. This underscores the importance of employing a systematic analysis of local data when developing treatment guidelines.
TI  - Visible-light-induced bactericidal activity of a nitrogen-doped titanium photocatalyst against human pathogens.
AB  - The antibacterial activity of photocatalytic titanium dioxide (TiO(2)) substrates is induced primarily by UV light irradiation. Recently, nitrogen- and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates were shown to exhibit photocatalytic activities under visible-light illumination. Their antibacterial activity, however, remains to be quantified. In this study, we demonstrated that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates have superior visible-light-induced bactericidal activity against Escherichia coli compared to pure TiO(2) and carbon-doped TiO(2) substrates. We also found that protein- and light-absorbing contaminants partially reduce the bactericidal activity of nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates due to their light-shielding effects. In the pathogen-killing experiment, a significantly higher proportion of all tested pathogens, including Shigella flexneri, Listeria monocytogenes, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Acinetobacter baumannii, were killed by visible-light-illuminated nitrogen-doped TiO(2) substrates than by pure TiO(2) substrates. These findings suggest that nitrogen-doped TiO(2) has potential application in the development of alternative disinfectants for environmental and medical usages.
TI  - Microbiology of postoperative infections.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surgical infections, accounting for approximately one quarter of all  nosocomial infections, contribute to longer hospital stays and higher medical costs. Clinical failure of antibiotic treatment often is associated with increasing drug resistance. METHODS: Non-duplicated microbial isolates obtained at our institution from surgical patients were identified and tested for antimicrobial susceptibility using the Sceptor system in 2001-2002 and the Phoenix system in 2003-2005. Epidemiologic data were extracted using Epicenter and Powerlab. During selected periods, genetic and biochemical characterization was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, colony blot hybridization, gene amplification and sequencing, isoelectric focusing, and enzyme kinetics. RESULTS: The specimens were most commonly isolated from infections at surgical sites (24.0%), the urinary tract (19.0%), and blood stream (10.6%). Isolates of Escherichia coli showed an increasing prevalence of resistance to penicillins, third-generation cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, and gentamicin, whereas the prevalence of resistant Staphylococcus aureus generally declined. Highly aggressive multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains were widespread, although colistin remained effective in 100% of cases. A significant increase was seen in infections attributable to S. epidermidis and Candida albicans. The overall number of Enterobacteriaceae carrying extended-spectrum beta-lactamases increased continuously, and new resistance traits emerged. It appeared that the TEM-92 determinant moved from Enterobacteriaceae to nonfermenting gram-negative rods such as Acinetobacter baumannii. CONCLUSION: The number and type of antimicrobial-resistance determinants are increasing.
TI  - Bacillus spp. among hospitalized patients with haematological malignancies: clinical features, epidemics and outcomes.
AB  - Between April 2000 and May 2005, 350 bacteraemic episodes occurred among patients treated in our haematology unit. Two hundred and twenty-eight of these episodes were caused by Gram-positive pathogens, most commonly coagulase-negative staphylococci and Staphylococcus aureus. One hundred and twenty-two episodes were due to Gram-negative pathogens, with a predominance of Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bacillus bacteraemias constituted 12 of these episodes occurring in 12 patients, and accounted for 3.4% of all bacteraemic episodes. Of the 12 strains evaluated, seven were Bacillus licheniformis, three were Bacillus cereus and two were Bacillus pumilus. Seven episodes presented with bloodstream infection, three with pneumonia, one with severe abdominal pain and deterioration of liver function, and one with a catheter-related bloodstream infection. B. licheniformis was isolated from five patients who had been hospitalized at the same time. This outbreak was related to non-sterile cotton wool used during skin disinfection. B. cereus and B. licheniformis isolates were susceptible to cefepime, carbapenems, aminoglycosides and vancomycin, but B. pumilus isolates were resistant to all antibiotics except for quinolones and vancomycin. Two deaths were observed. In conclusion, Bacillus spp. may cause serious infections, diagnostic and therapeutic dilemmas, and high morbidity and mortality in patients with haematological malignancies. Both B. cereus and B. licheniformis may be among the 'new' Gram-positive pathogens to cause serious infection in patients with neutropenia.
TI  - [Preventing nosocomial infections. Dressings soaked in polyhexamethylene biguanide (PHMB)].
AB  - Polyhexamethlene biguanide (PHMB) is an antibacterial agent included in the chlorhexidine group which is active against a wide number of microorganisms including Staphylococcus Aureus Methycilin Resistant (MRSA), Vancomycin Resistant Enterococcus Faecalis (VRE) and Acinetobacter baumannii which all cause antibiotic-resistant infections. Traditionally gauze dressings have been used to cover and protect wounds although their porous structure does not constitute an efficient barrier against bacterial penetration, especially when a dressing becomes wet due to the effects of a wound oozing and draining. Recently the use of a dressing soaked in a 0.2% PHMB solution which works as a biological barrier against pathogenic agents has been introduced in clinical practice. On the one hand, this PHMB soaked dressing inhibits bacterial growth in the areas where it is applied and, on the other hand, it prevents the penetration of microorganisms through the dressing itself. Simultaneously while a PHMB soaked dressing carries out these actions, it creates an environment favorable to the proliferation of the normal flora found in the epidermis. As opposed to porous gauze dressings, a PHMB dressing remains active during 72 hours even in wet environs. Its wide anti-micro-bacterial range prevents infections in surgical, acute or chronic wounds and in any type of intra-corporal access susceptible to infection, such as by means of intravascular catheters, tracheotomies, or thoracic tubes. A PHMB dressing can also be used as a primary covering to treat a chronic wound since it does not interfere in the process of tissue reepithelization.
TI  - Culture-proven bacterial meningitis in elderly patients in southern Taiwan: clinical characteristics and prognostic factors.
AB  - The epidemiologic landscape of causative pathogens and clinical characteristics of bacterial meningitis varies with several clinical factors including preceding/pre-existent medical and/or surgical conditions, modes of contraction, geographic distributions, status of vaccinations, the study time periods and differences among age groups. In order to delineate the epidemiology of bacterial meningitis in senior adults (ages > or =60 y/o) in southern Taiwan, we analyzed the clinical characteristics and therapeutic outcomes of 64 senior adults (42 men and 22 women, aged 60-80 years) with bacterial meningitis collected over a period of 13 years at our hospital. The prognostic factors between fatal and non-fatal groups of patients were compared. Twenty-seven of the 64 patients belonged to a nosocomial infection group, and the other 37 comprised a community-acquired infection group. Sixty percent (39/64) of the patients had a post-neurosurgical state as the most preceding event prior to infection. Liver disease (13) and diabetes mellitus (6) were the most common underlying conditions of the other 25 patients with spontaneous meningitis. Of these 64 patients, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae (18), Acinetobacter baumannii (5), Escherichia coli (5), and Enterobacter species (5) were the most commonly implicated Gram-negative pathogens. Staphylococcus (S.) aureus infection was increasing during the study period. The therapeutic results of this group of patients showed a mortality rate of 38% (24/64). The presence of septic shock was the most significant prognostic factor. In conclusion, for this study group, a post-neurosurgical state was the single most important preceding event for senior adults developing bacterial meningitis. Of the implicated pathogens, K. pneumoniae and S. aureus were the most common gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens, respectively. The therapeutic result of this specific group of patients showed a high mortality rate; however, the small case number and possible bias of case selection have limited the analytical conclusions of this study.
TI  - Tigecycline: first of a new class of antimicrobial agents.
AB  - Tigecycline is the first commercially available member of the glycylcyclines, a new class of antimicrobial agents. The glycylcyclines are derivatives of the tetracycline antibiotics, with structural modifications that allow for potent gram-positive, gram-negative, and anaerobic activity, including certain multidrug-resistant strains. The enhanced activity can be attributed to stronger binding affinity and enhanced protection against several mechanisms of resistance that affect other antibiotic classes such as tetracyclines. Tigecycline exhibits generally bacteriostatic action by reversibly binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit and inhibiting protein translation. In vitro activity has been demonstrated against multidrug-resistant gram-positive pathogens including methicillin-resistant and glycopeptide-intermediate and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, as well as vancomycin-resistant enterococci. Multidrug-resistant gram-negative pathogens, such as Acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, are typically highly susceptible to tigecycline. The drug also has displayed significant activity against many clinically important anaerobic organisms. This agent demonstrates a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and minimal drug interactions, and is generally well tolerated, with nausea being the most common adverse event. It was approved in June 2005 for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs) and complicated intraabdominal infections. Currently, a limited number of broad-spectrum antimicrobials are available to combat multidrug-resistant organisms. The addition of new agents is essential to limiting the spread of these pathogens and improving outcomes in patients with these types of infections. Tigecycline has demonstrated promising results in initial in vitro and clinical studies for SSSIs and complicated intraabdominal infections; however, further clinical experience will clarify its role as a broad-spectrum agent.
TI  - [Nosocomial pneumonia due to Acinetobacter baumannii].
AB  - Acinetobacter baumannii is a significant cause of nosocomial pneumonia, especially late ventilator-associated pneumonia. In Spain, A. baumannii is the third leading pathogen after Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus. Risk factors for pneumonia due to A. baumannii are head injury, neurosurgery, acute respiratory distress syndrome, aspiration, and previous antibiotic therapy. Definitive diagnosis requires respiratory samples and invasive techniques with quantitative cultures to differentiate true infections from simple colonizations. The crude mortality of patients with ventilator-associated A. baumannii pneumonia is high, although the attributable mortality is controversial. Adequate empirical antimicrobial therapy of A. baumannii pneumonia is a protective factor, even though the therapeutic options are often limited. The treatment of choice is imipenem and sulbactam may be considered an acceptable alternative. Nowadays, colistin is the treatment of choice in A. baumannii pneumonia caused by panresistant strains. The associations of imipenem and rifampin or imipenem and sulbactam may be acceptable alternatives to colistin in infections caused by these strains. Surveillance measures are essential to eradicate this multidrug-resistant pathogen in outbreaks and reduce the number of episodes in endemic situations. Although these measures are important throughout the hospital, intensive care units are especially high-risk areas.
TI  - [Pathogenesis and environmental factors in ventilator-associated pneumonia].
AB  - Respiratory infections in intubated patients can derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. The major route for acquiring endemic ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is oropharyngeal colonization by endogenous flora and leakage of contaminated secretions into the lower respiratory tract. However, a not inconsiderable percentage of VAP results from exogenous nosocomial colonization, especially pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as by Legionella spp or filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus. This article reviews the pathogenesis of VAP and the role of the intensive care environment as a source of pathogenic microorganisms.
TI  - Results of gastroscope bacterial decontamination by enzymatic detergent compared  to chlorhexidine.
AB  - AIM: To compare the efficacy of enzymatic detergent with chlorhexidine for gastroscope bacterial decontamination. METHODS: A prospective randomized controlled study was undertaken to evaluate the ability of these 2 agents to achieve high level disinfection in a gastroscope. A total of 260 samples were collected from 5 different gastroscopes. Manual cleaning was done for 10 min with these 2 agents separately (n = 130 each). Then all specimens underwent 2% glutaraldehyde soaking for 20 min. After 70% alcohol was rinsed, sterile normal saline was flushed into each gastroscope channel and 40 mL of sample was collected. The sample was sent for aerobic bacterial culture after membrane was filtered. A colony count greater than 200 cfu/mL was considered significant. RESULTS: The positive culture rate was 4.6% in the enzymatic detergent arm and 3.1% in the chlorhexidine arm. Pseudomonas species were the main organism detected from both groups (60%). Multiple organisms were found from 4 specimens (enzymatic detergent arm = 1, chlorhexidine arm = 3). CONCLUSION: The contamination rate of both types of cleaning solution is equivalent.
TI  - Comparison of antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro with  those of propofol and midazolam.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to investigate the antimicrobial effects of dexmedetomidine and etomidate-lipuro, and to compare these effects with those of midazolam and propofol on Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeroginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase Escherichia coli ( E. coli ESBL). METHODS: All hypnotic dilutions were exposed to micro-organisms for 0, 30, 60, 120 and 240 min at room temperature in vitro. The inoculums taken from diluted suspensions were re-inoculated on blood agar and incubated for 18-24 h at 35 degrees C after which a count of the colonies was compared. RESULTS: Midazolam reduced the viable cells of S. aureus at 30, 60, 120 and 240 min, and also completely inhibited the growth of E. coli, P. aeroginosa, A. baumannii and E. coli ESBL. Dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro and propofol, however, did not inhibit any of the micro-organisms tested. CONCLUSION: In vitro, midazolam had an antimicrobial effect on E. coli, P. aeroginosa, A. baumannii and E. coli ESBL. Like propofol and dexmedetomidine, etomidate-lipuro had no antimicrobial effect on any of the micro-organisms tested.
TI  - Are therapeutic ultrasound units a potential vector for nosocomial infection?
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Nosocomial infections present a widespread problem in today's healthcare environment, with a significant number of patients acquiring an infection annually. With the contemporary transition of immunocompromised and high-risk patients to community-based care, therapeutic ultrasound has the potential to be a vector of infection in the physiotherapy setting. The purpose of the present study was to determine the degree of contamination on therapeutic ultrasound transducer heads and ultrasound gel after routine clinical use, and to evaluate the efficacy of recommended infection control procedures. METHOD: The study consisted of two phases. Using a prospective cross-sectional design, microbiological cultures were obtained from 44 transducer heads and 43 gels. Subjects were drawn from a variety of physiotherapy practice settings. All samples containing more than five colony forming units per cm2 were considered contaminated. Following these measurements, a repeated-measures design was used to re-evaluate the 44 transducer heads for the amount and type of bacteria present after cleaning with a 70% alcohol wipe. RESULTS: Twenty-seven per cent of transducer heads and 28% of gels were contaminated. Transducer heads showed fairly low levels of contamination across the sample, with the majority of organisms isolated found in normal skin and environmental flora. Gels were heavily contaminated with opportunistic and potentially pathogenic organisms, including Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and Rhodotorula mucilaginosa. No multi-resistant organisms were identified. Cleaning with 70% alcohol significantly reduced the level of contamination on transducer heads (p < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Therapeutic ultrasound equipment is a potential vector for nosocomial infection in physiotherapy patients. The risk of infection from transducer heads can be effectively removed by cleaning with 70% alcohol between patients. Further research into possible strategies to reduce the risk of infection from ultrasound gels is needed.
TI  - Acquisition of multidrug-resistant organisms among hospital patients hospitalized in beds adjacent to critically ill patients.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess whether patients hospitalized in beds physically adjacent to critically ill patients are at increased risk to acquire multidrug-resistant pathogens. DESIGN: Cohort study.Setting. Shaare Zedek Medical Center, a 550-bed medical referral center. PATIENTS: From April to September 2004, we enrolled consecutive newly admitted patients who were hospitalized in beds adjacent to either mechanically ventilated patients or patients designated as "do not resuscitate" (DNR). For each of these patients, we also enrolled a control patient who was not hospitalized in a bed adjacent to a critically ill patient. We collected specimens from the anterior nares, the oral cavity, and the perianal zone at the time of admission and subsequently at 3-day intervals until discharge or death. Specimens were cultured on selective media to detect growth of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including Acinetobacter baumannii, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). RESULTS: We enrolled 46 neighbor-control pairs. Among neighbors and controls, respectively, the incidence rates for isolation of A. baumannii was 8.3 and 4 isolations per 100 patient-days (relative risk [RR], 2.1 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 0.8-5.2]; P=.12), the incidence rates for MRSA were 1.4 and 2.6 isolations per 100 patient-days (RR, 0.6 [95% CI, 0.1-2.3]; P=.45), the incidence rates for ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae were 10.5 and 9 isolations per 100 patient-days (RR, 1.2 [95% CI, 0.6-2.4]; P=.84), the incidence rates for VRE were 4.3 and 4.8 isolations per 100 patient-days (RR, 0.9 [95% CI, 0.3-2.4]; P=1), and the composite incidence rate was 21.7 and 16.2 isolations per 100 patient-days (RR, 1.3 [95% CI, 0.8-2.3]; P=0.3). CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we did not detect an increased incidence rate of isolation of multidrug-resistant pathogens among patients hospitalized in beds adjacent to critically ill patients. Further studies with larger samples should be conducted in order to generate valid data and provide patients, physicians, and policy makers with a sufficient knowledge base from which decisions can be made.
TI  - Antibacterial evaluation of a collection of norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin derivatives against multiresistant bacteria.
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyse an array of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin derivatives in order to determine those with good activity against bacteria that already present fluoroquinolone resistance associated with mutations in the gyrA and/or parC genes. Four norfloxacin and 20 ciprofloxacin derivatives were synthesised and tested against quinolone-susceptible and -resistant Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and Staphylococcus aureus strains using a microdilution test. Among the derivatives, the 4-methyl-7-piperazine ciprofloxacin derivative showed a minimum inhibitory concentration for 50% of the organisms that was 16- and 8-fold lower than ciprofloxacin for A. baumannii and S. maltophilia, respectively. When the methyl group at position 4 in the piperazine ring was substituted by ethyl, butyl or heptyl groups, activity against A. baumannii steadily decreased. The 7-(4-methyl)-piperazine ciprofloxacin derivative (UB-8902) showed very good activity against these multiresistant microorganisms including A. baumannii and S. maltophilia.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of catheter-related infections in paediatric oncology: an update.
AB  - Otherwise unexplained clinical signs of infection in patients with long-term tunnelled or totally implanted central venous access devices (CVADs) are suspected to be CVAD-associated. Diagnostic methods include catheter swabs, blood cultures and cultures of the catheter tip or port reservoir. In the case of a suspected CVAD-related bloodstream infection in paediatric oncology patients, in-situ treatment without prompt removal of the device can be attempted. Removal of the CVAD should be considered if bacteraemia persists or relapses > or = 72 h after the initiation of (in-vitro effective) antibacterial therapy administered through the line. Timely removal of the device is also recommended if the patient suffers from a complicated infection, or if Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Candida spp. are isolated from blood cultures. Duration of therapy depends on the immunological recovery of the patient, the pathogen isolated and the presence of related complications, such as thrombosis, pneumonia, endocarditis and osteomyelitis. Antibiotic lock techniques in addition to systemic treatment are beneficial for Gram-positive infections. Although prospectively controlled studies are lacking, the concomitant use of urokinase locks and taurolidine secondary prophylaxis seem to favour catheter salvage.
TI  - Pasteurization is effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and rapid spread of multidrug-resistant isolates causing nosocomial infections, particularly pandrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, pandrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are of great concern worldwide. METHODS: This study investigated the efficacy of pasteurization against contamination of culture tubes and plastic bags by the above 4 important multidrug-resistant bacteria. A 5-mL bacterial suspension with approximately 10(5) and 10(9) cfu/mL of each organism was inoculated into 3 sets of plastic bags and culture tubes and subjected to pasteurization in a washer at 75 degrees C for 30 minutes. RESULTS: A nearly total eradication was found after pasteurization of these 4 drug-resistant pathogens. CONCLUSION: Pasteurization was highly effective against drug-resistant bacteria. Strict adherence to appropriate infection control management for respiratory circuits is important for reducing the spread of drug-resistant bacteria among ventilator-assisted patients.
TI  - Broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, toxicologic assessment, and materials compatibility of a new generation of accelerated hydrogen peroxide-based environmental surface disinfectant.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns on human and environmental safety and label claims of many microbicides point to the need for safer, faster acting, and broad-spectrum substitutes. ACCEL TB, a 0.5% accelerated H(2)O(2) (AHP)-based disinfectant described here, is a potential candidate. METHODS: ACCEL TB was tested for its broad-spectrum microbicidal activity, safety and materials compatibility using internationally accepted protocols. Activity against bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and Salmonella choleraesuis) was tested with the AOAC use-dilution method and the first tier of a quantitative carrier test (QCT-1). Mycobactericidal activity was tested against Mycobacterium bovis and Mycobacterium terrae using a quantitative suspension test (QST) and QCT-1, respectively. Fungicidal activity (Trichophyton mentagrophytes) was determined with the AOAC test and QCT-1. Activity against several enveloped and nonenveloped viruses was evaluated using the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method No. E-1053. Sanitizing action was tested against 7 types of vegetative bacteria with method No. DIS/TSS-10. All microbicidal tests contained an added soil load; in all AOAC tests, it was 5% fetal bovine serum, and, in QCT-1, a mixture of 3 types of proteins in phosphate buffer was used instead. The methods to test for acute oral, dermal, inhalation toxicities, and dermal and eye irritation as well as skin sensitization complied with the requirements of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the US Environmental Protection Agency (OPPTS 870). Standard methods were also used to test compatibility with metals and plastics. RESULTS: At 20 degrees C, the full-strength product was bactericidal and virucidal in 1 minute and mycobactericidal and fungicidal in 5 minutes. It was nonirritating to skin and eyes. The acute oral LD(50) (lethal dose 50%) was >5000 mg/kg. It was compatible with 12 types of plastic and 3 out of 4 metals. CONCLUSION: The tested formulation showed a high safety and materials compatibility profile in addition to being a fast acting, intermediate-level disinfectant.
TI  - Predominance of Gram-negative bacilli and increasing antimicrobial resistance in  nosocomial bloodstream infections at a university hospital in southern Taiwan, 1996-2003.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: While nosocomial infections cause substantial morbidity and mortality, the availability of timely and accurate epidemiological information on nosocomial pathogens is essential to the appropriate selection of empirical therapy. This study analyzed nosocomial bloodstream infections (NBSIs) surveillance data to determine trends in the distribution of pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibilities of these pathogens. METHODS: During the period from 1996 to 2003 at National Cheng Kung University Hospital, patients with NBSIs were enrolled in the study, and the ranking of pathogens and status of antimicrobial resistance were determined. RESULTS: From 1996 to 2003, there were 4,038 episodes of NBSIs. The overall incidence was 1.79 episodes per 1,000 inpatient-days. Aerobic Gram-negative bacilli, Gram-positive cocci, fungi, and anaerobes were responsible for 51%, 37%, 10%, and 1.6% of NBSIs, respectively. The 5 leading pathogens were coagulase-negative staphylococci (16% of NBSIs), Staphylococcus aureus (13%), Candida spp. (10%), Acinetobacter baumannii (8%), and Escherichia coli (8%). Oxacillin resistance was found in 90% of coagulase-negative staphylococci and 75% of S. aureus isolates. In contrast to Enterococcus faecalis, in which only 1% of isolates were resistant to ampicillin, 78% of Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to ampicillin. The emerging antimicrobial-resistant Gram-negative pathogens included multidrug-resistant A. baumannii, cephalosporin- or fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli. Despite the annual increase in the use of fluconazole, Candida albicans (54%) remained the most common causative pathogen of nosocomial candidemia. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, Gram-negative bacilli predominated among pathogens causing NBSIs and an upsurge in the threat of antimicrobial resistance in our hospital occurred during the 8-year period. Surveillance of the characteristics of NBSIs and antimicrobial resistance patterns, together with appropriate antibiotic and infection control measures, should be reinforced.
TI  - Multicenter pilot survey of resistant bacteria in the Mediterranean area.
AB  - With the aim of testing the feasibility of a multiresistant bacteria (MRB) surveillance methodology and evaluating the level of antimicrobial resistance and dissemination of resistant pathogens in the Mediterranean area, a pilot study was carried out in nine university hospitals in Algeria, Tunisia and France. The results indicate that third-generation cephalosporin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae comprise the major MRB in Algerian and Tunisian hospitals. In France, the highest incidence rates were found for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, while in Tunisian hospitals, imipenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii seems to be a particularly prevalent organism. Although the data were not representative of the participating countries as a whole, the results show the importance and ubiquity of the problem in the area and the feasibility of surveillance.
TI  - [The relationship between airborne colonization and nosocomial infections in intensive care units].
AB  - The relationship between the airborne contaminants obtained from operating theatres and intensive care units and the colonizing and infecting microorganisms isolated from patients were investigated. Air samples were obtained with the biocollector air IDEAL (BioMerieux, France). During the study period (19 weeks), a total of 77 air samples and 870 clinical specimens (swabs from throat, nose, conjunctiva and skin) from 174 patients were collected weekly. Microorganisms were identified by using Vitek system (BioMerieux, France) and conventional methods. According to the criteria of Federal Standard 209E (FD 209E) on cleanrooms, the conventionally ventilated operating- and general surgery rooms, and the anesthesia intensive care unit have been ranked as less than class 3.5 and 3, respectively. The frequency of nosocomial infection related to air-colonization was higher in patients of anestesia intensive care unit (16.4%), than in those of general surgery intensive care unit (4.9%). In general surgery rooms and anesthesia intensive care unit, the most frequent air-colonization related nosocomial infections were surgical wound infections and bacteremia, respectively. The most frequently isolated microorganisms were methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Acinetobacter baumannii. It can be concluded that, total number of airborne viable particles in the critical areas such as operating theatres and intensive care units, seems to be a significant risk factor for the development of nosocomial infections in immunocompromised patients.
TI  - Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of invasive pathogens: the Estonian experience.
AB  - The aim of the present study was to evaluate the needs for surveillance of invasive Gram-negative pathogens in Estonia. The antimicrobial susceptibility data of invasive isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella spp, Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae and enterococci were collected in accordance with EARSS (European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System) protocols. Despite the higher rate of Gram positive pathogens, their resistance to antimicrobials was low in contrast to the elevated resistance established for Gram negative pathogens. The higher resistance to antimicrobials was particularly associated with A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa. Also, the proportion of extended spectrum betalactamase (ESBL)-producing strains was 23% among Klebsiella spp. and 3.6% among E. coli. The inclusion of invasive Gram negative pathogens in antimicrobial resistance surveillance provides useful information concerning local pathogen susceptibility, as well as for the empirical treatment of suspected infections.
TI  - [Bacteriologic profile of bacteremia due to multi-drug resistant bacteria at Charles-Nicolle Hospital of Tunis].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The authors had for aim to evaluate the place of multi-drug resistant  bacteria (MDR) in nosocomial bacteremia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective study was carried out at the Microbiology laboratory of Charles Nicolle hospital of Tunis (2001-2003). One hundred and ninety-five isolated MDR [third generation cephalosporin resistant enterobacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa resistant to ceftazidime and imipenem]. An automated system was used to detect bloodstream infections. Microorganism identification was performed by conventional methods and antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by the disk diffusion method. RESULTS: MDR bacteria were resistant to third generation cephalosporins (29%), A. baumannii (24%), P. aeruginosa (24%), and MRSA (10%). ERC3G were resistant to aminosides and fluorquinolones. A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa had high resistance rates. Associated resistance rates in MRSA were moderate. CONCLUSION: MDR bacteria are of great concern in our hospital. This situation emphasizes the importance to maintain rigorous measures of hygiene as well as adapted antibiotic prescriptions.
TI  - In vitro bactericidal activity of human beta-defensin 3 against multidrug-resistant nosocomial strains.
AB  - The antimicrobial activity of human beta-defensin 3 (hBD-3) against multidrug-resistant clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Acinetobacter baumannii was evaluated. A fast bactericidal effect (within 20 min) against all bacterial strains tested was observed. The presence of 20% human serum abolished the bactericidal activity of hBD-3 against gram-negative strains and reduced the activity of the peptide against gram-positive strains.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia : rationalizing the approach to empirical therapy.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) causes considerable morbidity and mortality. It is the second most common nosocomial infection and the leading cause of death from hospital-acquired infections. In 1996 the American Thoracic Society (ATS) published guidelines for empirical therapy of HAP. This review focuses on the literature that has appeared since the ATS statement. Early diagnosis of HAP and its etiology is crucial in guiding empirical therapy. Since 1996, it has become clear that differentiating mere colonization from etiologic pathogens infecting the lower respiratory tract is best achieved by employing bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) in combination with quantitative culture and detection of intracellular microorganisms. Endotracheal aspirate and non-bronchoscopic BAL/PSB in combination with quantitative culture provide a good alternative in patients suspected of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Since culture results take 2-3 days, initial therapy of HAP is by definition empirical. Epidemiologic studies have identified the most frequently involved pathogens: Enterobacteriaceae, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus ('core pathogens'). Empirical therapy covering only the 'core pathogens' will suffice in patients without risk factors for resistant microorganisms. Studies that have appeared since the ATS statement issued in 1996, demonstrate several new risk factors for HAP with multiresistant pathogens. In patients with risk factors, empirical therapy should consist of antibacterials with a broader spectrum. The most important risk factors for resistant microorganisms are late onset of HAP (>/=5 days after admission), recent use of antibacterial therapy, and mechanical ventilation. Multiresistant bacteria of specific interest are methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Each of these organisms has its specific susceptibility pattern, demanding appropriate antibacterial treatment. To further improve outcomes, specific therapeutic options for multiresistant pathogens and pharmacological factors are discussed. Antibacterials developed since 1996 or antibacterials with renewed interest (linezolid, quinupristin/dalfopristin, teicoplanin, meropenem, new fluoroquinolones, and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are discussed in the light of developing resistance.Since the ATS statement, many reports have shown increasing incidences of resistant microorganisms. Therefore, one of the most important conclusions from this review is that empirical therapy for HAP should not be based on general guidelines alone, but that local epidemiology should be taken into account and used in the formulation of local guidelines.
TI  - Antimicrobial activities of silver dressings: an in vitro comparison.
AB  - A range of silver-coated or -impregnated dressings are now commercially available for use but comparative data on their antimicrobial efficacies are limited. The antibacterial activities of five commercially available silver-coated/impregnated dressings were compared against nine common burn-wound pathogens, namely methicillin-sensitive and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Enterococcus faecalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Acinetobacter baumannii and a multi-drug-efflux-positive Acinetobacter baumannii (BM4454), using a broth culture method. The rapidity and extent of killing of these pathogens under in vitro conditions were evaluated. All five silver-impregnated dressings investigated exerted bactericidal activity, particularly against Gram-negative bacteria, including Enterobacter species, Proteus species and E. coli. The spectrum and rapidity of action, however, ranged widely for different dressings. Acticoat and Contreet had a broad spectrum of bactericidal activities against both Gram-positive and -negative bacteria. Contreet was characterized by a very rapid bactericidal action and achieved a reduction of > or =10,000 c.f.u. ml(-1) in the first 30 min for Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus vulgaris, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumanii. Other dressings demonstrated a narrower range of bactericidal activities. Understanding the characteristics of these dressings may enable them to be targeted more appropriately according to the specific requirements for use of a particular dressing, as in for prophylaxis in skin grafting or for an infected wound with MRSA.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other antimicrobial agents against clinically isolated organisms in Taiwan.
AB  - This study evaluated the in vitro activities of tigecycline, ertapenem, isepamicin, and other comparators against 861 bacterial isolates recovered from patients treated in three major teaching hospitals in 2003. MICs to antimicrobial agents were determined by the agar dilution method. High rates of oxacillin resistance (58%) in Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), and vancomycin resistance (21%) and quinupristin-dalfopristin non-susceptibility (39%) in Enterococcus faecium (34 isolates) were found. Carbapenems had excellent in vitro activities (>or=98% susceptibility) against the 419 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, with the MIC(50) and MIC(90) of imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem being 0.25 and 4 mg/L, 0.03 and 0.12 mg/L, and 0.03 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively. For, Pseudomonas aeruginosa (74 isolates) and Burkholderia cepacia (21 isolates), meropenem (MIC(90), 0.25, 2, and 4 mg/L, respectively) had better in vitro activities than imipenem (MIC(90), 8, 4, and 32 mg/L, respectively) and ertapenem (MIC(90), 0.5, >32, and 32 mg/L, respectively). Isepamicin had a similar activity with amikacin against all Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, B. cepacia, and Acinetobacter baumannii, except for C. freundii isolates in which isepamicin had an eight-fold activity better than amikacin. Tigecycline had excellent in vitro activities against all isolates tested (MIC(90), <or=1 mg/L) including 14 pandrugresistant A. baumannii isolates (MICs, 1-4 mg/L), except for Proteus mirabilis (59 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), Bacteroides fragilis (60 isolates; MIC(90), 8 mg/L), P. aeruginosa (MIC(90), 16 mg/L), and B. cepacia (21 isolates; MIC(90), 16 mg/L). Tigecycline, carbapenems, and isepamicin exhibited better or comparable in vitro activities against a wide spectrum of commonly encountered bacteria than other comparator antimicrobials and may represent therapeutic options for infections due to multidrug-resistant pathogens.
TI  - In vitro antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid.
AB  - The in vitro inhibitory effect of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid, a compound derived from roselle calyx, on the growth of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii was studied. The data from inhibition zone and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values showed that both roselle calyx extract and protocatechuic acid inhibited effectively the growth of all test bacterial pathogens, the antibacterial activity of protocatechuic acid being significantly greater than roselle calyx (p < 0.05). Furthermore, heat treatment did not affect the antibacterial activity of roselle calyx and protocatechuic acid against all test pathogens. The time-kill data from protocatechuic acid showed this agent provided concentration dependent antibacterial activities in broth and human plasma (p < 0.05); however, protocatechuic acid showed less inhibitory activity in human plasma than in broth (p < 0.05). These agents based on their lower MIC values, heat tolerance and concentration dependent antibacterial activity may be useful in clinical infection prevention or therapy.
TI  - Diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia in liver transplantation recipients: report of 33 cases.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacterial pneumonia in the recipients of liver transplantation (LTX)  is a common postoperative complication influencing the prognosis greatly. In this article, the diagnosis and treatment of bacterial pneumonia in 33 LTX recipients are reported. METHODS: From February 1999 to January 2003, a total of 103 patients underwent allogeneic LTX at our center; afterwards, a retrospective analysis was made on their postoperative clinical manifestations, including symptoms (expectoration, panting and fever), sign (rale), results of laboratory examinations (white blood cell count and sputum culture of tracheal secretions or pleural fluid culture), and chest X-ray films. The following data of the pneumonia and non-pneumonia groups were collected, and the rank sum test (SPSS 11.0, Wilcoxon's method) was used to analyze the duration of postoperative respirator utilization and the volume of pleural effusion through pleurocentesis or pleural drainage. RESULTS: In the 103 patients, 33 experienced 53 episodes of bacterial pneumonia during their hospital stay after transplantation, 14 of them (42.42%) had more than three manifestations of the seven mentioned above. The pathogens causing bacterial pneumonia included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.48%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (15.53%), Acinetobacter baumannii (10.68%), and Staphylococcus aureus (7.77%). Amilkacin, tienam, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, etc. were the antibiotics of choice against those bacteria. Acute rejection occurred during the treatment of bacterial pneumonia in 16 patients, and 5 of them died. Wilcoxon's rank sum test of the data indicated that the pneumonia group had longer duration of postoperative ventilator treatment and larger volume of pleural effusion than the non-pneumonia group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The clinical manifestations of pneumonia after LTX might be atypical, and special attention should be paid to the respiratory symptoms and signs within 2 months after LTX. Whenever the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is confirmed, consideration should be given to reasonable use of antibiotics and regulation of immunity in addition to other routine therapies.
TI  - [Etiology of severe hospital infections in intensive care units and antibiotic resistance of pathogens].
AB  - The leading pathogens of severe infections in intensive care units were the following: respiratory tract infections--bacteria of the famility of Enterobacteriaceae (33.8%), Pseudomonas spp. (24.9%), Acinetobacter spp. (18.1%), Staphylococcus aureus (16.0%), blood flow infections--coagulase negative staphylococci (33.6%), S. aureus (26.1%), Enterobacteriaceae (17.6%), wound infections--Enterobacteriaceae (35.7%), coagulase negative staphyloccocci (17.8%), Pseudomonas spp. (14.3%). As for various species of Enterobacteriaceae, susceptibility was preserved in 91-100% of the isolates to meropenem, in 72-100% to cefoperazone/sulbactam, in 51-65% to cefepime, in 72-86% to amikacin, and in less than 50% to cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. As for P.aeruginosa, 28% of the isolates was resistant to all the antibacterials, except polymyxin. The highest susceptibility to cefoperazone/sulbactam and meropenem was revealed in the isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii. Oxacillin resistance was detected in 64.9% of the S.aureus isolates. The oxacillin resistance as a rule was associated with resistance to macrolides, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones. As for coagulase negative staphylococci, oxacillin resistance was stated in 75.6% of the isolates. All the isolates of the Staphylococcus spp. preserved their susceptibility to vancomycin and linezolid.
TI  - Bacteriophage therapy: a revitalized therapy against bacterial infectious diseases.
AB  - Bacteriophage (phage) therapy involves using phages or their products as bioagents for the treatment or prophylaxis of bacterial infectious diseases. Much evidence in support of the effectiveness of phage therapy against bacterial infectious diseases has accumulated since 1980 from animal model studies conducted in Western countries. Reports indicate that appropriate administration of living phages can be used to treat lethal infectious diseases caused by gram-negative bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Vibrio vulnificus, and Salmonella spp., and gram-positive bacteria, such as Enterococcus faecium and Staphylococcus aureus. The phage display system and genetically modified nonreplicating phages are also effective for treatment of Helicobacter pylori and P. aeruginosa, respectively. In addition to phage particles per se, purified phage-encoded peptidoglycan hydrolase (lysin) is also reported to be effective for the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases caused by gram-positive bacteria such as Streptococcus pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, Bacillus anthracis, and group B streptococci. All phage lysins that have been studied to date exhibit immediate and strong bacteriolytic activity when applied exogenously. Furthermore, phage-coded inhibitors of peptidoglycan synthesis (protein antibiotics), search methods for novel antibacterial agents using phage genome informatics, and vaccines utilizing phages or their products are being developed. Phage therapy will compensate for unavoidable complications of chemotherapy such as the appearance of multidrug resistance or substituted microbism.
TI  - The emergence of multidrug resistant Acinetobacter species: a major concern in the hospital setting.
AB  - Acinetobacter spp. have emerged in recent years as a major cause of nosocomial infections that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Developing resistance patterns have prompted the suggestion that we are closer to the end of the antibiotic era with Acinetobacter than with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (J Hosp Infect58, 2004, 167).
TI  - Antimicrobial activity of a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides against Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative bacteria.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To test a series of 1-alkyl-2-(4-pyridyl)pyridinium bromides with alkyl chains containing between 9 and 16 carbons against Gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (Escherichia coli, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) bacteria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemical synthesis was based on the reaction of 2,4'-bipyridyl with alkyl bromide. Antimicrobial activity of the bipyridyls was measured by growing bacterial cultures on Mueller-Hinton agar in the presence and absence of inhibitors. RESULTS: The compounds were most active against S. aureus. The most active compounds had alkyl chain lengths of between 11 and 16 carbons. Methicillin-sensitive S. aureus was more susceptible to the inhibitors than methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). Two subclasses of MRSA existed which differed in their susceptibility to the inhibitors. The susceptibility of MRSA strains to the compounds was increased in the presence of the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine. The activity of the compounds against Gram-negative organisms was increased when the membrane-permeabilizing agent sodium citrate was introduced. Critical micelle concentrations of the compounds were much higher than minimum inhibitory concentrations of the inhibitors. CONCLUSION: The mechanism of action of the compounds may involve perturbing bacterial membranes. The resistance of some MRSA strains to the compounds may be related to efflux pumps.
TI  - Contamination of patients' files in intensive care units: an indication of strict handwashing after entering case notes.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The extent to which bedside patients' files become contaminated and the range of bacterial flora attributable to contamination in high-risk areas of the hospital are not known with certainty. The aim of the present study was to determine the degree of contamination of the patient's files and also to analyze and compare the spectrum of contaminant bacterial flora between the intensive care unit (ICU) and surgical wards, the 2 most high-risk areas for nosocomial transmission of infection. METHODS: Microbiologic samples were collected from the exposed outer surface of the patients' files kept bedside in the ICU and surgical wards with sterile swabs moistened with sterile normal saline. Swabs were cultured within an hour of collection on blood agar and MacConkey's agar plates, which were incubated at 37 degrees C for 48 hours. Gram-negative bacilli were identified by Gram's stain, catalase, oxidase tests, and API 20E and API 20NE. Staphylococcus species were identified by Gram's stain, catalase test, and tube coagulase test. Antibiotic susceptibility of the isolated bacteria was determined by the disk diffusion technique according to the criteria of National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards (NCCLS). RESULTS: In ICU, 85.2% (87/102) and, in surgical wards, 24.7% (22/89) of patient's files were found to be contaminated with pathogenic and potentially pathogenic bacteria (OR, 17.664; 95% CI: 8.050-39.423; P < .0001). Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most commonly isolated bacteria (32.3%, 33/102) in ICUs, whereas Staphylococcus aureus was the peak contaminant (11.2%, 10/89) of the files in surgical wards. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was isolated from 6.8% (7/102) of ICU patient's files, whereas only 1.1% (1/89) of patient's files in surgical wards were contaminated with MRSA (OR, 6.484; 95% CI: 3.215-13.463; P < .0001). The multidrug-resistant P aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Serretia marcesens isolated from the patient's files had the same antibiotic resistance pattern as of these bacteria isolated from the patients. CONCLUSION: The majority of the patient's files in ICUs were contaminated often with multidrug-resistant bacteria and even MRSA. Contaminated files could be a source of transmission of infection. To prevent this, handwashing practice should be strictly followed after attending the patient and before entering the case notes in the patient's file. The maintenance of good hand hygiene by the health care workers (HCWs) after handling contaminated files should perhaps be the most prudent approach to prevent patient-patient transmission of infection in high-risk areas including ICU and surgical wards.
TI  - Advances in the management of pneumonia in the intensive care unit: review of current thinking.
AB  - Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the intensive care unit should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms and protection of the patient. Microbiological investigation is useful for evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample, and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiological findings. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: (1) is the patient at risk of acquiring methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, (2) is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution, and (3) is the patient at risk of acquiring Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent any pathogen resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution-specific and patient-oriented.
TI  - Evaluation of a clinical pathway for ventilator-associated pneumonia: changes in  bacterial flora and the adequacy of empiric antibiotics over a three-year period.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evaluation of causative pathogens is vital for optimizing empiric antibiotic therapy of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Based on previous data (Ann Surg 1998;227:743-755), empiric antibiotics for our VAP clinical pathway were modified to target early and late occurring pathogens (ampicillin/sulbactam during the first week of hospitalization; cefepime plus vancomycin afterwards). The objectives of this study were to compare organisms causing VAP over a three-year period to previous data, and to determine the adequacy of the empiric antibiotic regimens. METHODS: A total of 299 critically ill trauma patients with VAP over a three-year period were studied retrospectively. The incidence of pathogens causing VAP in the study period were compared to a previously published study of a two-year period in our intensive care unit (ICU). Sensitivities of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii were evaluated over the study period. The adequacy of empiric antibiotic therapy for each episode of VAP was determined. Therapy was considered to be adequate if one or more antibiotics had in vitro activity against the organism causing VAP. RESULTS: Statistically significant changes in pathogens included increased Staphylococcus aureus (incidence 17% vs. 11%, p = 0.024) and decreased Acinetobacter baumannii (11% vs. 22%, p < 0.001). Susceptibility patterns were statistically unchanged except for increased resistance of P. aeruginosa to extended-spectrum penicillins (p = 0.016). Empiric therapy was adequate in 76% of VAP episodes. CONCLUSIONS: The clinical pathway's empiric antibiotic regimen was associated with only modest changes in organisms causing VAP and provided a high rate of adequate empiric coverage.
TI  - Respiratory tract infection caused by bacteria (non-Mycobacterium) and their antibiogram in HIV-positive patients.
AB  - Abstract. This study was undertaken from 1995-2000 to investigate the cause of respiratory tract infection among 481 patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at Siriraj Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand. The positive rate of bacterial pathogens was 38.46%. Pseudomonas aeruginosa appeared to be the most common pathogen (32.97%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (18.92%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (10.81 %), Haemophilus influenzae (7.57%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5.95%). P. aeruginosa was sensitive to netilmycin, amikacin, imipenem, meropenem, cefoperazone/sulbactam, piperacillin/tazobactam, and gentamicin (67-84%). S. aureus was sensitive to vancomycin and teicoplanin (100%).
TI  - Post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adults: microbiology, clinical features, and outcomes.
AB  - The clinical data of 62 adult patients who suffered post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis, retrospectively collected over a 16-year period, were studied. Cases were divided into two groups based on the date of presentation, the first period being 1986-1993 and the second 1994-2001. Fever and progressive consciousness disturbance were the most consistent clinical features - signs that may also be attributed to other postoperative neurosurgical problems. The common pathogens included Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase negative Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. An increase in polymicrobial infections and multi-antibiotic resistance during the second period was identified. In the first half of the study, mortality was 22%, and in the second half 36%. Adult post-neurosurgical nosocomial bacterial meningitis has become an important clinical problem. The choice of appropriate empirical antibiotics is challenging and must be guided by an awareness of the relative frequency of various pathogens and the increasing incidence of resistant strains. Although high mortality rates may, in part, be related to the primary brain pathology, early diagnosis and the timely use of antibiotics based on antimicrobial susceptibility testing are essential for survival.
TI  - Outcome analysis of patients requiring mechanical ventilation with severe community-acquired pneumonia and identified bacterial pathogens.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Severe community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is associated with high mortality. The choice of antibiotics should be guided by the distribution of bacterial pathogens. The purpose of this study was to analyze the causative bacteria and outcomes of patients with severe CAP in a medical intensive care unit (MICU) in Taiwan. The results may provide a basis of guidance for future empirical antibiotic treatments. METHODS: We enrolled patients with severe CAP who were intubated and who required mechanical ventilation in an MICU in 2001. Only patients with identified bacterial pathogens were included. The bacterial distribution was determined, while differences in age, acute physiology and chronic health evaluation (APACHE) II scores, and initial PaO2/FiO2 ratio between surviving and expired patients were compared. RESULTS: Fifty-nine patients were enrolled and 75 isolates were obtained. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common bacteria (21.3%), followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. Staphylococcus aureus (8%) was the most-commonly isolated gram-positive organism, and half of its isolates were oxacillin-resistant (ORSA). The overall mortality was 55.9%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that survivors had a significantly younger age and lower APACHE II scores. CONCLUSIONS: Gram-negative bacilli were the most-common causative pathogens among patients with severe CAP requiring mechanical ventilation. Antipseudomonal antibiotics or a carbapenem should be considered to cover Pseudomonas species, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing strains, and Acinetobacter species. If the isolated bacteria are gram-positive, care should be taken to cover the possibility of ORSA. Old age and higher APACHE II scores were associated with higher mortality.
TI  - Clinical approach to the patient with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Management of ventilator-associated pneumonia needs to balance the avoidance of unnecessary antibiotic overuse with the provision of adequate initial empiric therapy. A clinical diagnosis based on new pulmonary opacity and purulent respiratory secretions plus other signs of inflammation is valuable in screening for patients with suspected ventilator-associated pneumonia. A rational strategy starts with immediate initiation of adequate antibiotics and collection of respiratory secretions to evaluate the causative organism. As a minimum, an endotracheal aspirate with direct staining and quantitative cultures should be obtained. Overall, the need to choose adequate antibiotics correctly and expeditiously calls for the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, but the choice should be narrowed quickly in the light of microbiologic information. However, some patients (those who develop an infection within 5 days of hospitalization, those without recent antibiotic exposure, and those without hospitalization in the past 3 months) are at low risk of infection by resistant organisms. In that subset, adequate initial selection could be a non-pseudomonal third-generation cephalosporin, since antibiotics should target usual community-acquired organisms in addition to some Enterobacteriaceae and Staphylococcus aureus. Coverage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus should be limited only to intensive care units with concomitant index cases and to patients under antibiotic exposure. Patients at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (e.g., 1 week of prior hospitalization or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) require initial use of a combination of piperacilin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin, or amikacin plus imipenem, meropenem, or an antipseudomonal cephalosporin. If risk of Acinetobacter baumannii exists, one of these agents should be a carbapenem. After 48 hours of therapy, each patient should be re-evaluated based mainly on resolution of hypoxemia and fever plus the initial microbiologic information. Whereas broad-spectrum therapy is initially warranted in many patients, this treatment may be narrowed considerably as culture results identify the causative organism and its sensitivity. Recent data suggest that reducing overall treatment duration to a maximum of 1 week is safe, effective and is less likely to promote the growth of resistant organisms in patients who are clinically improving. Optimal management should be based on a strategy combining early high doses of an effective agent for a short period of time, which is then simplified in the light of microbiologic information.
TI  - Hospital-acquired pneumonia in critically ill patients: factors associated with episodes due to imipenem-resistant organisms.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate initial antimicrobial therapy represents one of the factors associated with mortality of patients suffering from hospital-acquired pneumonia. According to its wide antimicrobial spectrum, imipenem belongs to the usual antibiotics proposed by current guidelines for such a therapy. However, major changes in the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of bacteria in the intensive care unit (ICU) have occurred. Our goal was to determine the incidence of hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) due to imipenem-resistant organism(s) in our ICU and to identify factors associated with such a resistance. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From January 1994 to December 2001, all consecutive patients admitted to our ICU for HAP or exhibiting HAP during their ICU stay were included in an observational cohort. Patients with a bacteriologically documented HAP were studied. For each causative pathogen, imipenem susceptibility was routinely determined. Patients with an HAP episode due to at least one imipenem-resistant causative organism were compared with patients who developed HAP in which all incriminated pathogens were imipenem susceptible. RESULTS: 235 patients were included in our observational cohort. Among them, 168 had an HAP episode with a bacteriologically proven infection. In 42 patients (25%), at least one causative organism was resistant to imipenem. The 44 imipenem-resistant organisms were Staphylococcus aureus (n = 15), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 14), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 13), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 2). Multivariate analysis identified four significant independent factors associated with resistance of causative organism(s) to imipenem: prior use of a fluoroquinolone (AOR = 3.9; 95% CI: 1.8 to 8.8; p < 0.0001), prior use of an aminoglycoside (AOR = 2.6; CI: 1.2 to 5.9; p = 0.02), use of invasive blood pressure monitoring (AOR = 2.7; CI: 1.0 to 7.0; p = 0.04) and bilateral chest X-ray involvement (AOR = 2.6; CI: 1.1 to 5.8; p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: Factors associated with potential inadequacy of imipenem used as the single antibiotic for initial empiric treatment for HAP were identified. When they are present, imipenem should be either combined with antibiotics such as vancomycin and ciprofloxacin or replaced with another broad-spectrum antimicrobial regimen.
TI  - The role of the intensive care unit environment in the pathogenesis and prevention of ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia is preceded by lower-respiratory-tract colonization by pathogenic microorganisms that derive from endogenous or exogenous sources. Most ventilator-associated pneumonias are the result of exogenous nosocomial colonization, especially, pneumonias caused by resistant bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, or by Legionella species or filamentous fungi, such as Aspergillus. Exogenous colonization originates from a very wide variety of animate and inanimate sources in the intensive care unit environment. As a result, a strategic approach that combines measures to prevent cross-colonization with those that focus on oral hygiene and prevention of microaspiration of colonized oropharyngeal secretions should bring the greatest reduction in the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. This review examines strategies to prevent transmission of environmental pathogens to the vulnerable mechanically-ventilated patient.
TI  - Respiratory pathogens in dental plaque of hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases.
AB  - Bacterial cultivation studies have shown that dental plaque is a reservoir for respiratory pathogens in intensive care unit patients and in elderly who are debilitated, hospitalized or in a nursing home, placing them at risk of bacterial pneumonia. No information is available, however, concerning dental plaque as a reservoir of putative respiratory pathogens in hospitalized patients with chronic lung diseases. Supragingival plaque colonization of 34 hospitalized chronic lung-diseased Romanian citizens, excluding those with tuberculosis and less than 20 teeth, was therefore assessed by checkerboard DNA-DNA hybridization using a selected panel of whole genomic DNA probes produced from eight respiratory pathogens and eight oral pathogens. Thirty-one lung-healthy dental outpatients served as reference population. Respiratory pathogens were detected in plaque from 29 of the 34 (85.3%) hospitalized patients and 12 of the 31 (38.7%) reference population subjects. Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter cloacae occurred significantly (p<0.05) more frequent among the hospitalized patients. Hospitalized chronic lung-diseased patients harbored in their supragingival plaque samples bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia significantly (p<0.001) more frequent than lung-healthy dental outpatients. Our results indicate that dental plaque in patients with chronic lung diseases often serves as a reservoir of bacteria known to cause nosocomial pneumonia in susceptible individuals.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia.
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review summarises some of the notable papers on ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from January 2003 to October 2004. RECENT FINDINGS: Ventilator-associated pneumonia remains an important drain on hospital resources. All population groups are affected, but patients with VAP are more likely to be older, sicker, and male, with invasive medical devices in situ. Early VAP diagnosis is desirable to reduce VAP mortality and to retard emergence of multidrug-resistant microbes. This may be possible using preliminary culture results or intracellular organism in polymorphonuclear cells. In most intensive care units, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii are the commonest organisms isolated in VAP. However, causative organisms vary between and within hospitals. Consequently, individual intensive care units should develop empirical antibiotic policies to target the pathogenic bacteria prevalent in their patient populations. Preventative strategies aimed at reducing aerodigestive tract colonisation by pathogenic organisms, and also their subsequent aspiration, are becoming increasingly important. Educating medical staff about these simple measures is therefore pertinent. To reduce the occurrence of multidrug-resistant organisms, limiting the duration of antibiotic treatment to 8 days and antimicrobial rotation should be contemplated. Empirical therapy with antipseudomonal penicillins plus beta-lactamase inhibitors should be considered. If methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus VAP is a possibility, linezolid may be better than vancomycin. SUMMARY: Prevention remains the key to reducing VAP prevalence.
TI  - Risk factors of mortality for nosocomial pneumonia: importance of initial anti-microbial therapy.
AB  - Nosocomial pneumonia is a common nosocomial infection and has high mortality rate. Risk factors of mortality of nosocomial pneumonia were studied in 132 hospitalised patients who developed nosocomial pneumonia. The overall mortality rate was 64/132, 48.5%. Of the 11 risk factors univariately associated with mortality due to nosocomial pneumonia, only the inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy, high simplified acute physiology score and multiple organ failures remained significant after stepwise logistic regression. Gram-negative bacilli were still the most pre-dominant causative microbiologic agents of nosocomial pneumonia with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.3%), Acinetobacter baumannii (18.6%) and Escherichia coli (5.9%) being the three most predominant pathogens. A. baumannii were significantly more predominant among non-survivors than survivors (13.56 vs. 5.08%, p=0.0418). The incidence rate of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was 19.5% higher than previous reports. We conclude that inappropriate initial anti-microbial therapy for nosocomial pneumonia is associated with the mortality rate of nosocomial pneumonia, and appropriate anti-microbial therapy improves outcome of nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - First-generation fluoroquinolone use and subsequent emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria in the intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine the relationship between  fluoroquinolone (FQ) use and subsequent emergence of multiple drug-resistant bacteria (MRB) in the intensive care unit (ICU). DESIGN: The authors conducted a prospective observational cohort study and a case control study. SETTING: The study was conducted in a 30-bed ICU. METHODS: All immunocompetent patients hospitalized for >48 hrs who did not receive antibiotics before ICU admission were eligible during a 15-month period. Routine MRB screening was performed at ICU admission and weekly thereafter. This screening included tracheal aspirate and nasal, anal, and axilla swabs. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine risk factors for MRB emergence in the ICU. In addition, a case control study was performed to determine whether FQ use is associated with subsequent emergence of MRB. RESULTS: Two hundred thirty-nine patients were included; 108 ICU-acquired MRB were isolated in 77 patients. FQ use and longer duration of antibiotic treatment were identified as independent risk factors for MRB occurrence (odds ratio [95% confidence interval [CI] = 3.3 [1.7-6.5], 1.1 [1.0-1.2]; p < .001; respectively). One hundred thirty-five (56%) patients received FQ; matching was successful for 72 (53%) of them. Number of MRB (40 vs. 15 per 1,000 ICU days; p = .019) and percentage of patients with MRB (40% vs. 22%; OR [95% CI] = 1.5 [1.0-2.4]; p = .028) were significantly higher in cases than in controls. Although methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (26% vs. 12%; OR [95% CI] = 1.6 [.6-2.9]; p = .028) and extending-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli (11% vs. 1%; OR [95% CI] = 4.7 [0.7-30.2]; p = .017) rates were higher in cases than in controls, ceftazidime or imipenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (15% vs. 8%), Acinetobacter baumannii (1% vs. 5%), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (2% vs. 1%) rates were similar (p > .05) in case and control patients. CONCLUSION: FQ use and longer duration of antibiotic treatment are independently associated with MRB emergence. Reducing antimicrobial treatment duration and restricting FQ use could be suggested to control MRB spread in the ICU.
TI  - Assessment of the antibacterial activity of tea tree oil using the European EN 1276 and EN 12054 standard suspension tests.
AB  - The activity of tea tree oil (TTO) and TTO-containing products was investigated according to the EN 1276 and EN 12054 European suspension methods. The activity of different concentrations of TTO, a hygienic skin wash (HSW), an alcoholic hygienic skin wash (AHSW) and an alcoholic hand rub (AHR) was investigated. These formulations were assessed in perfect conditions with the EN 12054 test, and in perfect conditions as well as in the presence of interfering substances with the EN 1276 test, against Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. With the latter test, the activity of the same formulations without TTO was also assessed as a control. With the EN 1276 test, the AHR achieved a >10(5)-fold reduction against all four test organisms within a 1-min contact time. The AHSW achieved a >or=10(5)-fold reduction against A. baumannii after a 1-min contact time and against S. aureus, E. coli and P. aeruginosa after a 5-min contact time. The efficacy of TTO appeared to be dependent on the formulation and the concentration tested, the concentration of interfering substances and, lastly, the organism tested. Nevertheless, 5% TTO achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in P. aeruginosa cell numbers after a 5-min contact time in perfect conditions. TTO (5%) in 0.001% Tween 80 was significantly more active against E. coli and P. aeruginosa than against S. aureus and A. baumannii. With the EN 12054 test, after a 1-min contact time, 5% TTO in 0.001% Tween 80 and the AHSW achieved a >10(4)-fold reduction in E. coli and A. baumannii cell numbers, respectively, and the AHR achieved a >4 log10 reduction against all organisms tested. The formulations used in this study are now being tested using a novel ex vivo method as well as the in vivo European standard handwashing method EN 1499.
TI  - Heart transplantation in the patient under ventricular assist complicated with device-related infection.
AB  - Ventricular assist devices (VAD) have benefited patients with end-stage heart failure as a bridge to heart transplantation (HTx). We present our experience of HTx in the presence of device-related infection (DRI) including driveline exit site with pocket infections. From May 1996 to April 2003, mechanical circulatory support with the HeartMate VAD was performed in eight patients, and with the Thoratec VAD in seven patients. Although 151 patients underwent HTx during that period, only 8 of the 15 patients had suitable donors and underwent orthotopic HTx. Six of the eight patients developed DRI. Their ages ranged from 18 to 59 years (mean = 36 +/- 14 years). The duration of VAD support ranged from 8 to 287 days (mean = 125 +/- 117 days). The general condition and cardiac function improved gradually under VAD support. At the time of HTx, all six male patients were suffering from DRI. The causative microorganisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 3) methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n = 2), and Enterococcus faecium (n = 1). All patients underwent successful HTx, and were discharged in good condition. It is concluded that under the coverage of appropriate antibiotics, HTx can be successfully performed for the patients for VAD support with DRI. It is important to prevent the spread of infection during HTx. Adequate debridement and drainage of the infected materials prevents postoperative wound infections.
TI  - Device-associated infections and patterns of antimicrobial resistance in a medical-surgical intensive care unit in a university hospital in Thailand.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Surveillance of nosocomial infection in the intensive care unit (ICU) received a high level of attention and outcome indicators are now used in benchmarking the quality of patient care. Since 1999 the surveillance has targeted three site-specific, device-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), central-line-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI), and catheter-related urinary tract infection (CR-UTI). The authors conducted a two-year prospective study on the incidences of these infections acquired in an ICU and report herein, together with the antibiotic susceptibility patterns of the microorganisms isolated in an ICU. PATIENTS AND METHOD: Continuous prospective data collection was conducted on patients admitted to an adult medical-surgical ICU of a university hospital in Thailand from June 2000 to May 2002. RESULTS: A total 1422 patients with a total of 9370 patient-days were enrolled in the study. The incidence of VAP, CR-BSI, and CR-UTI were 10.8/1000 ventilator-days (95% C.I: 8.5-13.6), 2.6/1000 central-line-days (95%C.I. 1.5-4.4), and 13.8/1000 urinary-catheter-days (95%C.I: 10.7-17.5) respectively. The most common causative pathogens were Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Klebsiella pneumoniae. The proportion of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, imipenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ceftazidime-resistant A. baumannii, third-generation-cephalosporin-resistant K. pneumoniae, and quinolone-resistant E. coli were 68.8%, 30.9%, 68.5%, 44.6%, 38.3% respectively. CONCLUSION: The incidences of VAP and CR-BSI were comparable to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance (NNIS) report. But the incidence of CR-UTI was over the 90th percentile. The antibiotic resistance had become a serious problem.
TI  - [Surveillance of antimicrobial resistance: VIRA study 2004].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The objective of the study was to know the current situation of the antimicrobial sensitivity patterns of the main multi-resistant bacteria and to analyze any possible changes with respect to the VIRA study carried out in 2001. METHODS: The 40 participating hospitals sent a total of 1,425 microorganisms isolated in February 2004, distributed as follows: penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (139), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (289), clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (158), ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (89) and Enterococcus faecalis (2), ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae (85), ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli (346), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (187), and Acinetobacter baumannii (130). The hospitals provided epidemiological data on these microorganisms. Sensitivity was determined by the broth microdilution method. RESULTS: The number of highly penicillin-resistant pneumococci fell significantly (p < 0.0001) compared with the previous study (from 59.8% to 30.2%). Global methicillin-resistance in S. aureus was 31.2%, which represents a significant increase (p < 0.001) compared with the year 2001 (24.8%). 11.3% of the E. coli strains were extended-spectrum beta -lactamase-producers and came from 24 hospitals. One P. aeruginosa isolate gave a positive result in the E-test MBL assay, suggesting the presence of metallo-beta -lactamases. The strains of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii presented cross-resistance with several antibiotics. CONCLUSION: These results show how the multi-resistant bacteria included in the study represent a growing problem in our hospitals. This emphasizes the importance of resistance surveillance systems and the correct use of antimicrobial agents.
TI  - [Rapid diagnosis of common pathogenic bacteria infection in newborn infants by 16SrDNA oligonucleotide array].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The rapid identification of pathogenic bacteria is important for earlier effective patient management and antimicrobial therapy, especially for the infant patient, whose immunological system is not fully developed. However conventional microbiogical techniques of bacterial identification, culture and isolation of pathogenic bacteria, identification by biochemistry and serological assay, are time-consuming and require intensive labor. On the basis of special gene sequence, PCR provides simple and rapid way to identify bacteria. But it is difficult to identify all of bacteria species which are suspicious of pathogenic agents. Oligonucleotide arrays provide a powerful tool for parallel detection of target genes. The objective of this study was to test a reverse oligonucleotide assay, which hybridize with the PCR product of 16SrDNA using a pair of universal primers, to rapidly identify common infant pathogenic bacteria. METHODS: By comparison and analysis of the 16SrDNA sequences of common pathogenic bacteria, a region, which has numerous sequence variations and flanked by highly conserved sequences, was found. A pair of universal primers was designed according to its flanking conservative sequence, and a set of probes specially targeting to eight species of infant pathogenic bacteria, including staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Streptococcus faecalis, Hemophilus influenzae, Enterobacter cloacae, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii,according to the variable sequences. The probes were fixed on the nylon membrane with positive electricity, and hybridized them with the products of PCR using the universal primers. RESULTS: The universal primers could amplify the target sequence from bacteria including the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria and Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterobacter aerogenes, Streptococcus pneumoniae,beta-hemolytic streptococcus, Neisseria meningitides, Citrobacter freundii, Bacillus subtilis, and Salmonella infantis,but could not amplify rotavirus and human DNA as control. The results showed that the oligonucleotide array could specially hybridize with the eight bacteria to be examined and could not hybridize with other bacteria. The lowest concentration of DNA (product of PCR) for oligonucleotide array was about 25 ng/ml. The results proved that the probes are highly selective and the oligonucleotide arrays could parallelly detect the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria. The results suggested that the oligonucleotide array system was able to identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria from clinical specimens and the results were the same as identified by automated bacterial detection machine. From the further experiments, the oligonucleotide array system could directly diagnose the common infant pathogenic bacteria from the broths of samples culture. CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited number of identifiable bacteria and lack of information on antibiotic susceptibility of bacteria, the reverse oligonucleotide assay system, which contains amplification of the segment of 16rDNA from samples using the universal primers and parallel detection of PCR products using specific probes, is an effective method to rapidly identify the eight common infant pathogenic bacteria.
TI  - Hospital gowns as a vehicle for bacterial dissemination in an intensive care unit.
AB  - The microbiota from the uniforms of 31 professionals from the general intensive care unit was analyzed. The samples were collected in duplicate at the beginning and at the end of the work period. Total viable counts of microorganisms were determined; there was a significant increase in the counts at the end of the period, when compared with those obtained at the beginning. No significant difference was observed between the first and second counts obtained from the cuffs. However, differences were observed for the samples from the abdominal region. Among the isolated pathogens 11/18 were Staphylococcus aureus, 2/18 were Acinetobacter baumannii, 2/18 were Klebsiela pneumoniae and 1/18 were Serratia rubidae. Some of these isolates were multi-resistant to antibiotics. Emphasis should be placed on reducing the spread of these pathogens in the hospital, making sure that biosafety protocols are followed by the staff.
TI  - Comparison of trends of resistance rates over 3 years calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of a given species from a patient.
AB  - We compared trends of annual resistance rates calculated from results for all isolates and for the first isolate of Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Acinetobacter baumannii per patient over a 3-year period from 2001 through 2003. Antimicrobial susceptibility results of inpatients were extracted from a computerized database. Annual resistance rates of a species were calculated by two methods: (i) from results for all isolates, even those from patients with multiple isolates in a given year and (ii) from results for the first isolate from a patient in a given year, regardless of susceptibility profile or specimen type. Rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) did not differ among all isolates (79.9, 78.8 and 79.6%; P = 0.86), but decreased for the first isolate per patient (70.2, 65.7, and 64.1%; P = 0.006) over time. Annual duplication rates of methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) decreased (39.6, 37.6, and 31.7%; P = 0.01), but those of MRSA increased significantly (64.3, 67.8, and 68.9%; P = 0.004). Rates of cefotaxime-resistant K. pneumoniae did not differ over time by either method, and rates of imipenem-resistant A. baumannii decreased over time by both methods. Duplication rates did not differ for either susceptible or resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae and A. baumannii. The trends in MRSA rate differed by the two methods because of the different proportion of duplicate isolates per year. MRSA rates might be increasingly overestimated for all isolates. These results suggest that the method of calculating results for the first isolate per patient may remove the effect of duplication, allowing the simple and unambiguous analysis of cumulative susceptibility rates.
TI  - Microbiology and drug resistance mechanisms of fully resistant pathogens.
AB  - The acquisition of vancomycin resistance by Gram-positive bacteria and carbapenem resistance by Gram-negative bacteria has rendered some hospital-acquired pathogens impossible to treat. The resistance mechanisms employed are sophisticated and very difficult to overcome. Unless alternative treatment regimes are initiated soon, our inability to treat totally resistant bacteria will halt other developments in medicine. In the community, Gram-positive bacteria responsible for pneumonia could become totally resistant leading to increased mortality from this common infection, which would have a more immediate impact on our current lifestyles.
TI  - Monitoring of antibiotic resistance in bacterial isolates from bacteremic patients.
AB  - The aim of the study was to monitor the prevalence of pathogens and development of resistance in bacteria isolated from bacteremic patients. Five University Clinics and/or Regional Hospitals in the Slovak Republic participated in the study and a total of 421 isolates were collected in the second half of the year 2002. The most prevalent organisms were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CONS) (19%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.3%), among Gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli (13.3%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (11.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (7.8%) followed by enterococci, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacter sp. All CONS and S. aureus were susceptible to vancomycin; resistance to oxacillin was observed for 55% of the CONS and only for 4% of S. aureus isolates. A higher prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, gentamicin and ofloxacin was found in CONS in comparison to S. aureus. Enterococcus sp. isolates were fully susceptible to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanate, third generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin showed good activity against E. coli. Although 17% of K. pneumoniae isolates were resistant to ciprofloxacin, it was the most effective drug against K. pneumoniae; the prevalence of resistance to other antibiotics was rather higher. Gentamicin and ciprofloxacin were the most active against Enterobacter sp. isolates and ceftazidime and meropenem against P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Trends and antimicrobial resistance of pathogens causing bloodstream infections among febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancy.
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The microbiological spectrum in cancer patients with febrile neutropenia has changed over the past several decades in western countries. The growing incidence of antimicrobial resistance is an inevitable consequence of the widespread use of antibiotics in medical settings. The aim of this study was to clarify the trends and antimicrobial resistance among pathogens causing bloodstream infections in febrile neutropenic adults with hematological malignancies. METHODS: The characteristics of pathogens causing bloodstream infection isolated from patients with febrile neutropenia who were treated at National Taiwan University Hospital from 1996 to 2001 were reviewed. A total of 1174 pathogens were isolated from 3093 admissions to a hematological ward during this period. Among them, 738 isolates were recovered from patients with febrile neutropenia. RESULTS: The majority (93%) of these neutropenic febrile patients had underlying acute leukemia or lymphoma. Gram-negative bacteria accounted for 57% of isolated pathogens, followed by Gram-positive bacteria (32%), fungi (7%), and anaerobes (3%). In decreasing frequency, Escherichia coli (13%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (12%), Enterobacter cloacae (7%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (6%), and Acinetobacter baumannii (5%) were the predominant Gram-negative bacteria, while coagulase-negative staphylococci (13%), viridans group streptococci (4%), and Staphylococcus aureus (4%) were the major Gram-positive pathogens. Two-thirds (20/30) of S. aureus isolates were resistant to oxacillin. No vancomycin-resistant enterococci were isolated. Resistance to cefotaxime was found in 63% of E. cloacae, 13% of K. pneumoniae and 10% of E. coli. Overall, 33% of E. coli and 13% of K. pneumoniae were resistant to ciprofloxacin. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that the microbiological spectrum of microorganisms causing bloodstream infections in neutropenic febrile patients with hematological malignancies at National Taiwan University Hospital is different from western countries in that Gram-negative bacteria remain the predominant pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance among these pathogens is high and E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and ciprofloxacin are increasing.
TI  - Procoagulant and fibrinolytic activity in ventilator-associated pneumonia: impact of inadequate antimicrobial therapy.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the homeostatic balance of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) with respect to the adequacy of antimicrobial therapy. DESIGN AND SETTING: Descriptive observational study in a 12-bed medical intensive care unit in a university-affiliated hospital. PATIENTS: Twenty-nine patients with VAP documented by quantitative culture of bronchoalveolar secretions and a control group of eight mechanically ventilated patients. METHODS: Serial bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were assayed for prothrombin activation fragment (F1+2), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT) complex, fibrinolytic activity, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA), and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) on days 1, 4, and 7 after VAP onset. RESULTS: Pathogens isolated from patients with inadequate empirical antimicrobial coverage included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (n=2), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=4), and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=1). Compared to those who received adequate antibiotic therapy, TAT, F1+2, and PAI-1 levels increased while u-PA levels remained unchanged. Despite antibiotic adjustment on day 4, TAT levels remained elevated in those who lacked adequate antimicrobial coverage and were significantly correlated with PaO(2)/FIO(2). The procoagulant activity was accompanied by a local depression of fibrinolytic capacity that was attributed mainly to increased BALF PAI-1 levels. Nonsurvivors showed significantly higher levels of TAT and PAI-1 than survivors. No significant correlation between the bacterial burden and the homeostatic derangements was documented. CONCLUSIONS: The lung inflammatory response seems to promulgate a local procoagulant activity associated with hypoxemia in those with inadequate antibiotic therapy. The homeostatic derangement seems to be independent of the lung bacterial burden.
TI  - Antiseptic impregnated endotracheal tubes for the prevention of bacterial colonization.
AB  - The effect of endotracheal tubes (ETTs) impregnated with chlorhexidine (CHX) and  silver carbonate (antiseptic ETTs) against Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter aerogenes [organisms associated with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP)], was evaluated in a laboratory airway model. Antiseptic ETTs and control ETTs (unimpregnated) were inserted in culture tubes half-filled with agar media (airway model) previously contaminated at the surface with 10(8) cfu/mL of the selected test organism. After five days of incubation, bacterial colony counts on all ETT segments were determined. Swabs of proximal and distal ends of the agar tract in antiseptic and control models were subcultured. The initial and residual CHX levels, (five days post-implantation in the model) were determined. Cultures of antiseptic ETTs revealed colonization by the tested pathogens ranging from 1-100 cfu/tube, compared with approximately 10(6) cfu/tube for the control ETTs (P < 0.001). Subcultures from proximal and distal ends of the agar tract showed minimal or no growth in the antiseptic ETTs compared with the control ETTs (P < 0.001). The amount of CHX retained in the antiseptic ETTs after five days of implantation was an average of 45% of the initial level. Antiseptic ETTs prevented bacterial colonization in the airway model and also retained significant amounts of the antiseptic. These results indicate that the effectiveness of antiseptic-impregnated ETTs in preventing the growth of bacterial pathogens associated with VAP may vary with different organisms.
TI  - Comparative in vitro and in vivo study of nine alcohol-based handrubs.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Hygienic hand disinfection using alcohol-based handrubs (AHRs) is an  alternative method to conventional handwashing in hospital wards. Because a documented choice of such products would consider data from in-care evaluation, we designed a comparative study of 9 AHRs both in vitro and in vivo in actual care conditions. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of AHRs was first measured in vitro against 4 hospital strains exhibiting multiple antibiotic resistance: Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter aerogenes. In a second time, AHRs were tested in an intensive care unit for antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of personnel hands and for acceptance by the care personnel. RESULTS: The 9 AHRs could be classified in 3 groups on the basis of their in vitro activity: products of the first group showed a bactericidal activity higher than 4 log(10) against the 4 strains. Only 1 of these products presented simultaneously an effective antibacterial activity against the cutaneous flora of care personnel hands and a good acceptance by the care personnel. CONCLUSION: The in vitro study allowed the differentiation of the AHRs tested on the basis of bactericidal activity, but evaluation in an in-care situation allowed further discrimination through both antibacterial activity and acceptance. Thus, the combination of in vitro and in vivo evaluations should provide helpful arguments in the choice of AHRs.
TI  - Sepsis in burned patients.
AB  - A prospective study was conducted from June 2001 to May 2002 at the Burns Unit of Hospital Regional da Asa Norte, Brasilia, Brazil. During the period of the study, 252 patients were treated at the Burns Unit, 49 (19.4%) developed clinically and microbiologically proven sepsis. Twenty-six (53.1%) were males and 23 (46.9%) females with a mean age of 22 years (range one to 89 years) and mean burned body surface area of 37.7 +/- 18.4% (range 7 to 84%). Forty-three patients had flame burns, five a scald and one an electric burn. These 49 patients had a total of 62 septic episodes. Forty (81.6%) patients had only one and nine (18.4%) had up to three episodes of sepsis. Thirty (61.2%) patients had their first septicemic episode either earlier or by one week postburn. Out of 62 septic episodes, 58 were due to bacteria and four due to Candida sp. The most common bacteria isolated from blood culture were Staphylococccus aureus, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Eleven (18.9%) episodes were due to oxacillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Acinetobacter baumannii was sensitive to ampicillin/sulbactam in 71.4% and to imipenem in 85.7% of the cases. The primary foci of sepsis were the burn wound in 15 (24.2%) episodes. The most common clinical findings of sepsis in these patients were fever, dyspnea, hypotension and oliguria. The most common laboratory findings of these patients were anemia, leukocytosis, hypoalbuminemia and thrombocytopenia. Twelve (24.5%) patients died. The appropriate knowledge of clinical, epidemiological, laboratorial and microbiological aspects of sepsis in burned patients permits an adequate diagnosis and treatment of this complication.
TI  - [Nosocomial infections in a general surgical ward].
AB  - According to the National Nosocomial Infection Surveillance system we analysed the post-surgical nosocomial infections in a surgery ward of Perugia University. Between May 2000 and April 2001, 677 patients were enrolled mean age 51.5 years: 355 (52%) male, 462 (68%) ASA score 1, "clean" surgery in 355 cases (52%), cephazolin prophylaxis in 256 (38%); 11 (2%) patients deceased perioperatively. A total of 37 nosocomial infections, in 33 patients, were detected: 18 pneumonia (48.6%), 10 surgical site infections (27%) with 18 isolated: 12 gram-negative (E. coli 3, Acinetobacter baumannii 2, Providencia stuartii 2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa 2, Achromobacter spp. 1, Citrobacter freundii 1, Morganella morgani 1) and 6 gram-positive (Staphylococcus aureus meticillin resistant 3, Enterococcus faecalis 2, Streptococcus salivarius 1); 7 sepsis (19%) due to 7 gram-positive (S. aureus meticillin resistant 4, S. aureus meticillin susceptible 1, Staphylococcus coagulase negative 1, Clostridium spp 1), 2 urinary tract infections (5.4%). Patients without infections and with nosocomial infections spent in hospital 6.3 and 16.6 days respectively. We can image that in one year 53 surgical procedure were lost, with a lost gain of 79.500-291.500 euro/year.
TI  - Antimicrobial susceptibility of common bacterial pathogens isolated from a new regional hospital in southern Taiwan.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance has become a major health problem in Taiwan. While some trends in antimicrobial resistance are universal, others appear to be unique for specific regions. METHODS: To determine the distribution and antimicrobial drug resistance of bacterial pathogens in a new hospital in southern Taiwan, surveillance data on major bacterial pathogens isolated from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Chia-Yi from January 2002 through December 2002 were retrospectively analyzed. RESULTS: The most common gram-positive isolate was Staphylococcus aureus. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were the two most common gram negative isolates. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ranked the first among gram-negative, glucose non-fermenting isolates, followed in the order of frequency by Acinetobacter baumannii. Oxacillin resistance rate of S. aureus was 58%, while vancomycin and teicoplanin remained effective against all of the isolates. The penicillin non-susceptibility rate of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 52%, and it is notable that the rate of resistance to erythromycin was 87%. Resistance to various antimicrobial agents for P. aeruginosa, Aeromonas hydrophila, and gram-negative enteric bacilli was very common in our study. Infections caused by multidrug-resistant A. baumannii was not uncommon in this hospital but fortunately, imipenem resistant A. baumannii was rarely encountered. Antimicrobial resistance was common in nontyphoid Salmonella, S. choleraesuis and serogroup B isolates in particular. CONCLUSION: The high rates of antimicrobial resistance among these major bacterial pathogens in this new hospital are impressive and alarming. Judicious use of antimicrobial agents can never be overemphasized. Continued surveillance of the changes of resistance patterns over time is necessary.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance of bacterial ventilator-associated pneumonia in surgical intensive care units.
AB  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is the most common infection in intensive care units. It is caused by prolonged hospitalization and results in high mortality rates. This retrospective clinical study, of 140 patients in a surgical intensive care unit, aimed to identify the bacterial agents responsible for VAP infection, and determine antibiotic resistance rates in VAP. Antibiotic sensitivity was evaluated by culturing and testing tracheal aspirates from patients with clinical and radiological findings of VAP. The bacteria isolated most frequently were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (33.9%), Staphylococcus aureus (30.0%), Acinetobacter baumannii (26.1%), and Enterobacter species (4.3%). A. baumannii was more prevalent than in previous years. The results of antibiotic sensitivity testing suggested sulbactam/cefoperazone as the most appropriate drug for treating these patients. We suggest, however, that when staphylococcal pneumonia is suspected, a glycopeptide (vancomycin or teicoplanin) or combined trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole is used as first-line therapy until sensitivity results are obtained. In conclusion, development of antibiotic policies for individual hospitals can reduce high antibiotic resistance rates due to VAP.
TI  - Aggressive control measures for resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and the impact  on acquisition of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus in a medical intensive care unit.
AB  - The medical ICU implemented aggressive control measures following an outbreak of  multidrug-resistant, clonal Acinetobacter baumannii. Multivariable regression analyses comparing acquisition (6 months preceding to 6 months during or following the outbreak) revealed decreased VRE and MRSA acquisition. Aggressive control measures can reduce VRE, and perhaps MRSA, transmission.
TI  - Epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia in infants after cardiac surgery.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The pattern of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) in infants in a pediatric surgical ICU after cardiac surgery may differ from that seen in adult ICUs. STUDY OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to describe the epidemiology of NP in infants after cardiac surgery and, secondarily, to describe the changes of the distribution and antibiotic resistance of the pathogen during the last 3 years. METHODS: Data were collected between June 1999 and June 2002 from 311 consecutive infants who underwent open-heart surgery in our hospital. We retrospectively analyzed the distribution and antibiotic resistance pattern of all the pathogenic microbial isolates cultured from lower respiratory tract aspirations. RESULTS: Of 311 infants, 67 patients (21.5%) acquired NP after cardiac surgery. The incidence of NP was more frequently associated with complex congenital heart defect (CHD) compared to simple CHD (43% vs 15.9%, chi(2) = 22.47, p < 0.0001). The proportion of late-onset NP was higher in patients with complex CHD (chi(2) = 6.02, p = 0.014). A total of 79 pathogenic microbial strains were isolated. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) were the most frequent isolates (68 isolates, 86.1%), followed by fungi (6 isolates, 7.6%) and Gram-positive cocci (5 isolates, 6.3%). The main GNB were Acinetobacter baumanii (11 isolates, 13.9%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10 isolates, 12.7%); other commonly seen GNB were Flavobacterium meningosepticum (7 isolates, 8.9%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (7 isolates, 8.9%), Escherichia coli (6 isolates, 7.6%), and Xanthomonas maltophilia (5 isolates, 6.2%). The most commonly seen Gram-positive cocci were Staphylococcus aureus (2 isolates, 2.5%) and Staphylococcus epidermidis (2 isolates, 2.5%). The frequent fungi were Candida albicans (5 isolates, 6.3%). Most GNB were sensitive to cefoperazone-sulbactum, piperacillin-tazobactam, imipenem, ciprofloxacin, amikacin. The bacteria producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases were mainly from K pneumoniae and E coli; the susceptibility of ESBL-producing strains to imipenem was 100%. There were one case of methicillin-resistant S aureus (MRSA) and 1 case of methicillin-resistant S epidermidis; their susceptibility to vancomycin, gentamycin, and ciprofloxacin were 100%. From 1999 to 2002 in infants with NP after open-heart surgery, there was a trend of increasing frequency of multiresistant GNB such as A baumanii, P aeruginosa, and K pneumoniae. However, no remarkable changes of distribution were found in Gram-positive cocci and fungi in the 3-year period. Early onset episodes of NP were frequently caused by Haemophilus influenzae, methicillin-sensitive S aureus, and other susceptible Enterobacteriaceae. Conversely, in patients who acquired late-onset NP, P aeruginosa, A baumannii, other multiresistant GNB, MRSA, and fungi were the predominant organisms. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of pathogens and their antibiotic-resistance patterns in NP in infants after cardiac surgery had not shown an increasing prevalence of Gram-positive pathogens as reported by several adult ICUs. GNB still remained the most common pathogens during the last 3 years in our hospital. There was a trend of increasing antibiotic resistance in these isolates.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia in a multi-hospital system: differences in microbiology by location.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there were differences in the microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia in different clinical settings. DESIGN: Observational retrospective cohort study of microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia from 1998 to 2001 in a multi-hospital system. Microbiologic results were compared between hospitals and between different intensive care units (ICUs) within hospitals. SETTING: Three hospitals--one pediatric teaching hospital, one adult teaching hospital, and one community hospital--in one healthcare system in the midwestern United States. PATIENTS: Patients at the target hospitals who developed ventilator-associated pneumonia and for whom microbiologic data were available. RESULTS: Seven hundred fifty-three episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia had culture data available for review. The most common organisms at all hospitals were Staphylococcus aureus (28.4%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (25.2%). The pediatric hospital had higher proportions of Escherichia coli (9.5% vs 2.3%; P < .001) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (13% vs 3.1%; P < .001) than did the adult hospitals. In the pediatric hospital, the pediatric ICU had higher P aeruginosa rates than did the neonatal ICU (33.3% vs 17%; P = .01). In the adult hospitals, the surgical ICU had higher Acinetobacter baumannii rates (10.2% vs. 1.7%; P < .001) than did the other ICUs. CONCLUSIONS: Microbiologic etiologies of ventilator-associated pneumonia vary between and within hospitals. Knowledge of these differences can improve selection of initial antimicrobial regimens, which may decrease mortality.
TI  - Pneumonia in the intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To update the state-of-the-art on pneumonia in adult patients in the intensive care unit (ICU), with special emphasis on new developments in management. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, using the following keywords: hospital-acquired pneumonia, ventilator-associated pneumonia and healthcare-associated pneumonia, diagnosis, therapy, prevention. RESULTS: Interventions to prevent pneumonia in the ICU should combine multiple measures targeting the invasive devices, microorganisms, and protection of the patient. Once pneumonia develops, the appropriateness of the initial antibiotic regimen is a vital determinant of outcome. Three questions should be formulated: a) Is the patient at risk of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus?; b) Is Acinetobacter baumannii a problem in the institution?; and c) is the patient at risk of Pseudomonas aeruginosa? Antibiotic therapy should be started immediately and must circumvent pathogen-resistance mechanisms developed after previous antibiotic exposure. Therefore, antibiotic choice should be institution specific and patient oriented. Microbiologic investigation is useful on evaluating the quality of the respiratory sample and permits early modification of the regimen in light of the microbiologic findings. CONCLUSION: A decision tree outlining an approach to the evaluation and management of ventilator-associated pneumonia is provided.
TI  - The threat from the pink corner.
AB  - In terms of numbers of isolates, the greatest present resistance problems arise with gram-positive pathogens (which stain purple/black in Gram's method), especially methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). But, is the MRSA problem--by its size--blinding us to something ultimately more dangerous: the slow emergence of gram-negative pathogens (which stain pink) with resistance to all reliable antibiotics? Although presently rare, 'pan-resistant' gram-negative bacteria--predominantly strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii--have more comprehensive resistance than any gram-positive pathogen. They already pose treatment problems in compromised hospital patients, especially in specialist units, as well in particular groups, such as cystic fibrosis patents. Disturbingly, there is a near-total lack of developmental antibiotics active against gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Presence of the Tet M determinant in a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii.
AB  - The tet(M) gene encodes a protein which is related to tetracycline ribosomal protection, one of the mechanisms of tetracycline resistance. A tet(M) gene that is 100% homologous to the tet(M) gene of Staphylococcus aureus has been found in a clinical isolate of Acinetobacter baumannii, which also carries the tet(A) gene encoding a tetracycline efflux pump.
TI  - Criteria of time and antibiotic susceptibility in the elimination of duplicates when calculating resistance frequencies.
AB  - We studied the effects of various systems of eliminating repeat isolates on the absolute number and susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus isolates over a 2 year period. The criterion of time is objective and reproducible, whereas that of variation in antibiotic susceptibility detects variations in the susceptibility of microorganisms that acquire resistance during treatment, but may be affected by methodological errors in determining the antibiotic susceptibility. These tools are useful in the control of multi-resistant bacteria and enable the true situation regarding antibiotic resistance in each geographical area to be determined.
TI  - Impact of antibiotic-resistant pathogens colonizing the respiratory secretions of patients in an extended-care area of the emergency department.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the incidence of acquired infection, and the incidence, risk factors, and molecular typing of multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms (MROs) colonizing respiratory secretions or the oropharynx of patients in an extended-care area of the emergency department (ED) in a tertiary-care university hospital. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted regarding risk factors for colonization with MROs in ED patients from July 1996 to August 1998. The most prevalent MRO strains were determined using plasmid and genomic analysis with PFGE. RESULTS: MROs colonized 59 (25.4%) of 232 ED patients and 173 controls. The mean ED length of stay for the 59 cases was 13.9 days versus 9.8 days for the 173 controls. The mean length of stay prior to the first isolation of MROs was 9.9 days. MRO species included Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The rate of hospital-acquired infection was 32.7 per 1,000 ED patient-days. The case fatality rate was significantly higher for cases. Univariate analysis identified mechanical ventilation, nebulization, nasogastric intubation, urinary catheterization, antibiotic therapy, and number of antibiotics as risk factors for MRO colonization. Multivariate regression analysis found that mechanical ventilation and nasogastric intubation independently predicted MRO colonization. Endemic clones were identified by PFGE in ED patients and were also found in patients in other parts of the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged stay in the ED posed a risk for colonization with MROs and for contracting nosocomial infections, both of which were associated with increased mortality. Patients colonized with antibiotic-resistant A. baumannii may serve as a reservoir for spread in this hospital.
TI  - Photodynamic effects of antioxidant substituted porphyrin photosensitizers on gram-positive and -negative bacterial.
AB  - Photodynamic treatment of the gram-negative bacteria Escherichia coli B and Acinetobacter baumannii and the gram-positive bacterium Staphylococcus aureus was performed using two newly devised and synthesized antioxidant carrier photosensitizers (antioxidant carrier sensitizers-2 [ACS-2] and antioxidant carrier sensitizers-3 [ACS-3]), which are butyl hydroxy toluene and propyl gallate substituted haematoporphyrins, respectively. It was found that ACS-2 is less reactive than other photosensitizers previously used for the same purpose, whereas ACS-3 is very effective against the multidrug-resistant bacterium A. baumannii, causing its complete eradication at a low fluence (approximately 7.5 J/cm2) of blue light (407-420 nm) and a low concentration (10 microM). At a higher fluence (approximately 37.5 J/cm2) complete eradication of E. coli B can be obtained under the same conditions. Furthermore, X-ray microanalysis and ultrastructural changes indicate that ACS-3, especially in the case of photodynamic treatment of A. baumannii, interferes with membrane functions and causes the inactivation of the bacterium. ACS-3 may be suggested as a specific photosensitization agent for photoinactivation of gram-negative bacteria.
TI  - In vitro activity of azithromycin in combination with amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or imipenem against clinical isolates of Acinobacter baumannii.
AB  - The in vitro activity of the two-drug combinations of azithromycin with amikacin, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin or imipenem against five clonally unrelated strains of Acinobacter baumannii were evaluated. Synergy studies were performed by the checkerboard microtiter method. The fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) index was calculated for each drug combination. None of the four combinations tested was antagonistic. The combination of azithromycin and ceftazidime was synergistic (FIC index <or=0.5) for one strain and partially synergistic (FIC index 0.75) for another strain. An additive effect (FIC index = 1) was observed for the combinations of azithromycin with imipenem (two strains) or ceftazidime (one strain). The activities of the other combinations were indifferent (FIC index range from 1.5 to 2.5). It is concluded that azithromycin combined with ceftazidime has moderate synergistic activity against some multiresistant A. baumannii.
TI  - Bronchoalveolar interleukin-1 beta: a marker of bacterial burden in mechanically  ventilated patients with community-acquired pneumonia.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between concentrations of bronchoalveolar cytokines and bacterial burden (quantitative bacterial count) in intubated patients with a presumptive diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. DESIGN: A cross-sectional and clinical investigation. SETTING Medical/surgical and respiratory intensive care unit of a tertiary 1,200-bed medical center. PATIENTS: According to the time course of community-acquired pneumonia at the time of study with bronchoalveolar lavage, 69 mechanically ventilated patients were divided into three subgroups: primary (n = 11), referral (n = 23), and treated (n = 35) community-acquired pneumonia. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoalveolar lavage was performed in the most abnormal area on chest radiograph by fiberoptic bronchoscope. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was processed for quantitative bacterial culture. The concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 beta, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, and interleukin-10) also were measured. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-two patients had a positive bacterial culture (bronchoalveolar lavage > or = 10 colony-forming units/mL)., and made up 76% of pathogens recovered at high concentrations. The concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta were 199.1 +/- 32.1 and 54.9 +/- 13.0 pg/mL (mean +/- se) in the patients with positive and negative bacterial culture, respectively (p < .001). Bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin- 1 beta was significantly higher in the patients with a high bacterial burden (p < .001), with mixed bacterial infection (p < .001), and with pneumonia (p < .001), compared with values in patients without these features. The relationship between bacterial load and concentrations of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was very strong in the patients with primary and referral community-acquired pneumonia but was borderline in treated community-acquired pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: The common pathogens were similar to the core pathogens of hospital-acquired pneumonia, probably due to antibiotic effects, delayed sampling, and superimposed nosocomial infection. Since the concentration of bronchoalveolar lavage interleukin-1 beta was correlated with bacterial burden in the alveoli, it may be a marker for progressive and ongoing inflammation in patients who have not responded to pneumonia therapy and who have persistence of bacteria in the lung.
TI  - Neonatal sepsis: high antibiotic resistance of the bacterial pathogens in a neonatal intensive care unit in Karachi.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the bacterial pathogens causing neonatal sepsis and their sensitivity pattern so that guidelines can be prepared for empirical antibiotic therapy. SETTING: The study was conducted in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at PNS Shifa (Naval Hospital), Karachi during January 1997 to June 1999. METHODS: Blood specimens for culture were drawn from 520 newborns admitted in a NICU with sepsis. The specimens were inoculated into brain heart infusion broth. Subcultures were performed on days 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 and 10. The isolates were identified by standard biochemical tests. Antibiotic resistance pattern of the isolates was studied by Modified Kirby Baur disc diffusion technique. RESULTS: A total of 212 organisms were isolated. These included Staphylococcus aureus (n = 65), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 73), Acinetobacter baumannii (n = 23), Escherichia coli (n = 22), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 18), Citrobacter diversus (n = 5), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 4) and group B Streptococcus (n = 2). On antibiotic sensitivity testing, 61.54% of Staphylococcus aureus isolates were found to be methicillin resistant. Susceptibility to the other common drugs was also quite low while 89.23% of these were susceptible to amikacin and 100% to vancomycin. More than 90% gram negative rods were resistant to ampicillin and co-trimoxazole. Resistance to gentamicin was as high as 90.4% for Klebsiella pneumoniae; 60.87% for Acinetobacter baumannii. Resistance to the third generation cephalosporins and the quinolone tested (ciprofloxacin) varied between 25-75%. Majority of the isolates were susceptible to meropenem and amikacin. CONCLUSION: In view of the isolation of highly antibiotic resistant organisms, vancomycin in combination with amikacin or a carbapenem is the drug of choice for empirically treating neonatal sepsis.
TI  - Evaluation of dedicated stethoscopes as a potential source of nosocomial pathogens.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the ear tips of dedicated stethoscopes (DS) that  are used on patients prescribed contact precautions for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii become contaminated with these micro-organisms. DESIGN: Culture of DS ear tips. SETTING: A 524-bed tertiary care university hospital. METHODS: DS ear tips were inoculated directly onto bacteriologic media and incubated for 48 to 72 hours. Growth of more than 10 colonies from the 2 ear tips collectively was indicative of contamination. RESULTS: Ear tips of 78 DS from 69 patients were cultured. Ear tips from 17% (13/78) of the DS were contaminated with potentially pathogenic bacteria: 2 with S aureus (1 MRSA), 1 with E faecalis, 7 with Acinetobacter species, 2 with Pseudomonas species, 1 with Escherichia coli, and 1 with Moraxella. None of the stethoscope ear tips was contaminated with the same pathogen for which the patient was prescribed contact precautions (95% CI, 0-3.8%). CONCLUSION: Although the ear tips of DS from patients who were prescribed contact precautions for MRSA, vancomycin-resistant E faecium, or multiple antibiotic-resistant A baumannii were not contaminated with the indicated nosocomial pathogen, 94% of the evaluable ear tips were contaminated, including with MRSA (1.3%) and Acinetobacter (11%). Regular disinfection of ear tips of DS between users should be considered.
TI  - Sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles in the detection of cornea organ culture media contamination by bacteria and fungi.
AB  - AIMS: To test the bactericidal activity of standard organ culture medium, and to  compare the sensitivity and rapidity of blood culture bottles with conventional microbiological methods for detection of bacteria and fungi inoculated in a standard cornea organ culture medium. METHODS: The bactericidal activity of contaminated standard organ culture medium containing 100 IU/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, and 0.25 micro g/ml amphotericin B was evaluated after 48 hours of incubation at 31 degrees C with five inocula of 14 bacteria. Two yeasts (Candida spp) and one Aspergillus were also tested. Contaminated media were then inoculated in three blood bottles (aerobic, anaerobic, fungal) placed in a Bactec 9240 automat; three conventional microbiological broths were the control. Changes in colour of organ culture medium and growth on conventional broth were screened daily by visual inspection. The sensitivity and rapidity of detection of contamination were compared between the three methods: blood bottle, conventional, and visual. RESULTS: Organ culture medium eradicated five bacteria irrespective of the starting inoculums: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Branhamella catarrhalis, Escherichia coli, Propionibacterium acnes, and Haemophilus influenzae. For micro-organisms where the medium was ineffective or bactericidal only (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Staphylococcus haemolyticus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Bacillus subtilis, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Candida albicans, Candida kruzei, Aspergillus fumigatus), the blood bottle, conventional, and visual methods detected microbial growth in 100%, 76.5%, and 70% of cases respectively. Mean detection time using blood bottles was 15.1 hours (SD 13.8, range 2-52). In cases of detection by the blood bottle method and the conventional method, the former was always faster: 95.5% against 65.2% detection within 24 hours (p=0.022) respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Blood bottles detect more efficiently and more rapidly a wider range of bacteria and fungi than the conventional microbiological method and the visual inspection of organ culture media.
TI  - [Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance: VIRA Study].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to antimicrobial drugs has increased in recent years. The aim of this multicenter study was to determine the current situation in Spain regarding the resistance patterns of the most common infectious agents to antimicrobial drugs. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total 1,475 strains isolated in 38 hospitals in October 2001 were studied. These included 294 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), 149 clinically significant coagulase-negative staphylococci (CNS), 96 Enterococcus faecium, 1 ampicillin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, 204 penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, 100 ampicillin-resistant Haemophilus influenzae, 361 ciprofloxacin-resistant Escherichia coli, 160 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 110 Acinetobacter baumannii. Sensitivity to various antibiotics was studied by a broth microdilution method. Additionally, an epidemiologic survey was conducted in the participating hospitals to determine the incidence of these multi-drug resistant microorganisms. RESULTS: Overall incidence of ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli and MRSA strains was 24% in both cases. The pneumococci were resistant to several antibiotics. Telithromycin showed excellent activity against all the pneumococci, including those resistant to macrolides. Most MRSA isolates were resistant to quinolones and macrolides. All the staphylococci were susceptible to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin. Only 50% of A. baumannii strains were susceptible to imipenem. CONCLUSION: The results of this study evidence increasing multi-drug resistance among various microorganisms, such as MRSA, CNS, ampicillin-resistant enterococci, and penicillin-resistant pneumococci, and underline the need for surveillance programs to gain information on this significant therapeutic problem.
TI  - Preassembly of membrane-active peptides is an important factor in their selectivity toward target cells.
AB  - Membrane-active peptides comprise a large group of toxins used in the defense and offense systems of all organisms including plants and humans. They act on diverse targets including microorganisms and mammalian cells, but the factors that determine their target cell selectivity are not yet clear. Here, we tested the role of peptide length and preassembly on the ability of diastereomeric cationic antimicrobial peptides to discriminate among bacteria, erythrocytes, and fungal cells, by using peptides with variable lengths (13, 16, and 19 amino acids long) and their covalently linked pentameric bundles. All the bundles expressed similar potent antifungal activity (minimal inhibitory concentration of 0.2-0.3 microM) and high antimicrobial activity. Hemolytic activity was also observed at concentrations higher than those required for antifungal activity. In contrast, all the monomers showed length-dependent antimicrobial activity, were less active toward bacteria and fungi, and were devoid of hemolytic activity. BIAcore biosensor experiments revealed a approximately 300-fold increase in peptide-membrane binding affinity between the 13- and 19-residue monomers toward zwitterionic (egg phosphatidylcholine (PC)/egg spingomyelin (SM)/cholesterol) vesicles. All the monomeric peptides display a similar high affinity to negatively charged (E. coli phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)/egg phosphatidylglycerol (PG)) vesicles regardless of their length. In contrast, irrespective of the size of the monomeric subunit, all the bundles bind irreversibly and strongly disrupt both PC/SM/cholesterol and PE/PG membranes. Attenuated total reflectance Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that peptide assembly also affects structure as observed by an increased alpha-helical and beta-sheet content in membranes and enhances acyl chain disruption of PC/cholesterol. The correlation between the antibacterial activity and ability to depolarize the transmembrane potential of E. coli spheroplasts, as well as the ability to induce calcein release from vesicles, suggests that the bacterial membrane is their target. The data demonstrate that preassembly of cationic diastereomeric antimicrobial peptides is an essential factor in their membrane targeting.
TI  - Quantitative culture of endotracheal aspirates in the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients with treatment failure.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVE: To study the correlation of bacteriology between quantitative cultures of protected specimen brush (PSB), BAL, and quantitative endotracheal aspirate (QEA) in ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) patients with treatment failure. DESIGN: Prospective observational clinical study. SETTING: A 15-bed medical ICU of tertiary medical center. PATIENTS: Forty-eight patients receiving mechanical ventilation with clinical suspected VAP who had been treated with antibiotics for at least 72 h without improvement. INTERVENTION: QEA, PSB, and BAL were performed with patients receiving antibiotics. The diagnostic thresholds for QEA, PSB, and BAL were 10(5), 10(3), and 10(4) cfu/mL, respectively. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Microbial culture findings were positive in 24 BAL samples (50%), in 23 PSB samples (48%), and in 28 QEA samples (58%). The correlations between of QEA vs PSB and QEA vs BAL were significant (rho = 0.567 and rho = 0.620, p < 0.01, respectively). The most commonly isolated microorganisms were Acinetobacter baumannii (27%), Staphylococcus aureus (24%), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (15%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (10%). Using the predetermined criteria, bacterial pneumonia was diagnosed in 28 of 48 suspected VAP episodes based on PSB and/or BAL results. The diagnostic efficiency of QEA at threshold of 10(5) cfu/mL had a sensitivity of 92.8% and a specificity of 80%. CONCLUSIONS: QEA correlated with PSB and BAL in patients with suspected VAP who responded poorly to the existent antibiotic treatment. QEA missed only two cases of bacterial pneumonia diagnosed by invasive PSB and/or BAL with acceptable sensitivity and specificity. More importantly, QEA is noninvasive and easily repeatable. Early use of QEA is helpful to clinical physicians in decision making with regard to antibiotics use.
TI  - Association between intensity of chlorhexidine use and micro-organisms of reduced susceptibility in a hospital environment.
AB  - The potential for emergence of resistance to biocides has been a concern in recent years. This study tested whether an association exists between the intensity of chlorhexidine use and chlorhexidine susceptibility of micro-organisms isolated from patients in different clinical areas in an acute-care general hospital. Organisms frequently involved in nosocomial infections in the hospital were chosen for study over a six week period: Staphylococcus aureus (60 isolates), coagulase-negative staphylococci (48), Klebsiella pneumoniae (32), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (60), Acinetobacter baumannii (16) and Candida albicans (35). An index of chlorhexidine exposure for each clinical unit was derived for the year preceding organism collection. Chlorhexidine susceptibility was evaluated using agar incorporation minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and disk diffusion. A statistically significant inverse correlation was shown between intensity of chlorhexidine use and the overall susceptibility of all study organisms taken together. There was no association when individual taxa were considered. These findings must be interpreted with caution considering that greater use of chlorhexidine is likely to occur in difficult clinical disciplines where antibiotic use, invasive procedures and other intensive care-related procedures, cross-infection and immunosuppression are all potential confounding factors. There was an excellent correlation between MICs and disk testing, suggesting that disk diffusion might be useful in studies involving more than one biocide.
TI  - Community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults: the epidemiology, timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and prognostic factors.
AB  - Between January 1986 and December 1999, 109 adult patients with culture-proven community-acquired bacterial meningitis were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. To compare changes over time, the appearance of disease among our patients was divided into two equal time periods: an earlier time period (1986-1992) and a later time period (1993-1999). In this study, there was a decreasing proportion of community-acquired bacterial meningitis compared with nosocomial bacterial meningitis in adult patients in recent years. Its proportion declined dramatically from 81% in the earlier 7 years to 37% in the later 7 years. Of the pathogens, Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae was the most frequently implicated pathogen, followed by Viridans (V.) streptococci, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Staphylococcus aureus. Other rare organisms including Acinetobacter baumannii, Salmonella Group B and D, Proteus mirabilis, Group B, D, and non-A, non-B and non-D streptococci, and coagulase-negative staphylococci emerged during the second period. There was a decrease in the mortality rate from 44% in the first to 34% in the second time period, but the overall mortality rate remained high. Of the implicated pathogens, patients infected with V. streptococci had a consistently favorable prognosis, while a dramatic decrease in the mortality rate of those infected with K. pneumoniae was seen in recent years. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, only the presence of septic shock and seizures was independently associated with mortality. The timing of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, as defined by consciousness level, was a major determinant of survival and neurological outcomes for patients with community-acquired bacterial meningitis, and the first dose of an appropriate antibiotic should be administrated before a patient's consciousness deteriorates to a Glasgow coma scale score lower than 10.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of ertapenem against aerobic bacterial pathogens  isolated from patients with complicated intra-abdominal infections.
AB  - The in vitro activities of ertapenem, ceftriaxone, amoxicillin-clavulanate, ampicillin-sulbactam, and piperacillin-tazobactam were compared against 1018 aerobic bacterial pathogens isolated from 531 patients with complicated intra-abdominal infection. Enterobacteriaceae accounted for 66.3% of the aerobic bacteria; Escherichia coli was the most common isolate. The ertapenem minimal inhibitory concentration was < or = 2 microg/mL for 74.6% of isolates and > or = 8 microg/mL for 21.9% (including isolates of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). Against Enterobacteriaceae, ertapenem was the most potent and the most active drug evaluated (100% susceptible), followed by ceftriaxone (98% susceptible), piperacillin-tazobactam (96% susceptible), amoxicillin-clavulanate (80% susceptible), and ampicillin-sulbactam (64% susceptible). Piperacillin-tazobactam was the only drug evaluated with clinically useful activity against P. aeruginosa. In summary, ertapenem was highly active in vitro against many clinically important aerobic intra-abdominal bacterial pathogens, especially Enterobacteriaceae.
TI  - Antibiotic resistance as an indicator of bacterial chlorhexidine susceptibility.
AB  - The antibiotic and chlorhexidine (CHX) susceptibility of 70 distinct clinical isolates: Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus (not MRSA), Streptococcus pyogenes and Enterococcus faecalis (10 of each) were tested using minimal bactericidal (MBC) and/or minimal inhibitory (MIC) concentrations. Non-fermentative bacteria tolerated CHX at high concentrations; Gram-positive cocci, especially S. pyogenes, were the most susceptible. We found a good correlation between CHX and antibiotic susceptibility in both MIC and MBC among Gram-negative bacteria, and mainly in MBC among Gram-positive bacteria. Resistance to ciprofloxacin, imipenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, gentamicin and aztreonam appeared to indicate increased CHX resistance among Gram-negative bacteria. This finding gives clinicians the ability to predict CHX susceptibility according to routine antibiotic resistance testing.
TI  - Pneumonia in multiple injured patients: a prospective controlled trial on early prediction using clinical and immunological parameters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: In a prospective trial 266 multiple injured patients were included to evaluate clinical risk factors and immune parameters related to pneumonia. METHODS: Clinical and humoral parameters were assessed and multivariate analysis performed. RESULTS: The multivariate analysis (odds ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI)) revealed male gender (3.65), traumatic brain injury (TBI) (2.52), thorax trauma (AIS(thorax) > or = 3) (2.05), antibiotic prophylaxis (1.30), injury severity score (ISS) (1.03 per ISS point) and the age (1.02 per year) as risk factors for pneumonia. The main pathogens were Acinetobacter Baumannii (40%) and Staphylococcus aureus (25%). A tendency towards higher Procalcitonin (PCT) and Interleukin (IL)-6 levels two days after trauma was observed for pneumonia patients. CONCLUSION: The immune parameters (PCT, IL-6, IL-10, soluble tumor necrosis factor p-55 and p-75) could not confirm the diagnosis of pneumonia earlier than the clinical parameters.
TI  - [Etiology of hospital-acquired infections in Spanish hospitals (EPINE, 1990-1999)].
AB  - BACKGROUND: Clinical and demographic characteristics of patients, their interaction with pathogens and antimicrobial therapies are prompting changes in the epidemiology of hospital-acquired infections (HI). The knowledge of the etiology of hospital-acquired infections is valuable for the treatment of infected patients and for the prevention of HI. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We analyzed a series of 10 annual prevalence studies during the period 1990-1999 (EPINE project) in Spanish hospitals. Estimate of prevalence of infection was calculated by means of the percent distribution of every organism regarding overall identified organisms and infections. RESULTS: 40,550 HI were identified among 484,013 patients (HI prevalence = 8.4%; 95% CI, 8.3-8.5%). Gram-positive organism predominated steadily in bloodstream and surgical wound infections, while gram-negative bacilli predominated in respiratory and urinary tract infections. There was an increase in HI infections by Acinetobacter baumannii (from 1.9% in 1990 to 3.6% in 1999; P < 0.001) and Candida albicans (from 2.4 to 3.2%; P < 0.001), as well as an increase in both HI and community-acquired infections by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [HI: from 4.7 to 40.2% (P < 0.001); community-acquired: from 2.7 to 15.6% (P < 0.001)]. CONCLUSIONS: We observed some changes in the etiology of infections over the last decade: rates of methicillin-resistant S. aureus hospital-acquired and community-acquired infections increased steadily and their initial rates multiplied by 8 and 6, respectively. Rates of HI caused by yeasts and A. baumannii increased also.
TI  - Hospital-acquired infections following the 1999 Marmara earthquake.
AB  - In this study, medical records of all casualties admitted to our hospital following the Marmara earthquake, which struck northwest Turkey and resulted in the destruction of several towns in the Marmara region, were evaluated retrospectively. The time buried under the rubble, demographic data, type of medical and surgical therapies performed, type of injury and data on infection were analysed. Between 17 August and 25 September 1999, 630 trauma victims were received at our hospital and 532 (84%) of them were hospitalized. The mean age of hospitalized patients (312 males, 220 females) was 32 years (2-90 years). Two hundred and twenty patients were hospitalized for more than 48 h. Forty-one of them (18.6%) had 43 hospital-acquired infection (HAI) episodes, which were mostly wound infections (46.5%). A total of 143 culture specimens was collected and 48 yielded the following potential pathogens: 15 Acinetobacter baumanii (31.2%), nine Staphylococcus aureus (18.7%), seven Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.6%), six Escherichia coli (12.5%), six Klebsiella pneumoniae (12.5%), two Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (4.2%) and three various Pseudomonas spp. (6.3%). All S. aureus strains were found to be resistant to methicillin in vitro. Two strains of A. baumannii and one P. aeruginosa were found to be resistant to all antimicrobials including carbapenems. Fifty-three victims died (10%) and 36 of those died during the first 48 h because of severe injuries and multi-organ failure. After 48 h of hospitalization, the mortality rate was significantly higher in those patients with HAI (14/41) than those without (3/179) (34.1% vs. 1.7%, P<0.05). In conclusion, trauma is the significant factor associated with HAI and a high incidence of Acinetobacter strains was responsible for HAI in trauma patients.
TI  - [Prevalance of nosocomial infections in tetraplegic upper extremity surgery. Prospective study of twenty patients].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Many risk factors of nosocomial infection may be met with tetraplegic patients. The objective of this work was to study the prevalence of colonization by 3 multiresistants bacteria (methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Klebsiella pneumoniae with widened spectrum beta lactamase or multi-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii) on this population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: It was about a prospective study for which we included 20 consecutive patients coming from a rehabilitation of long stay center to have a surgical operation of palliative reanimation of the upper limb. For each patient, the first morning of his hospitalization, many sites cultures were carried out for bacteriological analysis whose results were returned in 48 h to the operator. No patient was excluded. RESULTS: Five patients (25%) showed the presence of SARM. One patient (5%) showed the presence of Klebsiela pneumoniae. One of the patients carrying a SARM was also carrying Acinetobacter baumannii. Overall 6 patients were contaminated (30%) but no postoperative infection occurred, neither at the time of the hospitalization nor after the exit of the service. DISCUSSION: The various risk factors of nosocomial infection appearance met in tetraplegic patient were analyzed. This study showed that the cares of tetraplegic patients limited to the maximum the risk of nosocomial infection appearance (no one in this series) in spite of an important contamination met in this type of population which presents long durations of hospitalization, main risk factor regularly met.
TI  - [Monitoring the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria in microbiology laboratories using Bacterio software].
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Since 1997, the microbiology laboratory of the hospital center in Lens has monitored hospital ecology and epidemiology to provide rapid information that help to adapt probabilistic antibiotherapy and to estimate the impact of hygienic preventive measures on the incidence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB). METHODS: Monitoring with statistical software (Epi-Info) could be pursued and improved on with Bacterio, a specific software for microbiology laboratories. We studied the incidence of MRB not only in clinical specimens but also in ecologic specimens to detect BMR colonization. RESULTS: In the year 2000, the incidence reached 4.11 for 1000 hospitalization days and 3.34 for 100 admissions. This clearly differed from clinical activity. From 1998 to 2000 the incidence of BMR remained stable. BMR was detected within 48 hours after admission in 22.9% of cases. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ticarcillin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common BMR in our hospital. Extended broad spectrum beta-lactamase enterobacterii and Acinetobacter baumannii represented respectively 23% and 13% of the MRB. Stenotrophomonas maltophilia represented a minority and no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found. CONCLUSION: Bacterio is a software well adapted to the use of microbiological data banks. Continuous monitoring of the incidence of BMR is very useful in the clinical care and hospital hygiene units.
TI  - How many nosocomial infections are associated with cross-transmission? A prospective cohort study in a surgical intensive care unit.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the percentage of cross-transmissions in an intensive care unit (ICU) with high nosocomial infection (NI) rates according to the data of the German Nosocomial Infection Surveillance System. SETTING: A 14-bed surgical ICU of a 1,300-bed, tertiary-care teaching hospital. METHOD: Prospective surveillance of NIs during a period of 9 months. If an NI was present, the isolates of the following indicator pathogens were stored and typed by species: Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus species, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacter species. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed for typing of S. aureus strains and arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction was applied for the other pathogens. The presence of two indistinguishable strains in two patients was considered as one episode of cross-transmission. RESULTS: Two hundred sixty-two patients were observed during a period of 2,444 patient-days; 96 NIs were identified in 59 patients and the overall incidence density of NI was 39.3 per 1,000 patient-days. For 104 isolates, it was possible to consider typing results. Altogether, 36 cross-transmissions have lead to NIs in other patients. That means at least 37.5% of all NIs identified were due to cross-transmissions. CONCLUSION: Because of the method of this study, the percentage of NIs due to cross-transmission identified for this ICU is an "at least number." In reality, the number of cross-transmissions, and thus the number of avoidable infections, may have been even higher. However, it is difficult to assess whether the percentage of NIs due to cross-transmission determined for this ICU may be the crucial explanation for the relatively high infection rate in comparison to other surgical ICUs.
TI  - The cost of antibiotic resistance: effect of resistance among Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudmonas aeruginosa on length of hospital stay.
AB  - To assess the effect of antimicrobial resistance on length of hospital stay, a case-control study compared infections due to four nosocomial pathogens. Significantly increased lengths of stay were associated with infections due to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae, and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Infections with resistant pathogens are associated with prolonged hospitalization.
TI  - [Effectiveness of contact isolation in the control of multiresistant bacteria in  an intensive care service].
AB  - AIM: To describe the frequency, characteristics and progression of critically ill patients admitted to the ICU, for whom isolation is indicated due to detection of multiresistant pathogenic bacteria, and to study the effectiveness of precautionary measures to avoid dissemination of these microorganisms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective, observational, cohort study performed by a specially created working group of four nurses and an ICU specialist. The study included 55 patients in whom contact isolation was indicated (isolation rate, 15.2 per 100 patients), collected over a 16-month period. RESULTS: The multiresistant bacteria responsible for isolation of the patients were: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17 cases), Staphylococcus aureus (17 cases), Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (15 cases), Acinetobacter baumannii (4 cases) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)- producing Enterobacteria (2 cases). Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp. was not identified in any case. The mean duration of ICU isolation was 17.6 6 5.1 days (range 1-75). Multiresistant bacteria were classified as intra-ICU nosocomial in 39 cases (70.9%), extra-ICU nosocomial in 10 cases (18.2%) and community-acquired in 6 (10.9%). During the study period, no epidemic outbreak due to any of the controlled bacteria was detected. The multiresistant bacteria presented in the form of colonization in 41 cases (74.5%). The reasons for discontinuing isolation were death of the patient in 18 cases, transferal to a hospital ward (discharge from the ICU) in 19 cases, and eradication of the bacteria in 18 cases. Of the 55 patients with multiresistant bacteria, 35 (63.6%) died during hospitalization, and 23 of these (41.8%) during their stay in the ICU. CONCLUSIONS: The implementation of a working team for early detection of multiresistant pathogenic bacteria resulted in application of contact isolation in 15.2% of patients admitted. Surveillance to fulfill isolation precautions in a medical-surgical ICU achieved an absence of epidemic outbreaks due to these bacteria during the study period.
TI  - In vitro activities of tigecycline (GAR-936) against recently isolated clinical bacteria in Spain.
AB  - The antimicrobial activities of tigecycline (GAR-936) were compared with those of other agents against 1,087 strains recently isolated in 12 Spanish medical centers. Tigecycline showed activity against a wide spectrum of aerobic and anaerobic bacteria, including strains such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, coagulase-negative staphylococci, penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia.
TI  - Multicenter surveillance of antimicrobial resistance of major bacterial pathogens in intensive care units in 2000 in Taiwan.
AB  - A susceptibility surveillance study of 1,274 bacterial isolates recovered from various clinical specimens from patients in intensive care units (ICUs) of five major teaching hospitals was carried out from March, 2000, to June, 2000, in Taiwan. This study demonstrated a high rate (66%) of oxacillin resistance in Staphylococcus aureus (ORSA), a high rate of nonsusceptibility to penicillin (intermediate, 50% and highly resistant, 8%), and high rates of cefotaxime nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (intermediate, 29% and resistant, 4%), Enterobacter cloacae (57%), Serratia marcescens (34%), and Citrobacter freundii (60%). High rate of ceftazidime nonsusceptibility for Pseudomonas aeruginosa (22%), and high rates of imipenem nonsusceptibility for P. aeruginosa (15%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (22%) were also found. The percentage (11.9%) of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli was greater than that (11.3%) for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Rates of quinupristin-dalfopristin nonsusceptibility for S. pneumoniae (42%), Enterococcus faecium (71%), and ORSA (39%) were high, but no vancomycin-resistant enterococci were found in this study. The resistance rates of some pathogen varied by institution or type of ICUs. Surveillance for antimicrobial resistance among bacterial pathogens in hospitals, particularly in ICU settings with a preexisting higher resistance burden, is mandatory in establishing and/or modifying guidelines for empirical treatment of severe infections in ICU patients caused by these antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against local bacterial isolates.
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of resistance to common antimicrobials in bacteria has been increasingly reported in various countries. Empirical antimicrobial therapy of various infections would therefore need to be reviewed. The introduction of new fluoroquinolones has created an interest in the use of these as possible agents in the empirical treatment of respiratory tract infections. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of the new fluoroquinolone, moxifloxacin, against 400 clinical bacterial isolates was determined by the E-test method. RESULTS: All Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates (penicillin sensitive or resistant) were susceptible to moxifloxacin. Similarly, both beta-lactamase and non beta-lactamase producing Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis isolates were susceptible to moxifloxacin. As for Enterobacteriaceae, 88.6% of the isolates tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin with MIC < 8 mg/L, but resistance was noted for some of Proteus mirabilis, Klebsiella spp. and Escherichia coli. Enterococci and Acinetobacter baumannii were resistant to moxifloxacin, whilst the anaerobes tested were susceptible to moxifloxacin. CONCLUSION: Moxifloxacin has good in vitro activity against common organisms associated with community and nosocomial infections, with the exception of enterococci, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ciprofloxacin-resistant gram-negative bacteria. There was good anti-anaerobic activity against Bacteroides fragilis and Clostridum spp. Results of this study are consistent with other similar published in vitro studies.
TI  - Present situation of antimicrobial resistance in Korea.
AB  - Resistance of bacteria to antimicrobial agents is a worldwide concern. In Korea,  resistant bacteria are more prevalent than in other industrialized countries. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, erythromycin-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, penicillin non-susceptible pneumococci, beta-lactamase-producing gonococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, class C beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli, and aminoglycoside-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are examples of resistant bacteria prevalent in Korea, and their presence suggests a high level of antimicrobial selective pressure and the nosocomial spread of resistant bacteria. Recently observed rapid increases in the incidence of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium and carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa present new threats in Korea.
TI  - In-vitro antibacterial activities of cefpiramide and other broad-spectrum antibiotics against 440 clinical isolates in China.
AB  - The in-vitro antibacterial activity of cefpiramide was compared with those of 15  other broad-spectrum cephalosporins. A total of 440 clinical strains of bacteria, including 9 bacterial species, were isolated from our hospital in 1998. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of cefpiramide and five other antibiotics were determined for each species, using the agar-dilution method. The MIC of cefpiramide for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae was higher than those of three other third-generation cephalosporins, (ie, cefoperazone, ceftazidime, and ceftriaxone). Fifty-one percent (26/51) of Enterobacter cloacae isolates were resistant to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam and cefepime had greater activity against E. cloacae (resistance, 3.9% and 19.6%, respectively) than cefpiramide. Cefpiramide was more active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (resistance rates, 12%) than cefoperazone, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, aztreonam, and cefepime. Cefpiramide-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were resistant to ceftazidime, but 27% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were susceptible to cefpiramide; 15.3% of cefpiramide-resistant S. maltophilia strains were also susceptible to ceftazidime, but 50% of ceftazidime-resistant strains were still susceptible to cefpiramide. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was the most active agent against Acinetobacter baumannii, showing a resistance rate of 2%. Ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime, and cefpiramide were the second most active agents, and about 50% of the tested strains were susceptible to these three antibiotics. Cefpiramide had an activity comparable to that of all tested beta-lactams against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MIC90, 2 microg/ml). Against Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae, cefpiramide had good activity, with an MIC90 concentration at which 90% of the strain was inhibited of 1 microg/ml and 0.5 microg/ml, respectively. These results indicated that cefpiramide was more active against glucose non-fermenting bacteria than against Enterobacteriaceae, and was very active against oxacillin-susceptible Staphylo-coccus aureus, S. pneumoniae, and H. influenzae. Thus, cefpiramide may be a good choice of drug for the treatment of patients with infections with glucose non-fermenting bacteria and community acquired infections.
TI  - Microbial killing activity of peracetic acid.
AB  - In vitro killing activity of peracetic acid (Perasafe) at a concentration of 0.26 per cent w/v was tested against Escherichia coli, Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Salmonella typhi, Salmonella paratyphi A, Acinetobacter baumannii, Sternotrophomonas maltophilia, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Bacillus subtilis spore, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and human immuno-deficiency virus type I. Exposure to Peracetic acid (0.26% w/v) for 10 minutes resulted in massive killing of all the aforementioned organisms and spore.
TI  - In vitro activity of moxifloxacin against common clinical bacterial isolates in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activities of moxifloxacin were compared with 7 other  antimicrobial agents. A total of 707 isolates of 11 common pathogenic bacteria were collected from the National Taiwan University Hospital; antimicrobial activities against these isolates were evaluated by minimum inhibitory concentration using an agar-dilution method. Most common pathogenic bacteria were susceptible to moxifloxacin, including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-susceptible and -resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. For many of these bacterial species, moxifloxacin was the most active antimicrobial agent compared with the third- and fourth- generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, monobactam, and other quinolones. Some strains of methicillin-resistant S. aureus and methicillin-resistant S. epidermidis demonstrated very low levels of minimum inhibitory concentration for moxifloxacin, suggesting the potential application of the drug to treat some drug-resistant gram-positive bacterial infections. Moxifloxacin was less active against P. aeruginosa, but was more active against S. maltophilia when compared with other fluoroquinolones. In conclusion, moxifloxacin exhibits an increased potency against gram-positive bacteria as compared with other tested antimicrobial agents, while preserving excellent activity against gram-negative bacteria. The drug appears to be a promising agent expressing activity against a wide variety of bacteria in Taiwan.
TI  - Comparative in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin in a North American surveillance study.
AB  - The in vitro activity of gemifloxacin, a new fluoroquinolone, was compared to three marketed fluoroquinolones; ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and ofloxacin against over 4,000 recent clinical isolates covering 29 species isolated in the United States and Canada between 1997-1999. Based on MIC(90)s, gemifloxacin was the most potent fluoroquinolone tested against a majority of Gram-positive isolates: Streptococcus pneumoniae, penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae, macrolide resistant S. pneumoniae, ciprofloxacin non-susceptible (MIC > or = 4 microg/mL) S. pneumoniae, S. pyogenes, S. agalactiae, viridans streptococci, Enterococcus faecalis, methicillin susceptible Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin resistant S. aureus, S. epidermidis, S. hemolyticus, and S. saprophyticus. Against Enterobacteriaceae and aerobic non-Enterobacteriaceae Gram-negatives, gemifloxacin was usually comparable to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin and more potent than ofloxacin for the following species: Citrobacter freundii, Enterobacter aerogenes, E. cloacae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Morganella morganii, Proteus mirabilis, P. vulgaris, Providencia stuartii, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter lwoffii, A. baumannii, Burkholderia cepacia, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Gemifloxacin was generally 16-64 fold more potent than the other fluoroquinolones tested against Gram-positive organisms and retains excellent activity comparable with ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin against a majority of Gram-negative pathogens.
TI  - Microbiologic aspects of predominant bacteria isolated from the burn patients in  Korea.
AB  - The risk of infection in burns is well-known. In recent decades, the antimicrobial resistance of bacteria isolated from burn patients has increased. For this reason, we have carried out a study of the predominant bacterial profiles and antimicrobial resistance patterns of isolates from a burn center in Korea. A retrospective study was undertaken at Hallym University, Hangang Sacred Heart Hospital to examine the bacterial isolates from the burn patients and to compare the antibiograms of the predominant bacteria isolated from these patients with those of the other wards over a period of 3 years. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most common (n=2997, 45.7%) isolate from the burn patients followed by Staphylococcus aureus (n=21261, 19.2%) and Acinetobacter baumannii (n=878, 13.4%). These bacteria, isolated from the burn patients, were almost all higher in antimicrobial resistance rate than those in the non-burn patients (P<0.05). Because these bacteria showed very high resistant rates, they must be avoided in order to control a hospital-acquired infection. Our results seem helpful in providing useful guidelines for choosing effective empiric antimicrobial therapy against bacteria isolated from the burn patients in Korea.
TI  - Nosocomial pneumonia: importance of recognition of aetiological agents to define  an appropriate initial empirical therapy.
AB  - Of the 16,024 patients hospitalized from January 1995 to October 1997, 397 (2.4%) acquired nosocomial pneumonia and the aetiological agent was defined in 101 (25%). About 82% developed late onset pneumonia (>7 days of hospitalization). The site of isolation of microorganisms was bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) (49%), blood culture (39%), pleural effusion (10%) and (2%) pulmonary tissue. Gram-negative bacteria were responsible for 54% of infections. Staphylococcus aureus (34%) was the most frequent microorganism isolated followed by Acinetobacter baumannii (29%) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, responsible for 7% of nosocomial pneumonia. Monotherapy gave good cover for early onset pneumonia, but not for late onset pneumonia. Based on our selection criteria, ciprofloxacin was the best monotherapy for early (50%) and late (31%) onset pneumonia. Vancomycin plus ciprofloxacin gave cover of 85% of early and 64% of late onset pneumonia. Monotherapy with ciprofloxacin and also combination therapy of ciprofloxacin plus vancomycin may be good options as initial empirical therapy for nosocomial pneumonia.
TI  - Impact of BAL in the management of pneumonia with treatment failure: positivity of BAL culture under antibiotic therapy.
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pneumonia is responsible for 50% of antibiotics prescribed in ICUs. Treatment failure, ie, absence of improvement or clinical deterioration under antibiotic therapy, presents a dilemma to physicians. BAL is an invasive method validated for etiologic diagnosis in pneumonia. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in ICU patients the impact of BAL in the etiologic diagnosis, treatment, and outcome of pneumonia with treatment failure. DESIGN: Prospective clinical study. SETTING: Nonsurgical, medical ICU of a university hospital in Brazil. PATIENTS AND PARTICIPANTS: Sixty-two episodes of pneumonia treated for at least 72 h without clinical improvement in 53 patients hospitalized for diverse clinical emergencies. Mean duration of hospitalization was 14.2 days. Mean duration of previous antibiotic therapy was 11.4 days. INTERVENTIONS: Bronchoscopy and BAL were performed in each episode. BAL fluid was cultivated for aerobic and anaerobic bacteria; the cutoff considered positive was 10(4) cfu/mL; 10(3) cfu/mL was also analyzed if under treatment. Pneumocystis carinii, fungi, Legionella spp, and Mycobacterium spp were also researched. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Fifty-eight of 62 BAL were performed under antibiotics. The results showed positivity in 45 of 62 (72.6%); 42 of the 45 positive episodes (93.3%) had > 10(4) cfu/mL. The three cases with between 10(3) and 10(4) cfu/mL were considered positive and were treated according to BAL cultures. The main agents were Acinetobacter baumannii (37.1%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.7%), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; 16.1%); 46.7% of the episodes (21 of 45) were polymicrobial. BAL results directed a change of therapy in 34 episodes (54.8%). Overall mortality was 43.5%. There was no difference in mortality among positives, negatives, and patients who changed therapy guided by BAL culture. CONCLUSIONS: (1) BAL fluid examination was positive in 45 of 62 episodes (72.6%), with 58 of 62 BAL performed under antibiotics. This suggests that BAL may be a sensitive diagnostic method for treatment failures of clinically diagnosed pneumonias, even if performed under antibiotics; (2) the main pathogens in our study were A baumannii, P aeruginosa, and MRSA, and approximately 45% of infections were polymicrobial; (3) BAL culture results directed a change of therapy in 75.6% of positive episodes (34 of 45) and in 54.8% of all episodes of treatment failure (34 of 62); and (4) there was no difference in mortality among positives, negatives, and patients who changed therapy guided by BAL culture.
TI  - Use of PCR with universal primers and restriction endonuclease digestions for detection and identification of common bacterial pathogens in cerebrospinal fluid.
AB  - We have designed a universal PCR capable of amplifying a portion of the 16S rRNA  gene of eubacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus pyogenes, Streptococcus agalactiae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Enterococcus faecium, Enterococcus faecalis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Proteus mirabilis, Haemophilus influenzae, and Neisseria meningitidis. The sizes of the amplified products from various bacteria were the same (996 bp), but the restriction patterns of most PCR products generated by HaeIII digestion were different. PCR products from S. aureus and S. epidermidis could not be digested by HaeIII but yielded different patterns when they were digested with MnlI. PCR products from S. pneumoniae, E. faecium, and E. faecalis yielded the same HaeIII digestion pattern but could be differentiated by AluI digestion. PCR products from E. coli, K. pneumoniae, S. marcescens, and E. cloacae also had the same HaeIII digestion pattern but had different patterns when digested with DdeI or BstBI. This universal PCR could detect as few as 10 E. coli or 250 S. aureus organisms. Compared with culture, the sensitivity of this universal PCR for detection and identification of bacteria directly from 150 cerebrospinal fluids was 92.3%. These results suggest that this universal PCR coupled with restriction enzyme analysis can be used to detect and identify bacterial pathogens in clinical specimens.
TI  - High prevalence of antibiotic resistance of common pathogenic bacteria in Taiwan. The Antibiotic Resistance Study Group of the Infectious Disease Society of the Republic of China.
AB  - We analyzed the antimicrobial susceptibilities of all clinical isolates of 14 common pathogenic bacteria recovered from patients in eight medical centers in Taiwan during 1995 and 1996. Susceptibility to commonly used antimicrobial agents was tested by the disk diffusion method as recommended by the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. Of the Staphylococcus aureus isolates, 59.3% and 62% were oxacillin-resistant in 1995 and 1996, respectively, whereas 63.2% of the coagulase-negative staphylococci isolates during the study period were oxacillin-resistant. The rate of penicillin-resistance among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 39.7% in 1995 and 53.7% in 1996. Macrolide-resistance was found in 71.4%, 42.1%, and 46.7% of S. pneumoniae, beta-hemolytic streptococci, and viridans streptococci, respectively, in 1996. Less than 2% of the enterococcal isolates were vancomycin resistant, but 77% of them were gentamicin resistant. Resistance to gentamicin was also common in Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Various degrees of resistance to ampicillin, piperacillin, cephalosporins, aztreonam, and ciprofloxacin were detected in Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and A. baumannii. More than 55% of Haemophilus influenzae isolates were ampicillin resistant. In summary, resistance to many antimicrobial agents in various common pathogenic bacteria is very common in Taiwan. Our results implicate that antibiotic resistance in the developing countries need to be monitored closely.
TI  - Mixed infection in adult bacterial meningitis.
AB  - 12 adult patients suffering from bacterial meningitis caused by mixed infection were identified at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital over a period of 13 years (1986-1998), and they accounted for 6.5% (12/184) of our culture-proven adult bacterial meningitis. The 12 cases included seven males and five females, aged 17-74 years. Six of the 12 cases had community-acquired infections and the other six had nosocomially-acquired infections. Ten of the 12 cases had associated underlying diseases, with head trauma and/or neurosurgical procedure being the most frequent. Both gram-negative and gram-positive pathogens were identified in these 12 cases with gram-negative pathogens outnumbering the gram-positive ones. The implicated pathogens, starting with the most frequent, included Enterobacter species (Enterobacter cloacae, Enterobacter aerogenes), Klebsiella species (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca), Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus species (Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus haemolyticus), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Enterococcus, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter diversus, Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus viridans and Neisseria meningitidis. Six of the 12 cases were found to have multi-antibiotic-resistant strains, which included E. cloacae in one, A. baumannii in one, K. pneumoniae in one and S. aureus in three. The management of these 12 cases included appropriate antibiotics and neurosurgical procedures including shunt revision. Despite the complexity of implicated pathogens and the high incidence of emergence of resistant strains, the overall mortality rate (8.3%, 1/12) was not higher than that in adult bacterial meningitis. However, complete recuperation was difficult in adult patients with mixed bacterial meningitis.
TI  - Influences of alternate therapy protocol and continuous infectious disease consultation on antibiotic susceptibility in ICU.
AB  - In this study, the effects of alternate use of imipenem and cefoperazone/sulbactam(CFP/Sul) on antibiotic resistance in the intensive care unit (ICU) were investigated. Between 1 April 1993 and 1 April 1994, the infectious diseases consultant saw patients when required and there was no alternative therapy for antibiotics. For the following 2 years, the same consultant followed up each patient from admission to discharge by daily visits to the ICU and an alternative therapy protocol was initiated. The most common microorganisms were found to be Acinetobacter baumannii and Staphylococcus aureus, followed by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively, in the two periods. This study demonstrated that sensitivity rates of imipenem, ciprofloxacin and aminoglycosides were improved as a result of this protocol.
TI  - [Treatment of pneumonia in hospitalized patients--results of a multicenter study  using a fourth-generation cephalosporin (cefepime)].
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To evaluate efficacy and safety of cefepime in severe pneumonia of hospitalized patients. DESIGN AND PATIENTS: A prospective, multicenter, open trial was performed with 148 patients (62 patients with nosocomial pneumonia; 34 with community-acquired pneumonia and 52 undefined forms). Cefepime was intravenously administered (1,000 to 2,000 mg every 12 hours), and doses were adjusted for renal function. The efficacy endpoint was clinical response at 48 hours after completion of therapy. RESULTS: The mean age was 56.4 +/- 20.31 years. The most common bacterias isolated from patients with nosocomial pneumonia were: 5 (8.06%) Pseudomonas aeruginosa; 7 (11.29%) Pseudomonas sp.; 6 (9.68%) Klebsiella sp.; 3 (4.84%) E. coli; 2 (3.23%) Acinetobacter baumannii; 3 (4.84%) Staphylococcus aureus; 3 (4.84%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 5 (8.06%) others. The most common isolates from patients with community-acquired pneumonia were: 2 (5.88%) Streptococcus pneumoniae; 1 (2.94%) S. aureus; 2 (5.88%) P. aeruginosa and 2 (5.88%) K. pneumoniae. Clinical efficacy was demonstrated in 137/148 (92.56%) of the cases since improvement was obtained in 20.27% and healing in 72.29%. Failure of the treatment was observed in 10 patients (6.75%) and one patient the evaluation was not possible. Adverse events were reported for 5/148 patients (3.38%). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that cefepime was safe and effective for treatment of severe pneumonia in hospitalized patients.
TI  - Variations in etiology of ventilator-associated pneumonia across four treatment sites: implications for antimicrobial prescribing practices.
AB  - This retrospective multicenter study compared microorganisms documented by quantitative cultures from bronchoscopic samples in episodes of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) from three different institutions in Barcelona (B), Montevideo (M), and Seville (S). The observations were compared with the findings reported by Trouillet and coworkers (AJRCCM 1998;157:531-539) in Paris (P). The objective was to evaluate whether a classification of etiologies of VAP in four groups, based on the number of ventilation days and previous antimicrobial use, might contribute to establishing generalized guidelines for empirical therapy. Significant variations in etiologies (p < 0.05) were found in all of the microorganisms isolated from VAP episodes across three treatment sites when compared with the reference site (P). In Group 1 (< 7 d and absence of antibiotics), Pseudomonas aeruginosa remained extremely infrequent (3 of 89, 3.3%) in the joint category, whereas the incidence of Acinetobacter baumannii was significantly higher, owing to M findings. On the other hand, one site (B) had a significantly lower incidence of multiresistant pathogens (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus [MRSA] and nonfermenters other than P. aeruginosa), even in Group 2 (< 7 d and antibiotics), Group 3 (>/= 7 d and absence of antibiotics), and Group 4 (antibiotics and >/= 7 days). Similar findings were documented when episodes were grouped according to Groups 1 and 3 of the ATS guidelines. We conclude that causes of VAP varied markedly across four treatment sites, resulting in the need for large-scale variations in antimicrobial prescribing practices. Instead of following general recommendations, antimicrobial prescribing practices for VAP should be based on up-to-date information of the pattern of multiresistant isolates from each institution.
TI  - The ex vivo antimicrobial activity and colonization rate of two antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters.
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Catheter-related sepsis is an important complication associated with the use of central venous catheters. Recent studies have suggested that antimicrobial-bonded catheters may reduce catheter colonization and catheter-related sepsis. The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between the antimicrobial activity and the colonization rate of two commercially available antimicrobial-bonded central venous catheters. DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled, nonblinded study. SETTING: Medical intensive care unit of a university-affiliated teaching hospital. PATIENTS: One hundred twenty consecutive medical intensive care unit patients requiring new central venous catheters (fresh stick). INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to receive a) a Standard Arrow; b) an ARROWgard; or c) a Cook Bio-Guard Spectrum central venous catheter. Central venous catheters were removed when they were no longer required or when catheter-related sepsis was suspected. Under aseptic conditions, the distal 12 cm of the removed catheters were cut into six 2-cm segments. Semiquantitative culture was performed (by roll technique) on the distal segment. Colonization was defined as >15 colony-forming units. Using a modified Kirby-Bauer technique, the zone of inhibition of the remaining five segments was determined against the following organisms: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus faecalis, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida albicans Catheters that were removed within 24 hrs of insertion were excluded from the analysis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Seven patients were not assessable. The baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were similar among the three groups of patients. Eleven Standard Arrow (28%), seven ARROWgard (19%), and four Bio-Guard (11%) catheters were colonized (p = .05 for Bio-Guard vs. control). Staphylococci were the most common colonizing organisms. Two patients with Standard Arrow catheters (5%) and one patient with an ARROWgard catheter (3%) developed catheter-related sepsis. Antibiotic-coated catheters significantly inhibited the growth of all test organisms except C. albicans (p < or = .05). Zones of inhibition were significantly larger for the Bio-Guard compared with the ARROWgard catheter when tested against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis (p < or = .002). CONCLUSION: The Bio-Guard central venous catheter had greater ex vivo antimicrobial activity against MRSA, S. epidermidis, and E. faecalis compared with the ARROWgard catheter, and this was associated with a significantly lower rate of catheter colonization.
TI  - The global epidemiology of resistance to ciprofloxacin and the changing nature of antibiotic resistance: a 10 year perspective.
AB  - Many studies have examined the in-vitro activity of ciprofloxacin. The results are for the most part encouraging but we must guard against complacency. Levels of ciprofloxacin resistance vary geographically, while some predictably difficult-to-treat organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii present challenges globally. The emergence of resistance in species previously exquisitely sensitive to ciprofloxacin, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae, in countries associated with 'pirate' production and indiscriminate use of antimicrobials represents a major challenge. Ciprofloxacin continues to show excellent activity against Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catharralis. In general, ciprofloxacin shows good activity against Enterobacteriaceae although the emergence of reduced susceptibility and, sometimes, quinolone resistance in multi-resistant isolates should be noted.
TI  - Korean Nationwide Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance of bacteria in 1997.
AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant bacteria are known to be prevalent in tertiary-care hospitals in Korea. Twenty hospitals participated to this surveillance to determine the nationwide prevalence of resistance bacteria in 1997. Seven per cent and 26% of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were resistant to 3rd-generation cephalosporin. Increased resistance rates, 19% of Acinetobacter baumannii to ampicillin/sulbactam, and 17% of Pseudomonas aeruginoa to imipenem, were noted. The resistance rate to fluoroquinolone rose to 24% in E. coli, 56% in A. baumannii and 42% in P. aeruginosa. Mean resistance rates were similar in all hospital groups: about 17% of P. aeruginosa to imipenem, 50% of Haemophilus influenzae to ampicillin, 70% of Staphylococcus aureus to methicillin, and 70% of pneumococci to penicillin. In conclusion, nosocomial pathogens and problem resistant organisms are prevalent in smaller hospitals too, indicating nosocomial spread is a significant cause of the increasing prevalence of resistant bacteria in Korea.
TI  - Bacteriological monitoring in the Prague Burns Center.
AB  - The microbiological aspect of the prevention of nosocomial infections at the Burn Center consists primarily in the surveillance of bacterial flora and its antibiotical resistance. The Prague Burn Center is regularly monitoring the microbial flora. Patients are examined not only by the conventional methods of taking swabs of burned sites, but also by printing method, which allows a semiquantitative assessment of the colonization of burned areas. Simultaneously, investigation of bacterial contamination in the external environment of the department is carried out and the colonization of nursing staff is investigated. In all isolated strains the sensitivity to antibiotics is examined; this is significant from the point of view of current knowledge about therapeutic possibilities and for the antibiotic policy. The typing of bacterial strains makes possible to determine their epidemiological markers, and thus to investigate their spread within the department. The most frequent isolate is S. aureus and the prevalence of MRSA is relatively high. Among gramnegative rods the strains of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. cloacae are most often isolated. Various typing methods revealed endemic spread of particular strains of rarely isolated species (E. agglomerans, S. marcescens, A. baumannii, etc.).
TI  - In vitro activity of meropenem against common pathogenic bacteria isolated in Taiwan.
AB  - The in vitro antimicrobial activity of meropenem, in comparison with nine other antimicrobial agents, against 12 different common pathogenic bacteria were evaluated to know the susceptibility of common bacteria to meropenem in Taiwan. Meropenem was active against most Gram-positive, Gram-negative, and anaerobic bacteria, including methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, Haemophilus influenzae, and Bacteroides fragilis. For many of them, meropenem was the most active one in comparison with other broad-spectrum cephalosporins, aztreonam, imipenem, and ciprofloxacin. It is concluded that meropenem is a very active agent against most common pathogenic bacteria. It is uncommon for these common bacteria, except MRSA and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, to be resistant to meropenem in Taiwan, where a high prevalence of resistance to other antimicrobial agents was found in many of the common bacteria.
TI  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii: an unexpected difference in epidemiologic behavior.
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Dutch guideline on hospital policy for the prevention of nosocomial spread of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) states that patients transferred from hospitals abroad must be placed in strict isolation immediately on admission to a hospital in the Netherlands. Three patients colonized with both MRSA and a multiresistant Acinetobacter were transferred from hospitals in Mediterranean countries to 3 different hospitals in the Netherlands. Despite isolation precautions, Acinetobacter spread in 2 of the 3 hospitals, whereas nosocomial spread of MRSA did not occur. METHODS: For outbreak analysis, the Acinetobacter isolates, identified as Acinetobacter baumannii by the use of amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis, were comparatively typed by 4 methods. Comparison of isolation measures in the hospitals was performed retrospectively. RESULTS: In the 2 hospitals in which nosocomial spread of Acinetobacter occurred, most of the epidemiologically related isolates were indistinguishable from the index strains. In these 2 hospitals, isolation measures were in concordance with those recommended for the prevention of contact transmission. The precautions of the hospital in which no outbreak occurred included the prevention of airborne transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Precautions recommended for multiresistant gram-negative organisms are insufficient for the prevention of nosocomial spread of multiresistant Acinetobacter. The airborne mode of spread of acinetobacters should be taken into account, and guidelines should be revised accordingly.
TI  - [Bacteria isolated from protected bronchopulmonary samples: variation as a function of the previous length of stay in the recovery room].
AB  - We retrospectively reviewed the variation of the organisms recovered from 403 protected bronchopulmonary specimens in three surgical intensive care units according to the time elapsed from admission. The predominant pathogens during the four first days were Haemophilus influenzae (33.3%), Staphylococcus aureus (18.2%), mostly methicillin susceptible strains, and Streptococcus pneumoniae (14.3%). After the fourth day, they were progressively replaced by typical nosocomial bacteria such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter baumannii. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa and cephalosporinase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, strains resistant to third generation cephalosporins occurred significantly later than the susceptible strains. These results indicate that the time elapsed from intensive care unit admission has a major influence on the bacteriology of respiratory tract infections, but no clear cut-off point between early-onset and late onset pneumonia is evident.
TI  - The pattern of burn infection in the Singapore National Burns Centre.
AB  - As part of the multi-pronged strategy in the fight against burn infection, we conducted a retrospective study of the pattern of infection in our burn patients for a period of 15 months from January 1993 to March 1994. We studied culture and sensitivity reports to determine the incidence of each organism, their antibiotic sensitivity patterns and the time interval between the burns injury and the appearance of these organisms. Organisms like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and multiply-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii constituted a problem in our patients. Other organisms that were isolated from our patients included Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacter species and Klebsiella species. The infection control measures in our burns centre are aimed at combating the spread of gram-positive and gram-negative organisms. This study has helped to influence our antibiotic administration policy for treating infection in our centre based on the sensitivity patterns of the prevailing flora.
TI  - Ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by potentially drug-resistant bacteria.
AB  - To determine risk factors for ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by potentially drug-resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and/or Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, 135 consecutive episodes of VAP observed in a single ICU over a 25-mo period were prospectively studied. For all patients, VAP was diagnosed based on results of bronchoscopic protected specimen brush (> or = 10(3) cfu/ml) and bronchoalveolar lavage (> or = 10(4) cfu/ml) specimens. Seventy-seven episodes were caused by "potentially resistant" bacteria and 58 episodes were caused by "other" organisms. According to logistic regression analysis, three variables among potential factors remained significant: duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) > or = 7 d (odds ratio [OR] = 6.0), prior antibiotic use (OR = 13.5), and prior use of broad-spectrum drugs (third-generation cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and/or imipenem) (OR = 4.1). Distribution of the 245 causative bacteria was analyzed according to four groups defined by prior duration of MV (< 7 or > or = 7 d) and prior use or lack of use (within 15 d) of antibiotics. Although 22 episodes of early-onset VAP in patients receiving no prior antibiotics were caused by antibiotic-susceptible bacteria, 84 episodes of late-onset VAP in patients receiving prior antibiotics were mainly caused by potentially resistant bacteria. Differences in the potential efficacies (ranging from 100% to 11%) against microorganisms of 15 antimicrobial regimens were studied according to classification into these four groups. These findings may provide a more rational basis for selecting the initial therapy of patients suspected of having VAP.
TI  - Impact of tracheotomy on colonization and infection of lower airways in children  requiring long-term ventilation: a prospective observational cohort study.
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Determination of the following: (1) colonization and infection  rates in children requiring long-term ventilation initially via a transtracheal tube and subsequently via a tracheotomy; (2) the number of infection episodes per 1,000 ventilation days, during both types of artificial airways; and (3) routes of colonization/infection of the lower airways, ie, whether the pathogenesis was endogenous (via the oropharynx) or exogenous (via the transtracheal tube or tracheotomy). DESIGN: Observational, cohort, prospective study over 2 1/2 years. SETTING: Pediatric ICU (PICU), Royal Liverpool Children's National Health Service Trust of Alder Hey, a tertiary referral center. PATIENTS: Twenty-two children requiring long-term mechanical ventilation initially transtracheally and subsequently via a tracheotomy. INTERVENTION: Nil. RESULTS: The lower airways were colonized in 71% of children during transtracheal ventilation; posttracheotomy, this was 95% (p=0.03). Children developed significantly fewer infections following colonization with a microorganism posttracheotomy (8/15 pretracheotomy vs 6/21 posttracheotomy; p=0.013). Throughout the study, there were a total of 17 episodes of infection, all of which were preceded by colonization. Haemophilus influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the same four causative pathogens during mechanical ventilation both transtracheally and via tracheotomy. Forty-nine episodes of colonization were observed, 15 pretracheotomy and 34 posttracheotomy; of these, 12 (80%) and 19 episodes (56%), respectively, were primary endogenous, ie, present in the oropharynx on hospital admission and subsequently at tracheotomy. Only one colonization episode (7%) of exogenous pathogenesis was observed during transtracheal intubation, while 12 (35%) (p=0.02) occurred after tracheotomy. An equal number of secondary endogenous colonization episodes (two and three, ie, acquired in the oropharynx after PICU admission and after tracheotomy, respectively, were recorded. CONCLUSIONS: (1) Despite a high level of hygiene, exogenous colonization without subsequent infection was common. (2) Although all patients were colonized, the infection rate was lower after tracheotomy. This may be due to enhanced immunity (medically stable) and improved tracheobronchial toilet. (3) Microorganisms in children with tracheotomy differ from those in adults.
TI  - Oropharyngeal or gastric colonization and nosocomial pneumonia in adult intensive care unit patients. A prospective study based on genomic DNA analysis.
AB  - Colonization of the digestive tract has been supposed to be the source of many hospital-acquired infections, especially nosocomial pneumonia. To assess the relationship between oropharyngeal and gastric colonization and subsequent occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia, we prospectively studied 86 ventilated, intensive care unit (ICU) patients. Oropharyngeal or gastric colonizations were detected and quantified on admission and twice weekly during ICU stay. When nosocomial pneumonia was suspected on clinical grounds (new chest X-ray infiltrate and purulent tracheal secretions), diagnosis was assessed on fiberoptic bronchoscopy with quantitative cultures of a protected specimen brush sampling and/or a plugged telescoping catheter sampling yielding > or = 10(3) cfu/ml of at least one microorganism. Bacterial strains responsible for colonization and infection (Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterobacteriaceae, and Staphylococcus aureus) were compared using pulsed-field electrophoresis. A total of 31 cases (36%) of pneumonia were diagnosed. Oropharyngeal colonization, detected either on admission or from subsequent samples, was a predominant factor of nosocomial pneumonia as compared with gastric colonization. For instance, oropharyngeal colonization with A. baumannii yielded a 7.45-fold estimated increased risk of pneumonia as compared with patients not yet or not identically colonized (p = 0.0004). DNA genomic analysis demonstrated that an identical strain was isolated from oropharyngeal or gastric samples and bronchial samples in all but three cases of pneumonia, due to S. aureus. These findings provide better knowledge of the pathophysiology of nosocomial pneumonia in mechanically ventilated patients.
TI  - Influence of relative humidity and suspending menstrua on survival of Acinetobacter spp. on dry surfaces.
AB  - Acinetobacter spp. are being reported with increasing frequency as a cause of nosocomial infection and have been isolated from the skin of healthy individuals, patients, hospital staff, dry nonbiotic objects, and different pieces of medical equipment. Factors affecting the survival of Acinetobacter spp. under conditions closely similar to those found in the hospital environment were investigated in the present study to help us understand the epidemiology of nosocomial Acinetobacter infection. Bacterial cells were suspended in distilled water or bovine serum albumin and were dried onto glass coverslips and kept at different relative humidities. Cells washed from coverslips were used to determined viable counts. Freshly isolated strains of Acinetobacter spp. belonging to the clinically important Acinetobacter calcoaceticus-Acinetobacter baumannii complex were found to be more resistant to drying conditions (e.g., 30 days for A. baumannii 16/49) than American Type Culture Collection strains (e.g., 2 days for A. baumannii ATCC 9955). The majority of strains belonging to the Acb complex had survival times similar to those observed for the gram-positive organism Staphylococcus aureus tested in the experiment. Survival times were prolonged for almost all the strains tested when they were suspended in bovine serum albumin (e.g., 60 days for A. baumannii R 447) compared with those for strains suspended in distilled water (11 days for R 447). The survival times for strains at higher relative humidity (31 or 93%) were longer than those for strains of Acinetobacter kept at a relative humidity of 10% (11 days at 31% relative humidity and 4 days at 10% relative humidity for R447). These findings are consistent with the observed tendency of Acinetobacter spp. to survive on dry surfaces, and they can be transferred not only by moist vectors but also under dry conditions in a hospital environment during nosocomial infection outbreaks. The results obtained in the experiment support the previously suggested airborne spread of Acinetobacter spp. in hospital wards and repeated outbreaks after incomplete disinfection of contaminated dry surfaces.
TI  - Sinusitis in mechanically ventilated patients and its role in the pathogenesis of nosocomial pneumonia.
AB  - Nosocomial sinusitis is a complication of endotracheal intubation and mechanical  ventilation in critically ill patients. Its incidence is often underestimated because of a lack of clinical signs. It is suspected in patients with nasal discharge or unexplained fever. Its diagnosis is based on radiological examination, by radiograph or computed tomography scan, and microbiological cultures of maxillary sinus aspirate. Maxillary sinusitis is often associated with involvement of the sphenoid, ethmoid, and/or frontal sinuses. Its incidence varies greatly according to diagnostic criteria and the population studied. Infectious sinusitis is less frequent than noninfectious sinusitis, occurring in 20 to 30% of patients intubated for at least seven days. Its incidence is higher in nasotracheally than in orotracheally intubated patients. Other risk factors include nasogastric tubes and head trauma. The main causative agents are gram-negative bacilli, primarily Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae, but Staphylococcus aureus and yeasts are also common. Patients with nosocomial sinusitis are more likely to develop pneumonia than those without sinusitis. The sinus provides a bacterial reservoir from which organisms may seed the tracheobronchial tree. The association of sinusitis and pneumonia is mainly due to Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. The treatment of sinusitis is based on the removal of all nasal tubes, topical decongestants, and maxillary sinus drainage and lavage. The role of intravenous antibiotics is controversial.
TI  - Molecular nosocomial epidemiology: high speed typing of microbial pathogens by arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction assays.
AB  - Arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (AP PCR) assays are suited for the discrimination of isolates of all clinically relevant bacterial species. In a hospital setting, this type of DNA amplification test can be used for the timely detection of ongoing nosocomial outbreaks. For rapid screening of isolates of many medically important bacterial species, including Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus, Serratia marcescens, Xanthomonas maltophilia and others, a single AP PCR assay can be used as a primary typing screen for genetic relatedness. In combination with epidemiological data, AP PCR testing is particularly useful for identifying true outbreaks caused by a single strain.
TI  - Emergence of bacterial resistance to imipenem and ciprofloxacin in a university hospital.
AB  - We have continuously monitored the in-vitro activities of imipenem and ciprofloxacin against large numbers of non-fastidious clinical isolates. After eight years of use, 97-100% of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii remained susceptible to imipenem, but susceptibility of Pseudomonas aeruginosa declined from 100% to 91%. After six years of use, 94%-100% of Enterobacteriaceae (except Providencia stuartii) remained susceptible to ciprofloxacin but susceptibility of P. stuartii, A. baumannii and P. aeruginosa declined from 100% to 46%, 66% and 84%, respectively. Oxacillin-resistant staphylococci were considered to be resistant to imipenem and all beta-lactams. There were no quinolone-resistant staphylococci observed in 1986, but susceptibilities of Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus haemolyticus to ciprofloxacin decreased to 85-93% for oxacillin-susceptible strains and to 7-39% for oxacillin-resistant strains. Enterococcus faecalis has remained susceptible to imipenem and the modal MIC of ciprofloxacin has remained 1 mg/L; however, susceptibility to ciprofloxacin 2 mg/L decreased from 94% to 64%. Imipenem-quinolone cross-resistance was observed for staphylococci but not for P. aeruginosa.
TI  - Microbiology of nosocomial sinusitis in intensive care unit patients.
AB  - We performed a 2-year microbiological study of specimens of sinus fluid recovered from patients with suspected nosocomial sinusitis in six intensive care units. Over that period, 103 cases of sinusitis were documented by positive culture. The number of cases varied widely from one unit to another and was particularly high in the neurosurgical unit. Cultures were often polymicrobial. The main pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Enterobacteriaceae. Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae were far less frequently isolated. Anaerobes and yeasts were often associated with aerobic bacteria. The pathogen involved was also recovered from bronchopulmonary samples in 50 patients and from blood cultures in seven patients.
TI  - Synergistic interaction between ofloxacin and cefotaxime against common clinical  pathogens.
AB  - Antimicrobial synergy resulting from combined antibiotic therapy is often important in the treatment of serious bacterial infections. To investigate the interactions between cefotaxime (CTX), desacetylcefotaxime (DES), and ofloxacin (OFL), 247 recent clinical isolates were tested for in vitro susceptibility to each antibiotic alone by an agar dilution technique and retested with the various antibiotic combinations using a checkerboard protocol. Fractional inhibitory concentrations were calculated for all organisms with all drug combinations. Time kill kinetic studies were performed on selected isolates to examine the bactericidal activity of the various antimicrobial combinations. Of the 110 gram-negative organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy between CTX, DES and OFL was demonstrable for 89 (81%). Included in the study were 70 members of the Enterobacteriaceae family, 20 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 10 strains of Acinetobacter baumannii, and 10 isolates of Xanthomonas maltophilia. Additive activity was observed against an additional 13 (11%) isolates. Findings were similar for the 89 gram-positive isolates examined. Organisms tested included methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (20), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (9), methicillin-susceptible S. epidermidis (10), Enterococcus faecalis (10), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (20). Synergy or partial synergy was observed against 81 (91%). Less synergistic activity was detected, however, with members of the Bacteroides fragilis group. Of the 48 organisms tested, synergy or partial synergy was noted for only 27 (57%). Isolates representative of each major group of organisms included in the study were tested to determine whether synergistic bactericidal activity was also demonstrable with the three drugs. Time kill studies supported the checkerboard results.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
TI  - In vitro antimicrobial activity of fluoroquinolones against clinical isolates obtained in 1989 and 1990.
AB  - The in vitro activity of nine fluoroquinolones, enoxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, fleroxacin and levofloxacin, and two earlier quinolones, nalidixic acid and pipemidic acid, against 1,346 bacterial strains isolated clinically between 1989 and 1990, was evaluated by agar dilution method. The bacteria studied were Staphylococcus aureus (including methicillin-susceptible and -resistant strains), Staphylococcus epidermidis, Enterococcus species (including high-level gentamicin-resistant strains), Escherichia coli, Salmonella species, Proteus mirabilis, Proteus vulgaris, Morganella morganii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Citrobacter spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Pseudomonas cepacia, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Bacteroides fragilis. In contrast to the moderate to poor activity of two earlier quinolones, the fluoroquinolones acted well against most Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii. The minimum inhibitory concentrations for 90% of the drug strains (MIC90s) were < 1 microgram/mL against most tested species. Ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, and levofloxacin were more effective against multi-drug-resistant nosocomial pathogens. All fluoroquinolones assayed were very active against methicillin-susceptible S. aureus, with MIC90s < or = 1 microgram/mL. For methicillin-resistant strains, on the other hand, the MIC90s were > or = 4 micrograms/mL. There was no significant difference in fluoroquinolone susceptibility between methicillin-susceptible and -resistant S. epidermidis. Sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin were more active against enterococci. Most fluoroquinolones were relatively inactive against B. fragilis, with the exception of tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin and levofloxacin. The MIC90s of most quinolones assayed against K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter spp., E. cloacae, S. aureus and S. epidermidis were at least four-fold higher in our study. Therefore, it is important for physicians to use fluoroquinolones carefully so as to prevent or delay the emergence of resistant strains.
TI  - Activity of imipenem, third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam and ciprofloxacin against multi-resistant gram-negative bacilli isolated from Chilean hospitals.
AB  - The activity of imipenem against nosocomial strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter spp. and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus resistant to some third-generation cephalosporins, aztreonam, or ciprofloxacin was assessed. These strains represent the most prevalent multi-resistant nosocomial microorganisms in Chile since they were isolated from clinical specimens in 11 Chilean hospitals. A high proportion of the strains were resistant to several beta-lactams, yet all strains of K. pneumoniae and Acinetobacter spp. were susceptible to imipenem; resistance was exhibited by only one strain of P. aeruginosa and 16 strains of S. aureus. Synergy between cefotaxime and clavulanic acid was found in almost all strains of K. pneumoniae, suggesting the presence of plasmid-coded beta-lactamases, probably with extended-spectrum activity. Killing A. baumannii by imipenem was rapid, but slower for P. aeruginosa. Killing of K. pneumoniae was also somewhat slower despite the lower MIC of imipenem for this strain. Bactericidal activity was even slower against one strain of methicillin-resistant S. aureus. These results suggest that imipenem would be an adequate alternative to other broad-spectrum agents in the treatment of infections due to nosocomial multi-resistant Gram-negative bacilli.
TI  - Comparative in-vitro activities of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, and ciprofloxacin, sparfloxacin, tosufloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990.
AB  - The in-vitro activity of the new quinolone, Bay y 3118, was compared with that of ciprofloxacin, tosufloxacin, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and CI-990 against 1640 isolates belonging to 117 bacterial species. Against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Bay y 3118 was as active as CI-960 and CI-990, up to four-fold more active than ciprofloxacin and tosufloxacin and up to 16-fold more active than sparfloxacin. The majority of Enterobacteriaceae which were resistant to ciprofloxacin (MICs > or = 2 mg/L) were sensitive to Bay y 3118. With the exception of ciprofloxacin which was less active, the activities of Bay y 3118 and the other comparator compounds were similar against Acinetobacter baumannii, Acinetobacter genospecies 3 and Acinetobacter strain 84. Bay y 3118 inhibited Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates at concentrations comparable with those of ciprofloxacin. However, non-aeruginosa Pseudomonas spp. were four times more susceptible to Bay y 3118 than to ciprofloxacin. All of the agents tested were equally active against Haemophilus, Moraxella, Neisseria and Bordetella spp. Against staphylococci, Bay y 3118 was the most active compound, followed jointly by CI-990, sparfloxacin, CI-960 and tosufloxacin, and then ciprofloxacin. Bay y 3118 remained highly active against Staphylococcus aureus strains resistant to ciprofloxacin; the MIC90 (0.5 mg/L) was 16-fold less than that of CI-990 and sparfloxacin, 32-fold less than that of CI-960 and 128-fold less than that of tosufloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Against haemolytic and non-haemolytic streptococci and Enterococcus faecalis, Bay y 3118 was two- to 16-fold more active than the other compounds. It had only moderate activity against Listeria spp., but this was superior to that of all the other compounds tested. Bay y 3118 was also the most active agent overall against anaerobic bacteria, although CI-960 and CI-990 had slightly better activity against Gardnerella vaginalis. It inhibited Mycobacterium spp. other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mycobacterium kansasii, Mycobacterium scrofulaceum, Mycobacterium gordonae, Mycobacterium xenopi, Mycobacterium flavescens, Mycobacterium avium and Mycobacterium fortuitum) at concentrations < or = 0.06-4 mg/L and was between two- and 128-fold more active than the other compounds against these isolates; the two strains each of Mycobacterium terrae and Mycobacterium nonchromogenicum were resistant to Bay y 3118. In this study, Bay y 3118 was shown to be the most active and most broad-spectrum of the new quinolone and naphthyridine derivatives.
TI  - RU 29 246, the active compound of the cephalosporin-prodrug-ester HR 916. I. Antibacterial activity in vitro.
AB  - The aminothiazolyl-cephalosporin RU 29 246 is the active metabolite of the prodrug-pivaloyl-oxyethyl-ester HR 916. RU 29 246 in vitro activity includes a wide range of clinically relevant bacterial pathogens. Against methicillin-sensitive Staphylococci RU 29 246 (MIC90 of 0.25 approximately 2 micrograms/ml) was clearly more active than cefaclor, cefuroxime, cefpodoxime, cefixime and ceftibuten, but slightly less active than cefdinir. RU 29 246 inhibited hemolytic Streptococci of the serogroups A, B, C and G as well as penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae at concentrations similar to cefdinir, cefpodoxime and cefuroxime (MIC90 less than or equal to 0.13 micrograms/ml), but less than the other oral cephalosporins investigated (cefixime, cefaclor and ceftibuten). MIC90s of RU 29 246 against Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Proteus mirabilis and Haemophilus influenzae were less than or equal to 0.5 micrograms/ml. Only RU 29 246 and cefdinir demonstrated moderate activity against Acinetobacter baumannii (MIC90 greater than or equal to 4 micrograms/ml). Most strains of Pseudomonas spp., Serratia marcescens, Enterobacter spp., Hafnia alvei and Bacteroides spp. were resistant to RU 29 246. RU 29 246 killed Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus at a rate of 99% to 99.9% at concentrations of two times MIC. The pH value of the medium (range 5.5 to 8.5) and the inoculum size (range 10(5) to 10(7) cfu/ml) had no or only low influence on the antibacterial activity of RU 29 246. RU 29 246 is a broad spectrum cephalosporin including in its activity both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens and therefore--depending on the bioavailability of its prodrug--looks promising as to its therapeutic perspective.
TI  - [In vitro antibacterial activity of piperacillin-tazobactam combination on hospital isolates and regression curve].
AB  - Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of piperacillin (P) in combination with  4 micrograms/ml of tazobactam (T) were evaluated by agar dilution for 1,245 strains isolated in 4 hospitals. In addition antibiograms by agar diffusion were performed with disks loaded of 75 micrograms of P + 10 micrograms of T. For naturally non beta-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae (E), MIC 50 and 90% of P + T were (microgram/ml): E. coli 1-2; P. mirabilis: 0.5-1; activity was practically identical on plasmid mediated penicillinase (Pase) producing strains. Strains of K. pneumoniae only resistant (R) to amino- and carboxypenicillins (C) had MICs less than or equal to 4 (mode MIC 2); MICs of strains R to cephalothin and/or cefotaxime were 2 to 16 (mode MIC 4). For chromosomal cephalosporinase (Case) producing species, MICs of P + T were less than or equal to 8, including for acquired Pase producing strains, but were greater than or equal to 16 for Case hyperproducing strains. Strains of P. aeruginosa susceptible (S) to C were inhibited by 1 to 16 (with MIC 4) and strains R to C by 8 to greater than 128. MICs were generally 2 to 32 for A. baumannii S to C at 0.12 to greater than 128 for strains R to C. Haemophilus, S or R to ampicillin, were inhibited by 0.008 to 2 (MIC 50 and 90: 0.016-0.12). S. aureus S to methicillin (M), Pase producing on not, were inhibited by 0.5 to 2 (mode MIC 1) and strains R to M by 8 to greater than 128. Activity of P + T for coagulase-Staphylococci was similar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
