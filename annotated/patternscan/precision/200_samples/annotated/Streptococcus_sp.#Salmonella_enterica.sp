TI == molecular detection of fastidious and common bacteria as well as plasmodium spp.  in febrile and afebrile children in franceville, gabon.
AB == malaria was considered as the main cause of fever in africa. however, with the roll back malaria initiative, the causes of fever in africa may change. this study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of bacteria and plasmodium spp. in febrile and afebrile (controls) children from franceville, gabon. about 793 blood samples from febrile children and 100 from controls were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction (pcr) coupled with sequencing. plasmodium spp. was the microorganism most detected in febrile (74.5%, 591/793) and controls (13%, 13/100), p < 0.0001. its coinfection with bacteria was found only in febrile children (p = 0.0001). staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent bacterium in febrile children (2.8%, 22/793) and controls (3%, 3/100). eight cases of salmonella spp. (including two salmonella enterica serovar paratyphi) and two of streptococcus pneumoniae were found only among febrile children. borrelia spp. was found in 2 controls while rickettsia felis was detected in 10 children (in 8 febriles and 2 afebriles). no dna of other targeted microorganisms was detected. plasmodium spp. remains prevalent while salmonella spp., staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus pneumoniae were common bacteria in gabon. two fastidious bacteria, rickettsia felis and borrelia spp., were found. inclusion of controls should improve the understanding of the causes of fever in sub-saharan africa.

TI == potential probiotic attributes of a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces.
AB == a new strain of bacillus coagulans cgmcc 9551, which has a broad range of antibacterial activities against six main pathogenic bacteria including escherichia coli o8, staphylococcus aureus, salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus suis, listeria monocytogenes and pasteurella multocida, was isolated from healthy piglet feces. in adhesion assay, the isolate exhibited a stronger adhesion to pig intestinal mucus than that of b. subtilis jt143 and l. acidophilus ly24 respectively isolated from bioplus((r))2b and florafit((r)) probiotics (p < 0.05). the adhesion activity reached 44.5 +/- 3.2, 48.9 +/- 2.6, 42.6 +/- 3.3 and 37.6 +/- 2.4 % to jejunum, ileum, transverse colon and sigmoid colon, separately. the survival rate of b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 was reduced by only 20 % at 4 h exposure under 0.9 % w/v bile salt. the strain was fully resistant to ph 2 for 2 h with 90.1 +/- 3.5 % survival and susceptible to 15 antibiotics commonly used in veterinary medicine. additionally, the bacteria showed amylase, protease and cellulase activities. the safety assessment demonstrated the lack of toxicity potential in b. coagulans cgmcc 9551 by ligated rabbit ileal loop assay, acute and subchronic toxicity test. these results implied that that the new strain of b. coagulans cgmcc 9951 isolated from healthy piglet feces has promising probiotic characteristics and offers desirable opportunities for its successful commercialization as one excellent candidate probiotic.

TI == management of severe non-tb bacterial infection in hiv-infected adults.
AB == despite widespread antiretroviral therapy use, severe bacterial infections (sbi)  in hiv-infected adults continue to cause significant morbidity and mortality globally. four main pathogens account for the majority of documented sbi: streptococcus pneumoniae, non-typhoidal strains of salmonella enterica, escherichia coli and staphylococcus aureus. the epidemiology of sbi is dynamic, both in developing countries where, despite dramatic successes in antiretroviral therapy, coverage is far from complete, and in settings in both resource-poor and resource-rich countries where antiretroviral therapy failure is becoming increasingly common. throughout the world, this complexity is further compounded by rapidly emerging antimicrobial resistance, making management of sbi very challenging in these vulnerable patients. we review the causes and treatment of sbi in hiv-infected people and discuss future developments in this field.

TI == preparation and testing of a vi conjugate vaccine using pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) from streptococcus pneumoniae as the carrier protein.
AB == in the current study pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) was conjugated to vi capsular polysaccharide from salmonella typhi to make available a vaccine against typhoid fever that has the potential to also provide broad protection from streptococcus pneumoniae. high yielding production processes were developed for the purification of pspas from families 1 and 2. the purified pspas were conjugated to vi with high recovery of both vi and pspa. the processes developed especially for pspa family 2 could readily be adapted for large scale production under cgmp conditions. previously we have shown that conjugation of diphtheria toxoid (dt) to vi polysaccharide improves the immune response to vi but can also enhance the response to dt. in this study it was shown that conjugation of pspa to vi enhanced the anti-pspa response and that pspa was a suitable carrier protein as demonstrated by the characteristics of a t-cell dependent response to the vi. we propose that a bivalent vaccine consisting of pspa from families 1 and 2 bound to vi polysaccharide would protect against typhoid fever and has the potential to also protect against pneumococcal disease and should be considered for use in developing countries.

AB == attenuated salmonella typhimurium sl7207 was used as a carrier for a reconstructed dna vaccine against streptococcus agalactiae. a 1.02 kb dna fragment, encoding for a portion of the surface immunogenic protein (sip) of s. agalactiae was inserted into pvax1. the recombinant plasmid pvax1-sip was transfected in epc cells to detect the transient expression by an indirect immunofluorescence assay, together with western blot analysis. the pvax1-sip was transformed by electroporation into sl7207. the stability of pvax1-sip into salmonella was over 90% after 50 generations with antibiotic selection in vitro while remained stable over 80% during 35 generations under antibiotic-free conditions. the ld50 of sl/pvax1-sip was 1.7 x 10(11) cfu/fish by intragastric administration which indicated a quite low virulence. tilapias were inoculated orally at 10(8) cfu/fish, the recombinant bacteria were found present in intestinal tract, spleens and livers and eventually eliminated from the tissues 4 weeks after immunization. fish immunized at 10(7), 10(8) and 10(9) cfu/fish with different immunization times caused various levels of serum antibody and an effective protection against lethal challenge with the wild-type strain s. agalactiae. integration studies showed that the pvax1-sip did not integrate with tilapia chromosomes. the dna vaccine sl/pvax1-sip was proved to be safe and effective in protecting tilapias against s. agalactiae infection.

TI == antimicrobial function of shbetaap, a novel hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide, isolated from the liver of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis.
AB == a 2.3 kda of antimicrobial peptide was purified from an acidified liver extract of skipjack tuna, katsuwonus pelamis, by preparative acid-urea-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and c18 reversed-phase hplc. a comparison of the amino acid sequence of the purified peptide with those of other known polypeptides revealed high homology with the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain; thus, this peptide was designated as the skipjack hemoglobin beta chain-related antimicrobial peptide (shbetaap). shbetaap showed potent antimicrobial activity against gram-positive bacteria, such as bacillus subtilis, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus iniae (minimal effective concentrations [mecs], 6.5-57.0 mug/ml), gram-negative bacteria, such as escherichia coli d31, pseudomonas aeruginosa, salmonella enterica, shigella sonnei, and two vibrio parahaemolyticus species (mecs, 2.0-19.0 mug/ml), and against candida albicans (mec; 12.0 mug/ml) without significant hemolytic activity. antimicrobial activity of this peptide was heatstable and ph resistant but is sensitive to proteases and salt. shbetaap did not show membrane permeabilization and killing ability. the secondary structural prediction and the homology modeling expected that this peptide formed an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. this is the first report the purification of a novel antimicrobial peptide related to the c-terminus of hemoglobin beta-chain from marine fish.

TI == bacterial meningitis in malawian infants <2 months of age: etiology and susceptibility to world health organization first-line antibiotics.
AB == background: neonatal meningitis is an important cause of morbidity in sub-saharan africa and requires urgent empiric treatment with parenteral administered antibiotics. here we describe the etiology, antimicrobial susceptibility and suitability of the world health organization first-line recommended antibiotics (penicillin and gentamicin) for bacterial meningitis in young infants in malawi. methods: we reviewed all cerebrospinal fluid samples received from infants </=2 months of age with clinically suspected meningitis between january 1, 2002, and december 31, 2008, at the queen elizabeth central hospital in blantyre, malawi. results: we identified 259 culture-positive isolates from 259 infants </=2 months of age. sixty isolates were from neonates </=7 days old, in whom the most common pathogens were group b streptococcus (27/60; 45.0%), streptococcus pneumoniae (13/60; 21.7%) and nontyphoidal salmonella enterica (7/60; 11.7%). one hundred and ninety one isolates were from young infants who were >7 days and </=2 months of age. in this group, the most common isolates were s. pneumoniae (80/191; 41.9%), group b streptococcus (38/191; 19.9%) and nontyphoidal salmonella enterica (34/191; 17.8%). more isolates were susceptible to ceftriaxone than to the combination of penicillin and gentamicin (218/220; 99.1% vs. 202/220; 91.8%, fisher's exact test p = 0.006). in particular, gram-negative isolates were significantly more susceptible to ceftriaxone than to gentamicin (72/74; 97.3% vs. 63/74; 85.1%, fisher's exact test p = 0.020). penicillin and gentamicin provided less coverage for gram-negative than gram-positive isolates (74/86; 86.0% vs. 155/163; 95.1%, chi = 6.24, p = 0.012). conclusions: in view of these results, the world health organization recommendations for empiric penicillin and gentamicin for suspected neonatal meningitis should be reevaluated.

TI == a new plant-derived antibacterial is an inhibitor of efflux pumps in staphylococcus aureus.
AB == an in-depth evaluation was undertaken of a new antibacterial natural product (1)  recently isolated and characterised from the plant hypericum olympicum l. cf. uniflorum. minimum inhibitory concentrations (mics) were determined for a panel of bacteria, including: meticillin-resistant and -susceptible strains of staphylococcus aureus, staphylococcus epidermidis and staphylococcus haemolyticus; vancomycin-resistant and -susceptible enterococcus faecalis and enterococcus faecium; penicillin-resistant and -susceptible streptococcus pneumoniae; group a streptococci (streptococcus pyogenes); and clostridium difficile. mics were 2-8 mg/l for most staphylococci and all enterococci, but were >/=16 mg/l for s. haemolyticus and were >32 mg/l for all species in the presence of blood. compound 1 was also tested against gram-negative bacteria, including escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium but was inactive. the mic for mycobacterium bovis bcg was 60 mg/l, and compound 1 inhibited the atp-dependent mycobacterium tuberculosis mure ligase [50% inhibitory concentration (ic(50)) = 75 mum]. in a radiometric accumulation assay with a strain of s. aureus overexpressing the nora multidrug efflux pump, the presence of compound 1 increased accumulation of (14)c-enoxacin in a concentration-dependent manner, implying inhibition of efflux. only moderate cytotoxicity was observed, with ic50 values of 12.5, 10.5 and 8.9 mum against human breast, lung and fibroblast cell lines, respectively, highlighting the potential value of this chemotype as a new antibacterial agent and efflux pump inhibitor.

TI == antipathogenic activity of probiotics against salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile in anaerobic batch culture systems: is it due to synergies in probiotic mixtures or the specificity of single strains?
AB == probiotics are currently being investigated for prevention of infections caused by enteric pathogens. the aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the influence of three single probiotics: lactobacillus casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), lactobacillus acidophilus ncimb 30184 (pxn 35), bifidobacterium breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) and a probiotic mixture containing the above strains plus twelve other strains belonging to the lactobacillus, bifidobacterium, lactococcus, streptococcus and bacillus genera on the survival of salmonella typhimurium and clostridium difficile using ph-controlled anaerobic batch cultures containing mixed faecal bacteria. changes in relevant bacterial groups and effects of probiotic addition on survival of the two pathogens were assessed over 24 h. quantitative analysis of bacterial populations revealed that there was a significant increase in lactobacilli and/or bifidobacteria numbers, depending on probiotic addition, compared with the control (no added probiotic). there was also a significant reduction in s. typhimurium and c. difficile numbers in the presence of certain probiotics compared with controls. of the probiotic treatments, two single strains namely l. casei ncimb 30185 (pxn 37), and b. breve ncimb 30180 (pxn 25) were the most potent in reducing the numbers of s. typhimurium and c. difficile. in addition, the supplementation with probiotics into the systems influenced some fermentations parameters. acetate was found in the largest concentrations in all vessels and lactate and formate were generally detected in higher amounts in vessels with probiotic addition compared to controls.

AB == background: live, attenuated, orally-administered salmonella strains are excellent vectors for vaccine antigens and are attractive as vaccines based on previous use of s. typhimurium in animals. a phase i dose escalation trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of three newly constructed recombinant attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhi vaccine (rasv) vectors synthesizing streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein a (pspa). methods: the 3 s. typhi strains used as vectors to deliver pspa were s. typhi isp1820; s. typhi ty2 rpos(-); and s. typhi ty2 rpos(+). sixty healthy adults (median age 25.2 years) were enrolled into 4 arms (total 15 subjects per arm); within each arm, subjects were randomized 1:1:1 into 3 groups of 5. all subjects in the same group received the same vaccine vector, and all subjects in the same arm received the same titer of vaccine (10(7), 10(8), 10(9) or 10(10)cfu). adverse events, safety, shedding, and igg and iga titers against salmonella outer membrane proteins (omps), lipopolysaccharide (lps) and pspa were evaluated. results: in the highest dose group, no subject experienced severe reactions or serious adverse events. most adverse events were mild; one subject had a positive blood culture. no subject shed vaccine in stool. no statistically significant differences for post vaccination elisa or elispot results between groups were detected. however, a limited number of >/= 4 fold increases from baseline for iga anti-omps, iga and igg anti-lps, and iga anti-pspa occurred for a few individuals as measured by elisa, and iga anti-omps as measured by elispot assay. conclusions: all three s. typhi vectored pneumococcal vaccines were safe and well-tolerated. immunogenicity was limited possibly due to pre-existing high antibody titers prior to vaccination. increases in iga were most often observed.

TI == on-chip microbial culture for the specific detection of very low levels of bacteria.
AB == microbial culture continues to be the most common protocol for bacterial detection and identification in medicine and agronomics. using this process may take days to identify a specific pathogen for most bacterial strains. surface plasmon resonance (spr) detection is an emerging alternative technology that can be used for the detection of bacteria using protein microarrays although typical limits of detection are in the range of 10(3)-10(6) cfu ml(-1), which is not compatible with most food safety regulation requirements. in this work, we combine concomitant "on-chip" microbial culture with sensitive spr detection of bacteria thus allowing rapid specific detection of bacteria pathogens - including salmonella enterica serovar enteritidis, streptococcus pneumoniae and escherichia coli o157:h7 - cultured on a protein microarray. this culture-capture-measure (ccm) approach significantly decreases both the number of processing steps and the overall assay time for bacterial detection. signal analysis of spr responses allowed the fast and quantitative assessment of bacterial concentrations initially present in the sample as low as 2.8 +/- 19.6 cfu per milliliter. altogether, our results show how simple, easy-to-operate, fluidic-less and lo-tec microarrays can be used with unprocessed samples and yield - in a single assay - both qualitative and quantitative information regarding bacterial contamination.

TI == multiple antigen-presenting system (maps) to induce comprehensive b- and t-cell immunity.
AB == vaccines are among the most effective approaches to prevent and control many infectious diseases. because of safety and reproducibility concerns, whole-cell vaccines (wcvs), made from live or killed microorganisms and including hundreds of antigenic components, have been mostly replaced by acellular or subunit vaccines composed of well-defined, purified antigen components. the efficacy of acellular vaccines is inferior to that of wcvs, however, for two major reasons: limited antigen diversity and reduced immunogenicity, especially in a lack of activation of antigen-specific t-cell immunity, which plays an important role in protection against mucosal and intracellular pathogens. here we present the multiple antigen-presenting system (maps), which enables the creation of a macromolecular complex that mimics the properties of wcvs by integrating various antigen components, including polysaccharides and proteins, in the same construct and that induces multipronged immune responses, including antibody, th1, and th17 responses. using antigens from various pathogens (streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhi, and mycobacterium tuberculosis), we demonstrate the versatility of the maps system and its feasibility for the design of unique defined-structure subunit vaccines to confer comprehensive protection via multiple immune mechanisms. moreover, maps can serve as a tool for structure-activity analysis of cellular immunogens.

AB == recent advances in high-throughput rna sequencing (rna-seq) have enabled tremendous leaps forward in our understanding of bacterial transcriptomes. however, computational methods for analysis of bacterial transcriptome data have not kept pace with the large and growing data sets generated by rna-seq technology. here, we present new algorithms, specific to bacterial gene structures and transcriptomes, for analysis of rna-seq data. the algorithms are implemented in an open source software system called rockhopper that supports various stages of bacterial rna-seq data analysis, including aligning sequencing reads to a genome, constructing transcriptome maps, quantifying transcript abundance, testing for differential gene expression, determining operon structures and visualizing results. we demonstrate the performance of rockhopper using 2.1 billion sequenced reads from 75 rna-seq experiments conducted with escherichia coli, neisseria gonorrhoeae, salmonella enterica, streptococcus pyogenes and xenorhabdus nematophila. we find that the transcriptome maps generated by our algorithms are highly accurate when compared with focused experimental data from e. coli and n. gonorrhoeae, and we validate our system's ability to identify novel small rnas, operons and transcription start sites. our results suggest that rockhopper can be used for efficient and accurate analysis of bacterial rna-seq data, and that it can aid with elucidation of bacterial transcriptomes.

TI == evaluation of regulated delayed attenuation strategies for salmonella enterica serovar typhi vaccine vectors in neonatal and infant mice.
AB == we developed regulated delayed attenuation strategies for salmonella vaccine vectors. in this study, we evaluated the combination of these strategies in recombinant attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhi and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine vectors with similar genetic backgrounds in vitro and in vivo. our goal is to develop a vaccine to prevent streptococcus pneumoniae infection in newborns; thus, all strains delivered a pneumococcal antigen pspa and the impact of maternal antibodies was evaluated. the results showed that all strains with the regulated delayed attenuated phenotype (rdap) displayed an invasive ability stronger than that of the s. typhi vaccine strain, ty21a, but weaker than that of their corresponding wild-type parental strains. the survival curves of different rdap vaccine vectors in vitro and in vivo exhibited diverse regulated delayed attenuation kinetics, which was different from s. typhi ty21a and the wild-type parental strains. under the influence of maternal antibody, the persistence of the s. typhimurium rdap strain displayed a regulated delayed attenuation trend in nasal lymphoid tissue (nalt), lung, and peyer's patches, while the persistence of s. typhi rdap strains followed the curve only in nalt. the bacterial loads of s. typhi rdap strains were lower in nalt, lung, and peyer's patches in mice born to immune mothers than in those born to naive mothers. in accordance with these results, rdap vaccine strains induced high titers of igg antibodies against pspa and against salmonella lipopolysaccharides. immunization of mothers with s. typhi rdap strains enhanced the level of vaginal mucosal iga, gamma interferon (ifn-gamma), and interleukin 4 (il-4) and resulted in a higher level of protection against s. pneumoniae challenge.

TI == development and application of a multiplex pcr assay for rapid detection of 4 major bacterial pathogens in ducks.
AB == infections with pasteurella multocida, salmonella enterica, riemerella anatipestifer, and escherichia coli result in high morbidity and mortality, which cause significant economic loss in the poultry industry. it can be difficult to distinguish these pathogens based on clinical signs because these pathogens can cause similar clinical signs and coinfections can occur. thus, rapid and sensitive detection of these 4 major bacterial pathogens are important in ducks. the aim of this study was to develop a multiplex pcr (mpcr) assay for simultaneously detecting and identifying these 4 pathogenic bacteria in a single tube reaction. the target genes used were kmt1 of p. multocida, the invasion protein gene of s. enterica, 16s rdna of r. anatipestifer, and the alkaline phosphatase gene of e. coli. the detection limit of the assay for all bacterial dna was 10 pg. the mpcr did not produce any nonspecific amplification products when tested against other related pathogens, including staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, clostridium perfringens, mycoplasma gallinarum, mycoplasma synoviae, and mycoplasma gallisepticum, which can also infect ducks. we applied mpcr to field samples, and the results were the same as the single pcr results. these results suggest that mpcr for the 4 bacteria is a useful and rapid technique to apply to field samples.

TI == cd137 expressed on neutrophils plays dual roles in antibacterial responses against gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial infections.
AB == severe sepsis and septic shock caused mainly by bacterial infections are life-threatening conditions that urge the development of novel therapies. however, host responses to and pathophysiology of sepsis have not been clearly understood, which remains a major obstacle for the development of effective therapeutics. recently, we have shown that stimulation of a costimulatory molecule, cd137, enhanced survival of mice infected with the gram-positive (g(+)) intracellular bacterium listeria monocytogenes but decreased survival in a polymicrobial sepsis model. herein, we report that cd137 deficiency or blocking of cd137 signaling decreased antibacterial responses of mice infected with g(+) bacteria (staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, and enterococcus faecalis) but increased these responses in mice infected with gram-negative (g(-)) bacteria (escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium). consistent with these findings, stimulation of cd137 by administration of agonistic antibody enhanced responses against g(+) bacteria, whereas it decreased these responses against g(-) bacteria. neutrophils were responsible for cd137-mediated opposite roles in control of g(+) and g(-) bacterial infections. stimulation of cd137 enhanced activities of neutrophils against s. aureus but decreased these activities against e. coli, while cd137 blocking produced opposite results with the stimulation of cd137 in vivo and in vitro. furthermore, we found that combined signaling of cd137 and toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2) induced synergistic production of tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) and interleukin-6 (il-6) by neutrophils, but combined signaling of cd137 and tlr4 did not. our data strongly suggest that cd137 may play a dual role in sepsis in association with tlrs.

TI == diverse phosphorylation patterns of b cell receptor-associated signaling in naive and memory human b cells revealed by phosphoflow, a powerful technique to study signaling at the single cell level.
AB == following interaction with cognate antigens, b cells undergo cell activation, proliferation, and differentiation. ligation of the b cell receptor (bcr) leads to the phosphorylation of bcr-associated signaling proteins within minutes of antigen binding, a process with profound consequences for the fate of the cells and development of effector immunity. phosphoflow allows a rapid evaluation of various signaling pathways in complex heterogenous cell subsets. this novel technique was used in combination with multi-chromatic flow cytometry (fc) and fluorescent-cell barcoding (fcb) to study phosphorylation of bcr-associated signaling pathways in naive and memory human b cell subsets. proteins of the initiation (syk), propagation (btk, akt), and integration (p38mapk and erk1/2) signaling units were studied. switched memory (sm) cd27+ and sm cd27- phosphorylation patterns were similar when stimulated with anti-iga or -igg. in contrast, naive and unswitched memory (um) cells showed significant differences following igm stimulation. enhanced phosphorylation of syk was observed in um cells, suggesting a lower activation threshold. this is likely the result of higher amounts of igm on the cell surface, higher pan-syk levels, and enhanced susceptibility to phosphatase inhibition. all other signaling proteins evaluated also showed some degree of enhanced phosphorylation in um cells. furthermore, both the phospholipase c-gamma2 (plc-gamma2) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi3k) pathways were activated in um cells, while only the pi3k pathway was activated on naive cells. um cells were the only ones that activated signaling pathways when stimulated with fluorescently labeled s. typhi and s. pneumoniae. finally, simultaneous evaluation of signaling proteins at the single cell level (multiphosphorylated cells) revealed that interaction with gram positive and negative bacteria resulted in complex and diverse signaling patterns. phosphoflow holds great potential to accelerate vaccine development by identifying signaling profiles in good/poor responders.

TI == characterization of lactic acid bacteria from naturally-fermented manzanilla alorena green table olives.
AB == manzanilla alorena (or alorena) table olives are naturally fermented traditional  green olives with a denomination of protection (dop). the aim of this study was to search for lactic acid bacteria (lab) with technological properties of interest for possible inclusion in a starter or protective culture preparation or also as probiotics. a collection of 144 lab obtained from alorena green table olives naturally-fermented by four small-medium enterprises (smes) from malaga (spain), including lactobacilli (81.94%), leuconostocs (10.42%) and pediococci (7.64%) were studied. rep-pcr clustering and further identification of strains by sequencing of phes and rpo genes revealed that all lactobacilli from the different smes were lactobacillus pentosus. pediococci were identified as pediococcus parvulus (sme1) and leuconostocs as leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides (sme1 and sme4). genotyping revealed that strains were not clonally related and exhibited a considerable degree of genomic diversity specially for lactobacilli and also for leuconostocs. some strains exhibit useful technological properties such as production of antimicrobial substances active against pathogenic bacteria such as listeria monocytogenes, bacillus cereus, staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus mutans and salmonella enterica, utilization of raffinose and stachyose, production of bile salt hydrolase, phytase and haeme-dependent catalase activities, growth at 10 degrees c and in the presence of 6.5% nacl, good acidifying capacity and also resistance to freezing. however, none of the isolates showed protease or amylase activity, and also did not exhibit biogenic amine production from histidine, ornithine, cysteine or tyrosine. on the basis of data obtained, selected strains with potential traits were tested for their survival at low ph and their tolerance to bile salts, and the survival capacity demonstrated by some of the analysed strains are encouraging to further study their potential as probiotics.

TI == antibacterial activity and dual mechanisms of peptide analog derived from cell-penetrating peptide against salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pyogenes.
AB == a number of research have proven that antimicrobial peptides are of greatest potential as a new class of antibiotics. antimicrobial peptides and cell-penetrating peptides share some similar structure characteristics. in our study, a new peptide analog, app (glaraltrllrqltrqltra) from the cell-penetrating peptide pptg20 (glfrallrllrslwrlllra), was identified simultaneously with the antibacterial mechanism of app against salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pyogenes. app displayed potent antibacterial activity against gram-negative and gram-positive strains. the minimum inhibitory concentration was in the range of 2 to 4 mum. app displayed higher cell selectivity (about 42-fold increase) as compared to the parent peptide for it decreased hemolytic activity and increased antimicrobial activity. the calcein leakage from egg yolk l-alpha-phosphatidylcholine (eypc)/egg yolk l-alpha-phosphatidyl-dl-glycerol and eypc/cholesterol vesicles demonstrated that app exhibited high selectivity. the antibacterial mechanism analysis indicated that app induced membrane permeabilization in a kinetic manner for membrane lesions allowing o-nitrophenyl-beta-d-galactoside uptake into cells and potassium release from app-treated cells. flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that app induced bacterial live cell membrane damage. circular dichroism, fluorescence spectra, and gel retardation analysis confirmed that app interacted with dna and intercalated into the dna base pairs after penetrating the cell membrane. cell cycle assay showed that app affected dna synthesis in the cell. our results suggested that peptides derived from the cell-penetrating peptide have the potential for antimicrobial agent development, and app exerts its antibacterial activity by damaging bacterial cell membranes and binding to bacterial dna to inhibit cellular functions, ultimately leading to cell death.

TI == the asd(+)-dadb(+) dual-plasmid system offers a novel means to deliver multiple protective antigens by a recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine.
AB == we developed means to deliver multiple heterologous antigens on dual plasmids with non-antibiotic-resistance markers in a single recombinant attenuated vaccine strain of salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium. the first component of this delivery system is a strain of s. typhimurium carrying genomic deletions in alr, dadb, and asd, resulting in obligate requirements for diaminopimelic acid (dap) and d-alanine for growth. the second component is the asd(+)-dadb(+) plasmid pair carrying wild-type copies of asda and dadb, respectively, to complement the mutations. to evaluate the protection efficacy of the dual-plasmid vaccine, s. typhimurium strain chi9760 (a strain with multiple attenuating mutations: deltaasd deltaalr deltadadb deltarecf) was transformed with asd(+) and dadb(+) plasmids specifying pneumococcal antigens pspa and pspc, respectively. both plasmids were stable in chi9760 for 50 generations when grown in nonselective medium. this was significantly (p < 0.05) greater than the stability seen in its recf(+) counterpart chi9590 and could be attributed to reduced interplasmid recombination in chi9760. oral immunization of balb/c mice with 1 x 10(9) cfu of chi9760 (carrying asd(+)-pspa and dadb(+)-pspc plasmids) elicited a dominant th1-type serum igg response against both antigens and protected mice against intraperitoneal challenge with 200 50% lethal doses (ld(50)s) of virulent streptococcus pneumoniae strain wu2 or intravenous challenge with 100 ld(50)s of virulent s. pneumoniae strain l81905 or intranasal challenge with a lethal dose of s. pneumoniae a66.1 in a pneumonia model. protection offered by chi9760 was superior to that offered by the mixture of two strains, chi9828 (asd(+)-pspa) and chi11026 (dadb(+)-pspc). this novel dual-plasmid system marks a remarkable improvement in the development of live bacterial vaccines.

TI == phosphate groups of lipid a are essential for salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium virulence and affect innate and adaptive immunity.
AB == lipid a is a key component of the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria and stimulates proinflammatory responses via the toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-md2-cd14 pathway. its endotoxic activity depends on the number and length of acyl chains and its phosphorylation state. in salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, removal of the secondary laurate or myristate chain in lipid a results in bacterial attenuation and growth defects in vitro. however, the roles of the two lipid a phosphate groups in bacterial virulence and immunogenicity remain unknown. here, we used an s. typhimurium msbb pagl pagp lpxr mutant, carrying penta-acylated lipid a, as the parent strain to construct a series of mutants synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated, 4'-dephosphorylated, or nonphosphorylated penta-acylated lipid a. dephosphorylated mutants exhibited increased sensitivity to deoxycholate and showed increased resistance to polymyxin b. removal of both phosphate groups severely attenuated the mutants when administered orally to balb/c mice, but the mutants colonized the lymphatic tissues and were sufficiently immunogenic to protect the host from challenge with wild-type s. typhimurium. mice receiving s. typhimurium with 1-dephosphorylated or nonphosphorylated penta-acylated lipid a exhibited reduced levels of cytokines. attenuated and dephosphorylated salmonella vaccines were able to induce adaptive immunity against heterologous (pspa of streptococcus pneumoniae) and homologous antigens (lipopolysaccharide [lps] and outer membrane proteins [omps]).

TI == sialidase specificity determined by chemoselective modification of complex sialylated glycans.

AB == salmonella continues to be a significant human health threat, and the objective of this study was to identify microorganisms with the potential to improve porcine food-safety through their antagonism of salmonella. anaerobic culture supernatants of 973 bacterial isolates from the gastrointestinal tract and feces of swine were screened for their capacity to inhibit the growth of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. growth inhibition of 1000-fold or greater was observed from 16 isolates, and 16s rrna sequencing identified the isolates as members of the genera mitsuokella, escherichia/shigella, anaerovibrio, selenomonas, and streptococcus. four isolates were identified as mitsuokella jalaludinii, and the mechanism of salmonella typhimurium growth inhibition by m. jalaludinii was further investigated. m. jalaludinii stationary phase culture supernatants were observed to significantly inhibit growth, and featured the production of lactic, succinic, and acetic acids. aerobic and anaerobic s. typhimurium growth was restored when the ph of the culture supernatants (ph 4.6) was increased to ph 6.8. however, s. typhimurium growth in fermentation acid-free media was the same at ph 4.6 and ph 6.8 - indicating a synergistic effect between fermentation acid production and low ph as the cause of s. typhimurium growth inhibition. furthermore, exposure of s. typhimurium to m. jalaludinii culture supernatants inhibited salmonella invasion of hep-2 cells by 10-fold. the results identify m. jalaludinii as a possible inhibitor of salmonella growth and invasion in swine, and thus a potential probiotic capable of improving food safety.

AB == pneumococcal and salmonella typhi infections are two major diseases for children  in developing countries. for typhoid fever, licensed vi polysaccharide vaccines are ineffective in children <2-year old. while investigational vi conjugate vaccines have been shown effective in clinical trials, they are currently only available to restricted areas. pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccines are highly effective in children, but suffer from some limitations including cost and limited serotype coverage. we have previously shown that a fusion conjugate vaccine, consisting of pneumococcal fusion protein psaa and pneumolysoid (pdt) conjugated to a polysaccharide, results in enhanced antibody and cd4+ th17 cell responses as well as protection against pneumococcal colonization and disease in mice. here we applied this approach to develop a bivalent vaccine against pneumococcus and s. typhi. two species-conserved pneumococcal antigens (sp1572 or sp2070) were fused to the nonhemolytic pneumolysoid pdt. sp1572-pdt was then conjugated to vi polysaccharide and sp2070-pdt was conjugated to the pneumococcal cell wall polysaccharide (cwps; also conserved). mice immunized with this bivalent conjugate were protected against pneumococcal colonization and sepsis challenges, and made anti-vi antibody concentrations higher by 40-fold compared to mice that received equimolar mixtures of the antigens. an enhanced killing of vi-bearing salmonellae in vitro was demonstrated from plasma of mice that received the fusion conjugate but not the mixture of antigens. our results support further evaluation of this bivalent immunogen for the prevention of pneumococcal colonization and disease, and of typhoid fever.

TI == inhibition of bacterial carbonic anhydrases and zinc proteases: from orphan targets to innovative new antibiotic drugs.
AB == zinc-containing enzymes, such as carbonic anhydrases (cas) and metalloproteases (mps) play critical functions in bacteria, being involved in various steps of their life cycle, which are important for survival, colonization, acquisition of nutrients for growth and proliferation, facilitation of dissemination, invasion and pathogenicity. the development of resistance to many classes of clinically used antibiotics emphasizes the need of new antibacterial drug targets to be explored. there is a wealth of data regarding bacterial cas and zinc mps present in many pathogenic species, such as neisseria spp., helycobacter pylori escherichia coli, mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, haemophilus influenzae, listeria spp, vibrio spp., pseudomonas aeruginosa, legionella pneumophila, streptomyces spp., clostridium spp., enterococcus spp., etc. some of these enzymes have been cloned, purified and characterized by crystallographic techniques. however, for the moment, few potent and specific inhibitors for bacterial mps have been reported except for clostridium histolyticum collagenase, botulinum and tetanus neurotoxin and anthrax lethal factor, which will be reviewed in this article. bacteria encode alpha-,beta-, and/or gamma-ca families, but up to now only the first two classes have been investigated in some detail in different species. the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and h. pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from e. coli, h. pylori, m. tuberculosis, brucella spp., s. pneumoniae, s. enterica and h. influenzae have been cloned and characterized. the catalytic/inhibition mechanisms of these cas are well understood as x-ray crystal structures are available for some of them, but no adducts of these enzymes with inhibitors have been characterized so far. in vitro and in vivo studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates have been reported. only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis and s. pneumoniae cas it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas and mps represent at this moment very promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI == rapid biosynthesis of silver nanoparticles from bacillus megaterium (ncim 2326) and their antibacterial activity on multi drug resistant clinical pathogens.
AB == the notion to fight against multi drug resistant pathogens is a great deal in the field of nanomedicine. the identifiable antimicrobial action of metal bionanoparticles on many microorganisms is reported earlier. as silver bionanoparticles (ag-bnps) are known to have efficient antibacterial properties they are synthesized in ecofriendly and biocompatible way. the present study is focused on the extracellular biosynthesis of highly stable ag-bnps from bacterial strain bacillus megaterium (ncim 2326) by bio-reduction of silver ion using the culture supernatant, and to determine the antibacterial efficacy on multi drug resistant clinical pathogens such as streptococcus pneumoniae and salmonella typhi. the biosynthesis process is rapid and ag-bnps are formed within few minutes if agno(3) comes to contact with cell filtrate. furthermore the synthesized ag-bnps are characterized by uv-vis spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (afm), thin layer chromatography (tlc) and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ftir).

TI == bacterial carbonic anhydrases as drug targets: toward novel antibiotics?
AB == carbonic anhydrases (cas, ec 4.2.1.1) are metalloenzymes which catalyze the hydration of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate and protons. many pathogenic bacteria encode such enzymes belonging to the alpha-, beta-, and/or gamma-ca families. in the last decade, the alpha-cas from neisseria spp. and helicobacter pylori as well as the beta-class enzymes from escherichia coli, h. pylori,mycobacterium tuberculosis, brucella spp., streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, and haemophilus influenzae have been cloned and characterized in detail. for some of these enzymes the x-ray crystal structures were determined, and in vitro and in vivo inhibition studies with various classes of inhibitors, such as anions, sulfonamides and sulfamates reported. although efficient inhibitors have been reported for many such enzymes, only for neisseria spp., h. pylori, b. suis, and s. pneumoniae enzymes it has been possible to evidence inhibition of bacterial growth in vivo. thus, bacterial cas represent promising targets for obtaining antibacterials devoid of the resistance problems of the clinically used such agents but further studies are needed to validate these and other less investigated enzymes as novel drug targets.

TI == effect of deletion of genes involved in lipopolysaccharide core and o-antigen synthesis on virulence and immunogenicity of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium.
AB == lipopolysaccharide (lps) is a major virulence factor of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium and is composed of lipid a, core oligosaccharide (c-os), and o-antigen polysaccharide (o-ps). while the functions of the gene products involved in synthesis of core and o-antigen have been elucidated, the effect of removing o-antigen and core sugars on the virulence and immunogenicity of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has not been systematically studied. we introduced nonpolar, defined deletion mutations in waag (rfag), waai (rfai), rfah, waaj (rfaj), wbap (rfbp), waal (rfal), or wzy (rfc) into wild-type s. typhimurium. the lps structure was confirmed, and a number of in vitro and in vivo properties of each mutant were analyzed. all mutants were significantly attenuated compared to the wild-type parent when administered orally to balb/c mice and were less invasive in host tissues. strains with deltawaag and deltawaai mutations, in particular, were deficient in colonization of peyer's patches and liver. this deficiency could be partially overcome in the deltawaai mutant when it was administered intranasally. in the context of an attenuated vaccine strain delivering the pneumococcal antigen pspa, all of the mutations tested resulted in reduced immune responses against pspa and salmonella antigens. our results indicate that nonreversible truncation of the outer core is not a viable option for developing a live oral salmonella vaccine, while a wzy mutant that retains one o-antigen unit is adequate for stimulating the optimal protective immunity to homologous or heterologous antigens by oral, intranasal, or intraperitoneal routes of administration.

TI == contribution of a streptococcus mutans antigen expressed by a salmonella vector vaccine in dendritic cell activation.
AB == a salmonella vector vaccine expressing the saliva-binding region (sbr) of the adhesin agi/ii of streptococcus mutans has been shown to induce a mixed th1/th2 anti-sbr immune response in mice and to require toll-like receptor 2 (tlr2), tlr4, and myd88 signaling for the induction of mucosal anti-sbr antibody responses. since dendritic cells (dc) are critical in innate and adaptive immunity, the present study assessed the role of sbr expression by the vector vaccine in dc activation. bone marrow-derived dc from wild-type and tlr2, tlr4, and myd88 knockout mice were stimulated with salmonella vector brd509, the sbr-expressing salmonella vector vaccine brd509(psbrt7), or sbr protein, and the dc responses to different stimuli were compared by assessing costimulatory molecule expression, cytokine production, and signaling pathways. the dc response to both brd509(psbrt7) and brd509 was dependent mainly on tlr4. brd509(psbrt7) and brd509 induced upregulation of cd80, cd86, cd40, and major histocompatibility complex class ii (mhc ii) expression. lower levels of interleukin-10 (il-10) and il-12p40 were produced by brd509(psbrt7)-stimulated dc than by brd509-stimulated dc. furthermore, brd509(psbrt7)-stimulated dc showed decreased p38 phosphorylation compared to that induced by dc stimulated with brd509. however, brd509(psbrt7)-treated dc produced a higher level of il-6 than brd509-stimulated cells. the low il-12p40 and high il-6 cytokine profile expressed by brd509(psbrt7)-stimulated dc may represent a shift toward a th2 response, as suggested by the increased expression in jagged-1. these results provide novel evidence that a heterologous protein expressed by a salmonella vector vaccine can differentially affect dc activation.

TI == susceptibility of bacterial isolates from community-acquired infections in sub-saharan africa and asia to macrolide antibiotics.
AB == objective: to review the literature on the susceptibility of common community pathogens in sub-saharan africa and asia to the macrolide antibiotics. methods: inclusion criteria required that isolates were collected since 2004 to ensure results were of contemporary relevance. the data were aggregated by region, age group and sterility of site of culture sample. results: a total of 51 studies were identified, which reported the macrolide antimicrobial susceptibilities of common bacterial pathogens isolated since 2004. in general, there was less macrolide resistance in african than in asian isolates. most african studies reported high levels of macrolide susceptibility in streptococcus pneumoniae, whereas most chinese studies reported high levels of resistance. there was very little information available for gram-negative organisms. conclusions: susceptibility of the pneumococcus to macrolides in ssa remains high in many areas, and good activity of azithromycin has been shown against salmonellae spp. in asia. in urban areas where high antibiotic consumption is prevalent, there was evidence of increased resistance to macrolides. however, there is no information on susceptibility from large areas in both continents.

TI == microbiological identification and analysis of swine tonsils collected from carcasses at slaughter.
AB == the primary objective of this 7-month study was to determine the prevalence of porcine pathogens of the tonsil of the soft palate of swine at slaughter. additional objectives were to determine if sampling the carcasses of normal or abnormal hogs provided different microbiological profiles and if the slaughter plant provides a feasible sampling frame and environment for detecting and monitoring important pathogens in tonsils that have health implications for both swine and humans. a total of 395 samples were collected from 264 farms. of these, 180 tonsils were collected from normal carcasses and 215 tonsils were collected from carcasses that were diverted to the hold rail. laboratory testing included bacteriological culture and identification as well as real time-polymerase chain reaction (pcr) testing for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (pprsv) and immunohistochemistry (ihc) for porcine circovirus-2 (pcv-2). the most commonly isolated bacteria included: streptococcus suis (53.7%), arcanobacterium pyogenes (29.9%), pasteurella multocida (27.3%), and streptococcus porcinus (19.5%). virus screening revealed evidence of prrsv and pcv-2 in 22.0% and 11.9% of the samples, respectively. salmonella typhimurium and yersinia enterocolitica were isolated in 0.5% and 1.8% of the samples, respectively. tonsils collected from the hold rail were more likely to be positive for staphylococcus hyicus [odds ratio (or) = 7.51, confidence interval (ci) = 2.89 to 19.54], streptococcus porcinus (or = 9.93, ci = 4.27 to 23.10), and streptococcus suis (or = 2.16, ci = 1.45 to 3.24). tonsils collected from abnormal carcasses were less likely to be positive for staphylococcus aureus (or = 0.05, ci = 0.005 to 0.482).

TI == salmonella synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated [corrected] lipopolysaccharide exhibits low endotoxic activity while retaining its immunogenicity.
AB == the development of safe live, attenuated salmonella vaccines may be facilitated by detoxification of its lps. recent characterization of the lipid a 1-phosphatase, lpxe, from francisella tularensis allowed us to construct recombinant, plasmid-free strains of salmonella that produce predominantly 1-dephosphorylated lipid a, similar to the adjuvant approved for human use. complete lipid a 1-dephosphorylation was also confirmed under low ph, low mg(2+) culture conditions, which induce lipid a modifications. lpxe expression in salmonella reduced its virulence in mice by five orders of magnitude. moreover, mice inoculated with these detoxified strains were protected against wild-type challenge. candidate salmonella vaccine strains synthesizing pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) were also confirmed to possess nearly complete lipid a 1-dephosphorylation. after inoculation by the lpxe/pspa strains, mice produced robust levels of anti-pspa abs and showed significantly improved survival against challenge with wild-type streptococcus pneumoniae wu2 compared with vector-only-immunized mice, validating salmonella synthesizing 1-dephosphorylated lipid a as an ag-delivery system.

AB == certain serovars of salmonella enterica subsp. enterica cause invasive disease (e.g., enteric fever, bacteremia, septicemia, meningitis, etc.) in humans and constitute a global public health problem. a rapid, sensitive diagnostic test is needed to allow prompt initiation of therapy in individual patients and for measuring disease burden at the population level. an innovative and promising new rapid diagnostic technique is microwave-accelerated metal-enhanced fluorescence (mamef). we have adapted this assay platform to detect the chromosomal oric locus common to all salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovars. we have shown efficient lysis of biologically relevant concentrations of salmonella spp. suspended in bacteriological media using microwave-induced lysis. following lysis and dna release, as little as 1 cfu of salmonella in 1 ml of medium can be detected in <30 seconds. furthermore the assay is sensitive and specific: it can detect oric from salmonella serovars typhi, paratyphi a, paratyphi b, paratyphi c, typhimurium, enteritidis and choleraesuis but does not detect escherichia coli, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae, streptococcus pneumoniae, haemophilus influenzae or acinetobacter baumanii. we have also performed preliminary experiments using a synthetic salmonella oric oligonucleotide suspended in whole human blood and observed rapid detection when the sample was diluted 1:1 with pbs. these pre-clinical data encourage progress to the next step to detect salmonella in blood (and other ordinarily sterile, clinically relevant body fluids).

AB == gram-negative bacteria produce outer membrane vesicles (omvs) that serve a variety of functions related to survival and pathogenicity. periplasmic and outer membrane proteins are naturally captured during vesicle formation. this property has been exploited as a method to derive immunogenic vesicle preparations for use as vaccines. in this work, we constructed a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain that synthesized a derivative of the pneumococcal protein pspa engineered to be secreted into the periplasmic space. vesicles isolated from this strain contained pspa in the lumen. mice intranasally immunized with the vesicle preparation developed serum antibody responses against vesicle components that included pspa and salmonella-derived lipopolysaccharide and outer membrane proteins, while no detectable responses developed in mice immunized with an equivalent dose of purified pspa. mucosal iga responses developed against the salmonella components, while the response to pspa was less apparent in most mice. mice immunized with the vesicle preparation were completely protected against a 10x 50% lethal dose (ld(5)(0)) challenge of streptococcus pneumoniae and significantly protected against a 200x ld(5)(0) challenge, while control mice immunized with purified pspa or empty vesicles were not protected. these results establish that vesicles can be used to mucosally deliver an antigen from a gram-positive organism and induce a protective immune response.

AB == background: the evolution and spread of antibiotic resistance, as well as the evolution of new strains of disease causing agents, is of great concern to the global health community. our ability to effectively treat disease is dependent on the development of new pharmaceuticals, and one potential source of novel drugs is traditional medicine. this study explores the antibacterial properties of plants used in haudenosaunee traditional medicine. we tested the hypothesis that extracts from haudenosaunee medicinal plants used to treat symptoms often caused by bacterial infection would show antibacterial properties in laboratory assays, and that these extracts would be more effective against moderately virulent bacteria than less virulent bacteria. methods: after identification and harvesting, a total of 57 different aqueous extractions were made from 15 plant species. nine plant species were used in haudenosaunee medicines and six plant species, of which three are native to the region and three are introduced, were not used in traditional medicine. antibacterial activity against mostly avirulent (escherichia coli, streptococcus lactis) and moderately virulent (salmonella typhimurium, staphylococcus aureus) microbes was inferred through replicate disc diffusion assays; and observed and statistically predicted mic values were determined through replicate serial dilution assays. results: although there was not complete concordance between the traditional use of haudenosaunee medicinal plants and antibacterial activity, our data support the hypothesis that the selection and use of these plants to treat disease was not random. in particular, four plant species exhibited antimicrobial properties as expected (achillea millefolium, ipomoea pandurata, hieracium pilosella, and solidago canadensis), with particularly strong effectiveness against s. typhimurium. in addition, extractions from two of the introduced species (hesperis matronalis and rosa multiflora) were effective against this pathogen. conclusions: our data suggest that further screening of plants used in traditional haudenosaunee medicine is warranted, and we put forward several species for further investigation of activity against s. typhimurium (a. millefolium, h. matronalis, i. pandurata, h. pilosella, r. multiflora, s. canadensis).

AB == effective antimicrobials currently in use in europe and throughout the world are  fast losing ground as many pathogens acquire resistance to newly introduced drugs. multidrug and panresistance have now been identified in many pathogens, as iteratively discussed throughout this year's meeting of the european congress of clinical microbiology and infectious diseases (eccmid). as extensively discussed in an oral session entitled worldwide dissemination of resistances by 10 specialists from across europe and the world, important drug resistances have now been identified in staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pneumoniae, escherichia coli, klebsiella pneumoniae, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, acinetobacter baumanii and virtually all known pathogens (roede, b.m. et al., abst o127; huenger, f. et al., abst o395; mera, r.m. et al., abst o483). while many other issues were discussed, including the role of healthcare professionals and of hand hygiene in controlling the spread of infections (derde, l. et al., abst o464), microbial resistance was indeed the main topic of discussion in the many oral and poster presentations at the austria center in vienna. the war against the superbugs has been declared and initiatives have been taken for tracking and destroying difficult to treat pathogens. treatments of the diseases caused by these multidrug- and panresistant organisms continue, as manifested by new research and population surveys. however, with antimicrobial resistances as leitmotiv background music, other very recent scientific achievements and findings in diagnostics and treatment for infectious diseases took center stage in vienna, including important information on novel drugs for infectious diseases and the use and comparative effectiveness of extant drugs, as summarized in the following report.

TI == a low-cost approach to measure the burden of vaccine preventable diseases in urban areas.
AB == we piloted a low-cost approach to measure the disease burden of streptococcus pneumoniae, hib and salmonella typhi by leveraging the existing infrastructure of high performing microbiology laboratories at two large paediatric hospitals in dhaka bangladesh, and assessing the hospital utilization of the catchment population of these hospitals for different syndromes. s. typhi was the most common bacterium identified in culture and accounted for an estimated 211 hospitalizations per 100,000 children <5 years of age per year. meningitis due to s. pneumoniae was the most common cause of mortality accounting for 8.0 deaths per 100,000 children <5 years of age per year. this low-cost approach can provide data to support vaccine introduction and the health impact of newly introduced vaccines.

TI == regulated delayed expression of rfc enhances the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a heterologous antigen delivered by live attenuated salmonella enterica vaccines.
AB == the salmonella rfc gene encodes the o-antigen polymerase. we constructed three strains in which we replaced the native rfc promoter with the arabinose-dependent arac p(bad) promoter so that rfc expression was dependent on exogenously supplied arabinose provided during in vitro growth. the three mutant strains were designed to synthesize different amounts of rfc by altering the ribosome-binding sequence and start codon. we examined these strains for a number of in vitro characteristics compared to an isogenic deltarfc mutant and the wild-type parent strain. one promoter-replacement mutation, deltap(rfc174), yielded an optimal profile, exhibiting wild-type characteristics when grown with arabinose, and deltarfc characteristics when grown without arabinose. in addition, when administered orally, the deltap(rfc174) strain was completely attenuated in for virulence in mice. the deltap(rfc174) mutation was introduced into attenuated salmonella vaccine strain chi9241 (deltapaba deltapabb deltaasda) followed by introduction of an asd(+) balanced-lethal plasmid to designed for expression of the pneumococcal surface protein pspa. mice immunized with either chi9241 or its deltap(rfc174) derivative expressing pspa were protected against s. pneumoniae challenge.

TI == live recombinant salmonella typhi vaccines constructed to investigate the role of rpos in eliciting immunity to a heterologous antigen.
AB == we hypothesized that the immunogenicity of live salmonella enterica serovar typhi vaccines expressing heterologous antigens depends, at least in part, on its rpos status. as part of our project to develop a recombinant attenuated s. typhi vaccine (rastyv) to prevent pneumococcal diseases in infants and children, we constructed three rastyv strains synthesizing the streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein pspa to test this hypothesis. each vector strain carried ten engineered mutations designed to optimize safety and immunogenicity. two s. typhi vector strains (chi9639 and chi9640) were derived from the rpos mutant strain ty2 and one (chi9633) from the rpos(+) strain isp1820. in chi9640, the nonfunctional rpos gene was replaced with the functional rpos gene from isp1820. plasmid pya4088, encoding a secreted form of pspa, was moved into the three vector strains. the resulting rastyv strains were evaluated for safety in vitro and for immunogenicity in mice. all three rastyv strains were similar to the live attenuated typhoid vaccine ty21a in their ability to survive in human blood and human monocytes. they were more sensitive to complement and were less able to survive and persist in sewage and surface water than their wild-type counterparts. adult mice intranasally immunized with any of the rastyv strains developed immune responses against pspa and salmonella antigens. the rpos(+) vaccines induced a balanced th1/th2 immune response while the rpos(-) strain chi9639(pya4088) induced a strong th2 immune response. immunization with any rastyv provided protection against s. pneumoniae challenge; the rpos(+) strain chi9640(pya4088) provided significantly greater protection than the isp1820 derivative, chi9633(pya4088). in the pre-clinical setting, these strains exhibited a desirable balance between safety and immunogenicity and are currently being evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial to determine which of the three rastyvs has the optimal safety and immunogenicity profile in human hosts.

TI == enhanced protection against nasopharyngeal carriage of streptococcus pneumoniae elicited by oral multiantigen dna vaccines delivered in attenuated salmonella typhimurium.
AB == developing carrier systems and choosing appropriate antigens are essential steps  in improving the safety and efficacy of streptococcus pneumoniae dna vaccines, which have enhanced the mucosal protection against nasopharyngeal colonization. in this study, we reconstructed a salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system, which was used as carrier to orally deliver the streptococcus pneumoniae multiantigen dna vaccines encoding psaa (pneumococcal surface adhesion a) and pspa' (n-terminal of pneumococcal surface protein a) genes. the results showed that the multiantigen dna vaccines using the new vector system as carrier afforded better protection than the vaccination with injected intramuscularly (i.m.) against streptococcus pneumoniae d39 colonization infection in balb/c mice models. this finding has associated with a high level of siga in the nasal mucosa as well as systemic igg antibodies and a shift toward a th1-mediated immune response. these studies have demonstrated the feasibility and advantage of using the new salmonella-based balanced-lethal host-eukaryotic vector system as carrier to deliver s. pneumoniae dna vaccines.

TI == community-acquired bloodstream infections in africa: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
AB == data on the prevalence and causes of community-acquired bloodstream infections in africa are scarce. we searched three databases for studies that prospectively studied patients admitted to hospital with at least a blood culture, and found 22 eligible studies describing 58 296 patients, of whom 2051 (13.5%) of 15 166 adults and 3527 (8.2%) of 43 130 children had bloodstream infections. 1643 (29.1%) non-malaria bloodstream infections were due to salmonella enterica (58.4% of these non-typhoidal salmonella), the most prevalent isolate overall and in adults, and 1031 (18.3% overall) were due to streptococcus pneumoniae, the most common isolate in children. other common isolates included staphylococcus aureus (531 infections; 9.5%) and escherichia coli (412; 7.3%). mycobacterium tuberculosis complex accounted for 166 (30.7%) of 539 isolates in seven studies that used mycobacterial culture techniques. hiv infection was associated with any bloodstream infection, particularly with s enterica and m tuberculosis complex bacteraemia. where recorded, patients with bloodstream infections had an in-hospital case fatality of 18.1%. our results show that bloodstream infections are common and associated with high mortality. improved clinical microbiology services and reassessment of empirical treatment guidelines that account for the epidemiology of bloodstream infections might contribute to better outcomes.

AB == the immune stimulation induced by lactobacillus rhamnosus crl1505 (lr05) and l. rhamnosus crl1506 (lr06) on the resistance to infection with an intestinal pathogen (salmonella typhimurium) and a respiratory pathogen (streptococcus pneumoniae) was studied in swiss-albine mice experimental models. the cytokine profiles that induced the innate and specific immune response in both infectious processes were investigated. both strains were able to improve resistance against the intestinal pathogen. only lr05 was able to induce a significant decrease in the number of s. pneumoniae in the lung, prevent its dissemination into the blood and induce a significant increase in th1 (inf-gamma) and th2 (il-6, il-4 and il-10) cytokine levels in the bronchoalveolar lavages (bal). the changes in the cytokines profiles in bal were associated with an increase in the number and activity of phagocytic cells and with the increase in specific antibodies in serum and bal, which would explain the increased resistance to the challenge. the administration of lr06 did not induce significant effects at the respiratory mucosal level. the results described in the present paper showed that certain lab strains can share certain functional properties, although some of them can perform a functional role better than others, so that it is important to perform careful studies on specific strains, according to their therapeutic use.

AB == ag-coated cnts hybrid nanoparticles (ag/cnts) were prepared by ultrasonic irradiation of dimethylformamide (dmf) and silver (i) acetate precursors in the presence of cnts. the morphology of ag/cnts was characterized using x-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy (tem) techniques. the nylon-6 powder and 1 wt% ag/cnts mixture was dispersed uniformly using a noncontact spinning technique. the dried mixture was melted in a single screw extrusion machine and then extruded through an orifice. extruded filaments were later stretched and stabilized by sequentially passing them through a set of tension adjusters and a secondary heater. the nylon-6/ag/cnt hybrid polymer nanocomposite (hpnc) fibers, which were of approximately 80 microm size, were tested for their tensile properties. the failure stress and modulus of the extruded hpnc fibers (doped with 1% ag/cnts) was about 72.19 % and 342.62% higher than the neat extruded nylon-6 fiber, respectively. dsc results indicated an increase in the thermal stability and crystallization for hpnc fibers. the antibacterial activity of the ag-coated cnts, commercial ag, neat nylon-6 and plain cnts were evaluated. ag-coated cnts at 25 microg demonstrated good antimicrobial activity against four common bacterial pathogens as tested by the kirby-bauer assay. the mean diameters of the zones of inhibition were 27.9 +/- 6.72 mm, 19.4 +/- 3.64 mm, 21.9 +/- 4.33 mm, and 24.1 +/- 4.14 mm, respectively, for staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. by comparison, those obtained using the broad spectrum antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanic acid were 37.7 +/- 2.13 mm, 28.6 +/- 4.27 mm, 22.6 +/- 1.27 mm, and 27.0 +/- 1.41 mm, respectively, for the same strains. the zones of inhibition obtained for nylon-6 ag-coated cnt powder at 25 microg were also high, ranging from 15.2 to 25.3 mm in contrast to commercial silver or neat nylon-6, which did not inhibit the bacterial strains tested. further, the nylon-6 nanocomposite fibers infused with ag/cnts inhibited bacterial growth by 11-20%. our results suggest that nylon nanocomposite fibers infused with ag-coated cnts have significant antimicrobial activity.

TI == ndp52, a novel autophagy receptor for ubiquitin-decorated cytosolic bacteria.
AB == autophagy functions as a cell-autonomous effector mechanism of innate immunity by separating bacteria from cytosolic resources and delivering them for lysosomal destruction. how cytosolic bacteria are targeted for autophagy is incompletely understood. we recently discovered that salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium and streptococcus pyogenes are detected by ndp52 (nuclear dot protein 52 kda), after these bacteria enter the cytosol of human cells and become decorated with polyubiquitinated proteins. ndp52 binds the bacterial ubiquitin coat as well as atg8/lc3 and delivers cytosolic bacteria into autophagosomes. in the absence of ndp52 ubiquitin-coated bacteria accumulate outside atg8/lc3(+) autophagosomes. cells lacking ndp52 fail to restrict bacterial proliferation, as do cells depleted of tbk1, an ikk family kinase colocalizing with ndp52 at the bacterial surface. our findings demonstrate the existence of a receptor for the selective autophagy of cytosolic bacteria, suggesting that cells are able to differentiate between antibacterial and other forms of autophagy.

TI == immunogenicity of a live recombinant salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine expressing pspa in neonates and infant mice born from naive and immunized mothers.
AB == we are developing a salmonella vectored vaccine to prevent infant pneumonia and other diseases caused by streptococcus pneumoniae. one prerequisite for achieving this goal is to construct and evaluate new recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine (rasv) strains suitable for use in neonates and infants. salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain chi9558(pya4088) specifies delivery of the pneumococcal protective antigen pspa and can protect adult mice from challenge with s. pneumoniae. this strain is completely safe for oral delivery to day-old and infant mice. here we assess the colonizing ability, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of chi9558(pya4088) in neonatal mice. colonization was assessed in mice 0, 2, 4, or 7 days of age after oral inoculation. in the presence of maternal antibodies, the colonization of lymphoid tissues was delayed, but the immune responses were enhanced in mice born to immunized mothers. both oral and intranasal routes were used to assess immunogenicity. all orally or intranasally immunized neonatal and infant mice born to either immunized or naive mothers developed pspa-specific mucosal and systemic immune responses. mice born to immunized mothers produced higher titers of pspa-specific antibodies in the blood and mucosa and greater numbers of pspa-specific interleukin-4 (il-4)-secreting cells than mice born to naive mothers. more importantly, mice born to immune mothers showed a significant increase in protection against s. pneumoniae challenge. these results suggest that strain chi9558(pya4088) can circumvent some of the limitations of the immature immune system in neonatal and infant mice, generating enhanced protective immune responses in the presence of maternal antibodies.

TI == biochemical characterization of the rnase ii family of exoribonucleases from the  human pathogens salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB == maturation, turnover, and quality control of rna are performed by many different  classes of ribonucleases. escherichia coli rnase ii is the prototype of the rnase ii family of ribonucleases, a ubiquitous family of hydrolytic, processive 3' --> 5' exonucleases crucial in rna metabolism. rnase r is a member of this family that is modulated in response to stress and has been implicated in virulence. in this work, rnase ii-like proteins were characterized in the human pathogens salmonella typhimurium and streptococcus pneumoniae. by sequence analysis, only one member of the rnase ii family was identified in s. pneumoniae, while both rnase ii and rnase r were found in sa. typhimurium. these enzymes were cloned, expressed, purified, and characterized with regard to their biochemical features and modular architecture. the specificity of substrates and the final products generated by the enzymes were clearly demonstrated. sa. typhimurium rnase ii and rnase r behaved essentially as their respective e. coli counterparts. we have shown that the only hydrolytic rnase found in s. pneumoniae was able to degrade structured rnas as is the case with e. coli rnase r. our results further showed that there are differences with regard to the activity and ability to bind rna from enzymes belonging to two distinct pneumococcal strains, and this may be related to a single amino acid substitution in the catalytic domain. since ribonucleases have not been previously characterized in s. pneumoniae or sa. typhimurium, this work provides an important first step in the understanding of post-transcriptional control in these pathogens.

TI == regulated delayed expression of rfah in an attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine enhances immunogenicity of outer membrane proteins and a heterologous antigen.
AB == rfah is a transcriptional antiterminator that reduces the polarity of long operons encoding secreted and surface-associated cell components of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, including o antigen and lipopolysaccharide core sugars. a deltarfah mutant strain is attenuated in mice (50% lethal dose [ld(50)], >10(8) cfu). to examine the potential for using rfah in conjunction with other attenuating mutations, we designed a series of strains in which we replaced the native rfah promoter with the tightly regulated arabinose-dependent arac p(bad) promoter so that rfah expression was dependent on exogenously supplied arabinose provided during in vitro growth. following colonization of host lymphoid tissues, where arabinose was not available, the p(bad) promoter was no longer active and rfah was not expressed. in the absence of rfah, o antigen and core sugars were not synthesized. we constructed three mutant strains that expressed different levels of rfah by altering the ribosome-binding sequence and start codon. one mutation, deltap(rfah178), was introduced into the attenuated vaccine strain chi9241 (deltapaba deltapabb deltaasda) expressing the pneumococcal surface protein pspa from an asd(+) balanced-lethal plasmid. mice immunized with this strain and boosted 4 weeks later induced higher levels of serum immunoglobulin g specific for pspa and for outer membrane proteins from other enteric bacteria than either an isogenic deltarfah derivative or the isogenic rfah(+) parent. eight weeks after primary oral immunization, mice were challenged with 200 ld(50) of virulent streptococcus pneumoniae wu2. immunization with deltap(rfah178) mutant strains led to increased levels of protection compared to that of the parent chi9241 and of a deltarfah derivative of chi9241.

TI == pspa family fusion proteins delivered by attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium extend and enhance protection against streptococcus pneumoniae.
AB == pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) is highly immunogenic and can induce a protective immune response against pneumococcal infection. pspa is divided into two major families based on serological variability: family 1 and family 2. to provide broad protection, pspa proteins from pneumococcal strains rx1 (family 1) and ef5668 (family 2) were combined to form two pspa fusion proteins, pspa/rx1-ef5668 and pspa/ef5668-rx1. each protein was fused to a type ii secretion signal and delivered by a recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine (rasv). both pspa/rx1-ef5668 and pspa/ef5668-rx1 were synthesized in the rasv and secreted into the periplasm and supernatant. the fusion proteins reacted strongly with both anti-pspa/rx1 and anti-pspa/ef5668 antisera. oral immunization of balb/c mice with rasv synthesizing either pspa fusion protein elicited serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and mucosal iga responses against both families of pspa. analysis of igg isotypes (igg2a and igg1) indicated a strong th1 bias to the immune responses to both proteins. sera from mice immunized with rasv synthesizing pspa/rx1-ef5668 bound to the surface and directed c3 complement deposition on representative strains from all five pspa clades. immunization with rasv synthesizing either protein protected mice against intraperitoneal challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae wu2 strain (family 1), intravenous challenge with s. pneumoniae 3jyp2670 strain (family 2), and intranasal challenge with s. pneumoniae a66.1 (family 1). the pspa/rx1-ef5668 protein elicited significantly greater protection than pspa/ef5668-rx1, pspa/rx1, or pspa/ef5668. these results indicate an rasv synthesizing a pspa fusion protein representing both pspa families constitutes an effective antipneumococcal vaccine, extending and enhancing protection against multiple strains of s. pneumoniae.

TI == the interaction of the antimicrobial peptide cleap-2 and the bacterial membrane.
AB == chicken liver expressed antimicrobial peptide-2 (cleap-2) is known to have killing activities against salmonella spp., but the mechanism by which killing occurs remains to be elucidated. the ability of cleap-2 to disrupt the outer membrane of several salmonella spp. was assessed using the fluorescent probe n-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (npn). a rapid dose-dependent permeabilization of the outer membranes of salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium phop, and s. enterica serovar typhimurium sl1344 was observed although no significant permeabilisation of the s. enteriditis membrane was detected. these data suggested that the ability of the mature cleap-2 peptide to permeabilise the salmonella outer membrane is important in mediating its killing activities. the ability of the peptide to kill gram-positive bacteria, specifically streptococcus spp. and staphylococcus spp. was also investigated using recombinant peptide and a time-kill assay. of the strains analysed the streptococcus pyogenes m1 strain appeared the most resistant to leap-2 killing although s. pyogenes mutants deficient in sortase and m1 activities showed increased sensitivity to the mature peptide. this suggested the involvement of specific streptococcus cell wall proteins including m1 in the resistance of the bacteria to cleap-2 killing. cleap-2 showed no significant toxicity towards mammalian erythrocytes indicating selectivity for bacterial over eukaryote cell membranes. these data provide further support for mature cleap-2 functioning in protecting the chicken against microbial attack.

TI == correlations between carbon metabolism and virulence in bacteria.
AB == bacteria have developed several mechanisms which allow the preferred utilization  of the most efficiently metabolizable carbohydrates when these organisms are exposed to a mixture of carbon sources. interestingly, the same or similar mechanisms are used by some pathogens to control various steps of their infection process. the efficient metabolism of a carbon source might serve as signal for proper fitness. alternatively, the presence of a specific carbon source might indicate to bacterial cells that they thrive in infection-related organs, tissues or cells and that specific virulence genes should be turned on or switched off. frequently, virulence gene regulators are affected by changes in carbon source availability. for example, expression of the gene encoding the streptococcus pyogenes virulence regulator mga is controlled by the classical carbon catabolite repression (ccr) mechanism operative in firmicutes. the activity of prfa, the major virulence regulator in listeria monocytogenes, seems to be controlled by the phosphorylation state of phosphotransferase system(pts) components. in vibrio cholerae synthesis of hapr, which regulates the expression of genes required for motility, is controlled via the crp/camp ccr mechanism, whereas synthesis of salmonella enterica hile, which represses genes in a pathogenicity island, is regulated by the carbohydrate-responsive, pts-controlled mlc.

AB == the antigenically related coaggregation receptor polysaccharides (rps) of streptococcus oralis strains c104 and sk144 mediate recognition of these bacteria by other members of the dental plaque biofilm community. in the present study, the structure of strain sk144 rps was established by high resolution nmr spectroscopy as [6galfbeta1-6galnacbeta1-3galalpha1-2ribitol-5-po(4)(-)-6galfbeta1-3galbeta1](n), thereby indicating that this polysaccharide and the previously characterized rps of strain c104 are identical, except for the linkage between gal and ribitol-5-phosphate, which is alpha1-2 in strain sk144 versus alpha1-1 in strain c104. studies to define the molecular basis of rps structure revealed comparable genes for six putative transferases and a polymerase in the rps loci of these streptococci. cell surface rps production was abolished by disrupting the gene for the first transferase of strain c104 with a nonpolar erm cassette. it was restored in the resulting mutant by plasmid-based expression of either wcjg, the corresponding gene of s. pneumoniae for serotype 10a capsular polysaccharide (cps) biosynthesis or wbap for the transferase of salmonella enterica that initiates o-polysaccharide biosynthesis. thus, wcjg, like wbap, appears to initiate polysaccharide biosynthesis by transferring galactose-1-phosphate to a lipid carrier. in further studies, the structure of strain c104 rps was converted to that of strain sk144 by replacing the gene (wefm) for the fourth transferase in the rps locus of strain c104 with the corresponding gene (wcrc) of strain sk144 or streptococcus pneumoniae serotype 10a. these findings identify genetic markers for the different ribitol-5-phosphate-containing types of rps present in s. oralis and establish a close relationship between these polysaccharides and serogroup 10 cpss of s. pneumoniae.

TI == evaluation of new generation salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccines with regulated delayed attenuation to induce immune responses against pspa.
AB == increasing the immunogenicity to delivered antigens by recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccines (rasv) has been the subject of intensive study. with this goal in mind, we have designed and constructed a new generation of rasv that exhibit regulated delayed attenuation. these vaccine strains are phenotypically wild type at the time of immunization and become attenuated after colonization of host tissues. the vaccine strains are grown under conditions that allow expression of genes required for optimal invasion and colonization of host tissues. once established in the host, these virulence genes are turned off, fully attenuating the vaccine strain. in this study, we compared 2 of our newly developed regulated delayed attenuation salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strains chi9088 and chi9558 with the deltacya deltacrp deltaasd strain chi8133, for their abilities to express and present a secreted form of the alpha-helical region of pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) to the mouse immune system. all 3 strains induced high levels of serum antibodies specific for pspa as well as to salmonella antigens in orally immunized mice. however, both rasvs expressing delayed attenuation elicited significantly greater anti-pspa immune responses, including serum igg and t cell secretion of il-4 and ifn-gamma, than other groups. also, vaccination with delayed attenuation strains resulted in a greater degree of protection against streptococcus pneumoniae challenge than in mice vaccinated with chi8133 (71-86% vs. 21% survival, p </= 0.006). together, the results demonstrate that the regulated attenuation strategy results in highly immunogenic antigen delivery vectors for oral vaccination.

TI == a sopb deletion mutation enhances the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a heterologous antigen delivered by live attenuated salmonella enterica vaccines.
AB == sopb is a virulence factor of salmonella encoded by spi-5. salmonella sopb deletion mutants are impaired in their ability to cause local inflammatory responses and fluid secretion into the intestinal lumen and also can enhance the immunogenicity of a vectored antigen. in this study, we evaluated the effects on immunogenicity and the efficacy of a sopb deletion mutation on two salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strains with different attenuating mutations expressing a highly antigenic alpha-helical region of the streptococcus pneumoniae surface protein pspa from an asd(+)-balanced lethal plasmid. after oral administration to mice, the two pairs of strains induced high levels of serum antibodies specific for pspa as well as to salmonella antigens. the levels of antigen-specific serum immunoglobulin g (igg) and mucosal iga were higher in mice immunized with sopb mutants. enzyme-linked immunospot assay results indicated that the spleen cells from mice immunized with a sopb mutant showed higher interleukin-4 and gamma interferon secretion levels than did the mice immunized with the isogenic sopb(+) strain. the sopb mutants also induced higher numbers of cd4(+) cd44(hi) cd62l(hi) and cd8(+) cd44(hi) cd62l(hi) central memory t cells. eight weeks after primary oral immunization, mice were challenged with 100 50% lethal doses of virulent s. pneumoniae wu2. immunization with either of the sopb mutant strains led to increased levels of protection compared to that with the isogenic sopb(+) parent. together, these results demonstrate that the deletion of sopb leads to an overall enhancement of the immunogenicity and efficacy of recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccine strains.

TI == regulated programmed lysis of recombinant salmonella in host tissues to release protective antigens and confer biological containment.
AB == we have devised and constructed a biological containment system designed to cause programmed bacterial cell lysis with no survivors. we have validated this system, using salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccines for antigen delivery after colonization of host lymphoid tissues. the system is composed of two parts. the first component is salmonella typhimurium strain chi8937, with deletions of asda and arabinose-regulated expression of mura, two genes required for peptidoglycan synthesis and additional mutations to enhance complete lysis and antigen delivery. the second component is plasmid pya3681, which encodes arabinose-regulated mura and asda expression and c2-regulated synthesis of antisense asda and mura mrna transcribed from the p22 p(r) promoter. an arabinose-regulated c2 gene is present in the chromosome. chi8937(pya3681) exhibits arabinose-dependent growth. upon invasion of host tissues, an arabinose-free environment, transcription of asda, mura, and c2 ceases, and concentrations of their gene products decrease because of cell division. the drop in c2 concentration results in activation of p(r), driving synthesis of antisense mrna to block translation of any residual asda and mura mrna. a highly antigenic alpha-helical domain of streptococcus pneumoniae rx1 pspa was cloned into pya3681, resulting in pya3685 to test antigen delivery. mice orally immunized with chi8937(pya3685) developed antibody responses to pspa and salmonella outer membrane proteins. no viable vaccine strain cells were detected in host tissues after 21 days. this system has potential applications with other gram-negative bacteria in which biological containment would be desirable.

TI == analysis of type ii secretion of recombinant pneumococcal pspa and pspc in a salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine with regulated delayed antigen synthesis.
AB == recombinant attenuated salmonella vaccines (rasvs) have been used extensively to  express and deliver heterologous antigens to host mucosal tissues. immune responses can be enhanced greatly when the antigen is secreted to the periplasm or extracellular compartment. the most common method for accomplishing this is by fusion of the antigen to a secretion signal sequence. finding an optimal signal sequence is typically done empirically. to facilitate this process, we constructed a series of plasmid expression vectors, each containing a different type ii signal sequence. we evaluated the utilities of these vectors by fusing two different antigens, the alpha-helix domains of pneumococcal surface protein a (pspa) and pneumococcal surface protein c (pspc), to the signal sequences of beta-lactamase (bla ss), ompa, and phoa and the signal sequence and c-terminal peptide of beta-lactamase (bla ss+ct) on asd(+) plasmids under the control of the p(trc) promoter. strains were characterized for level of expression, subcellular antigen location, and the capacity to elicit antigen-specific immune responses and protection against challenge with streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. the immune responses to each protein differed depending on the signal sequence used. strains carrying the bla ss-pspa and bla ss+ct-pspc fusions yielded the largest amounts of secreted pspa and pspc, respectively, and induced the highest serum igg titers, although all fusion proteins tested induced some level of antigen-specific igg response. consistent with the serum antibody responses, rasvs expressing the bla ss-pspa and bla ss+ct-pspc fusions induced the greatest protection against s. pneumoniae challenge.

TI == secreted enteric antimicrobial activity localises to the mucus surface layer.
AB == objectives: the intestinal mucosa is constantly exposed to a dense and highly dynamic microbial flora and challenged by a variety of enteropathogenic bacteria. antibacterial protection is provided in part by paneth cell-derived antibacterial peptides such as the alpha-defensins. the mechanism of peptide-mediated antibacterial control and its functional importance for gut homeostasis has recently been appreciated in patients with crohn's ileitis. in the present study, the spatial distribution of antimicrobial peptides was analysed within the small intestinal anatomical compartments such as the intestinal crypts, the overlaying mucus and the luminal content. methods: preparations from the different intestinal locations as well as whole mouse small intestine were extracted and separated by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. antibacterial activity was determined in extracts, and the presence of antimicrobial peptides/proteins was confirmed by n-terminal sequencing, mass spectrometry analysis and immunodetection. results: the secreted antibacterial activity was largely confined to the layer of mucus, whereas only minute amounts of activity were noted in the luminal content. the extractable activity originating from either crypt/mucus/lumen compartments respectively (given as a percentage) was for listeria monocytogenes, 48 (4)/44 (4)/8 (8); enterococcus faecalis, 44 (10)/49 (3)/7 (7); bacterium megaterium, 56 (4)/42 (3)/2 (1); streptococcus pyogenes, 48 (4)/46 (3)/6 (6); escherichia coli, 46 (4)/47 (3)/7 (7); and salmonella enterica sv. typhimurium, 38 (3)/43 (7)/19 (10). a spectrum of antimicrobial peptides was identified in isolated mucus, which exhibited strong and contact-dependent antibacterial activity against both commensal and pathogenic bacteria. conclusion: these findings show that secreted antimicrobial peptides are retained by the surface-overlaying mucus and thereby provide a combined physical and antibacterial barrier to prevent bacterial attachment and invasion. this distribution facilitates high local peptide concentration on vulnerable mucosal surfaces, while still allowing the presence of an enteric microbiota.

AB == plesiomonas shigelloides is an emerging pathogen that is widespread in the aquatic environment and is responsible for intestinal diseases and extraintestinal infections in humans and other animals. virtually nothing is known about its genetic diversity, population structure, and evolution, which severely limits epidemiological control. we addressed these questions by developing a multilocus sequence typing (mlst) system based on five genes (fusa, leus, pyrg, recg, and rpob) and analyzing 77 epidemiologically unrelated strains from several countries and several ecological sources. the phylogenetic position of p. shigelloides within family enterobacteriaceae was precisely defined by phylogenetic analysis of the same gene portions in other family members. within p. shigelloides, high levels of nucleotide diversity (average percentage of nucleotide differences between strains, 1.49%) and genotypic diversity (64 distinct sequence types; simpson's index, 99.7%) were found, with no salient internal phylogenetic structure. we estimated that homologous recombination in housekeeping genes affects p. shigelloides alleles and nucleotides 7 and 77 times more frequently than mutation, respectively. these ratios are similar to those observed in the naturally transformable species streptococcus pneumoniae with a high rate of recombination. in contrast, recombination within salmonella enterica, escherichia coli, and yersinia enterocolitica was much less frequent. p. shigelloides thus stands out among members of the enterobacteriaceae. its high rate of recombination results in a lack of association between genomic background and o and h antigenic factors, as observed for the 51 serotypes found in our sample. given its robustness and discriminatory power, we recommend mlst as a reference method for population biology studies and epidemiological tracking of p. shigelloides strains.

AB == tank-binding kinase-1 (tbk1) is an integral component of type i interferon induction by microbial infection. the importance of tbk1 and type i interferon in antiviral immunity is well established, but the function of tbk1 in bacterial infection is unclear. upon infection of murine embryonic fibroblasts with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium (salmonella), more extensive bacterial proliferation was observed in tbk1(-/-) than tbk1(+/+) cells. tbk1 kinase activity was required for restriction of bacterial infection, but interferon regulatory factor-3 or type i interferon did not contribute to this tbk1-dependent function. in tbk1(-/-)cells, salmonella, enteropathogenic escherichia coli, and streptococcus pyogenes escaped from vacuoles into the cytosol where increased replication occurred, which suggests that tbk1 regulates the integrity of pathogen-containing vacuoles. knockdown of tbk1 in macrophages and epithelial cells also resulted in increased bacterial localization in the cytosol, indicating that the role of tbk1 in maintaining vacuolar integrity is relevant in different cell types. taken together, these data demonstrate a requirement for tbk1 in control of bacterial infection distinct from its established role in antiviral immunity.

AB == hepcidin is an antimicrobial peptide secreted by the liver during inflammation that plays a central role in mammalian iron homeostasis. here we demonstrate the endogenous expression of hepcidin by macrophages and neutrophils in vitro and in vivo. these myeloid cell types produced hepcidin in response to bacterial pathogens in a toll-like receptor 4 (tlr4)-dependent fashion. conversely, bacterial stimulation of macrophages triggered a tlr4-dependent reduction in the iron exporter ferroportin. in vivo, intraperitoneal challenge with pseudomonas aeruginosa induced tlr4-dependent hepcidin expression and iron deposition in splenic macrophages, findings mirrored in subcutaneous infection with group a streptococcus where hepcidin induction was further observed in neutrophils migrating to the tissue site of infection. hepcidin expression in cultured hepatocytes or in the livers of mice infected with bacteria was independent of tlr4, suggesting the tlr4-hepcidin pathway is restricted to myeloid cell types. our findings identify endogenous myeloid cell hepcidin production as a previously unrecognized component of the host response to bacterial pathogens.

AB == clinicopathological findings from six cats with confirmed cholecystitis or acute  neutrophilic cholangitis are presented. historical findings included lethargy and anorexia or inappetence of up to five days duration. on physical examination all cats were pyrexic and four out of six were jaundiced and had cranial abdominal pain. bile samples were obtained by cholecystocentesis at exploratory coeliotomy (two cases) or by percutaneous, ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis (four cases). gall bladder rupture and bile peritonitis occurred subsequent to ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis in one case. the most common bacterial isolate was escherichia coli (four cases); e coli was isolated alone in two cases, in combination with a streptococcus species (one case) and in combination with a clostridium species (one case). streptococcus species alone was isolated from one case, as was salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the latter is the first reported case of salmonella-associated cholecystitis in a cat. concurrent pancreatic or intestinal disease was detected histologically in three cases. all cases were treated with antimicrobials based on in vitro susceptibility results. treatment was successful in five cases. one cat with concurrent diffuse epitheliotropic intestinal lymphoma was euthanased. percutaneous ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis is an effective, minimally-invasive technique enabling identification of bacterial isolates in cats with inflammatory hepatobiliary disease.

TI == role of the acrab-tolc efflux pump in determining susceptibility of haemophilus influenzae to the novel peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415.
AB == haemophilus influenzae isolates vary widely in their susceptibilities to the peptide deformylase inhibitor lbm415 (mic range, 0.06 to 32 microg/ml); however, on average, they are less susceptible than gram-positive organisms, such as staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pneumoniae. insertional inactivation of the h. influenzae acrb or tolc gene in strain nb65044 (rd strain kw20) increased susceptibility to lbm415, confirming a role for the acrab-tolc pump in determining resistance. consistent with this, sequencing of a pcr fragment generated with primers flanking the acrra region from an lbm415-hypersusceptible h. influenzae clinical isolate revealed a genetic deletion of acra. inactivation of acrb or tolc in several clinical isolates with atypically reduced susceptibility to lbm415 (mic of 16 microg/ml or greater) significantly increased susceptibility, confirming that the pump is also a determinant of decreased susceptibility in these clinical isolates. examination of acrr, encoding the putative repressor of pump gene expression, from several of these strains revealed mutations introducing frameshifts, stop codons, and amino acid changes relative to the published sequence, suggesting that loss of pump repression leads to decreased susceptibility. supporting this, nb65044 acrr mutants selected by exposure to lbm415 at 8 microg/ml had susceptibilities to lbm415 and other pump substrates comparable to the least sensitive clinical isolates and showed increased expression of pump genes.

TI == bacterial defenses against oxidants: mechanistic features of cysteine-based peroxidases and their flavoprotein reductases.
AB == antioxidant defenses include a group of ubiquitous, non-heme peroxidases, designated the peroxiredoxins, which rely on an activated cysteine residue at their active site to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen peroxide, organic hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrite. in the typical 2-cys peroxiredoxins, a second cysteinyl residue, termed the resolving cysteine, is also involved in intersubunit disulfide bond formation during the course of catalysis by these enzymes. many bacteria also express a flavoprotein, ahpf, which acts as a dedicated disulfide reductase to recycle the bacterial peroxiredoxin, ahpc, during catalysis. mechanistic and structural studies of these bacterial proteins have shed light on the linkage between redox state, oligomeric state, and peroxidase activity for the peroxiredoxins, and on the conformational changes accompanying catalysis by both proteins. in addition, these studies have highlighted the dual roles that the oxidized cysteinyl species, cysteine sulfenic acid, can play in eukaryotic peroxiredoxins, acting as a catalytic intermediate in the peroxidase activity, and as a redox sensor in regulating hydrogen peroxide-mediated cell signaling.

TI == phages and the evolution of bacterial pathogens: from genomic rearrangements to lysogenic conversion.
AB == comparative genomics demonstrated that the chromosomes from bacteria and their viruses (bacteriophages) are coevolving. this process is most evident for bacterial pathogens where the majority contain prophages or phage remnants integrated into the bacterial dna. many prophages from bacterial pathogens encode virulence factors. two situations can be distinguished: vibrio cholerae, shiga toxin-producing escherichia coli, corynebacterium diphtheriae, and clostridium botulinum depend on a specific prophage-encoded toxin for causing a specific disease, whereas staphylococcus aureus, streptococcus pyogenes, and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium harbor a multitude of prophages and each phage-encoded virulence or fitness factor makes an incremental contribution to the fitness of the lysogen. these prophages behave like "swarms" of related prophages. prophage diversification seems to be fueled by the frequent transfer of phage material by recombination with superinfecting phages, resident prophages, or occasional acquisition of other mobile dna elements or bacterial chromosomal genes. prophages also contribute to the diversification of the bacterial genome architecture. in many cases, they actually represent a large fraction of the strain-specific dna sequences. in addition, they can serve as anchoring points for genome inversions. the current review presents the available genomics and biological data on prophages from bacterial pathogens in an evolutionary framework.

TI == efficacy of vaccines against bacterial diseases in swine: what can we expect?
AB == this paper discusses what can be expected with regard to efficacy of antibacterial vaccines used in swine, based on the present knowledge of pathogen-host interactions. first, vaccination against bacteria that mainly cause disease by production of exotoxins is considered. vaccines containing the inactivated toxin or a non-toxic but antigenic recombinant protein derived from the exotoxin can be expected to provide protection against disease. the degree of protection induced by such vaccines varies, however, depending amongst other things on the pathogenesis of the disease. vaccination against clostridial infections, actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae infections, progressive atrophic rhinitis and enterotoxigenic escherichia coli, is considered. the second part of the article deals with vaccination against extracellular bacteria. protection against these bacteria is generally mediated by antibodies against their surface antigens and certain secreted antigens, but cellular immunity may also play a role. efficacy of vaccines against swine erysipelas, streptococcus suis infections, mycoplasma hyopneumoniae infections and swine dysentery is discussed. finally, vaccination against facultatively intracellular bacteria is considered. for protection against these bacteria cell-mediated immunity plays an important role, but antibodies may also be involved. it is generally accepted that live-attenuated vaccines are more suitable for induction of cell-mediated immunity than inactivated vaccines, although this also depends on the adjuvant used in the vaccine. as an example, vaccination against salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium is discussed.

TI == bacterial responses to neutrophil phagocytosis.
AB == purpose of review: this review focuses on adaptive bacterial interactions with neutrophils, emphasizing information communicated within the past year about bacterial factors that respond to contact with or phagocytosis by pmn. recent findings: since the discovery of type iii and iv secretion, progress in the analysis of bacterial interactions with host phagocytes has been extensive but largely focused on the macrophage. the remarkable growth of information about bacterial subversion of macrophage metabolism has been summarized in several excellent reviews. the scope of progress on neutrophil-bacteria interactions is more limited and dominated by recent studies of the granulocyte pathogen, anaplasma phagocytophilum, the agent of granulocytic ehrlichiosis. summary: for many pathogens, contact with or ingestion by phagocytes elicits a vigorous but varied microbial response. the response repertoire includes activation of type iii and type iv secretion systems that inject effector molecules into the host cell. effectors modify host cell signaling and metabolic pathways to favor survival of the microbe. whereas microbial secretory structures are few in kind and relatively conserved, effector molecules are numerous and variable. effectors may promote phagocytosis by nonphagocytic cells or suppress phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. they may suppress assembly or misdirect localization of the phagocyte nadph oxidase that is responsible for generating toxic oxidants, and they may suppress phagosome-lysosome fusion. phagocytosed bacteria may also up-regulate the expression of defensive proteins that attenuate the effects of phagocyte-derived antimicrobial toxins. these pathogenic stratagems probably have their origins in the competition among single-celled organisms, eukaryotes versus prokaryotes, that arose early in evolution.

TI == bacterial polysaccharides as vaccines--immunity and chemical characterization.
AB == studies on protective immunity and biochemical characterization of bacterial capsular polysaccharides have led to significant contributions to understanding of the mechanisms of infectious diseases and development of effective vaccines. immunity to encapsulated bacteria is related to antibody response to polysaccharide (ps) antigen, interactions with t- and b-lymphocytes, and host defense mechanisms. meningococcal, pneumococcal and salmonella vi pss and haemophilus type b ps-protein conjugate vaccines have been licensed and provided effective immunity for prevention of these bacterial infections. capsular pss are cell-surface polymers consisting of oligosaccharide repeating units. many pss are highly polar and hydrophilic and interfere with cell-to-cell interactions with phagocytes. most pneumococcal pss are negatively charged and possess acidic components such as d-glucuronic acid and phosphate in phosphodiester bonds. extensive immunologic cross-reactivity has been observed among bacterial capsular pss. in infants the antibody responses to most capsular pss are generally poor. enhanced immunogenicity of ps antigens can be achieved through ps-protein conjugate vaccines, immunization during a critical period of perinatal development and effective antigen delivery system.

TI == m1 protein triggers a phosphoinositide cascade for group a streptococcus invasion of epithelial cells.
AB == invasion of nonphagocytic cells by bacteria provides a favorable niche for persistence and evasion of host defenses and antibiotics. m protein is a major virulence factor because it promotes high-frequency invasion of epithelial cells by group a streptococcus (gas) and also renders the bacterium resistant to phagocytosis. in this study, we investigated the role of m1 protein from serotype m1 strain 90-226 in regulating mammalian signal transduction and cytoskeletal rearrangement for bacterial entry. ly294002 and wortmannin, which are inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (pi 3-k) blocked invasion of epithelial cells by gas by 75 and 80%, respectively, but failed to inhibit invasion by salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. also, epithelial cells transiently transfected with dominant negative p85 and p110 genes, the regulatory and catalytic subunits of pi 3-k, respectively, were less able to be invaded by gas. to separate the influence of other streptococcal virulence factors from m protein, lactococcus lactis was engineered to express m1 protein on its surface. l. lactis(plm1) invaded epithelial cells efficiently in vitro, and pi 3-k inhibitors blocked 90% of this invasion. purified soluble m1 protein stimulated the formation of stress fibers and actin tuffs on epithelial cells. ly294002 and wortmannin inhibited these cellular changes. a phosphoinositide analogue also inhibited the invasion of epithelial cells by gas. therefore, m1 protein, either directly or via bound fibronectin, initiates signals that depend on the lipid kinase pi 3-k pathway, which paves the way for cytoskeletal rearrangement that internalize the bacterium.

TI == the role of mutators in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
AB == bacteria contain a number of error prevention and error correction systems that maintain genome stability. however, strains exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies have recently been reported amongst natural populations of pathogenic escherichia coli, salmonella enterica, pseudomonas aeruginosa, neisseria meningitidis, helicobacter pylori and streptococcus pneumoniae. the majority of naturally occurring, strong mutators contain defects in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (mmr) system, with mutations in muts predominating. mmr-deficient strains possess superior genetic backgrounds for the selection of some antibiotic-resistance mutations since mutation frequencies up to 1000-fold higher than normal strains have been reported, and resistance levels achieved in mutators can be greater than those arising in non-mutator hosts. mmr is a major constraint to interspecies recombination events. removal of this barrier, as in the case of mmr defective mutators, also enhances the frequency of horizontal gene transfer, which is an important mechanism of acquired drug resistance in bacteria. permanent global mutator status is associated with loss of fitness as mutators accumulate deleterious mutations more frequently than non-mutators. fitness limitations of mutators may be overcome simply by the high bacterial cell densities that can be achieved during acute infection or by the adoption of transient mutator status. mutators are a risk factor during the treatment of bacterial infections as they appear to enhance the selection of mutants expressing high- and low-level antibiotic resistance and have the capacity to refine existing plasmid-located resistance determinants.

AB == there are common themes among bacteriophage-encoded virulence factors, which include the well-characterized bacterial toxins and proteins that alter antigenicity as well as several new classes of bacteriophage-encoded proteins such as superantigens, effectors translocated by a type iii secretion system, and proteins required for intracellular survival and host cell attachment. these virulence factors are encoded by a diversity of bacteriophages, members of the viral families siphoviridae, podoviridae, myoviridae and inoviridae, with some bacteriophages having characteristics of more than one virus family. the location of virulence genes within the bacteriophage genomes is non-random and consistent with an origin via imprecise prophage excision or as either transferable cassettes or integral components of the bacteriophage genome.

TI == prevalence of antimicrobial resistance among pigeon isolates of streptococcus gallolyticus, escherichia coli and salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium.
AB == thirty-three streptococcus gallolyticus, 60 escherichia coli and 18 salmonella enterica serotype typhimurium var. copenhagen strains isolated from homing pigeons (columba livia) were tested for susceptibility to the antimicrobials most commonly used to treat pigeons. minimal inhibitory concentrations were determined using the agar dilution technique. aminoglycosides (gentamicin and kanamycin), trimethoprim and flumequine were relatively inactive against the streptococci tested. acquired tetracycline resistance amounted to 85%, and lincomycin and macrolide (erythromycin) resistance to 48 and 45%, respectively. fluoroquinolone (enrofloxacin) resistance was found in four s. gallolyticus strains. all strains were susceptible to ampicillin. with the e. coli strains, resistance was found to all antibiotics tested. over one-half of them were resistant to tetracycline and to broad-spectrum penicillins (ampicillin); however, none showed extended spectrum beta-lactamase activity, implying that the cephalosporins (ceftiofur) remained active. resistance to trimethoprim, aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolone ranked next. in contrast to the s. gallolyticus and e. coli strains, the s. enterica strains were susceptible to all the antimicrobials tested.

TI == hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing of caenorhabditis elegans by streptococcus pyogenes.
AB == caenorhabditis elegans is currently introduced as a new, facile, and cheap model  organism to study the pathogenesis of gram-negative bacteria such as pseudomonas aeruginosa and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium. the mechanisms of killing involve either diffusible exotoxins or infection-like processes. recently, it was shown that also some gram-positive bacteria kill c. elegans, although the precise mechanisms of killing remained open. we examined c. elegans as a pathogenesis model for the gram-positive bacterium streptococcus pyogenes, a major human pathogen capable of causing a wide spectrum of diseases. we demonstrate that s. pyogenes kills c. elegans, both on solid and in liquid medium. unlike p. aeruginosa and s. enterica serovar typhimurium, the killing by s. pyogenes is solely mediated by hydrogen peroxide. killing required live streptococci; the killing capacity depends on the amount of hydrogen peroxide produced, and killing can be inhibited by catalase. major exotoxins of s. pyogenes are not involved in the killing process as confirmed by using specific toxin inhibitors and knockout mutants. moreover, no accumulation of s. pyogenes in c. elegans is observed, which excludes the involvement of infection-like processes. preliminary results show that s. pneumoniae can also kill c. elegans by hydrogen peroxide production. hydrogen peroxide-mediated killing might represent a common mechanism by which gram-positive, catalase-negative pathogens kill c. elegans.

TI == biodegradable microparticles for the mucosal delivery of antibacterial and dietary antigens.
AB == mucosal administration of antigen is known to be appropriate for vaccine purposes as well as tolerance induction. biodegradable poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) (plga) microparticles were used to deliver both antibacterial phosphorylcholine (pc) and dietary antigen beta lactoglobulin (blg) by mucosal route. in a first study, the protective immunity elicited by intragastric vaccination with pc encapsulated in microparticles was evaluated in a mouse model against intestinal infection by salmonella typhimurium and pulmonary infection by streptococcus pneumoniae. a significant rise in anti-pc immunoglobulin a (iga) titers, as measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, was observed in the intestinal secretions after oral immunization with pc-loaded microparticles compared with the titers of mice immunized with free pc-thyr or blank microparticles. this antibody response correlated with a highly significant resistance to oral challenge by s. typhimurium. iga in pulmonary secretion were not able to protect against s. pneumoniae infection. balb/c mice were, therefore, immunized intranasally (i.n.). immunization was followed by a rise in anti-pc iga and igg titers in serum and in pulmonary secretions by both free and encapsulated pc-thyr. the survival rates were 91 and 76% in the two groups of mice, respectively. in a second study and in order to prevent allergy against milk by inducing oral tolerance, one of the major allergenic milk protein, blg was entrapped into microparticles. oral administration of microparticles containing blg reduced significantly (by 10000) the amount of protein necessary to decrease both specific anti blg ige and dth response. these studies demonstrate the ability of microparticles to induce both mucosal immunity and oral tolerance.

TI == immune responses to recombinant pneumococcal pspa antigen delivered by live attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine.
AB == attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing recombinant antigens from other pathogens elicits primarily a th1-type dominant immune response to both recombinant and salmonella antigens. the immunogenicity and appropriate subcellular location of the recombinant antigen in the salmonella vaccine strain may contribute to augmenting immune responses by facilitating adequate exposure of recombinant antigen to antigen-presenting cells for processing. to allow for secretion from gram-negative bacteria and overexpression of antigen, a dna fragment encoding a highly antigenic alpha-helical region of pspa (pneumococcal surface protein a) was subcloned downstream from the beta-lactamase signal sequence in the multicopy asd(+) pya3493 vector to create pya3494. pya3493 was derived from a class of asd(+) vectors with reduced expression of asd to minimize selective disadvantage and enhance immunization of expressed recombinant antigens. the s. enterica serovar typhimurium vaccine strain was constructed by the introduction of deletion mutations delta crp-28 and delta asda16. approximately 50% of the recombinant pspa (rpspa) expressed in a salmonella strain harboring pya3494 was detected in the combined supernatant and periplasmic fractions of broth-grown recombinant salmonella. after a single oral immunization in balb/c mice with 10(9) cfu of the recombinant salmonella vaccine strain carrying pya3494, immunoglobulin g (igg) antibody responses were stimulated to both the heterologous antigen rpspa and salmonella lipopolysaccharide (lps) and outer membrane proteins (omps). about half, and even more at later times after immunization, of the antibodies induced to rpspa were igg1 (indicating a th2-type response), whereas 60 to 70% of the antibodies to lps and 80 to 90% of those to omps were igg2a (indicating a th1-type response). a sublethal infection with streptococcus pneumoniae wu2 boosted pspa antibody levels and maintained igg2a/igg1 ratios similar to those seen before the challenge. oral immunization with salmonella-pspa vaccine protected 60% of immunized mice from death after intraperitoneal challenge with 50 times the 50% lethal dose of virulent s. pneumoniae wu2.

AB == dtdp-d-glucose 4,6-dehydratase (rmlb) was first identified in the l-rhamnose biosynthetic pathway, where it catalyzes the conversion of dtdp-d-glucose into dtdp-4-keto-6-deoxy-d-glucose. the structures of rmlb from salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium in complex with substrate deoxythymidine 5'-diphospho-d-glucose (dtdp-d-glucose) and deoxythymidine 5'-diphosphate (dtdp), and rmlb from streptococcus suis serotype 2 in complex with dtdp-d-glucose, dtdp, and deoxythymidine 5'-diphospho-d-pyrano-xylose (dtdp-xylose) have all been solved at resolutions between 1.8 a and 2.4 a. the structures show that the active sites are highly conserved. importantly, the structures show that the active site tyrosine functions directly as the active site base, and an aspartic and glutamic acid pairing accomplishes the dehydration step of the enzyme mechanism. we conclude that the substrate is required to move within the active site to complete the catalytic cycle and that this movement is driven by the elimination of water. the results provide insight into members of the sdr superfamily.

TI == maintenance of an unfolded polypeptide by a cognate chaperone in bacterial type iii secretion.
AB == many bacterial pathogens use a type iii protein secretion system to deliver virulence effector proteins directly into the host cell cytosol, where they modulate cellular processes. a requirement for the effective translocation of several such effector proteins is the binding of specific cytosolic chaperones, which typically interact with discrete domains in the virulence factors. we report here the crystal structure at 1.9 a resolution of the chaperone-binding domain of the salmonella effector protein sptp with its cognate chaperone sicp. the structure reveals that this domain is maintained in an extended, unfolded conformation that is wound around three successive chaperone molecules. short segments from two different sptp molecules are juxtaposed by the chaperones, where they dimerize across a hydrophobic interface. these results imply that the chaperones associated with the type iii secretion system maintain their substrates in a secretion-competent state that is capable of engaging the secretion machinery to travel through the type iii apparatus in an unfolded or partially folded manner.

TI == effect of attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium expressing a streptococcus mutans antigen on secondary responses to the cloned protein.
AB == attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to gut- and nose-associated lymphoid tissues. contradictory reports have described the effect of preexisting immunity to the antigen delivery vehicle. we decided to examine this discrepancy by studying the effect of immunizing mice by the intranasal (i.n.) route with salmonella expressing an insoluble protein and to study the ability to augment recall responses by boosting with either salmonella-expressed protein or purified soluble protein alone. the glucan-binding domain (glu) of the enzyme glucosyltransferase (gtf), which is an important virulence factor of streptococcus mutans, was recombinantly expressed in the insoluble phase in s. enterica serovar typhimurium, and the immunogenicity of this construct was studied in mice. we examined the induction of primary immune responses by insoluble glu polypeptide delivered in salmonella at week 1 (groups 1 and 2) and recall responses after a week 15 boost with either salmonella expressing glu (group 1) or purified glu polypeptide (groups 2 and 3). group 4 served as the control and received phosphate-buffered saline alone by the i.n. route. significant anti-glu serum immunoglobulin g (igg) levels were seen in groups 1, 2, and 3 at week 18 (p < 0.001), i.e., 3 weeks after the booster immunization. mice in group 2, who received salmonella followed by glu, had the highest glu-specific igg levels among all groups. the serum igg levels persisted in all responding groups for at least 7 weeks after the boost (week 22). the igg2a/igg1 subclass ratio of serum anti-glu antibodies in group 1 significantly increased after the boost. these results support the induction of a type 1-like immune response to glu after primary and booster immunizations with salmonella expressing glu. on the other hand, group 2 mice, which received salmonella expressing glu as the primary dose and soluble protein as the booster dose, exhibited a shift from a type 1-like to a more type 2-like immune response to glu following the boost. these results indicate that s. enterica serovar typhimurium is an excellent delivery vehicle for the insoluble and recombinantly expressed glu of gtf and that this construct was especially effective in priming the host for a secondary response to soluble glu polypeptide.

TI == conserved degp protease in gram-positive bacteria is essential for thermal and oxidative tolerance and full virulence in streptococcus pyogenes.
AB == the degp protease, a multifunctional chaperone and protease, has been shown to be essential for virulence in gram-negative pathogens such as salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, brucella abortus, yersinia enterocolitica, and pseudomonas aeruginosa. the function of degp in pathogenesis appears to be the degradation of damaged proteins that accumulate as a result of the initial host response to infection, which includes the release of reactive oxygen intermediates. additionally, the degp protease plays a major role in monitoring and maintaining the escherichia coli periplasm and influences e. coli pilus biogenesis. we report here the identification of highly homologous enzymes in streptococcus pyogenes, streptococcus gordonii, streptococcus mutans, staphylococcus aureus, and enterococcus faecalis. moreover, the phenotype of an insertionally inactivated degp allele in s. pyogenes is similar to that reported for e. coli, with temperature sensitivity for growth and enhanced sensitivity to reactive oxygen intermediates. virulence studies in a mouse model of streptococcal infection indicate that a functional degp protease is required for full virulence. these results suggest degp as an attractive broad-spectrum target for future anti-infective drug development.

TI == borrelia burgdorferi and other bacterial products induce expression and release of the urokinase receptor (cd87).
AB == the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (upar, cd87) is a highly glycosylated 55- to 60-kda protein anchored to the cell membrane through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol moiety that promotes the acquisition of plasmin on the surface of cells and subsequent cell movement and migration by binding urokinase-type plasminogen activator. upar also occurs in a soluble form in body fluids and tumor extracts, and both membrane and soluble upar are overexpressed in patients with tumors. upar may be a factor in inflammatory disorders as well. we investigated whether borrelia burgdorferi could stimulate up-regulation of cell membrane upar in vitro. b. burgdorferi, purified native outer surface protein a, and a synthetic outer surface protein a hexalipopeptide stimulated human monocytes to up-regulate membrane upar as measured by immunofluorescence/facs and western blot. the presence of soluble upar in culture supernatants, measured by ag capture elisa, was also observed. lps from salmonella typhimurium and lipotechoic acid from streptococcus pyogenes also induced the up-regulation of both membrane and soluble upar protein by monocytes. up-regulation of upar was induced by conditioned medium from b. burgdorferi/monocyte cocultures. the up-regulation of upar by b. burgdorferi was concomitant with an increase in upar mrna, indicating that synthesis was de novo. the expression and release of upar in response to b. burgdorferi and other bacterial components suggests a role in the pathogenesis of lyme disease as well as in other bacterial infections.

TI == human c-reactive protein is protective against fatal salmonella enterica serovar  typhimurium infection in transgenic mice.
AB == c-reactive protein (crp) is an acute-phase protein with a well-known association  with infection and other inflammatory conditions. we have shown that expression of human crp by crp transgenic (crptg) mice is protective against lethal infection by streptococcus pneumoniae, an effect likely mediated by crp's ability to bind to this gram-positive pathogen. in the present study we tested whether crptg mice are resistant to infection with salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium, a gram-negative pathogen that causes the murine equivalent of typhoid fever. crptg mice experimentally infected with a virulent typhimurium strain lived longer and had significantly lower mortality than their non-tg littermates. the greater resistance of crptg mice could be attributed to significantly increased early (0 to 4 h) blood clearance of salmonellae and significantly decreased numbers of bacteria in the liver and spleen on day 7 postinfection. in addition, 14 days after infection with an avirulent salmonella strain, the serum titer of anti-salmonella immunoglobulin g antibodies was higher in crptg than non-tg mice. this study provides unequivocal evidence that crp plays an important role in vivo in host defense against salmonellae during the early stages of infection. in addition, as the beneficial effect of crp includes enhancement of the host's humoral immune response, crp may also contribute indirectly to host defense during later stages of infection.

AB == attenuated salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium has been used for targeted delivery of recombinant antigens to the gut-associated lymphoid tissues. one potential problem associated with this vaccine approach is the likelihood of in vivo instability of the plasmid constructs caused by constitutive hyperexpression of the heterologous immunogen. the aim of this study was to generate and characterize an expression system encoding the saliva-binding region (sbr) of streptococcus mutans antigen i/ii adhesin, either alone or linked with the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin a2/b subunits (cta2/b), under the control of the inducible nirb promoter. this promoter is activated in an anaerobic environment and within macrophages, which are the primary antigen-presenting cells involved in phagocytosis and processing of salmonella. the gene encoding the chimeric sbr-cta2/b was amplified by pcr using primers containing appropriate restriction sites for subcloning into ptetnirb, which contains the nirb promoter. the resulting plasmid was introduced into serovar typhimurium by electroporation. production of the sbr-cta2/b chimeric protein under anaerobic conditions was verified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay of whole-cell lysates on plates coated with g(m1) ganglioside and developed with antibodies to sbr. similar procedures were followed for cloning the gene encoding sbr in serovar typhimurium under nirb control. anaerobic expression of sbr was confirmed by western blotting of whole-cell lysates probed with anti-sbr antibodies. the resulting serovar typhimurium strains were administered by either the oral or the intranasal route to mice, and colonization was assessed by microbiologic analysis of dissociated spleens, peyer's patches (pp), and nasal tissues. high numbers of the recombinant strains persisted in pp and spleen for at least 21 days following oral challenge. a single intranasal administration of the salmonella clones to mice also resulted in the colonization of the nasal tissues by the recombinant bacteria. salmonellae were recovered from nasal lymphoid tissues, superficial lymph nodes, internal jugular lymph nodes, pp, and spleens of mice for at least 21 days after challenge. this study provides quantitative evidence for colonization by salmonella strains expressing a recombinant protein under the control of the inducible nirb promoter in pp or nasal tissues following a single oral or nasal administration of the bacteria, respectively.

AB == a 20-residue hybrid peptide (ca(1-8)-ma(1-12): kwklfkkigigkflhsakkf-nh(2)) incorporating 1-8 residues of cecropin a (ca) and 1-12 residues of magainin 2 (ma) has potent antibiotic activity without hemolytic activity. in order to investigate the effects of the flexible hinge sequence, gly-ile-gly of ca(1-8)-ma(1-12) (ca-ma) on antibiotic activity, ca-ma and its three analogues, ca-ma1, ca-ma2 and ca-ma3 were synthesized. the gly-ile-gly sequence of ca-ma was deleted in ca-ma1 and replaced with pro and gly-pro-gly in ca-ma2 and ca-ma3, respectively. ca-ma1 and ca-ma3 caused a significant decrease in the bactericidal rate against escherichia coli and bacillus subtilis and the tumoricidal activity against four different tumor cells, and the pc/ps (4:1, w/w) vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities. however, ca-ma2 showed a similar bactericidal rate and antitumor, vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities, as compared with ca-ma. these results suggested that the flexibility or beta-turn induced by gly-ile-gly or pro in the central part of ca-ma may be important in the electrostatic interaction of the cationic short alpha-helical region in the n-terminus with the cell membrane surface and the hydrophobic interaction of amphipathic alpha-helical region in the c-terminus with the hydrophobic acyl chains in the cell membrane. ca-ma3 exhibited lower activity in antibacterial, antitumor, and vesicle-aggregating and disrupting activities than ca-ma and ca-ma2. this result suggested that the excessive beta-turn structure by gly-pro-gly in ca-ma3 seems to interrupt the ion channel/pore formation on the lipid bilayer. it was concluded that the appropriate flexibility or beta-turn structure provided by the central hinge is responsible for the effective antibiotic activity of the antimicrobial peptides with the helix-hinge-helix structure.

TI == novel functions of human alpha(1)-protease inhibitor after s-nitrosylation: inhibition of cysteine protease and antibacterial activity.
AB == alpha(1)-protease inhibitor (alpha(1)pi), the most abundant serine protease inhibitor found in human plasma (at 30-60 microm), is a glycoprotein (53 kda) having a single cysteine residue at position 232 (cys(232)). we have found that cys(232) of human alpha(1)pi was readily s-nitrosylated by nitric oxide (no) without affecting inhibitory activity to trypsin or elastase. s-nitrosylated alpha(1)pi (s-no-alpha(1)pi) not only retained inhibitory activity against these serine proteases, but also gained thiol protease inhibitory activity against a streptococcus pyogenes protease; the parental alpha(1)pi did not have this activity. furthermore, s-no-alpha(1)pi exhibited bacteriostatic activity against salmonella typhimurium at concentrations of 0.1-10 microm, which were 20- to 3000-fold stronger than those of the other no-generating compounds or s-nitroso compounds such as s-nitrosoalbumin and s-nitrosoglutathione. no appears to be transferred into the bacterial cells from s-no-alpha(1)pi via transnitrosylation, as evidenced by electron spin resonance spectroscopy with an no spin trap. thus, we conclude that s-no-alpha(1)pi may be generated from the reaction between alpha(1)pi and no under inflammatory conditions, in which production of both is known to increase. as a result, new functions, i.e., antibacterial and thiol protease inhibitory activities of alpha(1)pi, were generated.

TI == streptococcus mutans h2o2-forming nadh oxidase is an alkyl hydroperoxide reductase protein.
AB == nox-1 from streptococcus mutans, the bacteria which cause dental caries, was previously identified as an h2o2-forming reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (nadh) oxidase. nox-1 is homologous with the flavoprotein component, ahpf, of salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase. a partial open reading frame upstream of nox1, homologous with the other (peroxidase) component, ahpc, from the s. typhimurium system, was also identified. we report here the complete sequence of s. mutans ahpc. analyses of purified ahpc together with nox-1 have verified that these proteins act as a cysteine-based peroxidase system in s. mutans, catalyzing the nadh-dependent reduction of organic hydroperoxides or h2o2 to their respective alcohols and/or h2o. these proteins also catalyze the four-electron reduction of o2 to h2o2, clarifying the role of nox-1 as a protective protein against oxygen toxicity. major differences between nox-1 and ahpf include: (i) the absolute specificity of nox-1 for nadh; (ii) lower amounts of flavin semiquinone and a more prominent fadh2 to nad+ charge transfer absorbance band stabilized by nox-1; and (iii) even higher redox potentials of disulfide centers relative to flavin for nox-1. although nox-1 and ahpc from s. mutans were shown to play a protective role against oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo in escherichia coli, the lack of a significant effect on deletion of these genes from s. mutans suggests the presence of additional antioxidant proteins in these bacteria.

TI == polyosides (encapsulated bacteria).
AB == the polysaccharide capsule which surrounds bacterial species such as haemophilus  influenzae, streptococcus pneumoniae, neisseria meningitidis and salmonella typhi is a potent virulence factor by protecting the bacteria from phagocytosis. the host responds with antibody production and specific antibodies plus complement binding to the capsule facilitate opsonization of the micro-organism, which is phagocytized and eliminated. purified capsular polysaccharides elicit t-independent antibody responses without a memory function, but are often poorly immunogenic in infants where much of the invasive h. influenzae type b (hib) and pneumococcal infections is seen. therefore purified polysaccharides have found limited use as vaccines. however, covalent linkage of the capsular polysaccharide, or fractions thereof, to immunogenic carrier proteins creates glycoconjugates which are t-dependent antigens and which elicit antibodies also in infants and which prime for boosting either with the glycoconjugate or the capsular polysaccharide. in the last decade hib glycoconjugate vaccines have been successfully introduced and in countries with very high immunization coverage the disease has been virtually eliminated and a decline of over 95% has been seen in countries with slightly lower vaccine rates. world-wide use of hib glycoconjugate vaccines offers the possibility of elimination of invasive hib disease. pneumococcal (11 serotypes with coverage of approximately 85% of invasive disease), meningococcal (a, c, w 135, y but not b) and s. typhi glycoconjugates are in advanced development and offer the prospect of being as successful as the hib glycoconjugates.

TI == incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5  years of age in slovakia.
AB == owing partly to a lack of disease burden data, eastern and central european countries have not introduced universal infant immunization against haemophilus influenzae type b. to determine the incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age, data were examined from eight districts in slovakia that formed part of a national haemophilus influenzae type b surveillance system. all invasive isolates of haemophilus influenzae type b identified from these districts during 24 months (1996-1997) were sent to a single central laboratory for serotype confirmation. thirty-five cases of confirmed haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis were identified, for a disease incidence among children under 5 years of 17.3 per 100,000 population per year. only 13 cases were identified during 1996, the first full year of the surveillance system. records were available for review at six of the eight district laboratories and showed that, using world health organization definitions, almost half of the cases of probable bacterial meningitis were culture negative, suggesting that the true incidence of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis may be considerably higher than 17.3. the rate of haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis among children less than 5 years of age in slovakia is comparable to that found in western europe and north america during the prevaccine era. thus, universal, publicly funded infant vaccination in slovakia can be expected to have the same dramatic effect on haemophilus influenzae type b disease morbidity and mortality as has been demonstrated in other countries that have adopted this approach.

TI == identification of a specific chaperone for sptp, a substrate of the centisome 63  type iii secretion system of salmonella typhimurium.
AB == salmonella typhimurium uses of a type iii protein secretion system encoded at centisome 63 of its chromosome to deliver effector molecule into the host cell. these proteins stimulate host cell responses such as reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and activation of transcription factors. one of these effector proteins is sptp, a tyrosine phosphatase that causes disruption of the host cell actin cytoskeleton. a characteristic feature of many substrates of type iii secretion systems is their association with specific cytoplasmic chaperones which appears to be required for secretion and/or translocation of these proteins into the host cell. we report here the identification of sicp, a 13-kda acidic polypeptide that is encoded immediately upstream of sptp. a loss-of-function mutation in sicp resulted in drastically reduced levels of sptp but did not affect sptp expression, indicating that sicp exerts its effect posttranscriptionally. pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that the loss of sicp leads to increased degradation of sptp. in addition, we show that sicp binds to sptp directly and that the binding site is located between residues 15 and 100 of the tyrosine phosphatase. taken together, these results indicate that sicp acts as a specific chaperone for sptp.

AB == the effects of mutations in host genes on tetracycline resistance mediated by the tet(o) and tet(m) ribosomal protection proteins, which originated in campylobacter spp. and streptococcus spp., respectively, were investigated by using mutants of salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli. the miaa, miab, and miaab double mutants of s. typhimurium specify enzymes for trna modification at the adenosine at position 37, adjacent to the anticodon in trna. in s. typhimurium, this involves biosynthesis of n6-(4-hydroxyisopentenyl)-2-methylthio-adenosine (ms2io6a). the miaa mutation reduced the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by both tet(o) and tet(m), but the latter showed a greater effect, which was ascribed to the isopentenyl (i6) group or to a combination of the methylthioadenosine (ms2) and i6 groups but not to the ms2 group alone (specified by miab). in addition, mutations in e. coli rpsl genes, generating both streptomycin-resistant and streptomycin-dependent strains, were also shown to reduce the level of tetracycline resistance mediated by tet(o) and tet(m). the single-site amino acid substitutions present in the rpsl mutations were pleiotropic in their effects on tetracycline mics. these mutants affect translational accuracy and kinetics and suggest that tet(o) and tet(m) binding to the ribosome may be reduced or slowed in the e. coli rpsl mutants in which the s12 protein is altered. data from both the miaa and rpsl mutant studies indicate a possible link between stability of the aminoacyl-trna in the ribosomal acceptor site and tetracycline resistance mediated by the ribosomal protection proteins.

AB == equine synovial fluid aliquots were inoculated with salmonella enteritidis, escherichia coli, actinobacillus equuli, staphylococcus aureus, and streptococcus zooepidemicus to obtain approximate concentrations of 1000, 100, 10, and 1 colony forming u/ml. synovial fluid aliquots were also inoculated with an unquantitated inoculum of bacteroides fragilis and clostridium perfringens. inoculated synovial fluid was incubated in trypticase-soy broth or columbia broth for approximately 12 hours. then aliquots were removed for dna extraction and polymerase chain reaction (pcr) analysis for detection of a 531 base-pair segment of bacterial dna corresponding to a region of the 16s ribosomal gene. duplicate samples of inoculated synovial fluid were prepared for microbial culture. bacteria were detected in all samples inoculated with bacteria but not in control synovial fluid samples. under experimental conditions there was no difference between microbial culture and pcr analyses for detection of bacteria. experimentally, pcr was able to detect bacteria in synovial fluid within 24 hours of inoculation.

TI == a human temporal bone study of acute bacterial meningogenic labyrinthitis.
AB == it is well established that sensorineural hearing loss (snhl) is an important sequela of acute bacterial meningitis. previous human temporal bone histopathologic studies have suggested that such hearing loss is due to labyrinthitis. this study involved a detailed and systematic evaluation of the auditory and vestibular end-organs in 41 human temporal bones from patients with acute bacterial meningitis, aimed at describing the spectrum of histopathologic changes within the labyrinth, ascertaining likely routes for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear, and comparing the data from humans with those described in a rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. our study revealed the following: (a) suppurative labyrinthitis occurred in 20 (49%) bones. of these 20 bones, the cochlea was affected in all, whereas the vestibular organs were involved in 10. eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids without the presence of inflammatory cells (so-called "serous" labyrinthitis) occurred in 14 of the remaining 21 bones. this staining occurred primarily within the vestibular system. its significance and pathogenesis remains unknown; (b) sensory and neural structures of the inner ear appeared intact in the majority of specimens, including bones with suppurative labyrinthitis and those with eosinophilic staining of inner ear fluids. this finding raises the possibility of preventing or reversing snhl by therapeutic intervention. spiral ganglion cells were severely degenerated in 12% of bones, indicating a retrocochlear site of hearing loss in addition to the cochlea. this subset of patients may perform poorly after cochlear implantation; (c) it has been traditionally assumed that irreversible and permanent snhl is caused by suppurative labyrinthitis, whereas reversible snhl is caused by serous labyrinthitis. our findings question the validity of these assumptions; (d) the data were consistent with the hypothesis that both the cochlear modiolus and cochlear aqueduct can serve as potential pathways for spread of infection from the meninges to the inner ear; (e) there were many similarities in the histopathology of the inner ear in humans when compared with the rabbit model of meningogenic labyrinthitis. a notable difference was that the cochlear aqueduct appeared to be the sole pathway for spread of infection in the rabbit, whereas in the human, both the modiolus and aqueduct were possible pathways.

TI == antimutagenicity of yogurt.
AB == yogurt is milk fermented by a mixture of two bacteria: lactobacillus delbrueckii  ssp. bulgaricus and streptococcus salivarius ssp. thermophilus. epidemiological studies have correlated a reduced risk of colon cancer with yogurt consumption. independent studies have established that yogurt and extracts thereof are antimutagenic. although multiple explanations can account for yogurt's putative anticarcinogenicity, we are interested in testing the hypothesis that antimutagenic compounds produced during fermentation are responsible. we recently reported on the antimutagenicity of an acetone extract of yogurt against the experimental carcinogens n-methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) and 3.2'dimethyl-4-aminobiphenyl (dmab) (mutation res. (1995) 334, 213-224). we are now aware that palmitic acid is an active ingredient against mnng.

TI == molecular, genetic, and topological characterization of o-antigen chain length regulation in shigella flexneri.
AB == the rfb region of shigella flexneri encodes the proteins required to synthesize the o-antigen component of its cell surface lipopolysaccharides (lps). we have previously reported that a region adjacent to rfb was involved in regulating the length distribution of the o-antigen polysaccharide chains (d. f. macpherson et al., mol. microbiol. 5:1491-1499, 1991). the gene responsible has been identified in escherichia coli o75 (called rol [r. a. batchelor et al., j. bacteriol. 173:5699-5704, 1991]) and in e. coli o111 and salmonella enterica serovar typhimurium strain lt2 (called cld [d. a. bastin et al., mol. microbiol. 5:2223-2231, 1991]). through a combination of subcloning, deletion, and transposon insertion analysis, we have identified a gene adjacent to the s. flexneri rfb region which encodes a protein of 36 kda responsible for the length distribution of o-antigen chains in lps as seen on silver-stained sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gels. dna sequence analysis identified an open reading frame (orf) corresponding to the rol gene. the corresponding protein was almost identical in sequence to the rol protein of e. coli o75 and was highly homologous to the functionally identical cld proteins of e. coli o111 and s. enterica serovar typhimurium lt2. these proteins, together with orf o349 adjacent to rfe, had almost identical hydropathy plots which predict membrane-spanning segments at the amino- and carboxy-terminal ends and a hydrophilic central region. we isolated a number of tnphoa insertions which inactivated the rol gene, and the fusion end points were determined. the phoa+ rol::phoa fusion proteins had phoa fused within the large hydrophilic central domain of rol. these proteins were located in the whole-membrane fraction, and extraction with triton x-100 indicated a cytoplasmic membrane location. this finding was supported by sucrose density gradient fractionation of the whole-cell membranes and of e. coli maxicells expressing l-[35s]methionine-labelled rol protein. hence, we interpret these data to indicate that the rol protein is anchored into the cytoplasmic membrane via its amino- and carboxy-terminal ends but that the majority of the protein is located in the periplasmic space. to confirm that rol is responsible for the effects on o-antigen chain length observed with the cloned rfb genes in e. coli k-12, it was mutated in s. flexneri by insertion of a kanamycin resistance cartridge. the resulting strains produced lps with o antigens of nonmodal chain length, thereby confirming the function of the rol gene product. we propose a model for the function of rol protein in which it acts as a type of molecular chaperone to facilitate the interaction of the o-antigen ligase (rfal) with the o-antigen polymerase (rfc) and polymerized, acyl carrier lipid-linked, o-antigen chains. analysis of the dna sequence of the region identified a number of orfs corresponding to the well-known gnd and hisie genes. the rol gene was located immediately downstream of two orfs with sequence similarity to the gene encoding udpglucose dehydrogenase (hasb) of streptococcus pyogenes. the orfs arise because of a deletion or frameshift mutation within the gene we have termed udg (for udpglucose dehydrogenase).

AB == a new protein of salmonella typhimurium was identified and characterized. the gene (tlpa) encoding this protein (tlpa) was isolated from the large virulence-associated plasmid of s. typhimurium and sequenced in order to predict the primary structure of tlpa. tlpa encodes a 371-amino acid soluble protein with a calculated m(r) of 41600 and pi of 4.63. secondary structure predictions and sequence statistics of tlpa indicated a predominant alpha-helical configuration and presence of heptapeptide repeat motifs characteristic of coiled coil proteins. purified tlpa was shown to have biochemical properties similar to those of coiled coil proteins, including adoption of an alpha-helical configuration and a tendency to form homodimers. furthermore, tlpa possessed heat resistance, evidence for a chain register and altered mobility in urea/sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis gels which are characteristics of tropomyosins. tlpa shows 32% overall sequence similarity with rat cardiac myosin and 36% similarity with horse platelet beta-tropomyosin over 226 residues, whereas selected regions possessed significant sequence identities with myosins, tropomyosins, and alpha-helical surface proteins of streptococcus pyogenes. our results indicate that tlpa represents a new member of prokaryotic coiled coil proteins.

TI == flavin-linked peroxide reductases: protein-sulfenic acids and the oxidative stress response.
AB == sequence analyses of the streptococcus faecalis nadh peroxidase and the flavoprotein component of the salmonella typhimurium alkyl hydroperoxide reductase indicate clear evolutionary links with members of the flavoprotein disulfide reductase family. however, chemical and spectroscopic evidence demonstrate that the non-flavin redox center in nadh peroxidase is an unusual stabilized cysteine-sulfenic acid (cys-soh) derivative, and not a cystine disulfide as found in the disulfide reductases. this redox-active element, when appropriately stabilized by the respective protein environment, appears to play key roles in both the catalytic and regulatory aspects of the bacterial response to oxidative stress.

TI == altering the conserved nucleotide binding motif in the salmonella typhimurium muts mismatch repair protein affects both its atpase and mismatch binding activities.
AB == the salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli muts protein is one of several methyl-directed mismatch repair proteins that act together to correct replication errors. muts is homologous to the streptococcus pneumoniae hexa mismatch repair protein and to the duc1 and rep1 proteins of human and mouse. homology between the deduced amino acid sequence of both muts and hexa, and the type a nucleotide binding site consensus sequence, suggested that atp binding and hydrolysis play a role in their mismatch repair functions. we found that muts does indeed weakly hydrolyze atp to adp and pi, with a km of 6 microm and kcat of 0.26. to show that this activity is intrinsic to muts, we made a site-directed mutation, which resulted in the invariant lysine of the nucleotide binding consensus sequence being changed to an alanine. the mutant muts allele was unable to complement a muts::tn10 mutation in vivo, and was dominant over wild type when present in high copy number. the purified mutant protein had reduced atpase activity, with the km affected more severely than the kcat. like the wild type muts protein, the mutant protein is able to bind heteroduplex dna specifically, but the mutant protein does so with a reduced affinity.

TI == nucleotide sequence of the streptococcus pneumoniae hexb mismatch repair gene: homology of hexb to mutl of salmonella typhimurium and to pms1 of saccharomyces cerevisiae.
AB == the hex mismatch repair system of streptococcus pneumoniae acts both during transformation (a recombination process that directly produces heteroduplex dna) to correct donor strands and after dna replication to remove misincorporated nucleotides. the hexb gene product is one of at least two proteins required for mismatch repair in this organism. the nucleotide sequence of a 2.7-kilobase segment from the s. pneumoniae chromosome that includes the 1.95-kilobase hexb gene was determined. the gene encodes a 73.5-kilodalton protein (649 residues). the spontaneous hex rx chromosomal mutant allele with which a mutator phenotype has been associated is shown to result from a single base substitution (tac to taa) leading to a truncated hexb polypeptide (484 residues). the hexb protein is homologous to the mutl protein, which is required for methyl-directed mismatch repair in salmonella typhimurium and escherichia coli, and to the pms1 gene product, which is likely to be involved in a mismatch correction system in saccharomyces cerevisiae. the conservation of hexb-like proteins among procaryotic and eucaryotic organisms indicates that these proteins play an important common role in the repair process. this finding also suggests that the hex, mut, and pms systems evolved from a common ancestor and that functionally similar mismatch repair systems could be widespread among procaryotic as well as eucaryotic organisms.

AB == the effect of a diet supplemented with yogurt containing live lactobacilli (lab)  - lactobacillus bulgaricus and streptococcus thermophilus - on the response of inbred mice to infection with salmonella typhimurium was elaborated. the results of our experiments were consistent with the hypothesis that modifications of the microflora influence the adherence of s. typhimurium to intestinal mucosa, the natural antibacterial activity of the peyer's patches lymphocytes, the accumulation of the macrophages in the liver, the proliferative responses of the splenocytes. the relationship between modifications of the immune response following ingestion of yogurt with live lab and increased defense mechanisms was confirmed by the bacterial counts in livers and spleens and by the reduced mortality to s. typhimurium infection.

AB == mycotic aneurysms of the extracranial internal carotid artery are rare; they usually appear as an enlarging pulsatile neck mass with associated pain, tenderness, and fever. this case report illustrates the need for prompt diagnosis and urgent surgical intervention. the most common organisms found with these aneurysms have been staphylococcus aureus and streptococcus pyogenes. we report a case of a mycotic internal carotid artery aneurysm resulting from salmonella enteritidis. a 20-year review of both the foreign and english language literature revealed only one other case of a mycotic carotid aneurysm resulting from salmonella infection. the cornerstone of therapy in the past had been proximal ligation. more recently, primary reconstructive procedures with either an end-to-end anastomosis or an interposition vein graft have been described. the present case was managed with an end-to-end technique with the use of a pruitt-inahara shunt.

AB == two muramyl dipeptides, n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine and its adjuvant-inactive isomer n-acetylmuramyl-d-alanyl-d-isoglutamine, were examined for their ability to protect mice carrying the cba/n immune deficiency gene (xid) against lethal bacterial challenge. prophylactic treatment with n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine gave significant protection against streptococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, and salmonella enteritidis infection. n-acetylmuramyl-d-alanyl-d-isoglutamine was unable to confer protection. incorporation of the lipophilic glycerol dipalmitate derivatives of the two muramyl dipeptides within liposomal carriers resulted in a significant enhancement of anti-infectious activity, both with respect to number of survivors and length of survival. liposomal muramyl dipeptides were 10- to 15-fold more potent than free muramyl dipeptide; enhanced potency was most evident with n-acetylmuramyl-d-alanyl-d-isoglutamine. prophylactic treatment with liposomes containing the lipophilic muramyl dipeptides resulted in enhanced clearance of bacteria from the blood (greater than 3-fold increase in rate) when compared with that of hydrosoluble n-acetylmuramyl-l-alanyl-d-isoglutamine, indicating a correlation between reticuloendothelial stimulation and anti-infectious activity.

TI == differentiation and interaction of secretory immunoglobulin a and a calcium-dependent parotid agglutinin for several bacterial strains.
AB == previous studies have suggested that both secretory immunoglobulin a (siga) and various nonimmunoglobulin salivary glycoproteins are capable of agglutinating a variety of bacteria. the present study was designed to compare the nature of the agglutinins for streptococcus mutans and salmonella typhimurium in parotid saliva and colostrum. s. mutans was aggregated by saliva and colostrum, whereas s. typhimurium was aggregated only by saliva as detected by a spectrophotometric method. the principal salivary agglutinin for both s. mutans and s. typhimurium was calcium dependent and could be desorbed in phosphate-buffered saline (ph 6.8). in contrast, the colostral agglutinin was calcium independent and not readily desorbed. the agglutinin activities of saliva and colostrum for s. mutans were additive, suggesting independent target sites on the bacterial surface. the agglutinin activity of colostrum was totally associated with siga as was suggested by blocking of the agglutinating activity with anti-alpha-chain serum and the absence of blocking with an antibody specific for salivary agglutinin. interestingly, anti-alpha-chain serum removed all agglutinating activity from saliva, but not from the phosphate-buffered saline-desorbed agglutinin. dialysis of parotid saliva against 0.1 m disodium edta eliminated the agglutinin blocking activity of anti-alpha-chain serum but not that of the antiagglutinin antibody. the ability of anti-alpha-chain serum to block agglutination of the edta-dialyzed saliva could be restored by the addition of calcium chloride, suggesting that siga and salivary agglutinin are associated through a calcium-mediated interaction. these results indicate that bacterial agglutinating activity of colostrum, as detected spectrophotometrically, is mediated by siga, and that of saliva is mainly dependent upon a calcium-dependent nonimmunoglobulin agglutinin. the agglutinating activities of siga and parotid agglutinin seem to be additive, and their calcium-dependent association may favor the enhancement of their respective activities.

AB == the antagonistic effect exerted towards salmonella typhimurium by the flora issued from conventional chickens was studied in gnotobiotic animals. in germfree chickens and mice inoculated with s. typhimurium, the highest bacterial counts were observed in ceca, and were not significantly different in either host. the protection afforded by the inoculation of cecal flora issued from a conventional chicken was more effective when this flora was inoculated first into germfree chickens than when it was given only after inoculation with s. typhimurium. administration of a cecal flora from a 15-day-old chick to gnotobiotic mice and chicken resulted in the inhibition of a further intestinal colonization by s. typhimurium in both hosts. sixteen strains were isolated among the predominant populations of the fecal flora from chicken flora recipient mice. association of 14 strains of strictly anaerobic bacteria with 2 strains of escherichia coli and streptococcus faecium only decreased the number of s. typhimurium in the ileum of gnotobiotic mice, but not in their cecum. anaerobe cultures were obtained from 10(-6) and 10(-8) dilutions prepared from the fecal flora of gnotobiotic recipient mice. antagonistic bacteria were present only in cultures from the 10(-6) dilution. cecal concentrations of volatile fatty acids were shown not to be the sole factor implicated in the antagonistic effect against s. typhimurium.

AB == we developed a clear-cut nutritional iron deficiency anemia without concomittant  malnutrition in rats given a low iron diet, and we restored normal iron and hemoglobin levels in these same animals with iron dextran injections. the neutrophil function studies performed during and after a period of iron deficiency showed the following: phagocytosis of staphylococcus aureus 502a, streptococcus pneumoniae, and salmonella typhimurium was not altered by iron deficiency or by the administration of iron; phagocytosis of candida albicans was moderately abnormal during iron deficiency, and became normal with the restoration of iron sufficiency. microbicidal activity towards staphylococcus aureus 502a and candida albicans, two catalase-positive microorganisms, was markedly decreased (to 50% of control values) and returned to normal when iron sufficiency was restored. killing of a catalase-negative organism, streptococcus pneumoniae was normal in iron-deficient rats. this pattern of differential bactericidal activities suggested an abnormality of the oxidant radical-generating machinery in neutrophils of iron-deficient animals. indeed, iron deficiency caused a marked decrease of neutrophil nitroblue tetrazolium dye reduction, which disappeared after iron administration. neutrophil myeloperoxidase activity was slightly decreased in iron deficient rats and returned to normal after iron administration. microbicidal activity towards a gram-negative, catalase-positive organism, salmonella typhimurium, was equal in iron deficient and iron sufficient animals. our combined results suggest that a definite microbicidal defect is the consequence of nutritional iron deficiency, apart from any protein-calorie malnutrition. this defect affects the disposal in pmns of two catalase-positive microorganisms (which require intracellular production of oxidant radicals for their destruction) but not of a catalase-negative bacterial species.(abstract truncated at 250 words)

TI == infections in sickle cell anemia: pathogenesis and control.
AB == splenic dysfunction accounts for the greatest deficit in immune function in children with homozygous scd. this dysfunction, coupled with the natural immunologic immaturity of all young children subjects the young child with scd to an immense risk of severe pyogenic infections. to data, experience would suggest that pneumococcal vaccines may provide only modest protection in the child with scd less than 5 years of age. antipneumococcal antibody responses are poor in children less than two years of age. all reported failures of pneumococcal vaccine among children with scd have occurred in children less than three years of age and offending pneumococci have been of groups 6 and 23. prophylactic antibiotic regimens have yet to be submitted to rigid scientific investigation and their utility in eliminating the risk of pneumococcal sepsis in asplenic hosts is unknown.

AB == in normal rabbits and mice, one i.v. injection of scarlet fever toxin (et) (30 000 std per kg of rabbit weight or 20-g mouse) elicited a similar biphasic change in carbon clearance rate - early depression followed by a stimulating phase - as has been described for gram-negative endotoxins. prolonged depression without a subsequent stimulation phase was obtained in mice by raising the et dose. the reasons of the discrepancy between these findings and those of hanna and watson (1965b) are discussed. pyrogenic tolerance to et is not accompanied by accelerated carbon clearance and is not impaired by res blockade. a possible mechanism of et tolerance is suggested.

AB == the opsonic requirements for phagocytosis of s. pneumoniae types 6, 7, 18, and 23 were determined in normal and c2 deficient serum, and in normal serum chelated with magnesium ethyleneglycoltetraacetic acid. all four strains were effectively opsonized via the alternative complement pathway, a finding suggesting that the capsular polysaccharides of these strains activated complement via the alternative pathway. since bacteremic pneumococcal disease is often associated with circulating capsular polysaccharide, it was considered that this cellular component may activate complement in vivo and impair host defenses by producing an opsonic defect for pneumococci. to examine this hypothesis, serum was incubated with suspensions of whole s. pneumoniae types 6, 7, 18, or 23 or with purified capsular polysaccharide from each of these types, and residual complement activity and opsonic capacity were measured. hemolytic c 3--9 complement activity and opsonic capacity for 3h-thymidine labeled salmonella typhimurium, a species effectively opsonized via the alternative pathway, were reduced in serum following incubation. polysaccharide concentrations as low as 1 microgram/ml inhibited serum opsonic capacity for salmonella. whole pneumococci and pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide also inhibited the opsonic activity of human c2 deficient serum for salmonella, further evidence for activation of complement via the alternative pathway. pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide markedly inhibited the opsonic capacity of normal serum for the homologous pneumoccal type. thus, amounts of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide, similar to those found in the serum of patients with pneumococcal disease, bring about decomplementation of serum via activation of the alternative pathway and inhibit pneumococcal opsonization.

TI == on the mode of action of 5-diazouracil on bacterial cell division.
AB == cell division by strains of escherichia coli and salmonella typhimurium is inhibited by 5-diazouracil (5-du). division recovers in the presence of the inhibitor after a period which is temperature-dependent. recovery is probably due to breakdown of 5-du and the rate of this breakdown is apparently increased at alkaline ph. growth with 5-du caused only a slight reduction in the rate of murein synthesis and no alteration in the properties or composition of membranes of s. typhimurium. the agent caused chaining in streptococcus fecalis and inhibition of the penicillin-induced lysis of s. typhimurium. these effects may have been due to direct inhibition of lysin activity but an indirect effect seems more likely. the most marked effect of 5-du on s. typhimurium was to cause a transient inhibition of dna synthesis. since 5-du did not stop uncoupled cell division (i.e. division occurring independently of dna replication) and since lon- strains were more sensitive to 5-du than lon+ strains, it was concluded that 5-du acts on cell division via an inhibitory effect on dna replication.

(ii) the gram-negative strains salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, and klebsiella pneumoniae all contain m6a but not m23a in 23s rrna. these observations suggest the existence of at least one systematic structural difference between the ribosomes of the two classes of bacteria. because of the demonstrated relationship between n6-dimethylation of adenine in 23s rrna and clinical resistance to macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in staphylococci and streptococci, the observed systematic differences found in rrna methylation combined with greater cellular permeability may be related to the relatively greater efficacy of macrolide, lincosamide, and streptogramin b-type antibiotics in treating infections caused by gram-positive organisms.

TI == use of limulus assay to compare the biological activity of peptidoglycan and endotoxin.
AB == the gelation of a lysate prepared from the amebocytes of limulus polyphemus, the  horseshoe crab, has been used to detect endotoxin-like material in clinical studies and in "in vitro" experiments. the investigation of blood samples from 54 hospitalized patients suspected of having endotoxemia, revealed a positive limulus test in 14. infections due to gram-positive organisms were not associated with positive assays. these results were in agreement with the observation that living gram-positive microorganisms - in contrast to gram-negative bacteria - did not initiate lysate gelation when studied "in vitro". only very high concentrations of peptidoglycan, isolated from the cell walls of various gram-positive bacteria, induced the reaction. therefore, these findings support the view, that the limulus test is relatively specific for the detection of gram-negative bacterial endotoxin and endotoxemia.

AB == for the purpose of ascertaining the peculiarities of cellular differentiation of  lymphoid cells of the palatine tonsils experiments were conducted on rabbits immunized intravenously and subcutaneously with streptococcus and paratyphoid b antigens; a study was made (in the blast-transformation reaction) of a comparative response of the lymphocytes of the palatine tonsils, the thymus, the spleen, the appendix and the regional lymph node. in case of stimulation with the specific microbial antigens and pha the proliferative response was greater in the culture of the splenic lymphocytes and the regional lymph node than in the culture of the lymphocytes of the palatine tonsils and the appendix. the thymus lymphocytes responded to pha only. a conclusion was drawn that the paratyphoid b and streptococcus antigens penetrating into the lymphoid tissue by hematogenic route stimulated a relatively low percentage of lymphocytes of the palatine tonsils and the appendix in comparison with the regional lymph node and the spleen.

TI == accelerated host metabolism of l-thyroxine during acute infection: role of the leukocyte and peripheral leukocytosis.
AB == metabolism of thyroid hormones is accelerated during acute infection in man and in experimental animals. the pathogenetic mechanisms mediating this phenomenon are uncertain, but activated leukocytes of the infected host have been implicated as potentially important sites of hormone degradation. the present studies were conducted in an attempt to assess the in vivo contribution of leukocytes and peripheral leukocytosis to the enhancement of l-thyroxine (t4) clearance seen during infection, and to evaluate further the possible roles of fever and of changes in the extracellular binding of t4. in 10 rhesus monkeys inoculated with virulent yellow fever (yf) virus, peripheral disposal of t4 was significantly accelerated (2-fold) during the febrile phase of the illness. this experimental viral infection was not accompanied by neutrophilic leukocytosis nor by detectable changes in serum free t4 levels, suggesting that neither an increased circulating neutrophil mass nor diminished extracellular binding of t4 contributed appreciably to the increase in metabolism of t4. a pathogenetic role for fever in the enhancement of t4 degradation was not specifically excluded in these infected monkeys. however, the failure of t4 turnover to increase during other febrile infections, such as that which followed inoculation of monkeys with venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, indicates that the acceleration of peripheral disposal of t4 seen in infection is not a simple concomitant of fever. in monkeys with bacterial sepsis and in those inoculated iv with zymosan particles, t4 turnover was similarly accelerated in the absence of detectable changes in serum free t4 levels, suggesting a pathogenetic role for enhances cellular uptake and metabolism of hormone. however, in these monkeys deiodination of t4 by leukocytes did not appear to account for the increase in t4 disposal. during sepsis and following zymosan administration, t4 turnover was markedly increased in both intact monkeys with a neutrophilic leukocytosis and in those with irradiation-induced neutropenia. therefore, the cellular sites of increased t4 degradation during infection remain uncertain. fixed tissue macrophages serve as the major site of clearance of yf virus, circulating bacteria and zymosan particles. accordingly, a relationship between activation of these phagocytic cells and the acceleration of t4 metabolism seemed possible but was not established by our studies.

TI == deregulation of mouse antibody-forming cells in vivo in cell culture by streptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin.
AB == an unregulated, elevated rebound of antibody levels in rabbits was shown to follow late (10 to 15 days) after steptococcal pyrogenic exotoxin (spe)-induced immunosuppression. because of that result we have suggested that spe acts by preferentially inhibiting a regulatory cell which normally limits the extent of full expression of antibody formation by b-cells. we are currently testing this hypothesis in mice. nih (swiss webster) mice (+/+) or nih (swiss webster) mice heterozygous (+/nu) for the mutant athymic nude gene and phenotypically normal showed an elevated plaque-forming cell (pfc) response to sheep erythrocytes (se) late (10 to 15 days) after immunosuppressive spe treatment similar to that described in rabbits. homozygous nude mice (nu/nu) that are phenotypically athymic normally show a reduced early (4 day) pfc response to se (a t-cell-dependent antigen) as compared with +/nu littermates or +/+ parent strain mice. this cryptic early 4-day response was improved by injection of purified endotoxin (a b-cell mitogen), but these relatively elevated nude pfc responses had decreased to normal control (se only)nude pfc levels before 10 days. in similar se-injected nude mice treated instead with spe, no elevation at 4 days was observed and, more pertinently, the late (10 to 15 day) elevated rebound of pfc levels observed in normal response controls (+/nu or +/+) was not observed. similar experiments were subsequently conducted in marbrook-type spleen pfc cultures during periods of 12 days. the results of these experiments paralleled the in vivo results above, and in addition showed that spe induced a large proliferation of either +/+ or +/nu cells (t-and b-cells) in culture but had no such effect on nu/nu cells (b-cells) in culture. purified endotoxin, the bcell mitogen, had a better sparing effect on nu/nu cells in this respect. these results are consistent with our premise that spe inhibits preferentially the function of a regulator of the antibody response. the regulator appears to be a t-cell and is likely a suppressor t-cell.

AB == the mechanism of bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12), the spectrum of microorganisms capable of such uptake, and the factors involved were the subject of this study. bacterial uptake of vitamin b(12) was found to be at least a two stage process. a primary uptake phase which was rapid (1 min or less), ph dependent, nontemperature dependent, did not require viable organisms and was insensitive to either the metabolic inhibitor dinitrophenol or to the sulfhydryl inhibitor n-ethyl-maleimide. protein denaturation (formalin treatment or autoclaving) abolished all b(12) uptake. this primary uptake phase is thought to represent adsorption to binding or "receptor" sites on the cell wall. second stage uptake was slower, ph and temperature dependent, required living bacteria, and was abolished by either dinitrophenol or n-ethyl-maleimide. this phase is dependent upon metabolic processes and may reflect transfer of b(12) from surface "receptor" sites into the bacterial cell. although differences among organisms were observed in total 1 hr uptake, number of surface "receptor" sites, and relative avidities for b(12), all organisms except streptococcus fecalis shared the two stage mechanism. two gram-positive organisms. bacillus subtilis and group a streptococcus, demonstrated the highest 1 hr vitamin b(12) uptake values; gram-negative bacteria required 2,000-10,000 the number of organisms for comparable uptake. binding constants (k(m)) varied from 5.05 +/-1.67 x 10(-10)m for b. subtilis to 6.18 +/-3.08 x 10(-9)m for klebsiella pneumoniae which approximate the km for human intrinsic factor (0.38 x 10(-10)m). competition between bacteria and intrinsic factor for vitamin b(12) may be inferred from the similarity of these constants. these observations suggest that a variety of enteric and nonenteric organisms, not requiring exogenous b(12), may play a role in the pathogenesis of the vitamin b(12) malabsorption found in the intestinal bacterial overgrowth syndromes.

AB == strongly basic anion-exchange resins form stable, water-insoluble combinations with triiodide ions. the combinations have remarkable antibacterial properties: 3.0 x 10(5)escherichia coli cells per ml were killed when passed through a 3.8-g column of commercially available resin treated with triiodide (volume 4 ml after treatment). in an attempt to deplete the resin-triiodide complex, 1.14 x 10(9)e. coli cells in 15 liters were passed through the column with no significant loss of effectiveness. the antibacterial capabilities of the resin-triiodide columns ranged from 10(6)salmonella typhimurium per ml to 1.1 x 10(4)streptococcus faecalis per ml. staphylococcus aureus and pseudomonas aeruginosa were also tested and killed at concentrations of 1.8 x 10(4) and 1.3 x 10(5) per ml, respectively. the cells were not filtered from the water. they emerged from the column in nonviable form. this was demonstrated by using (14)c-labeled bacteria. the irreversible nature of the antibacterial action was revealed when attempts to wash the damaged cells did not restore viability.

AB == sera of rabbits immunized against salmonella typhi have been studied for the idiotypy of certain of their components, i.e., the property of these components to possess an antigenic specificity which is different in individual rabbits, and which varies with the antigens against which these rabbits have been immunized. the reagent used (precipitating anti-idiotypic sera) have been prepared by injecting rabbits with bacteria agglutinated by anti-s. typhi sera (immunizing sera) as was done in the first observations by the authors of the phenomenon in the rabbit. these first observations have been confirmed and extended. in contrast to allotypy, the anti-idiotypic sera precipitate the corresponding immunizing sera, but not the sera taken in the immunizing rabbits prior to their immunization against s. typhi, nor the immunizing sera absorbed with the somatic antigen of s. typhi, demonstrating that idiotypes are antibodies. the idiotypic specificities of the antibodies of one rabbit against s. typhi are not detected in the antibodies of the same rabbit against another noncross-reacting salmonella (s. tranoroa) and vice versa; nor are they detected in the anti-pneumococcal antibodies of the same rabbit. each anti-idiotypic serum fails to precipitate anti-s. typhi sera of rabbits other than the immunizing one except for certain extremely faint reactions, the significance of which has not been established. the idiotypic specificities of anti-s. typhi antibodies of three rabbits were not found in anti-s. typhi antibodies of their parents. this lack of a sign of hereditary transmission of idiotypic specificities contrasts with allotypy. the apparent role of random chance in the determinism of the idiotypic patterns or of the idiotypic determinants has been discussed. unless it were admitted that antibodies with similar functions do not exist in different individuals, idiotypy apparently adds an order of magnitude to the antibody variability which had been previously envisaged. in one given individual, the heterogeneity of the idiotypic specificities seems to be less extended than that of the antibody functions. the possible relationships between these two levels of molecular variability and between the corresponding levels of cellular variability have been discussed.

TI == in vivo and in vitro action of norethindrone on staphylococci.
AB == norethindrone has been examined in vitro for antibacterial activity against 10 microorganisms. turbidimetric techniques were used to assay the antibacterial activity of norethindrone. the organisms tested included staphylococcus aureus, s. epidermidis, micrococcus conglomeratus, listeria monocytogenes, streptococcus faecalis, salmonella typhosa, shigella flexnerii, klebsiella pneumoniae, escherichia coli, and proteus vulgaris. bacteriostatic action was shown only against the gram-positive microorganisms when they were grown anaerobically in tryptic soy broth containing 10 to 50 mug of norethindrone per ml. the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone was exerted primarily during the first 8 hr of incubation and it was reduced by the presence of oxygen. mestranol at a concentration of 1 to 10 mug/ml failed to exert any significant action on s. aureus. however, incorporation of 5 mug of mestranol per ml in the culture medium enhanced the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone on staphylococci. enhancement of the bacteriostatic action of norethindrone could not be obtained by the addition of a concentration of 5 mug/ml of testosterone, 17alpha-estradiol, and 17beta-estradiol. progesterone and 4-pregnen-20beta-ol-3-one under similar conditions showed an additive bacteriostatic effect when they were incorporated into the culture medium containing norethindrone. in vivo studies indicated that female, adult new zealand rabbits, injected subcutaneously with two injections of 10 to 20 mug of norethindrone, 24 hr apart, and challenged intradermally with s. aureus 4 hr after the second injection, had fewer lesions with smaller areas of swelling and erythema as compared to control, nontreated rabbits. the protective effect of norethindrone on the development of staphylococcal lesion seemed related to hormone concentration. thus, it was demonstrated with doses of 20, 15, and 10 mug, but not with doses of 1 and 5 mug. when the lesions were excised 48 to 92 hr after infection and when viable cell counts were made, rabbits treated with norethindrone showed significantly lower staphylococcal counts than the control rabbits. during the 1st day after infection with s. aureus, leukocytic counts of the norethindrone-treated rabbits remained normal, whereas control animals showed elevated leukocytic counts.

AB == studies of experimental infections in embryonated eggs demonstrated that prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci afforded significant protection against subsequent challenge with virulent strains. all strains of coagulase-positive and coagulase-negative staphylococci tested that were relatively avirulent for embryonated eggs were capable of producing interference. the interference induced afforded protection not only against challenge with virulent staphylococci, but also against diplococcus pneumoniae, salmonella typhimurium, escherichia coli, proteus mirabilis, and one strain of influenza virus (a(2)j 305). prior allantoic infection with avirulent staphylococci also protected against intravenous as well as allantoic infection with challenge strains.interference required infection with viable bacteria. the onset of interference appeared within a few minutes after injection of the interfering strain, but was not maximal until 24 hours had elapsed between injection of the interfering and challenge strains. the protection afforded by the production of interference could not be overcome by increased inoculum size of the challenge strain and extended even to challenge with 10(9) bacteria. studies of in vitro and in vivo growth of challenge strains in allantoic fluid demonstrated that some interfering strains inhibited growth of the challenge strains. other strains produced interference without producing prolonged inhibition of the growth of challenge strains. similarly, interference could not be attributed to attenuated virulence of the challenge organisms. all interfering strains studied produced enhanced bactericidal activity of whole blood from the affected embryos, but whether this affected leukocyte activity, opsonization, or other host defense mechanisms has yet to be determined.

AB == evidence is presented suggesting that the apparent non-specificity of pyrogenic tolerance observed with gram-negative bacterial endotoxins is due to related antigenic determinants associated with the macromolecular toxins. this is based on results obtained in rabbits from pyrogenic cross-tolerance tests with selected endotoxins. in these tests, purified endotoxins from escherichia coli (coo8) and chromobacterium violaceum (cv) gave results one might expect with non-reciprocal cross-reacting antigens in classical immune systems. additional evidence for an immune mechanism in tolerance is suggested by the highly significant anamnestic response observed. lipid a, a toxic derivative of the purified coo8 endotoxin, failed to induce pyrogenic tolerance against the parent toxin. these results are explained by assuming that endotoxins have two interdependent activities associated with different portions of the macromolecule; one is assumed to be responsible for the primary toxicity, and the other is involved in secondary toxicity. the latter is dependent on the hypersensitive state of the host. additional evidence for the role of hypersensitivity in secondary toxicity is based on the observation that adult rabbits are highly sensitive to the pyrogenic, lethal, and skin-reacting activities of endotoxin in contrast to young animals which are more resistant to all of these attributes of toxicity. in adults, the host responses to pyrogenicity, lethality, and skin reactivity could be partially inhibited by the early exposure of the animals to massive doses of endotoxin equivalent to a ld(50). the pyrogenic tolerance shown in these animals was specific indicating that the inhibition of the hypersusceptibility to endotoxin involved an immunological mechanism. a mechanism of endotoxin tolerance is proposed and discussed based on the induction of specific antibodies capable of assisting the res in the clearance and destruction of endotoxin. it is suggested that the present inconsistencies relative to the chemical nature and biological activities of endotoxins might be explained on the basis of these two activities and the failure to recognize the importance of the immunological state of the host in which the toxins are tested.
